The Pentagon wants to shoot the craft down from a ship
The US said last week that it would use a missile to destroy the satellite , to stop it from crash landing .
Officials say the satellite contains hazardous fuel which could kill humans .
But Russia 's defence ministry said the US planned to test its " anti- missile defence system 's capability to destroy other countries ' satellites " .
The US says the satellite lost power and communications shortly after it was launched in December 2006 and is now uncontrollable .
The decision to destroy the American satellite does not look harmless as they try to claim
Russian defence ministry statement
The Pentagon said on Saturday that the window for the operation would begin on Wednesday , when the space shuttle Atlantis ended its current mission .
But Russia 's defence ministry said the US had not given enough information on the reasons for the decision .
" Speculations about the danger of the satellite hide preparations for the classical testing of an anti-satellite weapon , " a statement reported by Itar - Tass news agency said .
BROKEN SATELLITE
Owner : National Reconnaissance Office satellite Mission : Classified Launched : Dec 2006 Weight : 5,000 lb ( 2,270 kg ) 2,500 lb could survive re-entry Carrying hydrazine rocket fuel
" Such testing essentially means the creation of a new type of strategic weapons , " it added .
" The decision to destroy the American satellite does not look harmless as they try to claim , especially at a time when the US has been evading negotiations on the limitation of an arms race in outer space , " the statement continued .
The Russian defence ministry argued that various countries ' spacecraft had crashed to Earth in the past , and many countries used toxic fuel in spacecraft , but this had never before merited such " extraordinary measures " .
Toxic gas
The broken satellite had been predicted to reach the top of the Earth 's atmosphere towards the end of February or early March and officials could not predict where it would land .
A US general said on Thursday that exposure to the hydrazine would have similar effects to inhaling chlorine or ammonia - a burning sensation in lungs and , if too close and too much , then possibly death .
He said that blowing the satellite up would disperse the hydrazine in space , leaving only small - scale satellite debris to fall harmlessly to Earth .
The Pentagon says it plans to shoot down the satellite using a modified missile from a US Navy ship in the Pacific .
Last year , China carried out a test using a ground - based ballistic missile to destroy a satellite in space , prompting international alarm and fears of a space arms race .
On Thursday , US General James Cartwright said there was no parallel with Beijing 's actions as the Chinese satellite had been much further out from Earth , meaning its debris could be floating around for decades , endangering spacecraft .
He also denied claims that the main aim was to destroy secret parts .
Gen Cartwright said confidential components would be burned up in the atmosphere and , in any case , that would not be a reason for shooting down the satellite .

Dr Moore has now helped found several companies
Writing in a " throw - away " journal , Gordon Moore accurately imagined a future filled with mobile phones , home computers , and even intelligent cars .
But it was a much more prosaic prediction that has come to dominate his life and the industry that he helped found .
" I could see a change coming that the electronics were going to get significantly cheaper , " says the co-founder of Intel , the largest maker of computer chips .
In the article in Electronics Magazine , he predicted that the number of transistors on a silicon chip would double every year for ten years .
He later revised the forecast to doubling every two years or so , as the initial breakneck speed of development and shrinkage waned .
It was a prediction that became known as Moore 's Law and it has helped drive the computer revolution over the last four decades .
Modest growth
At first glance it is not the kind of observation that would catapult a person to fame .
But the day I meet him , a now silver haired Dr Moore has just given a talk to a packed auditorium of people and he is surrounded by crowds of autograph hunters who were not even born when he made his off the cuff observations .
Moore 's Law has become shorthand for the pace of technological change .
It set a standard for the chip industry 's phenomenal growth and has in turn underpinned the world 's digital awakening .
TRANSISTORS
Transistors are basic electronic switches found in silicon chips Each transistor can be switched on or off , representing a " 1 " or " 0 " , known as binary code
All computation is done using different combinations of these two outputs to do calculations
The number of transistors on a chip determine its speed Modern chips contain millions of transistors allowing them to execute millions of calculations per second
The tiny devices consist of a source , drain and gate A voltage applied to the gate and drain turns the device on Removing the gate voltage switches it off again
" It was an exciting technology in the beginning .
It had so much potential , we just had no idea how much potential , " he says .
" When Intel was formed [ in 1968 ] the total semiconductor industry was only a couple of billion dollars worldwide - today it is 300 billion . "
And as the industry has delivered each successive generation of faster , smaller , cheaper chips , it has opened up rafts of new possibilities for silicon that have ultimately delivered the technologies he predicted more than 40 years ago .
Reflecting on his prophesies today , a retired and quietly - spoken Dr Moore is characteristically modest .
" When I went back and read that I was amazed that I predicted all of those things , " he says .
But , as a young engineer , he was at least uniquely placed to make his key observation , having co-founded Fairchild Semiconductors , maker of the first commercial integrated circuit , or chip .
" I was directing a lab where we were trying to advance the technology and from my perspective I could see some of these things coming that were n't generally visible to the rest of the population , " he says .
Force for change
At the time , computers were mainly used by the military and PCs were unheard of , he says .
" Computers were in glass rooms tended to by a core of monks that knew how to do the proper incantations . "
But as the silicon chip industry took hold and computer makers learnt how to exploit the technology everything changed .
" Shortly after that the commercial market just completely dwarfed anything in the military , " he says .
And what had originally been just a prediction by Dr Moore became a self - fulfilling prophesy .
" It has become a driving force for the industry , " he says .
" Competitors have realised that if they do n't move at least that rate they are going to fall behind . "
So far silicon producers have managed to keep on or ahead of the curve for more than four decades by continually shrinking the technology and packing more and more components inside a chip .
MOORE'S LAW
The number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years First outlined by Gordon Moore , co-founder of Intel Published in Electronics Magazine on 19 April , 1965
Moore 's Law in action
" It 's a peculiar feature of this technology that by making things smaller everything gets better , " says Dr Moore .
" The transistors get faster , you can put more of a system on a chip . "
But more importantly , and perhaps more curiously , the chips also become cheaper .
And this is the key point of his 1965 paper , he says .
Moore 's Law is an economic law and would probably have driven the industry regardless of whether or not he had made his prediction .
" I am not sure that having Moore 's Law held up there as a yardstick increases the pressure [ on chip manufacturers ] because the need to remain competitive is so strong . "
Chip future
As a result , the industry has grown " far beyond " what he could have imagined in 1965 , he says .
" It is surprising that any of the things we predicted are still valid . "
He is most impressed with the industry 's inventiveness , he says , allowing it to overcome a series of seemingly insurmountable technical hurdles as it grew .
" The industry has succeeded in getting around all of the ones that have been thrown in front of it , " he says .
" It has been much more successful than I probably would have predicted . "
But , Dr Moore says , the industry can only go on shrinking transistors for so long .
Eventually , the features will become so small that the atomic structure of the materials will be a limitation , possibly spelling the end of Moore 's Law
So what does he think will happen in the next 40 years ?
" I 'm through with making predictions , " he chuckles .
" Get it right once and quit . "
Drawn Out Danish Caricaturist of Muhammad Fame Now Homeless
Two years ago Kurt Westergaard was in his Copenhagen home drawing pictures .
One of them was of the Muslim prophet , Muhammad .
Now Westergaard is homeless .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Lately , whenever the market has a bad day , the reflex among financial - news editors is to compare our current situation with 1987 and wonder if a " Black Monday " - style crash is on the horizon .
But some observers draw a darker metaphor , noting that much of what we are seeing now also took place in 1929 .
As we know , that meltdown -- unlike the 1987 crash -- was not followed by a happy ending , but rather by a decade of poverty , shantytowns and sporadic famine .
Popular imagination has the Great Depression opening with a bang in October 1929 .
We forget that even by December of that year , the market had no idea what was really in store .
After a period of wild , bipolar volatility , stocks had taken two big tumbles ( a 12.8 % drop on Oct. 28 and an 11.7 % fall the next day ) while the top bankers and " captains of industry " rushed to shore up the market .
By November , the Dow had hit its low for the year at 198 , down from the giddy September high of 381 .
But , the financial pundits and government leaders of the day insisted , the economy 's fundamentals were still strong .
Mass unemployment was , some months after the crash , still just something that went on in Germany and Britain .
America was strong and merely needed a push to keep the financial markets from harming the broader economy .
With that in mind , Herbert Hoover -- only nine months into his presidency -- assembled leaders from the public and private sectors to create an economic - stimulus package .
Among the measures ,
Time magazine reported at the time , was a promise from Congress to offer bipartisan support for a tax - cut package .
The proposal called for $ 160 million in tax relief -- only about $ 22 billion if adjusted against the gross domestic product at the time , and therefore much smaller than the plan under consideration here in 2008 .
Read Time 's original coverage of the plan .
Also on the table was an assurance from the Federal Reserve that it would provide cheaper credit .
Granted , the Fed had much less power over the money supply in those days , mainly because the amount of liquidity it could create was limited by the supply of gold it held to back the dollar .
Of course , there were a litany of public - works projects , plans for new corporate investments , and even a promise by Henry Ford to raise wages at his auto plants .
None of this worked .
What was first seen as speed bump to the expansion of American finance became something much larger .
The Dow continued falling , hitting 157 in 1930 , 73 in 1931 and finally a mere 41 points in 1932 .
It did not reach its 1929 high again until 1954 , a generation later .
Certainly , our economy now has far more differences than similarities with the economy of 1929 , and few expect a new depression for the decade ahead .
But it 's also worth remembering that the best laid plans of presidents , chief executives and senators can sometimes come to nothing .
Newswise — Actually , it 's a Chevy Nova IN ice , or it will be when visiting artists Mary Carothers and Sue Wrbican get through with it .
With the help of growing numbers of Michigan Tech individuals and organizations , the artists are hard at work on the Michigan Tech campus , freezing the 1978 Nova in a solid block of ice .
Why , you might ask .
It 's a Winter Carnival project , of course , but it 's more than just a stunt .
" We 're redefining our processes of making public art , " says Carothers , an associate professor of fine arts at the University of Louisville .
" We want to generate open dialogue with as vast an audience as possible . "
Nor is it a blatant criticism of the exalted status that the automobile has attained in our country and culture .
" The frozen car points to the classic struggle of culture versus nature , " said Wrbican , an assistant professor of art and visual technology at George Mason University in Fairfax , Virginia .
Wrbican and Carothers chose Michigan for their unconventional art project because it is the birthplace of the automobile industry .
They chose freezing as a way to stop time , to give us a chance to step back and examine how our choices today affect our world tomorrow , and they chose to freeze a car because the automobile is a metaphor for freedom and power .
The Nova itself was one of the last of the muscle cars to roll out of Detroit before the oil crisis of the 1970s forced American automakers to start rethinking their ways .
Carothers and Wrbican met in graduate school at the Rhode Island School of Design .
Since then , they 've made a specialty of collaborative and unpredictable art .
They have blown up a car , set a couch on fire , and traveled back roads in a classic Airstream trailer , all in the name of art .
Now they 're towed a 30 - year - old car named E.D. ( for Ethyl 's Daughter ) to the Michigan Tech campus , where Hancock High School industrial arts students are building a car - sized container in which Wrbican and Carothers will park the gutted car .
Then they will fill the container with water , a little more each day .
In the Upper Peninsula 's frigid winter weather , they hope to have to have an enormous ice cube with the Nova suspended in the center when they remove the box .
" We 're asking the public to think about freedom and power , to become aware of the choices we make and their implications for our present and our future , " Carothers said .
You can watch the frozen car project take shape in front of the bay window on the highway side of the J.R. Van Pelt Library .
With a lot of sweat and a few more arctic days , the Nova in ice should be ready when Winter Carnival begins February 6 .

Increasingly autonomous , gun-toting robots developed for warfare could easily fall into the hands of terrorists and may one day unleash a robot arms race , a top expert on artificial intelligence says .
" They pose a threat to humanity , " University of Sheffield professor Noel Sharkey said , ahead of a keynote address before Britain 's Royal United Services Institute .
Intelligent machines deployed on battlefields around the world - from mobile grenade launchers to rocket - firing drones - can already identify and lock onto targets without human help .
There are more than 4,000 US military robots on the ground in Iraq , as well as unmanned aircraft that have clocked hundreds of thousands of flight hours .
The first three armed combat robots fitted with large - calibre machine guns deployed to Iraq last summer , manufactured by US arms maker Foster - Miller , proved so successful that 80 more are on order , Professor Sharkey said .
But up to now , a human hand has always been required to push the button or pull the trigger .
It we are not careful , he said , that could change .
" [ Military leaders ] are quite clear that they want autonomous robots as soon as possible , because they are more cost - effective and give a risk - free war , " he said .
Several countries , led by the United States , have already invested heavily in robot warriors developed for use on the battlefield .
South Korea and Israel both deploy armed robot border guards , while China , India , Russia and Britain have all increased the use of military robots .
The US Government plans to spend $ 4.28 billion by 2010 on unmanned technology systems , with total spending expected rise to $ 25.7 billion , according to the Department of Defence 's Unmanned Systems Roadmap 2007 - 2032 , released in December .
Human - robot ratio
James Canton , an expert on technology innovation and chief executive of the Institute for Global Futures , predicts that deployment within a decade of detachments that will include 150 soldiers and 2,000 robots .
The use of such devices by terrorists should be a serious concern , Professor Sharkey said .
Captured robots would not be difficult to reverse engineer , and could easily replace suicide bombers as the weapon - of - choice .
" I do n't know why that has not happened already , " he said .
But even more worrisome , he continued , is the subtle progression from the semi-autonomous military robots deployed today to fully independent killing machines .
" I have worked in artificial intelligence for decades , and the idea of a robot making decisions about human termination terrifies me , " he said .

RAW STORY
President George W. Bush wants armed guards on all planes flying into the United States from Europe , according to a draft document circulating among the European Union ’s 27 member states .
According the document leaked to the Guardian , the administration also wants EU states to supply personal data on all air passengers flying over the United States even if they are not landing in America .
Further , the Administration is also demanding that European airlines provide personal data on non-travelers , such as family members who are allowed beyond departure barriers to help the elderly or infirm board jets embarking for America .
Some diplomats have called the proposal blackmail .
The US has threatened to require west Europeans and Britons to have US visas to enter if their governments wo n’t sign on .

In Beautiful Code , great programmers share their thinking process with us .
And that ’s why this book transcends so many other books about programming : thinking and problem solving approaches are universal .
This is n’t a book about programs , it ’s a book about programming : every page turned will make you a better programmer .
Fundamentals matter , because although you are a programmer without them , you could be a much better programmer with them
Elsewhere , I see some folks are arguing whether writing HTML is programming or not .
To questions like that , I have but one response : give me an objective definition of what is and what is n’t a program , and I ’ll give you an objective definition of what is and is n’t programming .
Write code that works .
That ’s all , you write working code .
And it does n’t matter what degree you have , what courses you took , or whose blogs you read .
It ’s all about the code .
Joel , I hear what you ’re saying about knowing what a pointer is and understanding the byzantine Windows API .
But still , if someone write a program , I say he ’s a programmer .
Steve , you ’re preaching to the choir .
Yeah boy , programming without understanding how programming languages really work is like painting with the brush held between the toes of one foot .
But I think it ’s still programming .
And you over there , the one who just wants a job as a programmer , the one who wants to do whatever everybody is doing and wants to learn as little as possible to get things done .
You ’re a programmer , do n’t let any Chablis - swilling pretentious art - house blogger tell you otherwise between their rants about why we should still be using Lisp or Smalltalk .
All these other things , be they type theory , agile practices , compilers , pointers , DSLs , or anything else …
These are all tools .
Ignorance of those tools is not helpful .
I think you will be even better with more knowledge .
I think you will be happier if you learn how to “ cut with the grain ” and work with the principles of software development instead of against them .
But even if you decide you ca n’t be bothered with anything hard , the important thing is that you write programs , therefore you are a programmer .
I do n’t want to wake up one day and find there ’s a required reading course for being a programmer ( even if my blog is on the list ) .
I do n’t want anyone deciding who is — and who is n’t — fit to be a programmer .
I want everyone to be free to program .
The price of that freedom is that yes , some people are going to do things I do n’t like .
But you ca n’t build a world with room for Ruby unless there ’s room for PHP .
You cannot build a world with room for Scala unless you build a world with room for Java .
Now , does that mean that when Steve Yegge talks about why you ought to know how compilers work , everyone ought to shout him down and say that compiler architecture and / or programming language implementation is bullshit ?
No .
I will be the first to say that compilers and language implementation are important .
I will rant .
I support your individual choice of what to learn and what to skip as a programmer .
Agree or disagree with me , I say you ’re a programmer and I measure how good you are by what you do with the knowledge you decide to acquire .
But I still believe that there are such things as fundamentals .
There are things that every programmer would do well to know .
There are things that would make everybody ’s lives easier if every programmer knew them .
I do say that you can program without the fundamentals , but I will never say that they are irrelevant , that we have passed the day when fundamentals matter .
They do matter , because although you are a programmer without them , you could be a much better programmer with them .
But you will still be a programmer .
" It 's over , " Eisner said .
" They made the deal , they shook hands on the deal .
It 's going on Saturday to the writers in general . "
Eisner , speaking live on CNBC's " Fast Money , " seemed to hesitate initially about whether it was possible that the writers could still reject the agreement , but finally suggested the deal 's acceptance was inevitable .
" A deal has been made , and they 'll be back to work very soon , " Eisner said , adding , " I know a deal 's been made .
I know it 's over . "
Eisner did not elaborate on terms of the agreement .
He said he expects most of the media companies affected by the strike to have " small " write - downs as a result of the deal .
Eisner said the deal was struck last Friday .
As a result of studio cutbacks , however , many of the writers who went on strike are unlikely to return to the same big - money contracts they'd had as individuals with the studios , Eisner said .
Shares of Walt Disney and CBS were both up in extended electronic trading Thursday .
Fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) is the most common hereditary form of mental retardation .
Many children with FXS also suffer from attention deficit and / or hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , which complicates social relationships at home and at school .
Although stimulant medication such as Ritalin® is often successfully used to treat children with ADHD , studies have shown that while it is effective in children with mental retardation , it also causes side effects such as increased irritability , decreased verbalization and social withdrawal .
A previous study showed that L - acetyl carnitine ( LAC ) , a form of the amino acid carnitine , significantly reduced hyperactive behavior in FXS boys with ADHD who were treated with it for one year without causing adverse side effects .
The same authors have now conducted a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled multicenter study to determine the effectiveness of LAC in a larger group .
Led by M. Giulia Torrioli and Giovanni Neri of the Università Cattolica in Rome , the study involved 51 boys between 6 and 12 years old with FXS and ADHD who were treated in one of eight centers in Italy , France and Spain .
Each patient followed the treatment for 12 months , which involved 500 milligrams of LAC or a placebo given twice daily .
Patients were evaluated by an interdisciplinary team of child neuropsychiatrists and psychologists at the start of the study , after one month , six months and 12 months .
The effects of the drug and placebo were evaluated using a set of neuropsychological tests to assess behavior .
Those treated with LAC demonstrated reduced hyperactive behavior and increased attention .
No side effects were exhibited , confirming that LAC is a safe alternative to stimulants .
The patients treated with the placebo also showed reduced hyperactive behavior , although not nearly to the extent as the LAC - treated patients .
The patients treated with LAC also had significantly improved social ability compared to the placebo - treated group .
Both groups took intelligence tests , but LAC did not improve overall intellectual functioning .
“ We propose that LAC be recommended as a treatment of ADHD in FXS children , ” conclude the authors , “ since it effectively reduces hyperactive behavior and improves social abilities without adverse side effects . ”
They also suggest that these results may be applicable to children with autism , who also do not easily tolerate stimulants .

OT III
In OT III , ( " OPERATING THETAN , Section Three " )
Hubbard explains his cosmology and the ins & outs of ' body thetans ' .
I will try to summarise it , because my lawyer , after finally having seen evidence handed over to him on behalf of RTC , has advised me that including the full text is at this time against my interests .
So be it .
I therefore will give you this summary , interspersed with comments .
Your comments are kindly invited .
Please correct any errors and tell me about any information that I may have missed .
Page numbers refer to the version of OT III as given in the Fishman Affidavit .
The following portion of OT III is quoted in full in Margery Wakefield 's book The Road to Xenu , chapter 13 , and I believe all of it has been quoted in other books and articles as well .
It provides a nice context for my summary and comments :
The head of the Galactic Federation ( 76 planets around larger stars visible from here ) ( founded 95,000,000 years ago , very space opera ) solved overpopulation ( 250 billion or so per planet , 178 billion on average ) by mass implanting .
He caused people to be brought to Teegeeack ( Earth ) and put an H - Bomb on the principal volcanos ( Incident II ) and then the Pacific area ones were taken in boxes to Hawaii and the Atlantic area ones to Las Palmas and there " packaged " .
His name was Xenu .
He used renegades .
Various misleading data by means of circuits etc. was placed in the implants .
When through with his crime loyal officers ( to the people ) captured him after six years of battle and put him in an electronic mountain trap where he still is .
" They " are gone .
The place ( Confederation ) has since been a desert .
The length and brutality of it all was such that this Confederation never recovered .
The implant is calculated to kill ( by pneumonia etc ) anyone who attempts to solve it .
This liability has been dispensed with by my tech development .
One can freewheel through the implant and die unless it is approached as precisely outlined .
The " freewheel " ( auto - running on and on ) lasts too long , denies sleep etc and one dies .
So be careful to do only Incidents I and II as given and not plow around and fail to complete one thetan at a time .
In December 1967 I knew someone had to take the plunge .
I did and emerged very knocked out , but alive .
Probably the only one ever to do so in 75,000,000 years .
I have all the data now , but only that given here is needful .
One 's body is a mass of individual thetans stuck to oneself or to the body .
One has to clean them off by running incident II and Incident I .
It is a long job , requiring care , patience and good auditing .
You are running beings .
They respond like any preclear .
Some large , some small .
Thetans believed they were one .
This is the primary error .
Good luck .

Well , lots of things to dissect and discuss here , and perhaps even more things that need some elucidation before we can even begin to understand what Hubbard says in this rather strange and condensed titbit .
But before we start , I believe it may be useful to first explain some more about Scientology 's basic beliefs ; otherwise it 's difficult to make head or tail of the quote .
Jon Atack , who once was a member of Scientology and who has in fact completed OT III before he became a very effective critic of the cult , has provided us with a very useful analysis , OT III rewritten for beginners .
Here 's what Jon says : Scientologists believe that they have reincarnated from before the beginning of time .
They believe that many interplanetary civilizations have existed .
Hubbard restyled the spirit the " thetan " .
Before the beginning of time , thetans existed , separate from one another ( thetans were not created ; they have existed for all time and indeed precede the creation of time ) .
With the creation of energy and matter , thetans have gradually become trapped .
The principal method of entrapment is through " implanting " , where the thetan is hypnotised and given positive suggestions which limit its powers .
This process , according to Hubbard has been going on in this universe for four quadrillion years ( 4,000,000,000,000,000 , rather than the mere 8 - 200,000,000 held by astrophysicists ) .
However , this is just one universe in a series of several .
Scientology seeks to return the thetan 's power by stripping away implants and using drills to heighten extrasensory perception and ability .
The goal of these procedures is an " operating thetan " - a being who can act independently of his physical body , and can cause physical events to occur through sheer force of will .
The " operating thetan " would be capable of dismissing illness and psychological disorder in others at will .
Now that we know that , let 's go through it again .
Here 's how Hubbard 's OT III story starts :
The head of the Galactic Federation ( 76 planets around larger stars visible from here ) ( founded 95,000,000 years ago , very space opera ) solved overpopulation ( 250 billion or so per planet , 178 billion on average ) by mass implanting .
He caused people to be brought to Teegeeack ( Earth ) and put an H - Bomb on the principal volcanos ( Incident II ) and then the Pacific area ones were taken in boxes to Hawaii and the Atlantic area ones to Las Palmas and there " packaged " .
Margery Wakefield , The Road to Xenu , p. 77 .
Hubbard believes in various universes , an idea that has been explored in sci - fi under the name of ' parallel universes ' .
Hubbard postulates that 95 million years ago , in our particular universe , a Galactic Federation was founded .
There are , according to him , seventy - six planets that have gained membership to it .
Sure bigger than the United Nations , and very space - opera indeed .
According to Hubbard , earth was once part of this Federation .
It suffered from severe overpopulation ; an average 178 billion people per planet is indeed rather crowded .
The head of the Federation , whose name is later on to be revealed as ' Xenu ' , although some people think it 's ' Xemu ' ( Hubbard 's handwriting is spidery , and thus easy to misread ) took draconian measures to reduce the number of inhabitants .
Xenu transported the lot of them to earth , then referred to as ' Teegeeack ' .
After transportation , Xenu used hydrogen bombs on various volcanoes and thereby wiped out all these people .
Very effective indeed .
He then proceeded to carry off their souls / spirits or ' thetans ' and ' implanted ' those .
This episode - the transport , the bombing , the implanting - was labelled ' Incident II ' by Hubbard .
In the other universes , other things happened .
All thetans on this planet and on twenty - one nearby stars have Incident II and ' R6 ' in common .
Hubbard refers to these twenty - two planets as ' the Confederation ' .
It might be worth mentioning here that the Sea Org 's insignia carries twenty - two stars .
The number of stars is surely not chosen haphazardly : the insignia is obviously intended to be a symbol of this confederation that had to ' suffer ' Incident II .
The other planets within the Galactic Federation - there were seventy - six of them , Hubbard says - supposedly have their own version of Incident II .
And other universes - remember , Hubbard believed in parallel universes - would probably have other versions of Incident II as well .
But what all universes have in common , according to Hubbard , is Incident I .
He describes it in just a few lines and obviously did n't give the matter much thought , or perhaps he did n't dare ' to take the plunge ' into this one .
Hubbard does n't say how much time this incident took , nor does he locate it .
He 's also noteably silent upon what happened in between Incident I and II , if I may say so .
Incident I
Occurs at start of track ( 4 quadrillion years ago ) .
LOUD SNAP
WAVES OF LIGHT
CHARIOT COMES OUT , TURNS RIGHT AND LEFT
CHERUB COMES OUT
BLOWS HORN , COMES CLOSE
SHATTERING SERIES OF SNAPS
CHERUB FADES BACK ( RETREATS )
BLACKNESS DUMPED ON THETAN L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 99-100 .
Judging by this , I do n't think Hubbard supported either the Big Bang or the Expanding Universe - theory in his private cosmology , although both make much more sense than his .
Let 's label this one the Snap Story .
We have here an undecisive cherub , who does n't know whether to turn left or right and who comes out twice without ever retreating ; and we have horns .
A bit angelic for somebody who , as we shall see later , believed that Christ was an implant .
Let 's turn to Incident II , which allegedly happened 75 million years ago and occurred on earth : Incident II is over 36 days long .
Capture on other planets was weeks or months before the implant .
Those on Teegeeack ( Earth ) were just blown up except for Loyal officers who were ( shortly before the explosion on Earth ) rounded up .

So Xenu captured everybody who did not live on earth , held them imprisoned for a few weeks or sometimes even months , and then transported them to earth and mixed them with the rest , that is : the people who did live there .
He then proceeded to nuke the lot .
Just a few loyal officers escaped this major hydrogen bombing .
Judging from this excerpt , it would seem that Hubbard conjures that loyal officers were only to be found on earth .
That 's exo-speciesm , I think ...
I also wonder where they went ?
Incident II is described in greater detail .
Here 's the ' sequence ' : H- BOMB DROPPED ON VOLCANO
EXPLOSION
TERRIFIC WINDS
THETAN CARRIED OVER PEAK
ELECTRONIC RIBBON CAME UP
HE STUCK TO IT
IT WAS THEN PULLED DOWN AND HE WAS ( AS PART OF A GROUP ) IMPLANTED WITH R6
PICTURE OF PILOT SAYING HE IS MOCKING IT UP L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 99 .
Every bit as cryptic , but at least he elaborates on it throughout OT III .
The bit about the thetan , the soul or spirit of a nuked - out guy , getting stuck to an electric ribbon surely reflects Margery Wakefield 's comparison of them to insects : upon hearing for the first time about body thetans , she said they sounded like fleas .
Based on this description , I 'd vote for flies .
Another nicety is the pilot mentioned in the last part of the sequence .
Sounds like the ending of a bad horror movie : 'T was all a dream ...
But although ' mocking something up ' usually means ' imagining it ' , in Scieno - lingo it means more than a mental picture ; it is supposedly a self - created object ; it is a thing which one can be .
Operating Thetans are , again supposedly , able to ' mock up ' a picture that has dimensions and location in space and time .
After the bombing , the thetans were ' implanted ' .
Hubbard decribes the ' sequence ' of the ' implant ' thus : ( 1 ) capture ( being shot ) ,
( 2 ) freezing ,
( 3 ) transport to Teegeeack ( sometimes via a relay point ) ,
( 4 ) being placed near a volcano ,
( 5 ) beginning implant up to " the pilot " ,
( 6 ) various picture sequences ,
( 7 ) the 7s and C.C. and OT II materials ,
(8) 36 days of picture implants which give a vast array of materials and three explanations for the bombing ,
( 9 ) transport to Hawaii or Las Palmas for packaging up into clusters .
The pictures contain God , the Devil , angels , space opera , theaters , helicopters , a constant spinning , a spinning dancer , trains and various scenes very like modern England .
You name it , it 's in this implant we call in its entirely " R6 " .
L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 80 .
Jon
Atack gives some more details than I 've been able to find in the Fishman - version of OT III .
For instance , he explains how the thetans were transported , according to Hubbard :
The people were killed and the thetans ( or spirits ) gathered , frozen in a mixture of glycol and alcohol , and brought to Earth where they were placed near volcanoes which were exploded with hydrogen bombs .
The thetans were gathered on " electronic ribbons " , packaged together as clusters and given 36 days of implanting , to render them servile and incapable of decision .
So what happens is that they 're caught , transported , nuked , get implanted up to a certain point ( the pilot saying it was all mocked up ) and then get fed pictures .
They 're also given the ' 7s ' ( a set of supposed implants , and for the life of me , I do n't know which ; I do n't know if Hubbard does , either .
He does not further describe it in OT III ) .
' C.C. ' is the clearing course , the courses Scientologists have to finish before they are allowed to do the OT's .
It strikes me as rather funny that Hubbard says they were fed OT 2 as well : something is coming full circle here .
I think it helps Scientologists to relate to these poor imprisoned inoperate thetans : after all , it means they 're at the same point in their studies .
After they 're fed OT 2 , it 's movie - time again .
Thirty six days , no less !
Then they 're transported again and delivered at the volcanoes .
What strikes me as odd , is that in the description of Incident II itself the thetans get to be implanted before they encounter this pilot who says it 's all mocked up ; but during this implant , they are " implanted up to ' the pilot ' " .
Mirrors in mirrors here ...
The gist of the implanting , as per Hubbard , is pictures of theatres , trains , helicopters , and modern British life .
Pictures of God and the devil are part of it , Hubbard says here .
This of course is a statement highly objectionable to those who adhere to Christianity .
Elsewhere Hubbard happens to mention that Christ was part of the implant too .
' R6 ' is short for the ' reactive mind ' , i.e. the whole of the implant during OT III .
The ' reactive mind ' is also being referred to as ' bank ' ( short for : memory bank ) .
Hubbard repeatedly states that this is all ' fact ' .
Fact , not fiction .
But he obviously chose to ignore a few harder facts , and his story is in flagrant contradiction with , for instance , geology .
In Jon Atack 's words : OT III is of course in substantial disagreement with conventional geology .
Geologists hold that almost all of the volcanoes listed by Hubbard and both Hawaii and Los Palmas came into being far more recently than 75 million years ago .
On a simple point of logic , it seems strange that none of these volcanoes was damaged by the explosion of the hydrogen bombs .
One of these scientific refutations may be found on my homepage : Peter Fordes Scientific Scrutiny of OT III .
Hubbard 's ' facts ' flunk on astrophysics : our universe is much younger that he believes it to be .
So be well advised and take Hubbard 's story as fiction rather than fact .
There 's another confusing paragraph :
His name was Xenu .
He used renegades .
Various misleading data by means of circuits etc. was placed in the implants .
Margery Wakefield , The Road to Xenu , p. 76 .
Ah , here we have the first occurrence of the name of the Beast , sometimes also referred to as ' the Dark Prince ' : Xenu .
The name ' Xenu ' is shunned by most Scientologist : they will not speak it , and try to prevent others from reading it .
( There 's this one Scientology guy on a.r.s. who carefully edits ' Xenu ' out of the name of Steven Fishman 's account any time he replies to Fishman : he changes it into zenu@ix.netcom.com instead .
Rather funny , in fact . )
Or Scientologists will pretend they 've never heard of Xenu , in adherence with their belief that OT III is very secret and must not revealed to or be discussed with anybody whatsoever .
So Xenu availed himself of renegades to carry out his devilish plot .
But renegades of what ?
Xenu was the leader of the Galactic Federation , according to Ron , was n't he ?
So if they were renegades , you would hardly expect them to plot with Xenu , but rather against , would n't you ?
It does n't make sense .
Even fiction needs a coherent plot and should not mess up details .
The next sentence deals with the content of the ' implants ' .
According to Hubbard , implants are ' false memories ' , a kind of post - hypnotic suggestion .
Here he describes them as ' misleading data ' .
Hubbard explains that Xenu and his renegades used ' circuits ' to place this misleading data in the populace .
It 's a shame he does n't give more details .
He was a sci - fi writer , was n't he ?
So surely he should have been able to come up with something .
Now I can't help but think of this movie of Johnnie Mnemonic and hismemory bank ...
When through with his crime loyal officers ( to the people ) captured him after six years of battle and put him in an electronic mountain trap where he still is .
" They " are gone .
The place ( Confederation ) has since been a desert .
The length and brutality of it all was such that this Confederation never recovered .
The implant is calculated to kill ( by pneumonia etc ) anyone who attempts to solve it .
This liability has been dispensed with by my tech development .
Margery Wakefield , The Road to Xenu , p. 76 .
Loyal officers - that is : loyal to the people , but I think that from Xenu 's point of view we would have the real renegades here , considering what 's up next - some officers captured Xenu after his frightful misdeeds .
It was not an easy catch : it took six years of battle .
These officers then proceeded by caging Xenu in and trapping him in a mountain on one of the Federation 's planets .
Hubbard believes that Xenu is still there , supposedly alive .
According to Hubbard , the place where all this happened has suffered severely and is still bare .
Hubbard turns to the implant now .
It is allegedly deadly : ' calculated to kill ( by pneumonia etc ) ' , but he quickly ensures his readers that he himself has developed the tech to deal with that , and render the implant harmless .
One can freewheel through the implant and die unless it is approached as precisely outlined .
The " freewheel " ( auto - running on and on ) lasts too long , denies sleep etc and one dies .
So be careful to do only Incidents I and II as given and not plow around and fail to complete one thetan at a time .
Margery Wakefield , The Road to Xenu , p. 76 - 77 .
Now it 's becoming complicated .
Until now , this was just a nice sci - fi story starring evil princes , but now we 'll get entangled in Scieno - speak : lots of lingo to come .
Hubbard here explains his to followers how to deal with the implants placed in us in Incident I and II .
Remember , Scientologists ' run ' things .
They ' run ' a routine , for instance , or a procedure .
' Running ' means : going over a memory or following an auditing procedure .
You can also ' overrun ' something , meaning that you take a routine or procedure beyond the end of an auditing process .
To put it simply , when you ' overrun ' something , you did n't stop in time .
I take it that ' auto - running ' is meant to denote that a procedure or routine takes off by itself , and just goes ' on and on ' .
' Freewheeling ' must be akin to running in circles in perpetuum .
Hubbard believes that it will kill a person .
But what about this : ' fail to complete one thetan at a time ' .
I take it that that 's a body thetan .
But how do you ' take ' them ?
I think I need help on this .
Jon ?
On OT III , the individual finds " body thetans " by locating any sensation of pressure or mass in his or her body .
This is addressed " telepathically " as a cluster , and taken through the cluster - making incident of 75 million years ago .
Once this is done , the individual body thetans should be available to be taken through either the same incident or through incident one . (...)
According to OT III , everyone on Earth is in fact a collection of such clusters ( Hubbard says that each person doing OT III will find " hundreds " of body thetans - many victims of this course believe that they find millions ) .
Thanks , Jon .
So one needs to take all one 's body thetans through one of these Incidents , one by one .
Sounds like a lot of work indeed .
In December 1967 I knew someone had to take the plunge .
I did and emerged very knocked out , but alive .
Probably the only one ever to do so in 75,000,000 years .
I have all the data now , but only that given here is needful .
Margery Wakefield , The Road to Xenu , p. 77 .
Oh - wee !
Hubbard dived straight into the implant !
The first one to do so in 75 million years !
Such a shame that he does not give ' all the data ' but holds back on us .
Now he 's dead and we 'll never know all the details of his space soap opera .
Oh well .
Star Wars is still being televised .
At least Hubbard had the grace to explain about these body thetans of his :
One 's body is a mass of individual thetans stuck to oneself or to the body .
Margery Wakefield , The Road to Xenu , p. 77 .
So we are made up of this ' mass of individual thetans ' that are stuck to us .
Yuk .
And they can form clusters too !
" A cluster is a group of body thetans crushed or hold together by some mutual bad experience , " that 's what I read somewhere .
I bet the mutual bad experience is either Incident I or Incident II .
One has to clean them off by running incident II and Incident I .
It is a long job , requiring care , patience and good auditing .
You are running beings .
They respond like any preclear .
Some large , some small .
Margery Wakefield , The Road to Xenu , p. 77 .
See ?
I was right .
But ' running beings '?
I guess it 's following processes not unlike those the pre-clear use when they 're ' running an engram ' , the difference being that they now ' run body thetans ' .
And the body thetans behave like pre-clears .
Hmm , do they have to hand in stats too ?
Thetans believed they were one .
This is the primary error .
Good luck .
Margery Wakefield , The Road to Xenu , p. 77 .
' Primary error ' , sounds like ' primary sin ' .
And these Scientologists believe all that ?
Wow .
And gee , thanks for the good wishes .
I think that the Scientologist who has just started on OT III and has just read all this , could use them .
Quite a few of them took a real fright , I 've gathered .
And what exactly happens to the body thetan when you get rid of it ?
Does it jump on somebody else ?
No , they do n't , Hubbbard says .
It 's explained a bit further in the text .
Body Thetans are just Thetans .
When you get rid of one he goes off and possibly squares around , picks up a body or admires daisies .
He is in fact a sort of cleared Being .
He cannot fail to eventually , if not at once , regain many abilities .
Many have been asleep for the last 75,000,000 years .
A Body Thetan responds to any process any Thetan responds to .
L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 78 .
Many body thetans ' have been asleep for the last 75 million years ' ?
They sure outdo Sleeping Beauty !
And when the Scientologist has rid himself of one of these body thetans , the little thingies may pick up a body of their own .
They even like daisies !
Where 's all the sci - fi gone , I wonder , and the horror ?
So what the Scientologist needs to do , is audit all these body thetans , that is : lead them through Incident II , and perhaps I .
Then they 'll be off .
Every body thetan has to be processed individually .
I could n't find a reference as to their numbers .
There might be hundreds ; could be more , could be less .
If you find none , Hubbard says , one needs to go back to some basic courses and perhaps file for a ' Review ' , that is , a serious talk with one 's supervisor , because finding no body thetans is out of the question .
In a chapter called ' The Basic on BT's ' , Hubbard goes on to explain that body thetans tend to stick together .
They form ' clusters ' by collision ; they keep a picture of this collision , and , in turn , this picture attracts yet other body thetans .
( I remember this fairy tale in which a boy with a swan starred ; everybody wanted to touch the swan , but once they had , they could n't get loose .
After the first person got stuck , someone tried to pull him loose .
He in turn got stuck as well .
And the next .
And the next .
Hubbard 's story reminds me of this tale . )
Hubbard then goes in a complicated spin , explaining how the collision and the picture of the collision conflate :
Thus we get the concept of a " black theta body " .
This would be actual BT 's stuck to a thetan plus pictures of BT 's stuck to a thetan .
L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 81 .
The solution to this tangled web of stuck body thetans and pictures of stuck body thetans stuck to thetans , is to try and trace the first incident or ' picture ' of such a collision or contact , and work from there .
What one has to do is break up the cluster .
Clusters are usually derived from Incident II ( one is never sure though ; they might date back to Incident I ) .
In the real big clusters that are formed in Incident II , these clusters even have hierarchies within the partaking body thetans : Incident II sometimes forms gigantic clusters .
In such there is a leader , an alternate leader and several ( eight to eighteen ) more .
L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 83 .
There is alas no reference to the function of this leadership and alternate leadership .
Perhaps it 's just for the heck of it ; after all , they 're nasty implanted little bastards .
It is even quite common to find that there are clusters made up out of clusters :
In doing a cluster one is likely to find it is made up of other earlier clusters .
L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 90 .
So how does one break up a cluster ?
Take 'em through Incident II and then they 'll losen up , so that you can address the individual body thetans .
As I said before , a lot of work to do here .
Another complication is that it will sometimes only appear as if a body thetan is n't gone , but he fooled ya .
He is gone indeed .
He just left a trace of himself , and what you are trying to audit away is not the thingie itself :
Thetans in the body may obsessively copy the pictures of other thetans .
Therefore you can find it seems that the thetan who just left is still there because there is a picture left .
L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 85 .
While this may be a nasty trick , there 's worse that you may encounter : Some Body Thetans are suppressive .
A suppressive is out of valence in R6 .
He is in valence in Incident I almost always .
L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 78 .
Suppressive body thetans !
Would n't you know .
Hubbard sees suppressives everywhere .
What do you want to do with them ?
Send them to Ethics ?
Expel them from Scientology ?
Fair game them ?
But what is a suppressive body thetan ?
In Scieno - speak , ' valence ' is an adopted personality ; ' being out of valence ' therefore means behaving as if you 're someone else ; imposturing , so to say .
So when Hubbard says that a body thetan is ' out of valence ' in ' R6 ' - R6 being the Incident II implant - I guess what he means is that these particular body thetans pretend to be linked with the bombing , while in fact they 're linked with the cherubs and the Snap Story .
The little pranksters !
According to Hubbard , when one manages to rid oneself of all body thetans , one will be able to " accomplish full stable exteriorization " with full perception , that is : get out of your body and move at will through the universe .
As L. Ron Hubbard puts it : OT III is a vital grade .
One fronts up to it and does it .
When he is really done , the rewards of OT III and IV exceed his wildest dreams .
L. Ron Hubbard , OT III , p. 93 .
For me , I think it 's not wild at all .
Wildly mad , at best .

For completion 's sake , and because my grasp of such an ephemeral subject as that of body thetans is quite flimsy ( and I intend to keep it that way ) I further include an excerpt from a book written by Geoffrey Filbert , Excalibur Revisited that deals with OT III as well .
Filbert goes on at length about the body thetans and the procedures one should apply on them .
Excalibur Revisted was published in electronic form , and Mr Filbert has given it to the public domain in the fall of 1994 .
It is , amongst others , available via America Online and has been since December 1994 .
The material is in fact copyright by Filbert ; he received his copyright registration on April 25 , 1982 .
Scientology received their first copyright filings for their OT III material on May 12 , 1982 ...
So I guess Filbert predates them .
These are pages 266 - 268 . ( begin Filbert excerpt ) OT III
1. Check for any BTs ( E - meter , theta perceptics , intention , pressure areas , telepathy is HOW ) on and in : Body surface ( WHERE ) Body inside
In thetan 's space ( Approx . 40 ' X 60 ') On thetan 2 . Run Incident 2 , then Incident 1 , until BT (s ) have gone and are released .
Then , check for additional Incidents 1's and 2's until dry ( on the meter ) .
3 . Return to Step 2 , to find new ones to run .
Use ruds while running if necessary .
There is an effort to stop and hurry on Incident 1 .
4 . When complete , exact date and run both of the incidents on self .
5 . If a bog , do Millazo Pack .
Write down some ' mutual associations ' .
Re each one on this list , FIND THE INCIDENT THAT MADE THEM ONE , and run that .
Then , run OT III , Incident 2 and 1 after that cluster is broken up .
Occasionally , BTs will have an incident that made them one other then Incident 2 , thus this action .
INCIDENT 2 : Dates approx .
75 million years ago , earth years , location , Earth , named TEEGEEACK at that time ( meaning planet of sorrow ) , involved 33 planets of this sector , each with populations of 80 - 200 BILLION PER PLANET .
XENU , the ruler , and ' Renegades ' decided to solve overpopulation as follows , but was halted and XENU placed in a mountain trap after over 5 years of war .
Incident 2 Patter : DETERMINE IF A LOYAL OFFICER , RESIDENT OF EARTH , or FROM ANOTHER PLANET .
If the latter two , start at their being picked up and shot and if from another planet , frozen in an ice cube , transported ( flying saucer ) , taken to mountain , a volcano always , H BOMB EXPLOSION , TERRIFIC WINDS , EFFORT TO ORIENT , MAGNETIC STRIP UP FROM CENTER OF VOLCANO OR DOWN FROM AN AIRPLANE , EFFORT TO GET OFF AND FIND REST OF SELF , PROTEST , BEING PULLED ON STRIP , VISUAL DISPLAY OF INSTRUCTION BY A 'GO TO THE PILOT ' , WHO SAYS ' HE'S MOCKING IT UP ' .
There are 26 - 29 days of implanting ( the CC and OT II , God and Devil material , reasons for this being done , helicopters , etc. ) that need not be run .
SOME WERE PACKAGED INTO CLUSTERS in the HAWAII and LOS PALMAS ISLANDS ( 8 to a cluster ) .
If a loyal officer , the sequence is SURPRISE at being shot , placed at the volcano .
Use meter to determine and determine volcano .
Watch for earlier beginning ( pulled in for a tax audit ) , run only up to the ' HE'S MOCKING IT UP ' as BTs can go into ' free fall ' , spin and get sick from the 29 days implanting , with pneumonia and death the implanted phenomena of free fall in addition to insomnia .
Coltus , the Reigning planet , Hubbard a part of the ' rescuing force that put an end to it ' .
Do n't force or push them off , and answer the BTs questions .
There were probably not any good or bad guys in this incident , although Hubbard insists the sector to have been a cultural desert since .
Very SP
BTs can usually be brought around with adept 2WC , Charm , Ruds , but if not use Power Processing on the rare hard core .
Incident 1 : Dates 4 QUADRILLION YEARS AGO ( which is 15 zeros or 4,000 trillion years ago ) .
Incident 1 Patter : LOUD SNAP , WAVES OF LIGHT , HORSES DRAWING CHARIOT RIGHT TO LEFT , CHERUB COMES OUT , BLOWS HORN , COMES CLOSE , SHATTERING SERIES OF SNAPS , CHERUB FADES , RETREATS , BLACK MASS IS DUMPED ON THE THETAN .

You clear up that a BT is a body thetan , The instructions are self explanatory , Basically , the reason they are doing this is to where they wo n't be confused with hundreds of different thoughts so that they can have some peace and quiet , and so they wo n't be other - determined .
After they have run all these remnants of folks out by telepathic auditing on them , they attain the state of freedom from overwhelm and a return of full self determinism .
One cleans off those 4 areas in the order listed .
It is generally underrun , it is rarely overrun .
What you have been doing all the way up the Bridge is breaking these clusters apart .
With Expanded Dianetics , Grades and all the previous auditing , you have been taking these off .
About 1/2 of the BTs come off and leave and go live their own lives by doing the lower Bridge right , and the other 1 / 2 come off here by doing OT III correctly .
So , if you do n't do the lower Bridge correctly on someone and they do a real good job on OT III , they will get about 1 / 2 of it done .
It is pretty wild material to run and the gains of it are beyond description .
It is not a crazy idea at all .
The irony of it is that it happened a lot more than once .
It is listed as an event that happened 75 million years ago .
It probably happened to the preclear dozens of times .
So , watch out for your dates .
After that you do not do OT VII , and then put them on OT III again , like the churches do .
You do OT IV which is included here .
After they have done that they have attained the state of certainty of self as a being and freedom from uncertainty of self .
On OT V they attain the state of freedom from fixated introversion into MEST and gain the ability to refamiliarize as a thetan exterior with the physical universe .

Sen. Jim Webb ( D - VA ) thinks legal action against the Bush administration may be needed if the president pursues a long - term military presence in Iraq without Congress ’ approval .
“ I ’m not convinced we do n’t need to have a lawsuit ready , ” Webb told the Huffington Post .
“ This is a classic separation of powers issue .
I started to talk to people about this today . ”
In recent days the administration has seemingly backed away from attempting to secure extended military - to - military relationship with the Iraqi government to replace a current U.N. Mandate .
Webb and others — most notably Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Sen. Hillary Clinton — have pushed legislation that would restrict federal money for any such agreement unless it came in the form of a congressional treaty .
And while a victory on that front seems within grasp , the possibility still exists , Webb warned , for the administration to ultimately circumvent congressional input .
“ They are characterizing this as within the authority of the Executive Branch .
They will wait to August when everyone is at the conventions , and leave it on our doorstep , ” said the Virginia Democrat .
“ If the Senate has n’t acted by then , they are going to announce an agreement between the Executive Branch and Iraq . ”

There was a rumor floating the Toobz yesterday that Trent Lott got out of the Senate in a hurry because of boy trouble -- perhaps something that Larry Flynt dug up .
That rumor has since been denied by the boy in question .
But Scott Horton points us to something that is rather more intriguing :
The fact that Trent 's brother - in - law 's law office is presently being raided .
Sources in Mississippi law enforcement inform No Comment that FBI agents are now raiding the law office of Richard “ Dickie ” Scruggs in Oxford .
Horton has covered the non-indictment of Dickie Scruggs before .
You see , Scruggs was the apparent mastermind of a plan behind loans to some Mississippi judges -- loans for which Democratic lawyer Paul Minor is now doing time .
As Minor recounts it , and other lawyers with whom I spoke confirm , the idea of rushing in to support the judges who came under fire from the Chamber of Commerce started with Richard Scruggs , probably the best known and wealthiest member of the Mississippi trial lawyers bar .
Scruggs , like Minor , made loans to Mississippi judges and came under investigation in the original study launched by the FBI .
However , there was a critical difference .
Scruggs tends to support the Republicans , not the Democrats .
In 2000 , for instance , he gave $ 250,000 to the Bush - Cheney campaign and to the G.O.P. , and only $ 20,000 to Democratic candidates .
And more significantly , Scruggs was the brother - in - law of Mississippi Senator Trent Lott , who at the time was the Republican leader in the U.S. Senate .
If the conduct that Minor engaged in was unlawful , then Scruggs should also have been charged .
Indeed , an outsider looking over the file would come pretty quickly to expect to see Scruggs as the lead defendant in the case .
But that ’s not the way U.S. Attorney Lampton and Public Integrity section head Noel Hillman saw things , and several people who have asked to remain anonymous have told me that that Lott was aggressive in acting to protect Scruggs .
Well , I gotta say , it'd be awfully encouraging if , just weeks after Michael Mukasey started as AG , what appears to have been another politicized prosecution was addressed .
It certainly raises questions , though , about what else might be out there .
Might Apple have interest in gaming beyond its pokey iPod gaming offerings ?
Maybe , when you consider that the company has recently applied to expand its trademark into the realm of gaming .
The new filing was made on February 5 , and has not yet been assigned to an examining attorney .
The trademark filing seeks to extend the " APPLE " ( text ) trademark to cover a wide swath of the gaming world , to wit :
" Toys , games and playthings , namely , hand - held units for playing electronic games ; hand - held units for playing video games ; stand alone video game machines ; electronic games other than those adapted for use with television receivers only ; LCD game machines ; electronic educational game machines ; toys , namely battery - powered computer games . " ( emphasis added . )
Tradmork , who first unearthed the application and contacted us about it , suggests that this could be the first credible evidence that Apple might build a gaming machine .
The question is , does this filing suggest anything more than the iPod gaming that already exists ?
Pippin , Jr .
Our first reaction is that Apple is just covering its bases here .
Yet the " stand alone video game machines " entry gives us pause , because that does n't describe an iPod , and Apple does n't need such a trademark for a PC that can play games .
" Stand alone video game machines " could describe gaming on the Apple TV , however , and we do n't think it 's farfetched that we 'll one day see the iPod - specific gaming titles playable on an Apple TV .
Recall Pippin , Apple 's failed attempt at a " multimedia console " ?
Apple TV , with a dash of gaming support , could be almost everything Pippin wanted to be ( and more ) .
The Apple TV is already gearing up to be the centerpiece in Apple 's new movie rental and sales scheme .
Apple has also shown us that it can take its OS X and put it on just about everything , which opens up tons of possibilities for a set top box .
Users have already managed to get OS X running on the Apple TV , so we know it 's a possibility .
And we do expect Apple TV to morph over time into something far more powerful than an iTunes - to - TV connector .
While support for iPod - style games ( low processor and graphics requirements ) wo n't impress hardcore gamers , the casual gaming world could be attracted to them .
What is far - fetched is the notion that Apple would build a gaming - only console , rather than some set top box that has gaming support as one feature among many .
The publisher support , the development framework , a market crying out for another console player — it 's all missing in action .
We do n't see Apple surviving in the big - budget segment of the gaming world .
Nevertheless , the filing can be interpreted as a sign that Apple intends to step up its involvement with gaming , which is really a no - brainer given the company 's success with handheld devices .
Most Muslims hope for better times with the non-Islamic world
The poll also suggested that most Europeans thought more interaction with Islam would be a threat - though most Americans disagreed .
WEF chairman Klaus Schwab said the poll pointed to " an alarmingly low level of optimism " over dialogue .
It surveyed about 1,000 people in each of 21 countries , mostly in mid-2007 .
The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum begins in Davos , Switzerland , on Wednesday .
Cartoon controversy
Respondents were asked how they thought relations were now and how they thought they would develop .
Describing the position now , majorities on both sides said they did not believe the two sides were getting along .
This belief was strongest in the US , Israel , Denmark - where the publication of cartoons about the Muslim Prophet Muhammad caused worldwide controversy - and among Palestinians .
WEF experts examining the poll data put this down to the effect of the Iraq war and the Middle East conflict .
By contrast , there was a less gloomy response in Saudi Arabia , Bangladesh and Pakistan .
According to WEF poll , neither the West nor the Muslim world believed the other side respected it .
But while Muslims said they believed their world did respect the West , Western respondents agreed that the West did not respect the Muslim world .
An alarmingly low level of optimism over dialogue
Klaus Schwab ,
World Economic Forum
Looking ahead , the poll paints a somewhat gloomy picture .
" In all but two countries surveyed ... a majority believed the interaction between Western and Islamic communities is getting worse , " said Mr Schwab .
Europeans apparently feared more interaction with Islam - according to the report , they saw it as a threat to their cultural identity .
But people in the US , Canada , Israel and the Muslim world said more contact would be a good thing .
" Although some might expect the United States , Israel and the Middle East to be more likely than Europe to be threatened by the ' other ' , the opposite is the case , " the report said .
But there are some rays of hope among the gloom :
Most respondents said they did not believe violent conflict was inevitable
Most respondents said the quality of the relationship between the West and the Muslim world was important to them personally
The WEF says the report is intended to be the first in a series tracking the state of relations between Islam and the West .
Gallup questioned about 1,000 people , mostly between March and September last year , in face - to - face and telephone interviews .
The results are published in a report on Muslim - Western relations for the World Economic Forum .
Countries polled were Bangladesh , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Denmark , Egypt , Indonesia , Iran , Israel , Italy , Malaysia , the Netherlands , the Palestinian Authority , Pakistan , Russia , Saudi Arabia , Singapore , Spain , Sweden , Turkey and the US .
Analyst asks “ what is torture but an application of terror ? ”
The United States Senate has blocked a bill earlier passed by the House of Representatives that would have banned the use of cruel and unusual punishment – well , torture – during the interrogations of terror suspects .
New York - based author and political analyst David Hungerford told PressTV he is n’t convinced this reflects the wishes of the general public , “ But I think we can come to the conclusion that George Bush himself endorses the torture of detainees . ”
Hungerford picked up quickly on my use of the phrase “ cruel and unusual punishment ” and noted it was a quotation from the 8th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which bans cruel and unusual punishments .
“ We got along with that provision for about 200 years until George Bush came along . ”
Hungerford said , “ Now Bush thinks he can ignore it . ”
Waterboarding and mock executions certainly fall into the category of cruel and unusual .
Hungerford said he does n’t find this a sign of strength on Bush ’s part , but rather it demonstrates the president ’s weak position over the destruction of the interrogation tapes .
“ I think at this point only one thing is clear , that George Bush does not want the people of the United States to see how he is defending them against – quote unquote – terror . ”

( FORTUNE Small Business ) -- Activists opposed to eBay's ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) upcoming fee and policy changes are readying for a weeklong site boycott starting on Monday , with buyers and sellers waiting to see if this strike will succeed where past protests have failed .
The boycott , planned to run Feb. 18 - 25 , is scheduled to overlap eBay 's Feb. 20 rollout of significant changes announced last month .
Sellers say eBay 's new policies are likely to cost them more money , but what 's really inspired an outpouring of wrath is an adjustment to eBay 's feedback system : sellers will no longer be able to leave negative commentary about their buyers .
Critics say that will leave sellers vulnerable to negligent bidders and scammers .
" You get bad buyers as often as you get bad sellers , " said M. Owens , a Severn , Md. - based seller of high - end dolls that typical go for several hundred dollars each .
On such an expensive transaction , having a buyer cause trouble - by , for example , disputing the transaction and requesting a credit - card chargeback after they 've already received their merchandise - can be financially devastating , she said .
Owens , who plans to participate in the boycott and avoid buying or selling on eBay next week , is also worried about the impact of a change to eBay 's " best match " search algorithm , one of the least - publicized aspects of the upcoming changes .
That search method , which will become eBay 's default next month , favors sellers with high and detailed customer - satisfaction ratings .
Low - volume sellers , like Owens , say this puts them at a disadvantage by burying their listings .
EBay spokesman Usher Lieberman said the company is taking a wait - and - see approach to the boycott talk
" At this point it 's still premature for us to speculate , " Lieberman said .
" We 're empathetic with our sellers and understand that they 're concerned , and that some of them object to some of the changes we 're implementing .
On the other hand , we think we have very good reasons for what we 're doing . "
EBay has no plans for listing - fee discounts or other special promotions next week to combat a potential boycott - related drop in listings , Lieberman said .
This week , eBay ran a one - day discounted listing fee special offer on Wednesday , a move that increased listings on the site that day from around 12 million to 16 million .
That special offer was not prompted by the groundswell of seller discontent about the upcoming changes , according to Lieberman .
" We should n't be reading anything into that , " he said .
" We 're always testing the price elasticity of our market . "
Whether or not the planned boycott will be successful in affecting eBay 's bottom line remains to be seen , but auction veterans say this degree of seller backlash to eBay fee hikes and other changes is unprecedented .
" I 've been getting about 400 e-mails an hour , " said Valerie Lennert , an Anaheim , Calif. , doll - clothing merchant who became an unofficial spokeswoman for the boycott after posting a call - to - arms video on Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) 's YouTube .
Past eBay boycott attempts have fizzled , and this one may too , Lennert acknowledged .
With millions of individuals selling on eBay , gaining critical mass for any organized action is extremely challenging .
But simply getting eBay 's attention is a worthy accomplishment , she said .
" There are a lot of people who are really upset , and if we choose to go somewhere else as a group , there wo n't be an eBay anymore , " she said .
" We do n't think eBay understands that .
They think they 're invincible , and they do n't seem to listen to what we need .
Even if listings do n't go down , we 're reached the main goal : to let them know how upset we are .
I 'm pretty sure they know that at this point . "

A magnetic field causes small single crystals along the struts to change length , which alters the macroscopic dimensions of the whole sample .
( See videos below . ) ×
Devices ranging from sonar to precision valves use materials that change shape when exposed to a magnetic field .
Now a team reports in the 14 December Physical Review Letters that it has developed a new material with a shape - change effect as large as any commercial material but potentially cheaper and lighter than others .
They created a porous foam of an alloy that was previously known but not very effective .
The porous form amplifies the shape - change effect , so the researchers believe it could be used in tiny motion control devices or pumps without mechanical parts .

Magnetic Shape Memory in Action .
A slab of Ni-Mn - Ga stretches and contracts in response to a changing magnetic field .
A nickel - manganese - gallium ( Ni -Mn - Ga ) sample contracts in the direction of an applied magnetic field and expands in a perpendicular direction .
When the field is turned off , the sample retains its new shape but will regain its original shape if the field is rotated 90 degrees .
First observed in 1996 , this so - called magnetic shape memory comes from a magnetically sensitive atomic structure .
Video courtesy of J. Enkovaara , Helsinki University of Technology .
A changing magnetic field ( H ) switches the twins between “ right - leaning ” and “ left leaning . ”
Imagine a two - dimensional crystal lattice made of parallelograms all “ leaning ” to the left , but above a certain horizontal line–called a twin boundary –the parallelograms all lean to the right .
This alternate leaning may repeat , with several layers of “ twins ” above the first pair , forming a zigzag pattern .
Each parallelogram has a magnetic moment , like a tiny bar magnet , pointing parallel to the tilted sides .
A magnetic field aligned with the right - leaning parallelograms switches the left - leaning ones into right - leaning and straightens out the zigzags , which lengthens the crystal along the new direction of alignment .
The twin flipping allows Ni-Mn - Ga crystals to elongate by 10 percent , the biggest magnetically - induced deformation–or “ strain ” –of any material .
But making large single crystals is a slow , expensive process , and it is n’t commercially viable .
It ’s easier to make so - called polycrystalline alloys , which contain many small , randomly oriented crystals , or “ grains , ” but boundaries between differently - oriented crystals restrict the twin motion , leading to very small strains .
David Dunand of Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , Peter Müllner of Boise State University in Idaho , and their colleagues have now increased the strain in polycrystalline Ni-Mn - Ga by nearly fifty times by introducing pores .
The team poured molten Ni-Mn - Ga into a chunk of porous sodium aluminate salt , and after cooling , they leached out the salt with acid .
They took samples of the “ foam ” left behind and exposed them to a 1 - Tesla magnetic field that rotated at 12,000 revolutions per minute , while a laser system measured the induced strain .
The team found the highest strain in their most porous sample ( 76 percent empty space ) , which deformed by as much as 0.12 percent in the rotating field .
The researchers attribute the improvement to the greater freedom for twin reorientation inside the foam , whose microstructure is an interconnected network of thin struts , each surrounded by empty space .
“ The struts become almost like single crystals , ” Dunand says .
Although the foam strain is 100 times less than that of Ni-Mn - Ga single crystals , the strain and millisecond response time are comparable to that of Terfenol D , whose magnetically - controlled vibration gives the ping in Navy sonar equipment and is used in audio devices .
Terfenol D–which changes shape by a different microscopic process–is an expensive material , so the team believes the foam could one day be a cheaper , lightweight alternative .
The porous structure could also work as a tiny biomedical pump that could squish fluid through it without the need for moving parts .
Vladimir Chernenko , of the Institute for Energetics and Interfaces in Lecco , Italy , believes this technological achievement –the first foam to exhibit magnetic shape memory –has great potential .
“ With further improvement of architecture , the performance can be increased , ” Chernenko says .
The authors will need to verify other mechanical properties of their material , but he thinks its large strain and small weight might make it useful for space - born applications .

The New York Times is to axe around 100 editorial jobs , cutting back a newsroom operation that has swelled to 1,332 staff .
Bill Keller , the paper 's executive editor , told staff yesterday that the title had its highest ever headcount , and that cuts would have to be made through contract buyouts , attrition and some lay - offs .
Despite some cutbacks at the title , editorial numbers have risen as the paper recruited heavily for its internet operation in recent years .
But growing financial concerns , including a 4.7 % drop in advertising revenue for the New York Times Company last year , have fuelled the decision to cut staff .
Shares in the company rose nearly 5 % after the announcement .
The New York Times ' own website reported that the paper 's editorial budget is around $ 200 m ( £ 102 m ) , of which about $ 3 m is spent on coverage of Iraq .
An extended US presidential campaign has also pushed editorial costs up .
" To meet our budget goals , we will have to do a little less , and every time we do less , we cede a bit of advantage , " Keller told staff .
" Our challenge will be to set our priorities in such a way that we do less in the areas that damage our competitiveness least . "
He said job cuts have been harder " because the low - hanging fruit is gone " .
The New York Times is the latest of several leading US newspapers to announce job cuts .
Los Angeles Times editor Jim O'Shea was fired in January for refusing to carry out editorial cuts , while parent company the Tribune newspaper group has announced that up to 150 jobs will go on the paper as part of 500 to be axed from the organisation nationwide .
Russ Stanton , who runs the LA Times website , was yesterday named as the paper 's new editor , replacing O'Shea .

Steve Gerber , 1947 - 2008
, a leading light in 1970s American comic books , a singular writer of odd and affecting comics for mainstream publishers , an advocate for and icon of creators rights , and the creator and co-creator of several characters including
Gerber was born in St. Louis in September , 1947 .
A comics fan as a youth , he began to correspond with legendary fanzine figures Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails at an early age .
He participated even more directly in the early fanzine movement by creating the publication Headline as a young teen .
He attended at school as the University of Missouri -- St. Louis and the University of Missouri , finishing his degree and doing some graduate work at St. Louis University .
He found early employment as a copywriter for a St. Louis advertising agent and wrote short stories at night .
Gerber became an associate editor at Marvel in 1972 through Roy Thomas , at a time in which the roles of writer and editor were blurry in that most of the editors , like prime Marvel mover Stan Lee and Thomas himself , were also writing books .
His initial page rate may have been as low as $ 13 a page .
Gerber began to find fill - in work on Marvel 's second - rung titles such as Sub - Mariner , Iron Man and Daredevil , branching out into more traditional assignments like Fantastic Four as well as stories for Marvel 's newer horror titles such as Creatures on the Loose and Chamber of Chills .
He began editing Marvel 's MAD knock - off Crazy with issue # 14 , and found a twist on the classic EC through Marvel formula of exaggerated glimpses of the comics ' creators by portraying himself and his fellow creators as straight - up crazy themselves .
A creative run on The Defenders featured one of the first deconstructions of the superhero idea and its conceptual nephew the superhero team concept that was actually done in the course of a narrative that also worked as an adventure story .
Gerber was a fruitful creator or co-collaborator for many other titles and characters , including but not limited to Morbius , the Living Vampire , the Guardians of the Galaxy , the Son of Satan , Tales of the Zombie , and Shanna the She - Devil .
Those concepts he did n't create he often fleshed out .
In many cases , his supporting characters were better known than the headliners , such as his title - jumping everyman , Richard Rory .
His scripts for Man- Thing , a classic swamp creature character of the kind that had been in comics since the 1940s , only this time portrayed as an empathic monster that used his burning touch on the fearful , are well - regarded even today for their concentration on psychological humor and touches of the absurd .
It was in building an unlikely cosmic odyssey for the shuffling muck creature that Gerber created his signature character , Howard the Duck .
Howard the Duck was an unlikely twist on another classic comics archetype : the anthropomorphic duck ( he would later wear pants after Disney threatened legal action , a story that if it's not true is better than truth ) .
In the course of the story being told with Man -Thing in Fear , Howard played a more utilitarian role .
His stepping forward from the bushes was put into the story to provide a weirder character introduction than the barbarian ( Korrek ) Gerber and Val Mayerik had just debuted by having him pop out from a can of peanut butter .
A classic straight - talker slightly out of step with the time , an archetype that appears a lot in 1970s pop culture but never more effectively , Howard 's debut proved popular enough with fans for Gerber and Marvel to bring him back , first in a short story or two , then in his own comic .
Imbued with an underground comix sensibility but as overground as the spinner rack at your local supermarket , Howard became a mini-sensation , allowing Gerber and his collaborators the opportunity to use a classic outsider character to riff on the ridiculous excesses of that decade 's pop culture landscape : kung fu , the moonies , self - help gurus , Anita Bryant , KISS , religious fundamentalism , and Star Wars among them .
It also turned out to be a perfect vehicle for Gerber 's acerbic worldview , and in some of the best comics , such as when Howard ran for President -- something Marvel milked for all it was worth in terms of mainstream coverage -- Gerber turned his comic into maybe the most formally daring book ever put on the market by one of the big two publishers .
Howard would eventually spawn a newspaper strip , which Gerber initially wrote , and a film version in 1986 by American Graffiti collaborators George Lucas , Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz that has gone down in history as one of the all - time Hollywood bombs .
Gerber had only a minimal amount to do with that project and , truth be told , the resulting film had nothing to do with Gerber .
Another fondly remembered title , Omega the Unknown , came about in partnership with the writer Mary Skrenes and the long - time industry veteran Jim Mooney .
It was many things : an odd but extremely affecting meditation on childhood as it rubs up against some of the sadder and isolating elements of adulthood , an out of the corner of one 's eye snapshot of the post - Kirby Marvel Universe , a walking tour of Gerber 's own Hell 's Kitchen neighborhood and another dissection of the superhero .
The briefly - lived comic series gained much of its power through Gerber and Skrenes ' modern , even arch take on comic book writing dancing in and among Mooney 's classic , square - jawed comic book dynamics .
Although there were admirable attempts to resolve the character 's story by other creators once the series had been canceled , the resolution desired by Gerber and Skrenes apparently never saw publication .
A currently ongoing re-telling of the story with additional layers by writers Jonathan Lethem and Karl Rusnak working with artist Farel Dalrymple has put the character back into the consciousness of comics fans , although there were complaints after the project 's announcement that Gerber and Skrenes should have been given a chance to tell their story either additionally or instead of this new effort .
As with Howard , there has never been a comic book quite like it .
Gerber left Marvel in either 1978 or 1979 , and immediately entered into dispute with the publisher over the Howard the Duck character he created a few years earlier .
In a letter that appeared in The Comics Journal # 41 , Gerber explained his situation to that magazine 's editor , Gary Groth : " I was dismissed from the Howard the Duck newspaper strip in a manner which violated the terms of my written agreement with Marvel .
Marvel was advised that I was contemplating legal action which would likely result in my ownership of the Howard the Duck character and all rights therein .
As a consequence of the notice given Marvel by my lawyers , the company chose to terminate my contract on the comic books as well .
Marvel 's action was not unanticipated , and my only regret is that , for a while at least , the Duck and I will be traveling separate paths . "
In an interview that followed the publication of that letter , Gerber painted what was at the time a startling picture of the mainstream comics industries , its rivalries and petty jealousies , and what he described as a plantation system in terms of how the talent was treated by the corporations .
" What disgusts me even more , though , is that I think the writers and artists have largely brought this on themselves , " he told Groth in 1978 .
" They do n't want to know about the business end of comics .
They prefer to remain ignorant .
They 've allowed the publishers to convince them that they 're a bunch of no - talent bums surviving on the goodwill of the companies .
Very few people in this industry really believe that their work has any artistic merit , or that it 's sale - able elsewhere .
Or that they deserve more than they 're getting .
You will actually hear them defend the publishers ' ownership of their creations , the low page rates , the cowardice of the companies to explore new markets .
That 's why it 's startling when someone like Gil Kane or Neal Adams or Don McGregor or Barry Smith -- or Steve Gerber -- shoots his mouth off .
People in the industry find it disturbing that one of their number might actually take his work seriously , take pride not only in being fast and dependable , but in the work itself . "
Steve Gerber did not win back Howard the Duck .
He settled with Marvel and even returned to the company by the mid-1980s , although not in as devoted or prolific a fashion .
Although the terms of the settlement were sealed , he told Art Cover in 1985 that , " It 's no secret how mad I was during and before the lawsuit .
The terms of the settlement are such that I am no longer angry . "
As part of the protracted legal battle , Gerber and the legendary Marvel Comics creator Jack Kirby created the lead feature in an anthology sharing the name
The notions that Marvel would take a character away from a creator , even the one best suited to it , and that a creator might fight back , became powerful ideas among a growing tide of younger creators asserting a series of creators ' rights in regards to their work with big , mainstream comic book companies or their moves to smaller companies or self - publishing where rights might be attained .
One element of the cautionary story was that Marvel was more interested in keeping and controlling the character than it was in fostering a relationship with the creator , even when the benefits were obvious to both .
Also , the fact that Gerber had created Howard in an offhand manner but that the character had come to be a valuable mouthpiece for the creator became a key part of the thinking of a lot of creators rights advocates , and spoke as a powerful counter to an argument often expressed that some characters you created for the big companies and some characters you kept for yourself .
As many have cautioned in a thousand hushed conversations since , you never know .
The remainder of Gerber 's comics career was devoted to primarily mini-series and a few short runs on series comics .
He had worked sporadically for DC Comics and Hanna - Barbera even while still at Marvel .
He created the early graphic novel Stewart the Rat for Eclipse .
An Epic Comic series refashioning a Hawkman proposal became the sex and violence - filled Void Indigo , one of the first comics to run afoul of the hands - on series of single proprietors approach that drove growing Direct Market network of stores in that , as Gerber put it , " Certain distributors themselves , personally , found it objectionable . "
This was also an opinion shared by some retailers and a few comics reviewers .
He would write Howard the Duck again , a series starring his Foolkiller character , and pen a number of stories for the anthology magazine Marvel Comics Presents .
Gerber was one of the veteran writers brought on board by the then enormously successful Image creators to provide some scripting stability for a title or two , and he was in the group of writers that created a superhero line at Malibu , eventually sold to Marvel .
His Nevada was the last after Stewart the Rat and Omega the Unknown in a series of comics that were as much about a place as they were a set of characters , an under - appreciated aspect to his career and something he did as well as any writer to work in comics .
One of his last notable creations was the superhero - in - prison saga Hard Time at DC Comics .
He was at the time of his passing working on a revival of the difficult Dr. Fate character .
Gerber 's main vocation during the 1980s and its sporadic comics output was as an animation writer and story editor , working for such successful franchises as Dungeons and Dragons , GI Joe , Thundarr , Transformers , Mr. T and The New Batman Adventures .
It was in that role that he was famously parodied during the period of antagonism between himself and Marvel , in Marvel Secret Wars II # 1 , a comic book that Gerber said later he enjoyed .
Gerber had in recent months
Steve Gerber 's role as one of the best and emblematic writers of his generation can't be overstated .
He was a crucial figure in comics history .
Like some of the all - time great cartoonists of years past , Gerber carved a place for self - expression and meaning out of a type of comic that had no right to hold within itself so many things and moments that were that quirky and offbeat and delicately realized -- except that Gerber made it so .
His Howard the Duck comics remain amusing when read today , perhaps more poignant now , laying into their broad targets in a way that communicated a kind of critical consciousness into the minds of many devoted superhero comics readers , fans that simply would n't have been exposed to those kinds of ideas any other way , the concept that media might lie to you , the notion of absolute self - worth in the face of a world that seems dead - set against it .
Steve Gerber 's superhero books were a tonic to the over - seriousness of most of their cousins , and his horror - adventure books were frequently classy and reserved in a genre that tends to reward the blunt and ugly .
No creator save Jack Kirby has as a cautionary tale and a living example saved so many creators the grief of turning over their creations without reward or without realizing what they had done .
Few creators in the American mainstream were as consistently fascinating as Steve Gerber .
Even fewer have been as outspoken and forthright , or in that way , as admirable .
" I would n't describe myself as fearless , but I think you have to accept the possibility of failure if you want to achieve anything , in any field . " -- Steve Gerber , 1985

Gerber became an associate editor at Marvel in 1972 through Roy Thomas , at a time in which the roles of writer and editor were blurry in that most of the editors , like prime Marvel mover Stan Lee and Thomas himself , were also writing books .
His initial page rate may have been as low as $ 13 a page .
Gerber began to find fill - in work on Marvel 's second - rung titles such asand , branching out into more traditional assignments likeas well as stories for Marvel 's newer horror titles such asand .
He began editing Marvel 'sknock - of fwith issue # 14 , and found a twist on the classic EC through Marvel formula of exaggerated glimpses of the comics ' creators by portraying himself and his fellow creators as straight - up crazy themselves .
A creative run onfeatured one of the first deconstructions of the superhero idea and its conceptual nephew the superhero team concept that was actually done in the course of a narrative that also worked as an adventure story .
Gerber was a fruitful creator or co-collaborator for many other titles and characters , including but not limited to Morbius , the Living Vampire , the Guardians of the Galaxy , the Son of Satan , , and Shanna the She - Devil .
Those concepts he did n't create he often fleshed out .
In many cases , his supporting characters were better known than the headliners , such as his title - jumping everyman , Richard Rory .
His scripts for , a classic swamp creature character of the kind that had been in comics since the 1940s , only this time portrayed as an empathic monster that used his burning touch on the fearful , are well - regarded even today for their concentration on psychological humor and touches of the absurd .
It was in building an unlikely cosmic odyssey for the shuffling muck creature that Gerber created his signature character , Howard the Duck .
Howard the Duck was an unlikely twist on another classic comics archetype : the anthropomorphic duck ( he would later wear pants after Disney threatened legal action , a story that if it's not true is better than truth ) .
In the course of the story being told with Man - Thing in , Howard played a more utilitarian role .
His stepping forward from the bushes was put into the story to provide a weirder character introduction than the barbarian ( Korrek ) Gerber and Val Mayerik had just debuted by having him pop out from a can of peanut butter .
A classic straight - talker slightly out of step with the time , an archetype that appears a lot in 1970s pop culture but never more effectively , Howard 's debut proved popular enough with fans for Gerber and Marvel to bring him back , first in a short story or two , then in his own comic .
Imbued with an underground comix sensibility but as overground as the spinner rack at your local supermarket , Howard became a mini-sensation , allowing Gerber and his collaborators the opportunity to use a classic outsider character to riff on the ridiculous excesses of that decade 's pop culture landscape : kung fu , the moonies , self - help gurus , Anita Bryant , KISS , religious fundamentalism , andamong them .
It also turned out to be a perfect vehicle for Gerber 's acerbic worldview , and in some of the best comics , such as when Howard ran for President -- something Marvel milked for all it was worth in terms of mainstream coverage -- Gerber turned his comic into maybe the most formally daring book ever put on the market by one of the big two publishers .
Howard would eventually spawn a newspaper strip , which Gerber initially wrote , and a film version in 1986 bycollaborators George Lucas , Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz that has gone down in history as one of the all - time Hollywood bombs .
Gerber had only a minimal amount to do with that project and , truth be told , the resulting film had nothing to do with Gerber .
Another fondly remembered title , , came about in partnership with the writer Mary Skrenes and the long - time industry veteran Jim Mooney .
It was many things : an odd but extremely affecting meditation on childhood as it rubs up against some of the sadder and isolating elements of adulthood , an out of the corner of one 's eye snapshot of the post - Kirby Marvel Universe , a walking tour of Gerber 's own Hell 's Kitchen neighborhood and another dissection of the superhero .
The briefly - lived comic series gained much of its power through Gerber and Skrenes ' modern , even arch take on comic book writing dancing in and among Mooney 's classic , square - jawed comic book dynamics .
Although there were admirable attempts to resolve the character 's story by other creators once the series had been canceled , the resolution desired by Gerber and Skrenes apparently never saw publication .
A currently ongoing re-telling of the story with additional layers by writers Jonathan Lethem and Karl Rusnak working with artist Farel Dalrymple has put the character back into the consciousness of comics fans , although there were complaints after the project 's announcement that Gerber and Skrenes should have been given a chance to tell their story either additionally or instead of this new effort .
As with , there has never been a comic book quite like it .
Gerber left Marvel in either 1978 or 1979 , and immediately entered into dispute with the publisher over the Howard the Duck character he created a few years earlier .
In a letter that appeared in # 41 , Gerber explained his situation to that magazine 's editor , Gary Groth : " I was dismissed from thenewspaper strip in a manner which violated the terms of my written agreement with Marvel .
Marvel was advised that I was contemplating legal action which would likely result in my ownership of the Howard the Duck character and all rights therein .
As a consequence of the notice given Marvel by my lawyers , the company chose to terminate my contract on the comic books as well .
Marvel 's action was not unanticipated , and my only regret is that , for a while at least , the Duck and I will be traveling separate paths . "
In an interview that followed the publication of that letter , Gerber painted what was at the time a startling picture of the mainstream comics industries , its rivalries and petty jealousies , and what he described as a plantation system in terms of how the talent was treated by the corporations .
" What disgusts me even more , though , is that I think the writers and artists have largely brought this on themselves , " he told Groth in 1978 .
" They do n't want to know about the business end of comics .
They prefer to remain ignorant .
They 've allowed the publishers to convince them that they 're a bunch of no - talent bums surviving on the goodwill of the companies .
Very few people in this industry really believe that their work has any artistic merit , or that it 's sale - able elsewhere .
Or that they deserve more than they 're getting .
You will actually hear them defend the publishers ' ownership of their creations , the low page rates , the cowardice of the companies to explore new markets .
That 's why it 's startling when someone like Gil Kane or Neal Adams or Don McGregor or Barry Smith -- or Steve Gerber -- shoots his mouth off .
People in the industry find it disturbing that one of their number might actually take his work seriously , take pride not only in being fast and dependable , but in the work itself .
" Steve Gerber did not win back Howard the Duck .
He settled with Marvel and even returned to the company by the mid-1980s , although not in as devoted or prolific a fashion .
Although the terms of the settlement were sealed , he told Art Cover in 1985 that , " It 's no secret how mad I was during and before the lawsuit .
The terms of the settlement are such that I am no longer angry . "
As part of the protracted legal battle , Gerber and the legendary Marvel Comics creator Jack Kirby created the lead feature in an anthology sharing the name Destroyer Duck , from Eclipse , with proceeds from various professionals doing stories going to Gerber 's war chest .
As Mark Evanier points out in his memorial post regarding Gerber , there was no shortage of professionals willing to contribute .
" People did that because they knew , first of all , that Steve was fighting not just for his own financial reasons but for matters of principle relating to how the comic book industry treated its creators . "
The Gerber / Kirby feature is fondly remembered as comics apart from its industry implications .
Marvel was satirized in the comic as Godcorp , the merciless corporation that exploited and then killed Destroyer Duck 's best friend in a blunt swipe at Marvel 's treatment of Gerber 's Howard .
That character would go on to make brief appearances in future comic books from Marvel and Image , and the original material is to be collected by Image Comics .
The notions that Marvel would take a character away from a creator , even the one best suited to it , and that a creator might fight back , became powerful ideas among a growing tide of younger creators asserting a series of creators ' rights in regards to their work with big , mainstream comic book companies or their moves to smaller companies or self - publishing where rights might be attained .
One element of the cautionary story was that Marvel was more interested in keeping and controlling the character than it was in fostering a relationship with the creator , even when the benefits were obvious to both .
Also , the fact that Gerber had created Howard in an offhand manner but that the character had come to be a valuable mouthpiece for the creator became a key part of the thinking of a lot of creators rights advocates , and spoke as a powerful counter to an argument often expressed that some characters you created for the big companies and some characters you kept for yourself .
As many have cautioned in a thousand hushed conversations since , you never know .
The remainder of Gerber 's comics career was devoted to primarily mini-series and a few short runs on series comics .
He had worked sporadically for DC Comics and Hanna - Barbera even while still at Marvel .
He created the early graphic novelfor Eclipse .
An Epic Comic series refashioning aproposal became the sex and violence - filled , one of the first comics to run afoul of the hands - on series of single proprietors approach that drove growing Direct Market network of stores in that , as Gerber put it , " Certain distributors themselves , personally , found it objectionable . "
This was also an opinion shared by some retailers and a few comics reviewers .
He would writeagain , a series starring his Foolkiller character , and pen a number of stories for the anthology magazine .
Gerber was one of the veteran writers brought on board by the then enormously successful Image creators to provide some scripting stability for a title or two , and he was in the group of writers that created a superhero line at Malibu , eventually sold to Marvel .
Hiswas the last afterandin a series of comics that were as much about a place as they were a set of characters , an under - appreciated aspect to his career and something he did as well as any writer to work in comics .
One of his last notable creations was the superhero - in - prison sagaat DC Comics .
He was at the time of his passing working on a revival of the difficult Dr. Fate character .
Gerber 's main vocation during the 1980s and its sporadic comics output was as an animation writer and story editor , working for such successful franchises asand .
It was in that role that he was famously parodied during the period of antagonism between himself and Marvel , in #1 , a comic book that Gerber said later he enjoyed .
Gerber had in recent months turned to blogging as many writers in the industry have , talking openly and honestly about his various projects , his state of mind and his declining health .
It was there that first indications he may have passed were posted , in the commentary thread under Gerber 's last entry .
Steve Gerber 's role as one of the best and emblematic writers of his generation can't be overstated .
He was a crucial figure in comics history .
Like some of the all - time great cartoonists of years past , Gerber carved a place for self - expression and meaning out of a type of comic that had no right to hold within itself so many things and moments that were that quirky and offbeat and delicately realized -- except that Gerber made it so .
Hiscomics remain amusing when read today , perhaps more poignant now , laying into their broad targets in a way that communicated a kind of critical consciousness into the minds of many devoted superhero comics readers , fans that simply would n't have been exposed to those kinds of ideas any other way , the concept that media might lie to you , the notion of absolute self - worth in the face of a world that seems dead - set against it .
Steve Gerber 's superhero books were a tonic to the over - seriousness of most of their cousins , and his horror - adventure books were frequently classy and reserved in a genre that tends to reward the blunt and ugly .
No creator save Jack Kirby has as a cautionary tale and a living example saved so many creators the grief of turning over their creations without reward or without realizing what they had done .
Few creators in the American mainstream were as consistently fascinating as Steve Gerber .
Even fewer have been as outspoken and forthright , or in that way , as admirable .
" I would n't describe myself as fearless , but I think you have to accept the possibility of failure if you want to achieve anything , in any field . " -- Steve Gerber , 1985
Leona Lewis helped boost online music downloads
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) said although downloads rose by 40 % in 2007 , losses are still being made .
The organisation blames music piracy for the shortfall .
It is calling on internet providers to disconnect people who repeatedly download illegally .
' Significant milestone '
In November French President Nicholas Sarkozy backed an industry agreement which could make internet providers block customers involved in piracy .
IFPI chief John Kennedy called the idea " the most significant milestone yet in the task of curbing piracy on the internet " .
In Belgium last year a court ordered the internet provider Tiscali to block users from file sharing .
" If the internet service providers played their role it would have a dramatic effect , " said Kennedy .
More and more people are downloading music
" Unpaid copying and downloading lies at the root of the recording industry 's problems , and internet service providers must be at the heart of the solution , " said Geoff Taylor , chief executive of industry body the BPI .
" 2008 must become the year when talk becomes action . "
Eammon Forde , editor of music business and strategy magazine Five Eight , does not think the shift in the music business is all down to one issue .
" Obviously piracy is playing a part , but also there 's competition from other entertainment sectors and consumers are n't as loyal to artists as they used to be , " he said .
" Digital has opened things up .
It 's made consumers more able to access more music , " he added .
Mr Forde believes the decline in physical sales is not a new thing .
" This is something that has been talked about for a number of years , " he said .
" Physicals have been on decline on average year - on - year since 1999 and 2000 .
The physical market is in freefall , both in terms of units and in terms of value , " he added .
Earlier this month the music industry body the BPI revealed album sales in the UK alone suffered a drop of nearly 11 % in 2007 .
It blamed the drop on copyright theft and difficult retail conditions , but added that sales were still 26 % higher than a decade ago .
Regardless , recyclers say that from their vantage point it ’s obvious that most phones are retired because of psychological , not technological , obsolescence .
“ There ’s some fashion driving all of this and , by its nature , fashion is not eternal , ” says Mark Donovan of M: Metrics , which tracks the wireless industry .
Phones were initially an afterthought , given out free so that customers had something to talk into after buying the real product , the service contract .
But carriers learned , as Donovan puts it , that “ if you deliver something cool , and if it ’s a bit of a status symbol , people will pony up and pay cash for it . ”
He adds : “ People want them to become more than an awkward gadget .
People want it to be an expression of their personalities . ”
Right now , there are roughly 470 models of phone for sale in the United States .
About 16 new ones come out every month .
Many are only slightly altered versions of existing phones , suggesting how easily we get bored  how we ’ll crave something that slides , say , instead of flips open .
( There are currently 46 styles of Motorola Razr ; Motorola has , in fact , projected which colors and finishes we ’ll find most attractive through the year 2009 . )
And we have the perfect incentive to get whatever we want every two years when our contracts are up and the discounts for new phones roll around .
When I asked Iain Gillott , an analyst with iGR , what makes a person get a new phone , he told me , “ They ’re cruising through the Sunday paper , and they see a fabulous phone for 50 bucks and they say , ‘ Well , I have n’t had a new one in 18 months . ’ ”
Gillott estimates 50 to 60 percent of phones are replaced “ because people get tired of the design . ”
Otherwise , consumers want a new feature  even , it seems , if there ’s no real need for it ; according to M: Metrics , 82 percent of those with Internet - enabled phones do not go online .
Steven Herbst , a psychology researcher at Motorola , told me : “ All that pressure to have the latest  something that people will be impressed by  is compounded by the fact that all of a sudden somebody is doing something with their mobile phone that you ca n’t do . ”
In other words , it ’s because we ’ve made phones such deep and indispensable extensions of ourselves that we dump them so quickly .
Who can bear seeing himself as even slightly outdated or incapable ?
“ Somewhere during the last 100 years , we learned to find refuge outside the species , in the silent embrace of manufactured objects , ” Jonathan Chapman , a young product designer and theorist at the University of Brighton , writes in his book “ Emotionally Durable Design . ”
But designers and consumers have snared themselves in an unsustainable trap , Chapman told me , since our affection for many high - tech objects is tied exclusively to their newness .
“ The mobile phone occupies a kind of glossy , scratch - free world , ” he says .
Whereas a pair of jeans gains character over time , a phone does no such thing .
“ As soon you purchase it , you can only watch it migrating further away from what it is you want  a glossy , scratch - free object . ”
You might leave the plastic film over the display for a few days , just so you can take it off later and “ give yourself a second honeymoon with the phone , ” he says .
But ultimately everything that first attracted you to it only deteriorates .
You start looking at it differently .
“ It ’s made of some kind of sparkle - finished polymer and it ’s got some decent curves on it , but so what ?
The intimacy comes more from the fact that , within that hand - held piece of plastic , exists your whole world ”  your friends ’ phone numbers , your digital pictures , your music  and that stuff can be easily transferred to a new one .
So you “ fall out of love ” with the phone , Chapman says .
Even the most idealistic visions of how e-waste should be recycled and reused take for granted that consumers and businesses will never reconsider why we are buying and discarding so many of those products , so quickly , in the first place .
If the rush of castoffs is n’t likely to stop , we need to clear a proper path for it , considering all the inevitable compromises and costs along the way and delivering those products to as consequenceless a place as possible .
There is no heaven for cellphones .
Wherever they go , it seems that something , somewhere , to some extent always ends up being damaged or depleted .
The only heaven I came across was what Chapman described .
It is an image in our heads  not of a place where we can send a used phone but one where we imagine each device when it ’s brand - new , right before we first get our hands on it .
That illusion of perfection , no matter how many times we see it spoiled , will always lure us into buying the next new phone and sending the last one careering on its way .
After a careful investigation , I have decided against seeking a recount in New Hampshire .
I am confident that not asking for a recount is the right decision .
I carefully considered the arguments for and against a recount before instructing my campaign staff not to pursue it .
Without a firm belief that vote fraud had taken place , and without the possibility that a recount would have increased the chances for success of our campaign , a recount would have diverted campaign resources , time , and energy away from crucial battles elsewhere .
We have taken concerns about vote fraud seriously .
In Iowa , campaign volunteers carefully monitored the caucuses .
Campaign staff placed Paul supporters in every precinct to watch and verify the voting and count .
We had supporters phone in results from their precincts to a campaign hotline while others ensured that those numbers were reflected on the official display board at the Polk County Convention Center .
The numbers our caucus watchers reported agreed with the official tally , and both results also aligned with the campaign ’s internal polling .
In relatively pro-Paul counties , our sampling pegged support at 11.5 % .
This is consistent with an overall 10 % finish for the entire state .
In New Hampshire , while I would have hoped for a better result than eight percent , I am convinced that vote fraud played no role in this result .
Rumors of vote fraud were investigated , and in the end they proved to be the result of errors in early media reports that were not reflected in the official numbers .
In one notable case , when a campaign staff member contacted an individual who had on the evening of January 8 claimed that his vote had not been counted , the person said that he had made a mistake and that the next morning the error in reporting on a newspaper website had been corrected both in the media and -- most importantly -- in the official tally .
Many have expressed concerns that those ballots counted by machine yielded a 2 % lower total than those counted by hand .
However , machine counted vote totals were more than 2 % lower for both John McCain and Mike Huckabee .
Hand counted votes were more likely to be cast in rural areas .
Results almost always vary between urban and rural areas .
My campaign staff and I have analyzed the numbers in New Hampshire and I have reached the conclusion that it was the high turnout -- not vote fraud or counting errors -- that left us with eight percent of the vote .
Our total vote count of over 18,000 votes was well within what we projected given the efforts of our extensive statewide get - out - the - vote program , giving me no reason to believe that vote fraud played any role in the results of the Granite State 's primary .
In both Iowa and New Hampshire there is much to be proud of .
Taking both states together , I am honored that over 30,000 people cast their vote for me -- more than either Rudy Giuliani or Fred Thompson .
Unlike many other candidates ’ efforts , our campaign for freedom is growing and our message is spreading .
Now is the time to redouble our efforts .
Our resources must be spent on the upcoming primaries and caucuses , and on ensuring that , with your help , we organize every state yet to vote with our Precinct Leaders program .
We can't win primaries and caucuses that have already happened -- but we can win those yet to come .
To become the Republican presidential nominee , a candidate must have 1,191 delegates .
Iowa , Wyoming and New Hampshire determined only 32 delegates , so we have much opportunity remaining .
Today , I ask you to join me in focusing on the battles ahead as we continue our fight for liberty and our Constitution .
Sincerely ,
Ron Paul
I was born in what the local rulers represented to be the sovereign state of Oklahoma .
This circumstance was not my fault .
I suppose I might blame my parents , but they had a similar excuse , my father having been born in the same jurisdiction and my mother having been brought there as an infant .
In any event , by virtue of my birthplace , I became a citizen of that state and , as such , I bore a heavy burden of misfortune .
Our part of Oklahoma , you see , was not exactly at the cutting edge of economic and social development in those days .
Good jobs were not easy to find , and even a resourceful workingman who was willing to labor long and hard , as my father was , could not earn much .
Many of the schools were primitive .
When I began the first grade , in 1950 , the school comprised about fifty students in grades 18 .
My first - grade class met in a little shack along with the second - grade class , while the rest of the students met in a larger , one - room building with a removable divider in the middle of the room .
With the divider put in place , grades 3 5 met on one side of it , grades 68 on the other side .
Three teachers made up the entire staff , except for the cook , who happened to be my mom .
I wont say that I couldnt possibly have remained in that environment and still become an astronaut .
Maybe I could have .
But the odds did not look promising .
For a time during the war , when I was an infant , my father had taken the family to Portland , Oregon , where he worked in one of Kaisers shipyards as a welder until the war ended .
So he had tasted the sweet nectar of West Coast wages .
Of course , after the war , such elevated wages were no longer available for the asking , yet West Coast wages still stood well above those in Oklahoma , as my father knew from the accounts of friends who had migrated to California earlier and sent back glowing reports .
In 1951 , a old friend of my fathers who worked on a ranch near Mendota , California , a dusty little town 35 miles west of Fresno , arranged for the ranch owner to hire my father and my older brother as tractor drivers during the summermy father had several months of accumulated vacation time .
So the family packed a few of our belongings and headed west on Route 66 , as so many Okies before us had done during the previous twenty years .
Reaching our destination at the Encher Ranch , we moved into a small living area walled off at the end of a larger structure built originally as a bunkhouse for immigrant Japanese workers before the war .
There was no extra charge for the outdoor toilets and showers .
In those days , such labor camps dotted the San Joaquin Valley thickly , housing not only the migrant Okies , Texans , and other wretched refuse of the Dust Bowl , but also an abundance of migrant Mexicans .
A sprinkling of Italians , Portuguese , Basque , Chinese , and Japanese spiced the areas population .
At the end of the summer , my fathers work having proved more than satisfactory to the employer , and the wages more than satisfactory to my father , we returned briefly to Oklahoma , arranged for the shipment of our household belongings , such as they were , and moved back to California permanently .
Lest you wonder about the point of this mundane little narrative , I hasten to emphasize that my father had done something quite remarkable : he had left the sovereign state of Oklahoma , crossed the sovereign states of Texas , New Mexico , and Arizona , and entered into and established permanent residence in the sovereign state of California , all without the permission of any of the rulers of these states .
Imagine that !
Ho-hum , you say ; any American can do the same whenever he wants .
Well , yes , that s true .
But Americans can do so only because the sovereign states that belong to the federal umbrella state known as the United States of America have worked out a system of essentially unimpeded cross - border passages , and their laws recognize that in general anyone with permission from the U.S. authorities to be in the United States may move freely within the constituent states of the union .
No law forbade my father to leave Oklahoma without approval by the Oklahoma government , and no law forbade him to enter California without approval by the California government .
( Earlier , in 1937 , California did enact a statute that became known as the anti-Okie law ,  aimed at preventing certain Americans from entering the state , but the law was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1941 in Edwards v. California [ 314 U.S. 160 ] . )
Many of the Mexican children with whom I grew up might have told a tale similar to mine .
The only difference would have been that for them , the origin of their migration to California happened to be not one of the states of the United States of America , commonly known as America , but one of the states of the United Mexican States , commonly known as Mexico .
Was this difference important ?
If so , why ?
Do the lines that government officials draw on maps sever the heart of humanity ?
It may not be entirely beside the point to note that the area in which my family settled in 1951 had previously been part of Mexico , from the time of Mexicos independence until its leaders were coerced into signing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , which ended what the Mexicans aptly call la Intervención Norteamericana ( the War of North American Invasion ) .
As the spoils of this war , the U.S. government snatched not only the whole of present - day California , but also all of present - day Nevada and Utah , most of present - day Arizona , and substantial parts of present - day New Mexico , Colorado , and Wyoming .
Recall this history the next time you hear someone talking about the current Mexican invasion of the United States .
If only the Americans under General Winfield Scotts command in 1847 had invaded Vera Cruz to pick lettuce , rather than to kill the local people .
To return to my story , however , the undeserved misfortunate that many of my childhood comrades suffered sprang from the simple , morally irrelevant fact that the government officials who ruled the states of Sonora , Chihuahua , Coahuila , and others included in the thirty - one states of the Mexican union had not entered into the same agreement that the government officials who ruled Oklahoma , Texas , California , and others included in the ( then ) forty - eight states of the United States of America had made with regard to state border crossings .
From time to time , people of my acquaintance were rounded up and deported , as if they were criminals .
What was their crime ?
Picking cotton ?
If so , then I was guilty , too , because when I was growing up , many of the ranchers had yet to switch from Okies and Mexicans to mechanical pickers , and by the time I was eleven or twelve years old , I could fill a 12 - foot sack and , having weighed my pickings , haul it up the ladder like a man to empty its contents into the cotton trailer .
So far as I was ever aware , the deportations pleased nobody : neither the unlucky individuals wrenched from their homes and places of employment ; nor the ranchers and other business owners who readily hired these hardworking people ; nor the rest of us , whose relations with the Mexicans were generally cooperative and cordial .
La Migra the immigration officers was like a natural disaster .
These obnoxious state functionaries descended on the community like a plague or a swarm of locusts , benefiting no one , yet collecting salaries at public expense for their mischief .
I knew one young man who was deported several times , and each time he returned after a short while .
He took special offense at these costly disruptions of his life because , in fact , he had been born in California , but he lacked official documentation of his birthplace .
If you are not familiar with immigration enforcement , heres an introduction , for which we are indebted to Pat Mora , whose poem  La Migra begins :
Lets play La Migra
Ill be the Border Patrol .
You be the Mexican maid .
I get the badge and sunglasses .
You can hide and run ,
but you cant get away
because I have a jeep .
I can take you wherever
I want , but dont ask
questions because
I dont speak Spanish .
I can touch you wherever
I want but dont complain
too much because Ive got
boots and kick if I have to ,
and I have handcuffs .
Oh , and a gun .
Get ready , get set , run .
Anti-immigrationists often say that the Mexicans come here only to go on welfare .
Aside from this declarations manifest misrepresentation of the truth , one wonders why the obvious remedy for this alleged problem does not occur to them : get rid of welfare after all , nobody , regardless of his place of birth , has a just right to live at other peoples coerced expense .
Others claim that the illegals crowd the public schools and hospitals , sucking resources away from the taxpayers .
If so , then the answer is the same : get the government out of the business of schooling and healing ; it ought never to have gone there in the first place .
Some Americans clothe their hatred with the charge that the foreigners who come here commit crimes , such as selling drugs and conducting businesses without a license .
Of course , drug peddling and working without a government license ought never to have been criminalized in the first place , for anybody , because these acts violate no ones just rights .
If people are worried about real crimes , such as robbery and murder , they need to recall that laws against these crimes already exist , and no special preemptive war against potential immigrant offenders can be justified , any more than I can justify nuking Philadelphia today on the strength of my absolute conviction that some residents of that city will commit serious crimes tomorrow .
I attended public schools in California from the second grade until my graduation from high school , and later , after a year at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy , I attended institutions of public higher education there , graduating from San Francisco State College in 1965 and then attending the University of California at Santa Barbara for a year of graduate study before going on to greener pastures at Johns Hopkins ( a so - called private university whose entanglements with the Pentagon youd best not look into , if you wish to retain your faith in  private universities ) .
Whether my father paid any more in taxes to the state of California , its subsidiary governments , and the school district than our Mexican neighbors paid I greatly doubt .
Everybody , regardless of his birthplace or documentation , paid excise , gasoline , and general sales taxes whenever he made certain purchases .
Everybody , regardless of his birthplace or documentation , paid the property tax ( indirectly ) whenever he rented a house or apartment .
Everybody , regardless of his birthplace or documentation , paid fees for drivers licenses , hunting licenses , bridge tolls , and other privileges the state graciously permitted the peasantry to enjoy for a price .
Of course , because my father never earned an enormous salary , he might well have paid less in taxes than the cost of my education in the California schools ; who knows ?
If so , should I have been kicked out of the state and deportedsent , as they say , back where [ I ] came from ?
Was my family sponging off the longsuffering taxpayers of California any less than the Mexican family down the road from us ?
And what difference does it make where the sponger comes from ?
Is nt the sponging itself the heart of the matter ?
Do the self - styled  Minutemen who undertook recently to secure the border with Mexico swat only the mosquitos that have hatched on the south side of the Rio Grande ?
If we must choose and indeed we must between the worlds most powerful and aggressive state , on the one hand , and a man who wishes to move to Yakima to support his family by picking apples , on the other hand , which side does human decency dictate that we choose ?
Unfortunately , in this situation , it is all too plain that many Americans are choosing to worship the state and to make a fetish of the borders it has established by patently unjust means .
As for this wandering Okie , Id sooner prostrate myself before a golden calf .

It is remarkable , wonderful , absolutely worth your attention .
The book is , most simply , a memoir of a life lived in contention with that singular disease of the mind : schizophrenia .
Payne leaps ( in fine classical style ) , in medias res , opening her account at what she tells us is the midpoint of her odyssey through her pathologies , speaking from within a locked ward for the mentally ill in Ames , Iowa .
She writes :
" My meds had not yet kicked in for the night .
I stood in bare feet in the middle of the floor and looked at the beds , the mirror , the window .
The air around me curled up at the edges .
It laughed at the fear spurting in my chest , just as the Evil Ones spurted through the night on their way to their own galaxy . ”
[ Italics in the original ]
That brief passage conveys one of Payne ’s great strengths : transforming feeling — terror , often — into vivid prose .
From that in - the - midst - of - it opening at Ames , Payne steps backwards to the year she spent in a master ’s program at Stanford , when she disintegrated severely enough to wind up in hospital for the first time .
Her description of that crisis sets the tone for much of the first half of the book :
I drove home .
On Palm Drive , while I was listening to rock on the radio , I felt my mind change .
I was aware of the same things – palm trees , bicycle riders , cars -- but they were all far away and magical .
“ MacArthur Park ” lasted all the way home .
It had a weird , doomsday authority over me .
I felt fragile .
Then I felt hot pain rise through my chest and spread out through my veins , just as it did when I drank at night .
Right on the edge of panic .
When I got home , I went and lay down on the grass under the hot sun and submitted to the pain .
I could n’t move until it got cool late that afternoon .
I went into my little cottage and sat down on the sofa .
Huge , invisible razor blades were attacking my eyes horizontally .
My body shook all over .
I wanted to kill myself .
Almost .
In my mind I went right to that edge and knew that I wanted to try to kill myself but be found while I was still alive .
But someone had to find out how bad it was .
Somebody had to know .
Before nightfall .
The night poised before me promised full - assault fear .
There was no way I could get through that night .
Unbelievably , Liz , an old roommate of mine , knocked at my door , opened it herself , and came in .
Blood was spurt - spurting crimson from my arm .
I cringed for doing that to her .
Payne ’s story goes down hill from there .
We follow her as she pursues the opportunities her clearly formidable mind opens up : graduate studies at Harvard ; mastery of language after language ( Italian , ancient Greek , medieval Greek , Latin… ) , Ph.D work at the University of Denver .
We wince , and then grieve , as at each stop , panic , depression , fear , alcohol — buckets and buckets of booze — and then full - blown schizophrenia derail this voice , this marvelous , literate voice at once narrating and living the train wreck unfolding across the page .
We learn about the pain of her childhood home , populated by a mother presented initially as uncaring , harsh , terrifying , a distant and uncomprehending father , a sister who , as the book proceeds , is revealed to be almost utterly without empathy — or perhaps better , as thoroughly terrified of whatever existential challenge Payne ’s illness seems to embody .
Payne describes in detail what happens as her schizophrenia advances , to the point where , in the hospital ward in Ames with which the book opens , she edges toward suicide … and then pulls back .
The second half of the book takes up what comes after her halt at the point of self - murder .
It ’s a very long way back — years , decades of painstaking , painful , courageous and ultimately successful labor , advanced with the help of modern pharmacology , persistent and sensitive talk therapy , AA , the rooted kindness of an admirable pair of Episcopalian clergy , and , in one of Payne ’s most subtly framed challenges to expectations raised earlier in her narrative , the love and care of parents who had seemed near - villainous in the early passages of the book .
By now what Payne ’s disease has taken from her is so apparent , so empathetically available , that I found myself rooting for her at every turn — and terribly fearful that something terrible might happen as I flipped each page .
But this latter story is one of renewal .
As Payne climbs out of the dark years she shows without saying what the reader can clearly recognize as the evidence of her strength , her capacity for restitution , for kindness and restitution and forgiveness .
The Roberta Payne who emerges through the final hundred pages of the book is someone it becomes a privilege to know , and one whose virtues make what her illness stole from her the more terrible .
This is supposed to be a review - site for works on science and related fields , so let me switch gears for a moment to say what else Payne achieves here : her story amounts to a case study in the advances achieved over the last half century in the understanding and treatment of serious mental illness .
At the beginning of that period and in the early days of Payne ’s troubles , talk , persuasion , some righting of wrong thoughts were seen as the royal road to treatment ( at least for someone in Payne ’s circumstances — educated , ferociously intelligent , articulate and , as a Stanford student , an ex-officio member of the elite ) .
Each of her various crises were , at least initially , seen as discrete problems — depression in one pocket , alcoholism in another and so on .
Ultimately , she achieved a clear and — for her — appropriate diagnosis , began to receive medication that over time became properly suited to her particular chemistry and physiology , and was able to return to the world supported be an infrastructure of therapeutic and social support .
What gets her and keeps her out of her madness was not available to her , to anyone , in the tie when she first fell ill .
Payne shows what that means with utter , brutal , and ultimately relieving detail .
Throughout both her descent into Hades and her return , Payne tests a claim she makes to one of her doctors midway through the book : that one ca n’t convey the experience of schizophrenia in words .
Of course , she ’s right .
It is impossible to give the full experience of any interior state , any landscape , anything but words in words .
Writers represent reality .
We do n’t replicate it , anymore than the painted illusion of three dimensional space in Raphael ’s School of Athens is anything more than a flat depiction , blobs of color on a plane .
We ca n’t experience Payne ’s disease , no matter how well she writes about it .
And yet , she ’s wrong .
Speaking to My Madness is much more than a memoir , though its a very fine remembrance indeed .
It is a meditation on how life may be lived .
In describing as clearly as she has what schizophrenia did to her and what she has done to live with , through , and beyond it , Payne has conveyed a four dimensional human experience .
It ’s not the same as being there , of course , but the book evokes imagination ; it compels an attempt at empathy .
I think it would please the classicist in her ( I hope it does ) to say that what she has done here is a thoroughly compelling display of mimesis — the art of description that , despite its necessary incompleteness , powerfully conveys the meaning of the whole .
Payne is simply a formidably skilled writer .
It ’s that skill that gives power to a proposition that Payne makes explicitly about two thirds of the way through the work : that psychosis , for all the pain and terror involved , is yet “ a deeply enriching experience ” as Payne put it , borrowing the phrase from some unremembered earlier reading .
The person writing the book , the voice we hear , is so compelling , so much a companion , that it seems that , yes , Payne ’s illness must have given her something , sensitivity , heightened feeling , whatever .
That ’s a comfort that does n’t survive her telling .
Reporting a conversation with her dearest friend she writes : ” you do n’t grow through schizophrenia … It ’s a fucking impediment and a waste of a lifetime . ”
That seems right — and Payne is writer enough to give that conclusion an air of necessity .
The fabric of her story , the utter courage with which she describes her worst days , makes it impossible to sustain the illusion that her terrors compensated her in any real measure .
Anyone who ’s suffered through the kinds of wretchedness Payne documents , or anyone who ’s watched someone they love do so , knows the costs involved .
But even so , there is a reward , scant comfort to those afflicted , that comes for those of us invited to listen to Roberta Payne ’s madness .
By the time she arrives at her resting point , speaking with a beloved companion , in the midst of a beauty her brain allows her to recognize , having mastered thought and feeling and the language needed to express both , Payne has delivered this marvelous book .
Her readers ’ lives , if not her own , are undisputedly better for it .
The shorter :
I loved this book .
I ’m sure it has flaws , and I could probably meditate a bit and offer the usual reviewers caveats about this or that .
But every now and then one comes across a writer , a voice , a text that lights up what ’s involved in being human .
Roberta Payne is such a writer .
Speaking to My Madness is such a work .

Erlang VM crash
Jan writes a call for help for some Erlang and Spidermonkey problems we 've been having .
It 's an interesting reason that Erlang crashes .
I spent some time looking at the crash dump and the server did n't look to be in a stressed state .
It only had 10's of processes running , most of them part of the core server that are always running .
It was only using 12 megs memory total and asking for 2 meg more .
How could it fail to allocate 2 megs and then crash because of it ?
Turns out it 's running in shared , hosted , memory limited environment and the Spidermonkey engine was hogging all the allowed OS memory .
I imagine when Spidermonkey fails the OS allocation , it runs the GC .
When Erlang fails an OS allocation , the whole VM bites the dust .
The fact that it bites the dusts is n't as disturbing I originally thought , but it did surprise me , I 'd expected it to reset all it 's internal state rather than just exit the OS process .
So the Erlang VM died suddenly with a failed memory allocation .
This is actually quite okay as CouchDB is designed with crash - only design principles and will instantly restart with no fix - up cycle necessary .
So in the interest of crash - only design , this really is the way to go .
Crash and restart .
However , the Erlang VM did n't restart automatically .
Apparently we need to configure something for that to happen , only we can't figure out how to make it work .
The documentation is either wrong , confusing or the feature is buggy .
This is the kind of stuff we keep hitting in Erlang .
It 's fantastically productive for many tasks , but using some of the built - in libraries and features can be a huge time sink .
( inets and xmerl immediately spring to mind ) .
I love Erlang , I really do , but I have a nasty Erlang rant building inside of me .
Posted December 9 , 2007 4:47 PM
For a time former Arkansas Gov. Michael Huckabee appeared to be among the craziest of the GOP candidates , gung - ho for the Iraq war , disdainful of Congress ’ role in declaring war , and enthusiastic about torturing U.S. captives .
But when he deviated slightly from neocon orthodoxy in his article in Foreign Affairs , which criticized President George Bush , the hawkish Right went berserk .
Where does Michael Huckabee really stand ?
The original Huckabee was an ugly creature .
Forget his love of tax hikes , paternalistic tendencies , and curious fondness for convicted criminals .
On foreign policy he sounded like a neocon clone .
Withdrawal timetables for Iraq were “ absurd , ” he said .
“ The quickest way to get out of Iraq is to win , ” he explained , and the U.S. should do “ whatever it takes to win . ”
No doubt , winning is better than losing .
But when it is n’t clear what winning is , and even your supposed friends whom you purport to be helping want you to leave , then plotting the best way out makes more sense than chirping about a victory which you ca n’t define .
As for Iran , Huckabee contended that “ A president has to [ do ] whatever is necessary to protect the American people .
If we think Iran is building nuclear capacity that could be used against us in any way , including selling some of the nuclear capacity to some other terrorist group , then , yes , we have a right ” to strike , and the president should do so without congressional authorization , which , Huckabee added , “ I would do in a heartbeat . ”
When pressed about his options if Congress said no , he said : “ You do what ’s best for the American people and you suffer the consequences . ”
Of course , no one doubts that the president has inherent authority to respond in exigent circumstances , such as a sudden nuclear attack by Russia .
But Iran has no nuclear capability and now , we believe , is not even creating a nuclear capability .
Nor has anyone shown anything in Iranian behavior to suggest that the regime would not be deterred , as was the Soviet Union , by America ’s overwhelming military might .
The fact that President Huckabee believes America has to choose between its democratic freedoms and national survival is frightening .
What of Guantánamo Bay , which has wrecked America ’s international reputation ?
After viewing the facility , he opined : “ The inmates there were getting a whole lot better treatment than my prisoners in Arkansas .
In fact , we left saying , ‘ I hope our guys do n’t see this .
They ’ll all want to be transferred to Guantánamo .
If anything , it ’s too nice ’ . ”
But Huckabee misses the point .
By all accounts today ’s Guantánamo is much better than the early Guantánamo .
The issue is not general prison conditions , but holding people who may be innocent without providing any procedure to assess their guilt .
One need shed no tears for terrorists , but one should recoil at a country dedicated to individual liberty imprisoning innocent people indefinitely .
The international cost to America ’s reputation has been exceedingly high .
At best , one could write off Huckabee ’s potpourri of right - wing sound - bites as reflecting his abject ignorance of foreign affairs .
When asked by Andrew Sullivan about the influences on his foreign policy thinking , Huckabee pointed to New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman and uberhawk Frank Gaffney of the Center for American Policy .
Huckabee then tossed in Richard Haass , a centrist with the Council on Foreign Relations , as an afterthought .
Mixing these three inevitably results in more confusion than enlightenment .
Then came Huckabee ’s article in Foreign Affairs , America ’s premier journal of international relations .
Who actually wrote it , and how responsible Huckabee is for the views it expresses , are unknown .
But it is as authoritative a campaign position as a statement issued from his campaign : for the foreign policy establishment , there is nothing closer to holy writ than the pages of Foreign Affairs .
In it Huckabee moved in a couple of decidedly new directions .
He opens with words that might have characterized candidate George W. Bush in 2000 : “ The United States , as the world ’s only superpower , is less vulnerable to military defeat .
But it is more vulnerable to the animosity of other countries .
Much like a top high school student , if it is modest about its abilities and achievements , if it is generous in helping others , it is loved .
But if it attempts to dominate others , it is despised . ”
Huckabee went on to hit the administration , hard .
“ The Bush administration ’s arrogant bunker mentality has been counterproductive at home and abroad , ” he intoned .
As president , he said he would “ recognize that the United States ’ main fight today does not pit us against the world but pits the world against the terrorists . ”
Huckabee also speaks skeptically of the Bush administration ’s attempt to spread democracy at the point of a gun .
Holding elections too soon can empower extremists , he rightly worries , though his belief that somehow improving life in the Muslim world is the key to love for America is sadly naive .
Abundant foreign aid to countries like Egypt has neither helped average people nor caused them to overlook policies , such as support for Arab dictatorships and Israel , that have generated such hostility against the U.S. government .
Even more profound may be Huckabee ’s break with the administration over Iran .
He recognizes that the attack on Iraq wrecked the regional balance of power , strengthening Iran .
Although he would not take the military option off of the table , he adds : “ if we do not put other options on the table , eventually a military strike will become the only viable one .
And nothing would make bin Laden happier than this outcome . ”
While al - Qaeda must be destroyed , “ Iran is a nation that just has to be contained . ”
In making his case for diplomatic engagement , he points to the experience in Iraq : “ Since we overthrew Saddam , we have learned that we invaded an imaginary country , because we relied at the time on information that was out of date and on longtime exiles who exaggerated the good condition of Iraq ’s infrastructure , the strength of its middle class , and the secular nature of its society .
We would have received better information if we had had our own ambassador in Baghdad .
Before we put boots on the ground elsewhere , we had better have wingtips there first . ”
While this is much improved over John “ bomb , bomb Iran ” McCain , for instance , Huckabee remains a hawk at heart .
“ It is essential to win in Iraq , ” he writes .
Rather than exercise the independent judgment required of the military ’s commander - in - chief , he says he would defer to Gen.
David Petraeus on any troop withdrawal .
Apparently he is prepared to stay forever : “ Those who say that we do not owe the Iraqis anything more are ignoring what we owe our own children and grandchildren in terms of security . ”
He is prepared to invade Pakistan , “ going after al - Qaeda ’s safe havens in Pakistan . ”
He does not address the feasibility of such a strategy , however .
Indeed , though he offers a devastating critique of current policy towards Pakistan , arguing that Washington “ has erred on the side of protecting Musharraf , ” he does not suggest a coherent alternative .
“ I will assure the Pakistanis that we are with them for the long haul , ” he writes , without explaining what that would mean in practice .
Finally , Huckabee makes two truly nutty proposals .
He explains : “ The first thing I will do as president is send Congress my comprehensive plan for achieving energy independence within ten years of my inauguration . ”
President Richard Nixon issued the first of many presidential promises to make America independent of foreign oil and today we import more petroleum than ever .
There is no cost - effective alternative to oil , a fact which Huckabee ’s bluster cannot change .
Even more bizarre is his proposal for an unprecedented military build - up .
Huckabee wants to speed up the administration ’s 92,000 troop increase and do so “ without lowering standards , ” no easy task .
Moreover , he contends : “ Right now , we are spending about 3.9 percent of our GDP on defense , compared with about six percent in 1986 , under President Ronald Reagan .
We need to return to that six percent level . ”
Apparently Huckabee fell asleep in 1989 and missed the fact that America ’s hegemonic competitor , the Soviet Union , disappeared .
The Berlin Wall fell .
Members of the enemy alliance all joined NATO .
China traded Maoist craziness for capitalist success .
As a result , American military dominance has never been greater .
The U.S. already accounts for roughly half of all military spending on earth .
America is allied with every major industrialized state .
As Colin Powell famously said , the U.S. is running out of enemies  there ’s Cuba , maybe North Korea , which is now negotiating with Washington , Iran , and perhaps Syria , which was just invited to the Annapolis conference .
Precisely what would Huckabee do with the $ 800 billion that he believes the U.S. should be spending on the military this year ?
He does not so enlighten us .
Although überhawks should glory in Huckabee ’s plan to bankrupt America to build more bombs , they are horrified far more by his apostasies .
Apparently the ivory tower warriors believe that with certifiable warmongers like Rudy Giuliani and John McCain  who believe in war against everyone , all of the time  already in the race , why settle for anyone with even a touch of weakness ?
To them , Huckabee ’s concern over America ’s image suggests a lack of manliness and toughness .
To oppose bombing Iran tomorrow reeks of appeasement and defeatism .
So the assaults came fast and furious .
Mitt Romney , himself critical of the president earlier this year , immediately went into suck - up mode , declaring that “ The president is a person who is deeply devoted to this country and doing what ’s right for this country and protecting American lives ” and that “ we can be thankful that President Bush has kept us safe . ”
Dean Barnett of the Weekly Standard declared Huckabee ’s comments to be the sort of “ rubbish ” one would expect “ from a Daily Kos diarist . ”
Columnist David Limbaugh denounced Huckabee ’s “ betrayal of President Bush , wrapped in a virtual endorsement of Jimmy Carter diplomacy . ”
Peter Wehner , fresh from the Bush White House , called Huckabee “ naive and foolish ” and “ ignorant , ” and said the candidate “ has a few things to learn . ”
The latter is certainly true , though for reasons very different from those advanced by Wehner .
Mike Huckabee has mixed a bizarre policy cocktail , leaving much to criticize .
Overall , his positions seem hopelessly muddled : America should be less arrogant but should undertake a massive military build - up .
The U.S. should improve its image abroad , but should ignore the counterproductive impact of Gitmo and related issues , such as torture and rendition , on America ’s reputation .
Washington should stick around Iraq forever but maybe not attack Iran .
Governments should treat so - called foreign aid , which has failed to achieve much of anything positive for a half century , as a measure of American generosity .
And America should toss more good money after bad in a hopeless quest for energy “ independence . ”
Still , Huckabee gets one essential point right .
Unlike President Bush , Mike Huckabee is sufficiently grounded in reality to recognize that all is not well with American foreign policy .
On the Republican side that sets him apart from everyone other than Rep. Ron Paul .
Huckabee is no revolutionary committed to overturning interventionist orthodoxy within the Republican Party .
But his modest heresies might be another harbinger of a slow shift away from the policy of promiscuous intervention that has come to characterize the conservative movement .
Such a transformation can’t come quickly enough .
Generally all apartments that accept pets allow solely cats and small dogs .
These animals , however generally wreak havoc on apartments .
Following are animals that spend most of their time caged but may be more attractive to landlords than dogs that dig and cats that scratch .
Perhaps your perfect pet is within .
1. Sugar Gliders
The Sugar Glider is for those of you who think squirrels are adorable and would like to have one as a pet .
The pet is actually not related to squirrel , however these small marsupials share many commonalities with flying squirrels .
Sugar Gliders are also very social animals .
Sugar gliders yearn for extensive attention from their human owners or need another sugar glider present as a companion .
The Sugar Glider 's diet is composed of high amounts of fruits , vegetables and some insects .
This pet is for those who want to interact with a pet that enjoys consistent human interaction .
2. Chinchillas
Chinchillas resemble squirrel - mouse hybrids with enormous furry ears .
As pets , Chinchillas are very docile and easy to keep and maintain .
A drawback to the Chinchilla is that the pet can be hard at times to socialize and can be introverted .
The animal prefers a quiet environment and strongly disfavors sudden movements , loud noises or extreme changes in its environment .
A quirky aspect of the Chinchilla is that it prefers bathing with dust or sand as opposed to water .
Chinchillas are also known to chew on a variety of objects , therefore many chewable items should be kept in the pets enclosure .
The enclosure for the Chinchilla must be relatively large to provide this pet with the opportunity to roam .
These animals are not noisy and almost odorless as a good alternative to gerbils or rats .
3. Ferrets
Ferrets are known as clever , affectionate and personable animals despite being criticized for their weasel like appearance .
Their proponents claim them to be exceptional pets because of their high energy and interactivity with toys , balls and their environment .
Though the animals spend the majority of their time in an enclosure , ferrets need to be released frequently for exercise .
As the popularity of ferrets increases , many accessories have hit the market including pouches , leashes and custom clothing .
Additionally if the animal is spayed or neutered and decantered , the smell of the animal is nearly eradicated .
4. Snakes
Snakes have long been an interest of pet owners .
Snakes are best for people who are not seeking a fuzzy et to cuddle with , but would rather an enigmatic animal to appreciate .
It should be noted that you must not mind that animal eating live mice or rats .
Snakes however can be difficult pets similar to many other reptiles .
Snakes require special heat lamps or heated rocks to maintain the body temperature of this cold blooded animal .
Additionally , the specialized diet of the animal and difficulty finding quality veterinarian services can be challenging .
However , if you remain undaunted by these challenges a snake may make an exceptional pet for you .
5. Guinea Pigs
The Hamster is generally a child 's first pet , however a guinea pig may be the best choice for most .
Guinea pigs are renowned as outgoing and affectionate pets that are very easy to take care of .
The animal can live very well on simple pellet foods and enjoys are large enclosure or can even do well in an open sectioned off portion of the apartment .
With enough space , a Guinea Pig can be trained to use a litter box .
Guinea pigs can become very attached to their human caretakers and make a small squeaking sound at times .
The guinea pig enjoys an active life and can make an exceptional apartment pet .
6. Rats
Rats are abhorred by many , however others discovery excellently clever companions .
If its appearance and stereotypes do n't dissuade you , the rat may be a good pet for you .
Rats are extremely easy to care for .
Rat enthusiasts applaud the pets increasing intelligence and often engage in games with their pets .
The rat needs a modes sized enclosure and flourishes with human interaction .
A rat can and will bond with its owner and despite the stereotypes will be a very clean and affectionate pet .
The Others
There are numerous other animals other than dogs and cats that make exceptional apartment pets including : ( 7 ) Birds , ( 8 ) frogs / turtles , ( 9 ) hamsters , and ( 10 ) fish are just a few .
Fish are very quiet and less interactive , however make for good stress relief , while birds are often noisy and much more interactive .
Prior to purchasing any pet perform your research and assess the size of your apartment with the animal 's needs .
Purchasing a pet that is too large or too noisy for your apartment will be a disaster to you and the pet .
Once your research is complete and you have selected the right pet , you and your pet will be happy for many years to come !
So to be clear right off the bat , this is not the type of hovercraft that you might commute to work or class in , but rather a small RC version more suitable for transporting babies or adorable pets .
That being said , Instructables user bradpowers has posted step - by - step guide for the ambitious modder to build his or her very own remotely - controlled or autonomous ' craft , from constructing the frame to assembling the lift and propulsion systems to setting up the onboard PIC .
Definitely not a project for the easily distracted , however , a successful build will surely make you the delight of neighborhood children for blocks in every direction .

Israel air strikes pounded targets in Gaza for a second night
Matan Vilnai said Palestinians risked a " shoah " , the Hebrew word for a big disaster - and for the Nazi Holocaust .
Mr Vilnai made the comments after rockets hit the city of Ashkelon , 10 km ( six miles ) from Gaza .
His colleagues insisted he had not meant " genocide " .
Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said it was ready for a large - scale Israeli attack .
Israeli air strikes have killed about 30 Palestinians in the past three days .
The string of attacks came a day after a rocket fired by Hamas killed an Israeli student on the outskirts of Sderot , about a mile from Gaza , the first such death in nine months .
' No choice '
The barrage continued on Friday with militants aiming several Grad rockets at Ashkelon , home to 120,000 people .
The Iranian - made rockets are said to have a range of about 22 km ( 14 miles ) .
Sderot residents give their views on what to do about rocket fire
In pictures
One rocket hit a block of flats in the city , breaking through the roof and slicing through three floors below , while another landed near a school , wounding a 17 - year - old girl .
It is the first time Israeli officials have ordered Code Red sirens to be sounded in Ashkelon and reports say soldiers from the Israeli military 's Home Front Command have been hanging posters around the city instructing residents on what to do when the warning sounds .
" It 's a city with large facilities - a huge soccer stadium , and a basketball stadium , and a beach .
No -one is ready for this , " Ashkelon mayor Roni Mehatzri told Israel Radio .
Israel 's leaders have been under pressure in some quarters to launch a ground invasion of Gaza to end the rocket fire and although they are reluctant , Mr Vilnai admitted on Friday that they will have " no other choice " .
Speaking on Israel Army Radio , Mr Vilnai said if Palestinians increased rocket fire , they would bring upon themselves a " shoah " .
The BBC's Katya Adler in Jerusalem says many of Mr Vilnai 's colleagues have quickly distanced themselves from his comments and also tried to downplay , them saying he did not mean genocide .
" We 're getting close to using our full strength .
Until now , we 've used a small percentage of the army 's power because of the nature of the territory , " he added .
Separately , the chairman of the Knesset 's defence and foreign affairs committee , Tzachi Hanegbi , said Israel " must make a strategic decision to order the army to prepare quickly " .
A recent opinion poll has indicated a majority of Israelis favour a truce with Hamas .
' Crazy war '
The Islamist movement , which seized control of Gaza in June , has said it will cease fire if Israel stops its military operations in Palestinian areas and ends the blockade of the territory which has cut essential supplies to its 1.5 m inhabitants .
ISRAEL - HAMAS ATTACKS
Friday : Israeli city Ashkelon activates warning system after Palestinian rocket hits Israeli air raids continue , with four wounded in Jabaliya Thursday : Four children killed near Jabaliya refugee camp Hamas militant killed near Shati refugee camp Hamas militant killed near Beit Hanoun Three Hamas militants and two from PRC killed in Gaza City Wednesday : Six - month - old boy killed near interior ministry Five Hamas militants near Khan Younis Islamic Jihad militant near Bureij refugee camp Israeli civilian killed in Sderot
In pictures : Gaza violence
Addressing a crowd of around 2,000 Hamas supporters at a rally held after Friday prayers in Gaza City , Mr Haniya , a former Palestinian prime minister , said Israel was deluded if it thought it could now remove his group .
" Gaza today faces a real war , a crazy war led by the enemy against our people , " he said .
" What does a large - scale raid mean ?
You were in the Gaza Strip and you quit because of the resistance .
What does assassination mean ?
If some leaders are assassinated , would the cause be assassinated ? " he asked .
Mr Haniya , who was dismissed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas ousted his Fatah movement in Gaza , said any Israeli attempt to invade would " end in terrible failure just like all the other rounds have failed " .
Back in the day , when Google was in its infancy , the search leaders of the time ( Yahoo , Altavista , Excite , etc. ) cluttered search results with banner ads .
In addition to offering a superior algorithm , one of Google ’s most alluring early features was the absence of such intrusions .
However , this is about to change , at least on a limited basis , according to Saul Hansell of The New York Times .
According to Hansell , Google began testing video ads in search results today .
Here ’s how the ads are described :
“ At first , users will barely notice the change because the videos will not be immediately obvious .
Ads with accompanying videos will have a small button with a plus sign . ”
However , this will change in time , according to Marissa Mayer of Google , who tells Hansell :
“… The company would explore adding small thumbnail photos to the video ads as well .
And a spokesman said the company is considering testing other formats that may include ads with images . ”
Mayer ’s justification for the move is that since Google has started including images and video in search results , people have stopped clicking on text ads as much .
To counter , she thinks adding visual ads will bring people ’s eyes back towards them .
It does sound like Google is taking a measured approach towards adding visual ads , and I would n’t expect to see run -of - network “ Win a Free iPod ” ads anytime soon in the search results .
With billions of search queries to monetize , it could mean significant revenue in the short - term .
And , from a business perspective , Mayer is correct – eyes gravitate towards images , and thus , I assume click - thrus will increase as visual ads become more common in results .
However , this also seems like a significant cultural shift at Google .
It ’s the end of what was once considered one of Google ’s major strengths , and opens the doors for up - and - comers to go back to Google ’ s original spartan approach to search .
The user response will be very interesting to watch on this one .
A 23 - year - old student journalist in Afghanistan has been sentenced to death for downloading and distributing a report that is critical of the oppressive treatment of women in some Islamic societies .
Sayed Pervez Kambaksh ( at right ) , who is a journalism student at Balkh University and a writer for Jahan-e Naw , was sentenced last October after downloading a report from a Farsi website that criticized Islamic fundamentalists who misrepresent statements in the Koran to justify the oppression of women .
Kambaksh was arrested after someone filed a complaint against him .
He is accused of blasphemy for distributing the report to other students and teachers at his school .
He was tried by a sharia court ( which oversees Islamic religious law ) and was not allowed legal representation , according to news reports .
The Afghan Senate passed a motion this week supporting the sentence , according to the British newspaper The Independent .
Other journalists have been warned that they would be arrested if they protested in support of Kambaksh .
The Independent has launched a campaign to support Kambaksh , urging readers to pressure the UK Foreign Office to intervene with the Afghan government .
The newspaper has posted a petition online for readers to fill out and submit .

Volunteer radar gunslingers nail speeders
Speeders beware .
Your neighbors might have you on their radar .
That 's the message police departments across the country are trying to send by loaning residents radar guns and turning them into neighborhood speed watchers .
Volunteers can't ticket the drivers they catch breaking the speed limit , but their reports can result in warning letters being sent by police , depending on how fast the drivers were going .
Police say the program is worth it if it can make even a few motorists obey speed limits .
" It 's one more element of enforcing speed , " says Lt. Daniel Furseth of the DeForest Police Department in Wisconsin .
For the past year , the village has allowed residents to borrow a battery - operated radar gun for a week or two , sit on their front lawns and record the speeds of passing motorists .
Typically , a warning letter is sent when speeds are 13 mph over the limit , but it depends on the residential area , Furseth says .
The police department has sent out a couple dozen warning letters , he says .
" One parent called and was glad we sent a letter , " Furseth says .
" But it 's not always the kids ( who are speeding ) — it 's the soccer moms , too . "
Elsewhere :
• Residents in Loveland , Ohio , are invited to sign up in teams of two or three to use the Stalker II , a hand - held , battery - operated radar gun .
• In the Chicago suburb of Naperville , Ill. , residents affiliated with homeowners associations use the radar guns .
" Some people seemed surprised .
Some took notice and slowed down , " says Bob Fischer , director of the Naperville Area Homeowners Confederation .
" Others were angry that we were interfering with their inherent right to get to the train station — or back home — as quickly as possible . "
• In Shawnee , Kan. , a suburb of Kansas City , police allow residents to use radar guns on residential streets that are posted 25 mph or less , police Sgt. Doug Orbin says .
The volunteer must stay in his or her vehicle while using the radar gun , he says .
• This week , the police department in The Dalles , Ore. , started taking names of interested citizens who want to be neighborhood speed watchers .

" Your papers please " has long been a phrase associated with Hitler ’s Gestapo .
People without the Third Reich ’s stamp of approval were hauled off to Nazi Germany ’s version of Halliburton detention centers .
Today Americans are on the verge of being asked for their papers , although probably without the " please . "
Thanks to a government that has turned its back on the US Constitution , Americans now have an unaccountable Department of Homeland Security that is already asserting tyrannical powers over US citizens and state governments .
Headed by the neocon fanatic Michael Chertoff , the Orwellian - sounding Department of Homeland Security has mandated a national identity card for Americans , without which Americans may not enter airports or courthouses .
There is no more need for this card than there is for a Department of Homeland Security .
Neither are compatible with a free society .
However , Bush , the neocons , Republicans and Democrats do not want America to any longer be a free society , and they are taking freedom away from us just as they took away the independence of the media .
Free and informed people get in the way of power - mad zealots with agendas .
It is the agendas that are supreme , not the American people , who have less and less say about less and less .
George W. Bush , an elected president , has behaved like a dictator since September 11 , 2001 .
If " our " representatives in Congress care , they have n’t done anything about it .
Bush has pretty much cut Congress out of the action .
In truth , Congress gave up its law - making powers to the executive branch during the New Deal .
For three - quarters of a century , the bills passed by Congress have been authorizations for executive branch agencies to make laws in the form of regulations .
The executive branch has come to the realization that it does n’t really need Congress .
President Bush appends his own " signing statements " to the authorizations from Congress in which the President says what the legislation means .
So what is the point of Congress ?
As for laws already on the books , the US Department of Justice ( sic ) has ruled that the President does n’t have to abide by US statutes , such as FISA or the law forbidding torture .
Neither does the President have to abide by the Geneva Conventions .
Other obstacles are removed by edicts known as presidential directives or executive orders .
There are more and more of these edicts , and they accumulate more and more power and less and less accountability in the executive .
The disdain in which the executive branch holds the " separate and equal " legislative branch is everywhere apparent .
For example , President Bush is concluding a long - term security agreement with the puppet government he has set up in Iraq .
Prior to September 11 , 2001 , when the President became The Decider , a defense pact was a treaty requiring the approval of Congress .
All that is now behind us .
General Douglas Lute , President Bush ’s national security adviser for Iraq says that the White House will not be submitting the deal to Congress for approval .
Lute says Bush will not be seeking any " formal inputs from the Congress . "
" There is no question that this is unprecedented , " said Yale Law School Professor O. Hathaway .
Bush can do whatever he wants , because Congress has taken its only remaining power — impeachment — off the table .
The Democratic Party leadership thinks that the only problem is Bush , who will be gone in one year .
Besides , the Israel Lobby does n’t want Israel ’s champion impeached , and neither do the corporate owners of the US media .
The Democrats are not adverse to inheriting the powers in Bush ’s precedents .
The Democrats , of course , will use the elevated powers for good rather than for evil .
Instead of having a bad dictator , we ’ll have a good one .

Britain 's colonial legacy in Pakistan left a thriving but dark commercial sector in the country 's capital , Karachi .
Massoud Ansari investigates the city 's desperate marketplace that trades in young women …
Over the years , Karachi , the economic jugular of the country , has become one of the major " mandis " ( markets ) for commercial sex in Pakistan , where girls as young as 14 can be purchased from 300 rupees upwards , depending upon the client , the service demanded , the location , and the girl ’s physical attributes .
As economic recession in the country deepens , many girls from different parts of Pakistan are thronging to Karachi where the market is comparatively better than in other nearby regions .
Salma , an 18 - year old call girl , says : “ In Lahore we can scarcely find enough business , but if we work only four weekends a month in Karachi , it fetches us twice the amount we would normally earn , despite working day and night … ”
A wide variety of girls can be found in Karachi ’s commercial sex market .
They belong not only to local communities originating from different parts of the country , but also comprise women of foreign nationalities .
According to the Society for Protection of the Rights of the Child ( SPARC ) , some 200,000 Bangladeshi women have been trafficked into Pakistan in the last 10 years alone .
“ Many of these girls are minors who are forced into the sex trade from surrounding countries ; the majority of them end up in Karachi , ” says the report .
Besides Bengali girls , women from the Central Asian States , Bosnia , Afghanistan and Burma can also be found marketing themselves in the capital .
Prostitution was formalised for the first time in the Indian subcontinent by the British government in the mid-18th century .
The British colonialists enacted special laws , created " red light " areas and assigned the task of protecting women sex workers to law - enforcing agencies .
Municipalities overlooking the sex districts were given the responsibility of collecting taxes and providing health and sanitation services to the brothels .
As an independent Muslim state , Pakistan does not officially allow prostitution .
Unofficially , however , the practice is prevalent all over the country , with the majority of the clientele ironically comprised of politicians , bureaucrats , police officials and army personnel ; in short , the very people who are supposed to legislate and implement laws against the sex trade .
Until the late 1970s - when General Zia-ul - Haq embarked upon a drive to " Islamise " Pakistani society , closing down brothels to the public , red light areas - as a legacy of British rule - continued to be institutionalised .
A local sociologist explains : “ With the closure of brothels to the public , the prostitutes - whose profession is often passed from generation to generation - dispersed to the cities ’ residential areas to earn their livelihoods .
With the passage of time , girls from impoverished families also came to join them . ”
The motivating factor for most call girls in Karachi today is the considerable amount of money they can earn in the profession .
Some maintain they were compelled to enter prostitution because their families had no breadwinner left after the death or remarriage of the household father , while others cite poverty resulting from divorce .
One call girl in Karachi claims : “ My entire family depends on my income .
My father died and I have to give at least 10,000 rupees every month to support my mother and the rest of my family .
I ’m divorced and have only a high school education .
One of my friends told me about the money I could earn from prostitution and introduced me to " Auntie Shamim . ”
The girl shares 40 per cent of her income with her " business auntie " in return for her contacts , shelter and protection .
While some of the girls start out on their own , the majority of them enter after coming into contact with a pimp .
When a new girl enters any den , the incumbent workers show her the ropes and how to behave with the house clients .
Each girl , however , is responsible for striking their own deal with the pimps .
While some share 40 to 50 per cent of their income with these touts , others prefer to work under a fixed monthly amount .
In return , pimps provide police protection , shelter , and bear their day - to - day expenses , including food and cigarettes .
A young call girl from Sahiwal , said : “ My parents have " rented " me out for three months to Goga Bhai ( a high - profile pimp in Karachi ) for one lakh rupees ( 100,000 ) . ”
However , she says has no complaints about living with the man because she is treated well .
“ I do n’t have to have sex with him , which is normal at other places .
He treats me like a brother ! ”
Once a girl is employed , she cannot refuse to oblige her pimp who will sell her on to as many clients as he wants .
Pimps more often than not retain all the money the girls earn in tips , which are particularly forthcoming during dance performances or " mujras . "
The majority of call girls learn to dance because they can earn more money .
Annie Noureen , a sex worker in Karachi , says : “ The ones who do n’t know dancing hardly get any tips , but if we do , our clients , when they get drunk , shower us with all the money they have in their wallets … ”
The optimum period in a call girl ’s life is a short one , and usually only lasts until they have crossed their teens .
A pimp said : “ When the girl is young , she is like a cheque that one can cash even on Sundays , but when she begins to age , she is akin to rotten fish .
It becomes hard for her to meet even her monthly expenses .
Those with dancing skills , however , have some bonus years in which to attract customers in this marketplace . "
The most astute call girls in Karachi work in tandem with their pimps for between six to eight months , after which time they strike out on their own to become suppliers .
A case in point is " Auntie " Shamim .
A one time call girl , she is today one of the best - known pimps in Karachi ’s higher social strata .
In the initial years , Shamim had to work very hard not only for herself but also in order to cultivate enough contacts to begin her own operations with at least five girls in her employ .
Soon after she entered the world of commercial sex , Shamim bought herself a mobile phone and circulated her number among her clients .
“ It ’s all a game of contacts ; the more connected you are , the better the business , " Shamim says .
" The day I realised I had enough contacts , I started my own business … ”
Now , Shamim boasts of having a select clientele among Karachi 's high and mighty .
Her cell phone scarcely stops ringing in the evenings as she cruises the city ’s upmarket localities , dropping girls at various given addresses .
The explosion in cell phones across the country have solved manifold problems for pimps and prostitutes .
Shahid , a local pimp , explained how mobile phones are essential for those in the business , chiefly because they ensure anonymity .
“ The police lost 80 per cent of the amount they used to extract from us through blackmail and extortion , ” he says .
“ Once our whereabouts are known , we can easily be trapped by the police and they create lot of problems for us , including demanding free services from these girls as well as regular " bhatta " ( extortion ) . ”
Incidentally , many of the pimps switched to pagers during the suspension of mobile phone operations in Karachi by Benazir Bhutto ’s government , which was directed at disrupting the communication network of terrorists and anti-state elements .
In order to avoid detection by law - enforcing agencies , call girls frequently shift apartments .
A Karachi police official , says : “ It ’s very difficult to track them down because they live for barely six months at any one place before shifting on to another . ”
Moreover , sex workers prefer to live in commercial areas where they can blend into the crowd and escape detection .
In order to hire a call girl in Karachi one has to be personally known to her or her tout .
If this is not so , then acquaintance with someone who has connections with a supplier is essential .
When contact has finally been made , rates are conveyed and the girl is supplied .
Once the pimp is familiar with the new contact however , acquiring services becomes far less convoluted in future .
“ Pimps have no problem dropping girls off at your place , but they avoid obliging people without references for fear that they may be walking into a police trap ” says a regular client .
The modus operandi states a pimp will arrive at a client ’s door after the initial contact has ben made , accompanied by a few well - groomed young women .
The client offers them tea or cold drinks in order to take his time and choose the one he wants for the night .
Questions are asked of them , and at times they are even physically harassed during the course of selection .
However , because it is their bread and butter , the women usually make no protest .
After the choice has finally been made , the client pays the pimp in advance .
The pimp then leaves the house with the rest of the women and returns in the morning to collect the remaining girl .
A call girls ’ clientele is varied and includes both young and old men , serving and retired bureaucrats , politicians , feudals and businessmen .
Most of the women consider an invitation by Sindhi feudals the most lucrative assignment as they are said to be the most generous paymasters of all .
A source discloses : “ Sometimes feudals even call these girls on " udhar " ( deferred payment ) and pay them later when their crop is sold . ”
Entertaining young men meanwhile , is usually deemed the least desirable job .
Samia , a young girl in her teens recalls a particularly harrowing encounter : “ Once when I went on call , there were six young men drinking alcohol in the drawing room .
When they became drunk , one of them took me inside the room .
After he was finished , the next wanted to sleep with me .
I co-operated .
To my utter dismay , the third demanded his turn .
When I refused , they abused me verbally and pushed me around .
I was weeping and begging them to stop but they showed me no mercy and came at me like animals .
They said that as they had purchased my body for the night they could do with me whatever they wanted .
By the time I returned home in the morning , I was such a wreck that I was unable to work for at least a week … ”
The sociologist implores the feelings of the girls to be considered and " how they sleep with people of different age groups , all with different temperaments , the fat and the slim ; the educated and the uneducated ; some of them violent , others nice ; the black , wheatish and the whitish ; the experienced and the inexperienced .
“ It 's like a mercenary killer or a thief who finds it difficult to commit the crime in the beginning , but becomes hardened after the second and third times , ” argues Manzoor Kohiyar , a Sindhi short story writer .
Most call girls , however , drink alcohol or smoke hashish on the job and say that when they finally sleep with their clients , they are devoid of feeling and offer only their bodies to them .
Suraya Parveen , who is known as " Gurya , " speaks from seven - years experience as a call girl .
She says : “ Initially , the work used to really upset me but when I accepted the bitter reality that I had to do this , I just tuned my mind accordingly .
Now there is no question of being happy or sad because normally I do n’t think about what they do with me … ”
However , one regular customer maintains : “ I normally pay these girls extra money and request them to pretend as though they have an emotional connection with me .
I can not enjoy sex until then . ”
Some men bluntly claim they prefer call girls to girlfriends .
A senior bureaucrat known as “ Rangeela Badshah ” in his circle says : “ If you have a girlfriend , you spend a lot of money taking her out for meals or for shopping .
She will start demanding that you marry her and if you refuse , she is quite liable to blackmail you , claiming pregnancy or other such shenanigans . ”
According to sources however , many businessmen and even some bureaucrats have a somewhat different modus operandi for buying sex .
They purchase or rent ‘ offices ’ and place advertisements in newspapers along the lines of “ lady secretary needed ” and attract many girls from impoverished families who , if willing , are hired solely for sexual services .
One businessman , who discreetly rented an office in Karachi ’s Saddar area for his trysts , said : “ In sleeping with call girls , one runs the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases , such as HIV , Hepatitis B and C among others .
But when you 're hiring a girl solely for yourself , there is less risk of getting infected . ”
His ‘ secretary ’ however , lasts only as long as his desire for her after which she is unceremoniously fired and an advertisement for a new one placed .
“ I have been doing this for over a decade and have so far had no difficulty in picking up women this way , ” he adds .
Other than the girls ferried around by pimps from place to place and those who pose as ‘ secretaries , ’ women offering sex for sale can also be found at certain boutiques and beauty parlours in the city .
As in the case of regular call girls , potential customers initially need a reference to avail their services .
A visitor to one such beauty parlour on Tariq Road discloses : “ I went there for the first time with a friend of mine who was a frequent client and as I ’m known to them now , I have no problem going there any time . ”
Sources reveal that the owner of the beauty parlour usually charges 1,000 rupees for a complete body massage lasting up to thirty or forty minutes .
Clients can select their masseur from six to eight young women in their 20s .
Co-operative ones give their customers more than a massage .
“ Most of them let you fondle their bodies in order to make tips at the end of the job , ” says another visitor to beauty parlours .
However , if the customer also wants sex , the price tag can be somewhere between two to three thousand rupees .
In an increasingly materialistic society , values have become skewed , and practices once considered taboo avoid the censure that was once their due .
In many cases , politicians act as procurers in return for political favours such as lucrative ministries while businessmen resort to the practice to clinch business deals .
A group of policemen and bureaucrats in Sindh justify their habit of procuring call girls in return for favours from important government officials as being in sync with the “ new world order . ”
According to a source , the logic behind this is simple : “ Market say lee , aur market main day dee ” ( Pick it up from the market and hand it over in the market ) .
Karachi’s higher echelon localities are dotted with lavishly decorated houses and apartments where these VIPs are entertained .
The bedrooms in these houses feature not only comfortable beds , sometimes waterbeds , but often boast full - length mirrors along the walls as well as on the ceiling .
According to sources , when a no-confidence move was launched against Benazir Bhutto in 1989 during her first tenure , many PPP - backed MNAs from Punjab and NWFP were shifted to Karachi .
Playing host to them was another MNA from Sindh , who was instructed to ensure that their stay in the city was as comfortable as possible .
One source said : " During their sojourn , which lasted over two weeks , most of them were supplied with a new girl and a bottle of scotch every day . ”
At times , however , riotous parties replete with alcohol and call girls have resulted in mayhem .
Two years ago , in the famous " Babli case , " the deputy commissioner of Mirpur Khas district threw a " mujra " to which he invited a number of senior and junior bureaucrats .
A scuffle broke out when two senior bureaucrats wanted to sleep with the same girl .
When she escaped from their clutches and fled , one of them asked the police to pursue her vehicle .
In the course of their pursuit , the police fired at the vehicle and the girl , Babli , a well - known dancer from Hyderabad sustained serious bullet injuries .
Subsequently , when the incident was reported in the press , the DC , SDM and other officials involved were suspended and an official inquiry was ordered by the provincial government .
A considerable number of bureaucrats , politicians and others with power and pelf have their “ keeps ” as well .
A source says : “ In return for fixed monthly expenses , the “ keep ” is available on call to the man in question . ”
There have been instances when clients have become serious in their affections and married their regular call girls .
However , according to Sheereen , a local call girl : “ Usually , the men are dissuaded by pressure from family and friends who advise them against it on the grounds that marrying such a girl would be a stain on their family honour . ”
Sheereen herself has had two serious liaisons , both of which came to naught .
Commercial sex was at its height until the late ’90s , but the severe economic downturn in the country over the last few years has had a negative impact on this business as well .
Says a young sex worker named Shazia : “ In the good days , we were so busy we barely had time to return or at times even answer our clients ’ calls , but now we often make calls to them ourselves to offer our services .
It ’s a hardly a break even situation these days . ”
Many pimps , meanwhile , have turned to peddling young girls to attract otherwise reluctant customers .
According to reports , 20 per cent of the prostitutes in Pakistan are children under the age of 16 .
It is estimated that in Asia , over one million children are involved in the sex trade often under conditions no better than slavery .
Ms. Tahira , a ‘ madam ’ who has been operating in Karachi for the last decade , said : “ Every man who comes asks for younger and younger girls .
The demand for them means that the young ones fetch more money and get more clients per day . ”
Most analysts recognise poverty as a crucial factor in driving women towards an occupation such as prostitution .
This factor , compounded by their low status in this society , results in a lethal combination that marginalises women and ensures their continuous flow into this profession .
Caught in a vicious cycle from which few escape , it renders them even more vulnerable to exploitation and victimisation .
One analyst commented : “ In this institution , the body is that of the women and the pleasure derived from it is totally that of men . ”
“ Could you deflower a girl ? " Madam Rabia asks one of her regular clients .
" She has been rotting at my place for the last couple of weeks , with no potential customers …
” She wants to put the 14 - year - old girl to work in Karachi 's commercial sex market as soon as possible .
Rabia , popularly known as " Bhabi " in the Karachi circuit , demands 20,000 rupees for a night with her new recruit and guarantees the girl ’s virginity personally .
“ The market is down these days , otherwise she is worth at least 50,000 rupees , ” she laments .
Rabai describes the girl as a “ tithli " ( fairy ) and gives details of her age , figure , features and complexion .
After some haggling , a deal is struck at 15,000 rupees , with an additional two thousand rupees thrown in as a “ mithai for nath utrai ” ( tip for deflowering ) .
The next day , the girl is delivered .
Far from being an exception , this is the typical manner in which hundreds of young girls enter the profession of commercial sex in the city to become " call girls . "

I saw an interesting talk by Tetsuo Asano on halftone algorithms that caught my attention .
My first remark after searching for dithering examples was that many images appear too bright .
The following is a comparison of images dithered using raw R'G ' B ' against images using values gamma corrected for an sRGB display device .
These images were dithered using a simple 8x8 Bayer matrix with values between 1 and 64 .
Each value in the matrix is tested against the scaled input channel value , if the image value is higher , we dither to 1 , otherwise we dither to 0 .
The 8x8 matrix is tiled over the image .
The matrix is as follows : [ 1 33 9 41 3 35 11 43 ] [ 49 17 57 25 51 19 59 27 ] [ 13 45 5 37 15 47 7 39 ] [ 61 29 53 21 63 31 55 23 ] [ 4 36 12 44 2 34 10 42 ] [ 52 20 60 28 50 18 58 26 ] [ 16 48 8 40 14 46 6 38 ] [ 64 32 56 24 62 30 54 22 ]
For applications which need results without a complexity penalty , it is sufficient to change our matrix to compensate for gamma directly .
While I have not done an analysis to measure the error , I decided to increase the precision of the dither matrix from 1 - 64 valued to using values from 1 to 255 .
The corrected matrix is as follows : [ 34 190 105 209 61 195 115 214 ] [ 227 141 242 168 231 148 246 174 ] [ 124 218 79 200 133 223 93 205 ] [ 250 179 235 155 253 185 239 162 ] [ 71 198 120 216 49 193 110 212 ] [ 233 152 248 177 229 145 244 171 ] [ 137 225 99 207 129 220 86 202 ] [ 255 188 240 165 251 182 237 158 ]
This matrix is applied on each colour component individually to return a 3 - bit per pixel image , one bit for each of red , green and blue .
First , we compare the original image to our 8 - coloured dithered version .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
A record increase in imported oil prices in November sent the U.S. trade deficit to its highest level in more than a year , the Commerce Department reported Friday .
The seasonally adjusted trade gap widened 9.3 % to $ 63.1 billion in November , the largest deficit since September 2006 .
Read the full report .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expected the trade deficit to widen in November to $ 59.5 billion .
See Economic Calendar .
October 's gap of $ 57.8 billion was unrevised .
" The trade picture is almost grim for a country whose exchange rate has dropped as much as the greenback 's has , " wrote Robert Brusca of FAO Economics .
" Any more dropping and they may have to rename it the ' yellow - back ' for cowardliness . "
Imports rose 3 % to a record $ 205.4 billion , while exports increased 0.4 % to a record $ 142.3 billion .
Most of the increase was simply a matter of higher prices , however .
In inflation - adjusted terms , the real trade gap widened by 4.2 % , as real imports rose 1.3 % and real exports fell 0.3 % .
It was the second straight decline in real exports , a troubling sign for an economy that 's relying on export growth to offset weakness in housing , capital spending and consumer spending .
The unexpected increase in the real trade gap will likely lead economists to lower their projections for fourth - quarter gross domestic product .
Currently , economists are predicting that GDP growth slowed to 1.2 % annualized in the quarter .
Jay Bryson , global economist for Wachovia , wrote that real net exports " likely made very little contribution " to the fourth quarter 's overall rate of GDP growth .
" Looking forward , exports should generally grow faster than imports , which should help to prop up overall GDP growth over the next few quarters , " he wrote .
In a separate report , the Labor Department said import prices were unchanged in December , following a 3.3 % rise in November .
Imported petroleum prices fell 0.6 % in December .
See full story .
Crude story
The big story in November 's trade report was petroleum .
With a $ 7.16 increase in the average price of a barrel of crude oil to a record $ 79.65 , the nation 's crude - oil bill rose to an unprecedented $ 25.2 billion .
Imports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased to a record $ 17 billion .
But the real trade gap widened 3 % in November , even excluding petroleum .
Real imports increased 0.3 % excluding petroleum .
Compared with a year ago , the trade deficit has widened by about 8 % , with exports up 13 % and imports rising 11 % .
The figures are not adjusted for price changes .
The weaker U.S. dollar had been boosting exports as U.S. farmers and producers of other commodities benefited from higher prices and a weaker dollar .
At the same time , imports have slowed because of sagging growth in the U.S. and because imports are relatively more expensive .
The U.S. ca n't cut its demand for petroleum quickly in response to higher prices , however .
Imports from China dropped in November on a seasonally unadjusted basis to $ 29.8 billion , as most of the holiday shipments had already been sent .
Still , it was the second - highest level of Chinese imports after October 's $ 31.6 billion .
The trade gap with China narrowed to $ 24 billion from $ 25.9 billion .
Over the past year , however , the trade gap with China has widened 11.1 % to $ 237.5 billion .
Trade with Canada , Mexico and Europe declined on a seasonally unadjusted basis in November .
Details
Imports of industrial supplies increased 8.5 % to $ 59.2 billion , including a 17 % increase in crude - oil imports .
Imports of capital goods increased 0.4 % , led by telecom equipment .
Imports of foods and feeds rose 2.5 % .
Imports of consumer goods rose 2 % .
Imports of autos increased 0.6 % .
Exports of capital goods fell 2.3 % , led by a 19 % drop in civilian aircraft .
Exports of industrial materials increased 0.7 % , boosted by a 40 % gain in exports of fuel oil .
Exports of foods and feeds increased 5.5 % , led by corn and soybeans .
Exports of autos increased 4.5 % .
Exports of consumer goods increased 0.9 % .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The federal government has released to CNN more than 100 photographs of a Halloween party that temporarily threatened to derail the nomination of a top Department of Homeland Security official .
ICE chief Julie Myers poses with a costume contest winner at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement party .
The images included several digital photos that the official had ordered erased because they were deemed to be inappropriate and offensive .
At the party , Julie Myers , then - acting chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , part of the Department of Homeland Security , gave an award for " most original costume " to an employee wearing prison stripes , a wig with dreadlocks and face - darkening makeup .
Immediately after posing for a photo with the winner , Myers later told Congress , she recognized that she made an error in judgment and ordered the photos deleted from the camera .
Myers said she did not know the employee was wearing skin makeup , but ordered the photos destroyed because she did not think that " recognizing an escaped prisoner in any way was beneficial to the agency 's goal of treating everyone in our custody with dignity and respect . "
This week , in response to the Freedom of Information
Act request filed by CNN on November 6 , ICE released 113 official photographs of the party , including all of the deleted photos , which technicians were able to electronically restore .
An ICE spokeswoman denied the photos were suppressed until after Myers ' job was secure , saying ICE responded in an " efficient time frame " to the FOIA request .
News of the photos ' existence infuriated some members of Congress , who said they should have been made aware of them earlier .
" It is too bad that these photos surfaced too late to have dealt with her nomination , perhaps , in a different way , " said Sen.
Claire McCaskill , D - Missouri , who last November put a " hold " on Myers ' confirmation because of the hubbub .
Watch what congressmen think about party photos »
Myers was confirmed on December 20 .
As an assistant secretary of Homeland Security , she leads ICE , the agency charged with enforcing immigration law in the nation 's interior .
The agency has more than 15,000 employees , including 6,000 investigators .
McCaskill said she believed the photos would have affected the confirmation .
" This is such brutally bad judgment that , to me , it indicates that the leadership of this division is flawed , " she said .
Rep. Bennie Thompson , whose committee oversees ICE , said Wednesday he is upset both by the photos and by ICE 's failure to give the photos to Congress in November .
" I was satisfied [ with Myers ' explanations and apology ] until I found out that these pictures existed , " Thompson said .
An ICE spokeswoman denied that there was any intentional effort to mislead Congress .
" We had asked that they be destroyed , and as far as we knew , that was the case , " spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said .
Myers was " frank and honest about every aspect of that situation from the very beginning , " she said .
An estimated 50 to 75 employees attended the October 31 costume party at ICE headquarters in the District of Columbia .
A poster advertising the contest said costumes should be tasteful and " office appropriate . "
Myers declined to talk to CNN Wednesday , but in written comments to Congress last November , she offered the following account of the incident :
She and two other ICE officials served as judges of the costume contest , and she had " very limited interaction " with the employee in the prisoner costume , who " was present at the [ judging ] table for less than half a minute before he moved on .
" I was not aware at the time of the contest that the employee disguised his skin color , " she wrote .
Nonetheless , after posing for a photo with the employee , she realized it was inappropriate .
" Although I did not know that this individual had disguised his race , I determined that I had made an error in judgment in recognizing an escaped prisoner at this party , " she wrote , and she instructed her chief of staff to direct the official photographer to delete the photos .
In an internal e-mail that was sent at 3:05 p.m. , shortly after the party was to end , the ICE public affairs director , Wendy Burrell , said , " Please make sure that the photos of the most creative ( single male entry ) are destroyed .
They may not be used in any publication , Web site , compilation disk , you name it .
Not just not used .
Please erase all . "
Myers said she was " shocked and horrified " to learn the next day that the employee had used skin- darkening makeup .
The employee was counseled , and Myers sent out a note to all agency employees expressing regret over the event , agency spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in November .
" It is now clear that , however unintended , a few of the costumes were inappropriate and offensive , " Myers wrote .
She reminded employees of their responsibility to complete diversity training and said managers should distribute and discuss ICE 's diversity policy statement during staff meetings .
The employee who donned the inmate costume was placed on two weeks of administrative leave , counseled by a supervisor and returned to full duty .

JERUSALEM , Feb 19 ( Reuters ) - Israel 's shekel ILS= advanced 0.3 percent against the dollar in light activity on Tuesday on the heels of the U.S. currency moving to a two - week low versus the euro .
The shekel ’s official rate was set at 3.5910 per dollar , compared with 3.6020 on Monday .
It was at 3.6010 in trading after the official rate was set and stuck to a narrow range of 3.58 - 3.60 during the session .
The shekel had reached a rate of 3.5780 set on Feb. 4 , its strongest level since April 1998 .
Tel Aviv shares rose 0.8 percent while 10 - year bond prices ILSAHR2683 =TA dipped 0.1 percent .
The shekel is one of the best performing currencies so far in 2008 with a gain of 7 percent against the dollar .
The shekel appreciated by 10 percent in 2007 .
The euro rose 0.5 percent to $ 1.4750 to a two - week peak .
At the same time , the local market was continuing to digest two key inflation reports that appeared to suggest steady monetary policy for the time being .
The consumer price index , issued last Friday , was unchanged in January from December and was up 3.5 percent over the prior 12 months .
Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 0.1 percent month - on - month increase .
On Sunday , the Bank of Israel reported that inflation expectations for the next 12 months increased to 2.6 percent in January from 2.1 percent in December .
Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer has said he would not lower short - term interest rates while inflation pressures persisted .
He has come under pressure from business leaders and some politicians to cut rates to weaken the shekel since the strong Israeli currency was hurting exports .
The shekel has been underpinned by a widening of the Israeli - U.S. rate differential , which is now 1.25 percentage points after the Federal Reserve slashed rates to 3 percent with more U.S. cuts expected .
On the crosses , the shekel traded at 3.3397 per 100 yen compared with 3.3293 on Monday , against the euro at 5.2926 from 5.2731 shekels and against the pound at 7.0055 from 7.0253 .

The Risks of Scanning

The saying " what you do n't know ca n't hurt you " in modern medicine could apply to a trend in healthy adults receiving full body or cardiac CT ( computer tomography ) scans .
In addition to radiation risks , unnecessary CT scans can expose you to a host of problems - from risks of invasive biopsies to aggressive treatments for misdiagnosed cancers .
When ordered by your doctor in the proper setting , any risks of CT scans are far outweighed by their potential benefits .
They are one of modern medicine 's greatest diagnostic tools , used to examine any part of your body and , increasingly , to guide minimally invasive procedures previously performed with surgery .
CT rapidly rotates X - ray beams around you , obtaining images from different angles that a powerful computer then compiles to build , slice by slice , highly detailed pictures of your insides .
Contrast material ( which you either drink or receive through a vein ) is used in some cases to enhance these images .
The impressive level of detail that CT provides can also cause confusion .
In CTs of healthy adults , more than 90 percent of findings are " false positives . "
One of the most common reasons patients are referred to our pulmonary practice at Stanford is for evaluation of tiny lung nodules - detected either incidentally in full - body or cardiac CT scans or on upper slices of an abdominal CT scan .
Studies show that even in smokers , 98 percent of these " incidentalomas " are benign .
( They are often no more than signs of prior infection . )
But to ensure they are not malignant , patients may need further tests or invasive biopsies .
If the diagnosis remains uncertain , they may even end up receiving surgery or chemotherapy for a presumed cancer .
At best , patients with incidentalomas require only repeat CT scans - from every three months to every year ( depending on individual cancer risk factors ) , to watch for growth or change in the abnormality .
But even this follow - up is not without risk .
A CT scan can provide up to 1,000 times the radiation of an X -ray .
A November 2007 New England Journal of Medicine review noted that two to three CT scans could expose patients to the same amount of radiation and cancer risk as the 1945 Japanese nuclear bomb survivors , with relatively higher risk in women and young patients .
In the rare event that an incidentaloma is malignant , you should know that early detection does not necessarily equate with better outcomes .
In a large Mayo Clinic study of lung CT scans in smokers , those with " early - detected " cancers had additional biopsies , surgery ( and probably anxiety ) , but lived no longer than their non-CT high - risk counterparts .
Full - body CT scans cost $ 500 to $ 1,000 .
Insurance companies do not cover the cost , but may use any detected abnormality to raise your premiums or limit future coverage .
There are no public health organizations that advocate the use of full body or cardiac CT scans in healthy adults , and the American College of Radiology and American Heart Association have released statements recommending against them .
Before you decide to schedule your own diagnostic test , consult with your doctor and follow the guidelines of these organizations .
They constantly review all available evidence so you do n't have to .
The notorious claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was not contained in an early draft of the controversial dossier , but the draft version did warn that the country had acquired weaponry intended to " terrorise , intimidate and destabilise " , it was revealed today .
The draft written by John Williams , who at the time was head of press at the Foreign Office , and released today under the Freedom of Information Act , also said that Iraq " was actively assembling an arsenal of terror weapons with which to intimidate its neighbours and the wider international community " .
Williams wrote that Iraq was " developing as a priority longer - range missile systems capable of targeting Nato ( Greece and Turkey ? ) " and " covertly attempting to acquire technology and material for use in nuclear weapons " .
But later in the document it was noted that Iraq would " find it difficult to produce fissile material [ for nuclear weapons ] while sanctions remain in place " .
Williams also qualified concerns about the regime 's chemical weapons capability by adding he could not be sure " whether these [ weapons ] have been destroyed " .
The former Daily Mirror journalist referred to a number of atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein , who he said " maintained power by torture , rape and execution " .
He referred to the late dictator 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the 1998 chemical weapons attack on the village of Halabja , which killed some 5,000 Kurds .
The 45 - minute claim became a key plank of the government 's case for going to war and Tony Blair was subsequently accused of " sexing up " the dossier with the help of spin doctors .
The content of today 's draft was considered significant because the government has claimed that the dossier eventually published in September 2002 was the work of the joint intelligence committee and its chairman , John Scarlett , and that the so - called " Williams draft " had little influence on the final version .
The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , Edward Davey , said that the " core analysis " was " the same in both documents " .
" The government cannot continue to deny the major role that spin doctors played in creating this dossier , " he said .
" A press official should never have been drafting a document that ended up being used as the justification for going to war .
Researcher Chris Ames had campaigned for three years for release of the document before a tribunal finally ruled in his favour last month .
Williams noted in his dossier that the Foreign Office could not publish everything it knew because it " would put people 's lives at risk " but added : " The public deserves as much knowledge as possible " .

After a jury found Jackson County Commissioner Mike Brown not guilty Wednesday , the woman who accused him of sexual assault cried and leaned her head on a friend as a somber Brown walked slowly past .
" I am glad it is over , " said Brown , 61 , who appeared tired and was unwilling to say much .
A jury , after deliberating for about 10 hours over two days , found him not guilty Wednesday of fourth - degree criminal sexual conduct , a misdemeanor , and attempted third - degree criminal sexual conduct , a felony .
Defense attorney Alfred Brandt said he was not surprised by the decision .
" Ultimately , it comes down to two people in a car .
One person has one version .
The other person has another version .
How do you prove it beyond a reasonable doubt ? "
He said Brown is relieved the ordeal is over .
" Hopefully , he goes on with his life and , hopefully , the young lady goes on with her life , " Brandt said .
The verdict had his accuser in tears .
" I am shocked , and he even admitted it , " the 24 - year - old said , referring to Brown 's testimony that he tried to push her face into his lap .
The Citizen Patriot generally does not identify sexual assault complainants .
She said she tried to protect other people from Brown .
" You try to protect ( others from Brown ) , and you get screwed , " she said as she embraced her mother outside the courtroom .
" It 's over .
You tried , honey , " her mother told her .
Her father was obviously upset with the verdict .
He approached Brown in the courtroom hallway , only to have court employees pull him away .
After the confrontation , Brown stood in a locked room until a court officer , for Brown 's safety , escorted him out of the building .
Brown was accused of fondling the woman and forcing her hand onto him .
He testified he exposed himself to her and tried to push her head into his lap , hoping she would perform a sex act , while the two sat in his car June 17 outside the Middle School at Parkside in Jackson .
Brown had given the woman a ride home from Ted 's Firehouse Pub in Jackson .
Jurors said they did not believe Brown exerted the force necessary to qualify his actions as sex crimes .
Michigan law says a person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct if " force or coercion is used to accomplish the sexual conduct . "
Juror Rudy Nowles said the jury asked Circuit Judge Thomas Wilson , who presided over the trial , for clarification on the definition of forced sexual conduct .
" And that 's what decided it , " said Nowles , 63 , of Jackson .
Nowles said he and other jurors concluded the accuser and Brown " both made big mistakes . "
" They are both stupid , " Nowles said .
" There is no law against that . "
Jurors  who began deliberating about 2:25 p.m. Tuesday and reached their verdict about 4 p.m.
Wednesday after spending Tuesday night away from the courthouse  were close to being a hung jury , said juror Aimee Mason of Jackson .
Mason and juror Debbi Seelinger of Jackson said they believed the victim 's testimony , but could not find Brown used coercion .
In taped telephone conversations with the victim that were played in court , Brown apologized profusely for his actions , saying he was ashamed and blaming the ordeal on excessive alcohol .
The prosecution argued that the woman , more than once , refused Brown 's advances and , according to a DVD played at the trial , she testified that he had her " terrified . "
Brown 's defense lawyer argued that her behavior while the two hung out at the bar and her mild response to his initial come - ons led Brown to believe she was physically receptive to him .
This did not please the victim 's family , who sat through the trial and milled about the fifth floor of the courthouse for hours while awaiting a verdict .
Brown , who coordinates the Hot Air Jubilee and organizes an annual Toys for Tots drive , declined to say much about the trial or his future .
" I 've been advised to just relax , " he said .
By prevailing in the trial , Brown is able to retain his seat on the county Board of Commissioners .
He would have been forced to step down if he had been convicted of a felony .
County officials were largely quiet on the issue as the case made its way through the court system .
Upon hearing the verdict , board Chairman Steve Shotwell said simply , " I 'm glad it 's over . "
Said acting county Administrator Randy Treacher : " The system has spoken and it goes from there . "
— Staff writers Dana DeFever , Chad Livengood and Kristin Longley contributed to this story .
Several Cathay crew and executives were on board
Captain Ian Wilkinson flew the Cathay Pacific plane within 28 feet of the ground with its undercarriage raised , at Boeing 's Seattle airfield .
The aircraft was on its delivery flight and packed with the airline 's VIPs .
The airline said Capt Wilkinson , 55 , had not sought or obtained permission for the fly - by on January 30 , and had been dismissed .
The co-pilot , Ray Middleton , has also been " subject to disciplinary actions " - understood to be suspension from training duties for six months .
Internet interest
Pictures of the huge aircraft flying just feet from the ground were posted on websites including YouTube .
There were 69 people on board , including Cathay 's UK chairman Chris Pratt .
The airline said : " We can confirm a fly - by event involving the delivery flight of a Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft departing from the manufacturer 's plant in Seattle on January 30 , 2008 .
" The airline is conducting an internal investigation into the incident , including the collection of flight data , and interviews with the crew involved . "
It had issued a notice to all cockpit crew reminding them of the company 's " well - established " approval policy for conducting fly - bys .

The San Francisco - based company , doubleTwist , is releasing a service that makes it easy for consumers to share both user - generated and professionally created audio , photos and video clips via computers , certain mobile phones or PSP game players .
Beyond computer - to - computer media - sharing , doubleTwist lets users synchronize media sitting on their computers to mobile devices they or their friends own , simply by “ dragging and dropping ” media files into a desktop folder that then drops copies of the media files onto the mobile devices over the Web .
The software initially can share files with Sony 's 6758.T PSP game console , Nokia 's NOK1V .HE multimedia N - series phone line , Sony Ericsson 's Walkman and Cybershop lines , LG's Viewty , and Microsoft's MSFT .
O Windows Mobile smartphones such as Palm's PALM .O Treo and HTC 2498 .
TW models .
Users can choose to share as many or as few media files as they wish with specific friends .
DoubleTwist software converts media stored in one file format to formats used by the other devices , making it possible to create common playlists that mix songs from Apple iTunes on non-Apple devices , double Twist said .
DoubleTwist ’s trick for opening up copy - protected formats is to replay a song in fast - forward mode and capture a copy of the audio track by re-recording it .
It ’s essentially the same process as when a user “ rips , ” or copies , a CD onto a computer .
“ Users can only play back the music they have already purchased and they are authorized to play , ” said Monique Farantzos , 34 , doubleTwists ’s co-founder and chief executive .
One hundred songs can be converted in half an hour or so .
DoubleTwist estimates the trick results in about a 5 percent degradation in sound - quality , similar to CD duplication .
Friends can listen to copy - protected songs that doubleTwist users have shared with them , whether or not they own the rights themselves , the company said .
DoubleTwist said it has created a legal technique that balances consumers desire to share media with their friends without unleashing a new wave of wholesale piracy of copyrighted content from Napster - like file - sharing services .
Nearly a decade ago , Napster popularized the idea of ripping digital music from compact discs and sharing it over the Web more or less anonymously with other music fans .
Napster and successor file - sharing services were forced to shut down when record labels filed a wave of lawsuits to halt the trend .
DoubleTwist officials said they are not enabling open file - sharing .
“ All we are facilitating are friends sending things to one another , ” Farantzos said .
The company believes that its service is within the mainstream of what the music industry is trying to do by doing away with copy protection on songs sold through Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O , for example .
DoubleTwist said it has not informed Apple of their plans , but that they expect no pushback .
DoubleTwist also disclosed it has received an undisclosed amount of first - round funding from Norway ’s NorthZone Ventures and Geneva - based Index Ventures , which was an early backer of Skype , Last.fm and MySQL before their eventual sale to larger companies .
As a 16 - year - old teenager in Norway , Johansen sparked a similar legal controversy when he published code to break copy - protection for Hollywood movies .
Now 24 , Johansen , doubleTwist ’s chief technology officer , has remained on the frontline of such controversies and has had several run-ins with Apple over efforts to help consumers “ liberate ” music from iTunes ’ copy protection regime .
Triumph for secularism at Oxford Union
“ This house believes that the ideal state is a secular state ” .
This was the motion proposed by NSS Executive Director , Keith Porteous Wood , at the Oxford Union last week , which was carried 220 votes for and 170 against .
He was supported in his endeavours by Peter Hughes , President of the Oxford Secular Society .
The debate was reported worldwide not because of the NSS ’s victory , unfortunately , but because it was also billed as a memorial debate for Benazir Bhutto , who had been president of the Oxford Union 30 years ago – the first Asian woman to hold the post .
Also present last week — with MI5 and police protection — was Benazir ’s 19 - year - old son Bilawal who is studying at Oxford .
Keith was opposed by the bishop of Worcester , John Inge and David Holloway , one of the founders of the Christian Institute and heavily involved in the Vardy Academies in the north - East .
Keith commented : “ Our record of success on theological arguments at the OU has been thin ; the Christian Unions and other religious groups turn out in force to support their god , and usually swing the vote . ”
A fuller report of the debate will appear in the forthcoming NSS Bulletin .

I happened to catch this little gem by accident and missed the very beginning of it , but this is rich .
Here are Mr. Gannon / Guckert 's own words from the video when asked about the male escort scandal :
Well , there 's not much to say about that .
You know it , after two and a half years , there 's nothing to it .
I mean there 's a lot of , of rumor and Internet gossip and you know " responsible journalists " payed some attention to that in the beginning and afterwards they decided there 's nothing there .
So .
So what Mr. Gannon ?
So those screen shots of your web site before they took it down were Photoshopped or you really did n't go into the White House how many hundreds of times without signing out so anyone would know when you left , and you really were n't a gay hooker asking softball questions to Scotty - boy ?
He 's going on a tour of college campuses to promote the book .
Oh joy !
We can only hope he gets treated as warmly as Gonzo .

my high school freshman english teacher had us read ayn rand 's " anthem " and i fell in love .
over the next few years i bought or was given several of her books .
however , any time i'd start reading one of them , my mom would say that i was acting like an asshole .
i had to assume that there was some correlation .now , i sorta consider myself an anti-capitalist anarchist .
if you have to put a label on it .
but i still have all these ayn rand books .
perhaps you have a similar yet opposite story and we can respectfully trade off the errors of our youth .
the books that i have and their condition are the following : ** atlas shrugged - - bought new , but well worn .
i actually read this book a few times ** we the living -- bought used , so it 's got that used book aging yellow musty - ness to it ; never fully read by me .** the fountainhead - - ok i'm actually not entirely sure that i have this one still .
but i know that i did at some point .
so this book may not be included .
however , if it is it was bought used ; never fully read by me .** capitalism : the unknown ideal - - bought new .
prolly some creases is the binding ** the virtue of selfishness -- bought now .
prolly some creases in the bindingand because , dear reader , i am feeling especially giving , i will also include ayn rand 's interview with playboy .
unfortunately , just the transcripts .
no nudie shots .i'm looking for anarcy books , commie books , um ... pretty much anything else .
and in case any of you randroids might not have something suitable on your shelves , i'll of course accept cold hard cash .( due to the harm that this caused in my relationship with my mother , i am trying not to give these books to minors . )
For those who are too young to remember , early miners had a cage in their mines inhabited by canaries as an insurance policy against an explosion caused by methane gas or other deadly toxin (s ) that could endanger their mine .
The canary had small lungs and was particularly susceptible to these gasses , so if you noticed the canary had died or was acting sickly , it was time to high - tail it out of the mine until the problem could be fixed .
If only our problem was that simple , because with us , it ’s more than a canary dying , and other than migrating to other worlds which is decades or more away , man is destined to stay on earth and gradually witness the “ canaries ” of all types dying by the millions .
No , I ’m not exaggerating , although I wish I were .
It began a few years ago when I noticed that Butterflies were no longer in the abundance they were when I was a child ; it was an innocent discovery , as I was attempting to show another child the wonderment of nature , something I had always enjoyed when I was growing - up which was now a matter of happenstance rather than the norm .
Something had changed and I had an eerie feeling that whatever was missing was far beyond what I could see or hear .
The Internet was n’t as fast back then , nor were the search capabilities what they are today , so I let it go until another day , shrugging off what was one of the first warnings that our world was dying even as we ignored the warning signs and casually went about our lives .
It turns out that the butterflies were dying , not just in the United States , but in several locations around the world .
The beautiful Monarch Butterfly I remember as a child and was attempting to show to my niece was dying out , and it was thought that millions of Monarchs had died because of over - logging :
Dying Monarchs - Updates - butterfly - Brief Article : The Environmental Magazine , May - June , 2002 by Chas OffuttConsidered an endangered phenomenon , the monarch butterfly ’s arduous migration stretches 3,000 miles from the Rocky Mountains to Oyamel fir forests in central Mexico ( see “ The Monarch ’s Perilous Flight , ” In Brief , July / August 1998 ) .
The World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) announced that logging in and around the Mexican sanctuaries Sierra Chincua and El Rosario are the likely root causes of an estimated 250 million frozen butterflies during a mid-January winter storm .
Butterfly biologist Lincoln P. Brower says up to 80 percent of the butterflies might have died from severe weather combined with the lack of tree cover , which exposed the insects to wind , rain and cold .

It was n’t just California and Mexico that were affected , and from several corners of the earth we have heard of Butterflies dying - off in massive numbers :
Britain ’s butterflies are dying out Updated 01 November 2001 , 19.56 Britain ’s butterflies are disappearing because we are destroying the places where they live .
Around three quarters of Britain ’s butterfly species have dropped in numbers during the last 30 years , even though the weather has changed to suit them .
Butterflies like hot weather , and the change in the global climate should have helped them .

Also , for North America there is this sobering report , and we ’re still miles from the tip of the iceberg :

- Edith ’s checkerspot butterflies dying off in southern North America as populations in northern North America expand - Science News , August 31 , 1996 by Janet Raloff Edith ’s checkerspot butterflies inhabit patches of fields , rocky hills , and alpine terraces from Baja California to British Columbia .
But throughout their lives , they do n’t roam far .
An entire population can confine its existence for decades to a piece of land 100 by 100 meters .
Yet as a species , new data show , this butterfly is moving northward - big time .
Camille Parmesan of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis , at the University of California , Santa Barbara , has just completed a census of 151 previously reported populations scattered along the west coast of North America .
Because they are such stay - at - homes , the butterflies ’ apparent northward trek actually reflects large numbers of populations dying off at the southern end of their range and presumably new populations in the north .

Over the past two decades , a growing share of the public has come to the view that American society is divided into two groups , the “ haves ” and the “ have - nots . ”
Today , Americans are split evenly on the two - class question with as many saying the country is divided along economic lines as say this is not the case ( 48 % each ) .
In sharp contrast , in 1988 , 71 % rejected this notion , while just 26 % saw a divided nation .
Of equal importance , the number of Americans who see themselves among the “ have - nots ” of society has doubled over the past two decades , from 17 % in 1988 to 34 % today .
In 1988 , far more Americans said that , if they had to choose , they probably were among the “ haves ” ( 59 % ) than the “ have - nots ” ( 17 % ) .
Today , this gap is far narrower ( 45 % “ haves ” vs. 34 % “ have - nots ” ) .
These shifting attitudes have occurred gradually over the past two decades , although the perception of personal financial stringency appears to have risen more rapidly in recent years .
As recently as 2001 , a 52 % - majority still viewed themselves as resting on the positive side of the economic balance , compared with 32 % who felt they were monetarily in need .
Since then the number of self - described “ haves ” has fallen by seven percentage points , a decline as large as that which occurred over the previous 13 years .
The share of Americans who see the country as divided along economic lines has also continued to tick upward , though at a somewhat slower rate in recent years ( Have / have - not perceptions rose by 18 points over the 13 years between 1988 and 2001 compared with a rise of four points over the last six years ) .
The increased prevalence of both views — that the country is increasingly divided along economic lines and that a given individual is on the wrong side of that divide — finds support in national economic data .
As numerous studies have demonstrated in recent years , income gains over the last few decades have been heavily concentrated at the very top of the income distribution .
For example , in an update of their earlier study of long - term U.S. income trends , 1 economists Piketty and Saez compute that the share of income going to families in the top 1 % of the income scale has doubled from 8 % in 1980 to 16 % in 2004 even excluding capital gains .
2
( For a review of other recent studies see an earlier Pew commentary , “ Pinched Pocketbooks : Do Average Americans Spot Something That Most Economists Miss ?
“ 3 )
Meanwhile , Congressional Budget Office data4 show that despite the increase in the number of families with two or more earners and widespread income gains in the latter half of the 1990s , families in the middle fifth of the income distribution realized only a modest $ 6,600 increase in annual income between 1988 and 2004 , while the top 1 % of families saw their incomes rise from $ 839,100 to an average $ 1,259,700 .
Recently released Census Bureau data show that in 2006 , median household income adjusted for inflation was still 2.1 % below its 1999 level .5
More sensationally , Bloomberg.com recently reported on a study showing that “ top private - equity and hedge fund managers made more in 10 minutes than average - paid U.S. workers earned all of last year . ”
6
Factors Driving Perceptions of an Economic Divide
These objective facts of economic life might seem , at first glance , to be the primary source of the rising perception of a have / have - not nation .
And the trends are surely reflected in the growing numbers of Americans who view themselves personally as on the wrong side of that divide .
But in judgments about the larger state of the country Americans have traditionally turned a deaf ear to commentaries or analyses that might be characterized as evocative of class warfare , whether grounded in objective facts or not .
Successive Pew Global Attitudes polls , for example , find that at every income level , Americans are far more likely than Europeans to believe that individuals , not society , are responsible for their own failures , economic and otherwise .
7
Also , economists have pointed to other factors contributing to modest economic gains among middle - income households — such as an aging population and smaller families — that do not necessarily suggest a growing socioeconomic divide among wage and salary earners , as well as to higher levels of consumption and expectations across the income board .
Analysis of polling data over the years also strongly suggests that the growing perception of societal divide is driven as much by political factors as by economic ones .
Not that the phenomenon is restricted to those of one political persuasion : Republicans as well as Democrats have recorded an increase among party adherents who see a have / have - not divide : Between 1988 and 2001 , the number of Republicans viewing the country as so divided increased from 19 % to 34 % , declining slightly since then to 33 % but still resulting in a net increase of 14 points over the period .
But the rise in the number of Democrats perceiving a divided society started from a higher base ( 32 % ) and has risen continuously .
Now , in 2007 , fully 63 % of Democrats see a social divide , a share nearly twice as great as that seen among Republicans .
As a result , the increased perception of societal division in recent years coincides with a widening partisan gap in views of American society .
Differences in the current prevalence of this view across other demographic groups are far more modest by comparison , as seen in the table .
Although upper - income Americans are less prone to see a divide than are those with middle - or lower - incomes , and college grads are less likely than those with lesser education , only the difference between black and white adults ( 67 % and 45 % respectively ) rivals the partisan gap in size .
Nor are substantial differences seen in the degree to which persons in various income and demographic categories have become more likely to see a “ have / have - not ” division over the 1988 - to - 2007 period .
One exception is that people who are middle - aged record a somewhat higher percentage - point increase in this perception compared with other age groups .
The same is true of people living in the eastern part of the country compared with those in other regions .
But these within - category variations are dwarfed by the political affiliation divide .
This tendency to view the national economy through the prism of politics is not a new phenomenon :
Over the last two decades , the gap between Republicans and Democrats on opinions about income distribution has consistently been larger than the gap between upper - and lower - income respondents .
Nor is this partisan cleavage unique to opinions about the nation ’s economic divide .
As earlier Pew analysis has shown , a similarly strong political influence is observed in judgments about the current and future state of the national economy .
8
As noted there , the causal link between political party affiliation and perceptions about the larger state of the economy and the nation may operate in both directions :
Families in the top income - tiers are both heavily Republican and , understandably , more likely to look with favor upon the nation ’s larger economy and their own place within it .
Still while many people may view both their choice of political party and the state of the nation through the prism of personal economic circumstance , other factors may dominate .
For example , evangelical Christians are among the GOP ’s strongest adherents , yet Pew surveys find that their average incomes are somewhat lower than those of other Protestants or of seculars .
To filter out the independent effects of party affiliation , income and other demographic variables including income , race , sex and education , multiple regression analyses were run on the July 2007 data .
As seen in the chart , political party affiliation is far and away the most important independent determinant of views about whether the country is divided between “ haves ” and “ have - nots . ”
Race is the second most important determinant , though its potency is only half that of party while income and education have virtually no independent effect on such perceptions .
Which Side of the Divide Are You On ?
This sharp partisan partition is not observed , however , when the focus shifts from the state of the nation to the state of one ’s personal finances .
Not surprisingly , views about one ’s own position relative to the income divide are heavily influenced by the independent factor of personal income .
While party affiliation remains a significant influence , it is dominated by the objective reality of economic status as well , to a lesser degree , by race .
A more detailed look at the increased prevalence of have - not status across various economic and demographic categories shows surprisingly little variation across groups .
Although Republicans remain more likely to see themselves as among society ’s “ haves , ” ( 50 % do so now , as compared with 44 % of Democrats ) , both groups record a substantial decline in the share of those who count themselves among the economically favored ( 13 % and 12 % respectively ) .
Declines in perceived personal economic status vary little among those in the top , middle and bottom thirds of the income distribution .
However , middle - income families record the largest drop ( from a solid 61 % - majority in 1988 to a 43 % - minority in 2007 ) in the number of those seeing themselves as among America ’s “ haves . ”
Among age groups , young people ( ages 18 - 29 ) are the most likely to see themselves as “ haves , ” although the share taking that view fell by a sizeable 19 percentage points over the years between 1988 and 2007 .
Those ages 30 - 49 experienced a similar decline in perceptions of “ have - ness ” but starting from a lower base so that the middle - aged are now the most likely age group to classify themselves as “ have - nots . ”
Interestingly , the elderly ( 65 and over ) , while recording a substantial gain in perceptions of economic status in 2001 ( 59 % haves vs. 45 % in 1988 ) have now reverted to their 1988 reading .
Women are more likely to see themselves as have - nots ( 37 % ) than are men ( 30 % ) and the gap between the sexes has widened slightly since 1988 .
Across geographic regions , persons residing in the South experienced the smallest decline in the number classifying themselves as “ haves ” ( minus 10 percentage points compared with declines of 15 points in the East and West and 17 points in the Midwest ) .
As a result , the South now registers , by a small margin , as the economically most satisfied region in the country .
Haves , Have - Nots and Horse Races
What ramifications might these differing perceptions of a socioeconomic divide have for the coming 2008 primary elections ?
At the moment the likely impact seems slight .
A look at voter preferences among the leading candidates in both political parties at the end of July shows little if any difference between those who see the country divided between haves and have - nots and those who see no such schism .
On the Republican side , the only significant difference is a somewhat stronger showing for John McCain among those who see a divide than among those who do not , a preference perhaps accounted for by the higher proportion of Republican - leaning independents among his supporters .
On the Democratic side , only Barack Obama receives significantly stronger support among those seeing America as a nation split along economic lines — nearly a quarter ( 24 % ) of such — name him as their preferred Democratic candidate for president compared with 16 % among those seeing no such divide – a finding consistent with other analyses showing Obama recording greater popularity among liberal Democrats than among other factions of the party .
By contrast , John Edwards , despite his overtly populist campaign message , draws equal support from those on their side of the “ divide ” divide .
This is not to say that such perceptions will not play some role in the subsequent general election .
But given the strong correlation between partisan preference and public opinion on the issue , it seems unlikely that the have / have - not question will play a strong independent role in the final outcome .

Sy Hersh confirms : Syrian facility bombed by Israel was not nuclear
After Israel bombed a Syrian military facility last September , the United States and Israel both claimed the target had been a Syrian nuclear facility under construction .
RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna was alone at the time in reporting that the actual target was a cache of North Korean No-Dong missiles , dating back to the 1990's , which Syria was converting for use as chemical warheads .
In a follow - up report , Alexandrovna added that Vice President Dick Cheney was suspected of being behind leaks to the press of misleading claims of a nuclear basis for the incident .
A third story in Alexandrovna 's series reported that the US and Israel were refusing to cooperate with an attempted investigation by the International Atomic Energy Agency , but that the IAEA had concluded on the basis of satellite imagery that the target was unlikely to have been nuclear .
However , the US / Israeli version continued to dominate most accounts of the incident .
As recently as December , the Sunday Times was still insisting that " Israel 's top - secret air raid on Syria in September destroyed a bomb factory assembling warheads fuelled by North Korean plutonium . "
Now veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has weighed in on the matter .
Hersh appeared on CNN's Late Edition on Sunday to discuss his upcoming article , " A Strike in the Dark , " which will appear in the Feb. 11 issue of the New Yorker .
Hersh writes in that article , " Whatever was under construction , with North Korean help , it apparently had little to do with agriculture -- or with nuclear reactors -- but much to do with Syria 's defense posture , and its military relationship with North Korea .
And that , perhaps , was enough to silence the Syrian government after the September 6th bombing . "
" This is a wonderful sort of a complicated story , " Hersh told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
" Here Israel bombs another country , basically an act of war .
...
They do n't say anything publicly about it .
The Israeli great ally , the United States , says nothing .
Syria does n't say much about it .
They complain , but they 're very muted too .
... Nobody talks about it . "
Hersh went on to say that even though nobody was talking publicly , " there was tremendous sotto voce stuff .
In other words , the Israeli government , the American government were leaking , telling newspaper people , particularly in America , but also in Europe , all sorts of wonderful , grandiose details about what happened . "
Hersh finally concluded as a result of his investigation that the claims that " when you began to look at each part ... they sort of fall apart . "
He is not even convinced the plant was a chemical warfare facility but believes it may have been a missile plant .
" Israel may indeed have some evidence that 's overwhelming , " Hersh stated .
" But without that sort of evidence , what they 've done is , they 've simply bombed another country . "
Hersh 's best guess as to the motivation of the bombing is that it was partly Israeli politics and partly " a message for the Iranians that we 're coming . "

Forget an extravagant bouquet of roses or an exquisitely packaged box of chocolates this Valentine 's Day .
If you want to be a good lover , start thinking about the impact your romance has on the environment .
Campaigners say the traditional tokens of affection exchanged on February 14 should be ditched because they damage the planet .
Instead , couples should be striving to " enjoy a greener romance " - at least according to a pressure group in Wales .
Waste Awareness
Wales is promoting e-cards to try to reduce the waste caused by the 13 million Valentine 's cards bought in Britain each year .
Couples are also being urged to make their own cards from left - over wrapping paper .
Other advice includes buying flowers planted in a pot instead of a bunch of cut ones .
Those who insist on buying chocolates are urged to buy ones with the least packaging .
Better presents than those involving packaging are " waste - free " gifts such as theatre tickets .
People wishing to cook a romantic meal are advised to check the quantities of food required for their recipe so they do not waste food by making too much .
They are also urged to compost any peelings .
Last night , however , the Welsh Assembly - funded campaign was branded a waste of money .
Matthew Elliot of the TaxPayers '
Alliance said : " People do n't pay their taxes for killjoys to lecture them about e-cards on Valentine 's Day .
" This would be laughable if it was n't for the fact this money is so sorely needed elsewhere . "
We all tend to focus on the evil men in the world and forget some of the truly evil women that have lived .
I hope to correct that with this list .
Here we have not just serial killers , but other utterly despicable women who have caused tragedy in many people ’s lives .
So , without further ado , here are the top 10 most evil women in history .

Mary was the only child of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon to live past infancy .
Crowned after the death of Edward VI and the removal of The Nine Days Queen - Lady Jane Grey , Mary is chiefly remembered for temporarily and violently returning England to Catholicism .
Many prominent Protestants were executed for their beliefs leading to the moniker “ Bloody Mary ” .
Fearing the gallows a further 800 Protestants left the country , unable to return until her death .
It should be noted that Elizabeth I shares position 10 on this list for her equally bad behavior .
9 Myra Hindley
Born : 1942 ; Died : 2002

Myra Hindley and Ian Brady were responsible for the “ Moors murders ” occurring in the Manchester area of Britain in the mid 1960 ’s .
Together these two monsters were responsible for the kidnapping , sexual abuse , torture and murder of three children under the age of twelve and two teenagers , aged 16 and 17 .
A key found in Myra ’s possession led to incriminating evidence stored at a left - luggage depot at Manchester Central Station .
The evidence included a tape recording of one of the murder victims screaming as Hindley and Brady raped and tortured her .
In the final days before incarceration , she developed a swagger and arrogant attitude that became her trademark .
Police secretary Sandra Wilkinson has never forgotten seeing Hindley and her mother Nellie , leaning against the courthouse eating sweets .
While the mother was obviously and understandably upset , Hindley seemed indifferent and uncaring of her situation .
8 Isabella of Castile
Born : 1451 ; Died : 1504
Isabella I of Spain , well known as the patron of Christopher Columbus , with her husband Ferdinand II of Aragon , are responsible for making possible the unification of Spain under their grandson Carlos I .
As part of the drive for unification , Isabella appointed Tomás de Torquemada as the first Inquisitor General of the inquisition .
March 31 , 1492 marks the implementation of the Alhambra Decree ; expulsion edicts forcing the removal or conversion of Jews and Muslims .
Roughly 200,000 people left Spain ; those remaining who chose conversion were subsequently persecuted by the inquisition investigating Judaizing conversos .
In 1974 , Pope Paul VI opened her cause for beatification .
This places her on the path toward possible sainthood .
In the Catholic Church , she is thus titled Servant of God .
7 Beverly Allitt
Born : 1968
The “ Angel of Death , Beverley Gail Allit , is one of Britain ’s most well known serial killers .
Working as a pediatric nurse , she is responsible for the murder of 4 children and the serious injury of 5 others in her care .
When available , insulin or potassium injections were used to precipitate cardiac arrest ; smothering sufficed when they were not .
Although convicted with death or injury in nine cases , Allit attacked thirteen children over a fifty - eight day period before being caught red-handed .
Allit has never spoken of the motive for her crimes , but Munchausen ’s Syndrome by Proxy explains her actions .
This debatable personality disorder involves a pattern of abuse or harm to someone in your care in order to garner attention ( Alitt was known as a child to wear bandages and casts over wounds , but would not allow them to be examined ) .
6 Belle Gunness
Born : 1859 ; Died : 1931
Belle Gunness was one of America ’s most degenerate and productive female serial killers .
Standing 6 ft ( 1.83 m ) tall and weighing in at over 200 lbs ( 91 kg ) , she was an imposing and powerful woman of Norwegian descent .
It is likely that she killed both her husbands and all of her children at different times , but it is certain that she murdered most of her suitors , boyfriends , and her two daughters , Myrtle and Lucy .
The motive was greed - pure and simple ; life insurance policies and assets stolen or swindled from her suitors became her source of income .
Most reports put her death toll at more than twenty victims over several decades , with some claiming in excess of one hundred .
Inconsistencies during her post mortem examination ; the corpse was reported to be two inches shorter than Belle ’s six feet , paved the way for Belle Gunnes to enter American criminal folklore , a female Bluebeard .

5 Mary Ann Cotton
Born : 1832 ; Died : 1873
Englishwoman Mary Ann Cotton is another for - profit serial killer , predating Belle Gunnes by thirty years .
Married at age twenty to William Mowbray , the newlyweds settled in Plymouth , Devon , to start their family .
The couple had five children , four of whom died of ‘ gastric fever and stomach pains ’ .
Moving back to the north - east , tragedy seemed to follow them ; three more children born , three more children died .
William soon followed his offspring , dying of an ‘ intestinal disorder ’ in January 1865 .
British Prudential promptly paid a 35 pound dividend , and a pattern was established .
Her second husband , George Ward , died of intestinal problems as well as one of her two remaining children .
The power of the press , always a force to be reckoned with , caught up with Mary Ann .
The local newspapers discovered that as Mary Ann moved around northern England , she lost three husbands , a lover , a friend , her mother and a dozen children , all dying of stomach fever .
She was hanged at Durham County Gaol , March 24 , 1873 , for murder by arsenic poisoning .
She died slowly , the hangman using too short a drop for a ‘ clean ’ execution .
4 Ilse Koch
Born : 1906 ; Died : 1967
“ Die Hexe von Buchenwald ” the Witch of Buchenwald , or “ Buchenwälder Schlampe ” the Bitch of Buchenwald was the wife of Karl Koch , commandant of the concentration camps Buchenwald from 1937 to 1941 , and Majdanek from 1941 to 1943 .
Drunk on the absolute power rendered by her husband , she reveled in torture and obscenity .
Infamous for her souvenirs ; tattoos taken from the murdered inmates , her reputation for debauchery was well earned .
After building an indoor sports arena in 1940 , with 250,000 marks stolen from inmates , Ilsa was promoted to Oberaufseherin or “ chief overseer ” of the few female guards at Buchenwald .
She committed suicide by hanging herself at Aichach women ’s prison on September 1 , 1967 .
3 Irma Grese
Born : 1923 ; Died : 1945
Another product of the Nazi ’s final solution , Irma Grese or the “ Bitch of Belsen ” was a guard at concentration camps Ravensbrück , Auschwitz and Bergen - Belsen .
Transferred to Auschwitz in 1943 , ( she must have shown particular enthusiasm and dedication to the job ) , she was promoted to Senior Supervisor , the 2nd highest ranking female in camp , by the end of the year .
In charge of over 30,000 Jewish female prisoners , she reveled in her work .
Her work included ; savaging of prisoners by her trained and half starved dogs , sexual excesses , arbitrary shootings , sadistic beatings with a plaited whip , and selecting prisoners for the gas chamber .
She enjoyed both physical and emotional torture and habitually wore heavy boots and carried a pistol to facilitate both .
2 Katherine Knight
Born : 1956
The first Australian woman to be sentenced to a natural life term without parole , Katherine Knight had a history of violence in relationships .
She mashed the dentures of one of her ex-husbands and slashed the throat of another husband ’s eight - week - old puppy before his eyes .
A heated relationship with John Charles Thomas Price became public knowledge with an Apprehended Violence Order that Price had filed against Knight and ended with Knight stabbing Price to death with a butcher ’s knife .
He had been stabbed at least 37 times , both front and back , with many of the wounds penetrating vital organs .
She then skinned him and hung his “ suit ” from the door frame in the living room , cut off his head and put it in the soup pot , baked his buttocks , and prepared gravy and vegetables to accompany the ‘ roast ’ .
The meal and a vindictive note were set out for the children , luckily discovered by police before they arrived home .
1 Elizabeth Bathory
Born : 1560 ; Died : 1614
Countess Elizabeth Bathory is considered the most infamous serial killer in Hungarian / Slovak history .
Rumors had circulated for years about missing peasant girls ; offered well paid work at the castle , they were never seen again .
One of these rumors reached the ears of King Mathias II , who sent a party of men to the massive Castle Csejthe .
The men found one girl dead and one dying .
Another was found wounded and others locked up .
Described atrocities , collected from testimony of witnesses , include ; severe beatings over extended periods of time , the use of needles , burning or mutilation of hands , sometimes also of faces and genitalia , biting the flesh off the faces , arms and other bodily parts , and the starving of victims .
The victim total is thought to number in the hundreds occurring over a twenty - five year period .
Due to her social status she was never brought to trial but remained under house arrest in a single room until her death .
The idea that the Countess bathed in the blood of her victims is folklore , and one of the few things she did not do .

With so many people spending so much time at the computer , carpal tunnel syndrome has taken off in the last few years .
Designers and engineers are fighting back with ergonomically - designed keyboards , mice , and other peripherals .
One of the best purchases I ever made is a mousepad with a wrist pillow ; that red streak I thought was permanent is finally gone from my wrist !
But everyone has a different hand , and a different way of using it .
What if you could design your own mouse ?
Better yet , what if you could change that design whenever you wanted ?
That 's what the Moldable Mouse from Lite - On Technology is all about .
It is made of modeling clay , covered with fabric .
Knead it into any shape you like !
The only rigid part is the base , where the batteries and circuit board are .
Wireless technology makes it all possible , as the click buttons and scroll pad are powered by RFID and can be stuck on anywhere .
Once molded , the shape is self - retaining .
That is , as long as you want it to be .
If you decide your shape is n't perfect after all , or when your hand gets tired and you want a change , you can mold it again .
Modern components are so small that the bulk of a mouse is only neccessary in order to fit our human hands , so it makes sense that we should be able to manipulate that bulk to fit our hands the best way possible .
I see a couple of possible drawbacks .
The obvious one is that you 'd spend too much time playing with it and not enough time doing your actual work .
That 's a common problem and not a design fault .
But how would you clean it ?
Phones , doorknobs , and keyboards are notorious germ farms because people touch them so much .
A computer mouse is the same way , but a h ard plastic mouse can be wiped off and even disinfected occasionally .
A fabric - covered mouse might be pretty grungy after a year or so of daily use .
The Moldable Mouse won a red dot award for design concept in 2007 .

Analyzing the neutrality of referees during 12 German premier league ( 1. Bundesliga ) soccer seasons , this paper documents evidence that social forces influence agents ’ decisions .
Referees , who are appointed to be impartial , tend to favor the home team by systematically awarding more stoppage time in close matches in which the home team is behind .
They also favor the home team in decisions to award goals and penalty kicks .
Crowd composition affects the size and the direction of the bias , and the crowd ’s proximity to the field is related to the quality of refereeing .
Wearing white T - shirts with red stop signs and chanting “ BET does not reflect me , MTV does not reflect me , ” protesters have been gathering every Saturday outside the homes of Viacom executives in Washington and New York City .
The orderly , mostly black crowds are protesting music videos that they say degrade women , and black and Latino men .
Among other things the protesters want media companies like Viacom to develop “ universal creative standards ” for video and music , including prohibitions on some language and images .
Video vixens and foul - mouthed pimps and thugs are now so widespread , the protesters maintain , that they infect perceptions of ordinary nonwhite people .
“ A lot of rap is n’t rap anymore , it ’s just people selling their souls , ” Marc Newman , a 28 - year - old car salesman from New Rochelle , N.Y. , said on Saturday .
He was among about 20 men , women and children from area Baptist churches marching outside the Upper East Side residence of Philippe Dauman , the president and chief executive of Viacom Inc .
The protests , by a group called Enough Is Enough , began in mid-September outside the Northwest Washington home of Debra L. Lee , chairman and chief executive of BET , a unit of Viacom .
( Viacom also owns MTV , VH1 , Comedy Central and Nickelodeon . )
On Oct. 20 protests also began outside Mr. Dauman ’s home .
The rallies in Washington have sometimes attracted hundreds of people , many belonging to the church of the Enough organizer , the Rev. Delman L. Coates , as well E. Faye Williams , as the chairwoman of the National Congress of Black Women and members of other civil rights and advocacy groups .
The three rallies in New York have been much smaller .
When the ant Cephalotes atratus is infected with a parasitic nematode , its normally black abdomen turns red , resembling the many red berries in the tropical forest canopy .
According to researchers , this is a strategy concocted by nematodes to entice birds to eat the normally unpalatable ant and spread the parasite in their droppings .
( Steve Yanoviak / University of Arkansas )
A newly discovered parasite so dramatically transforms its host , an ant , that the ant comes to resemble a juicy red berry , ripe for picking , according to a report accepted for publication in The American Naturalist .
This is the first example of fruit mimicry caused by a parasite , the co-authors say .
Presumably , the dramatic change in appearance and behavior tricks birds into eating infected ants - parasites and all - so that the bird can spread the parasite in its feces .
The fruit - eating birds ' droppings , which are mostly seeds and insect parts , are gathered by other ants who then feed and unwittingly infect their young .
This bizarre lifecycle of a parasitic nematode , or roundworm , plays out in the high canopy of tropical forests ranging from Central America to the lowland Amazon , according to Robert Dudley , a professor of integrative biology at the University of California , Berkeley .
" It 's just crazy that something as dumb as a nematode can manipulate its host 's exterior morphology and behavior in ways sufficient to convince a clever bird to facilitate transmission of the nematode , " Dudley said .
" It 's phenomenal that these nematodes actually turn the ants bright red , and that they look so much like the fruits in the forest canopy , " said co-author Stephen P. Yanoviak , an insect ecologist and assistant professor of biology at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock , who noted that numerous tropical plants produce small red , orange and pink berries .
" When you see them in the sunlight , it 's remarkable . "
Dudley chanced upon the infected ants while he , Yanoviak and ant ecologist Michael E. Kaspari of the University of Oklahoma in Norman were studying the gliding ability of a species of ant , Cephalotes atratus , common in the tropical forest canopy .
Three years ago , their team described the ant 's ability to make mid-air maneuvers so that , if knocked off a branch , they can glide toward the tree trunk , grab hold and climb back up , avoiding the treacherous forest floor .
Both Dudley and Kaspari are affiliated with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama .
Yanoviak is also with the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach , Fla .
In May 2005 , when searching for a colony of the ants in a downed tree on Panama 's Barro Colorado Island , Dudley was puzzled to see some members of the colony with bright red abdomens - something he , Yanoviak and Kaspari had never before seen .
Taking several of the ants back to the lab and opening them up , Yanoviak discovered that the red abdomen was full of hundreds of nematode eggs .
" Like other ant biologists , I initially thought this was another species of Cephalotes , " said Kaspari .
" Robert did n't think so , and we made a bet over beers .
Then Steve opened one up under the scope and - wow !
I lost the bet . "
Because the red abdomen clearly mimicked in both size and color the many red berries that attract birds , the biologists quickly suspected that the nematode had found a unique way to guarantee its transmission from ant host to bird host .
The researchers spent the next couple of years trying to prove their hypothesis .
Yanoviak first consulted the world 's authority on the nematodes that parasitize insects : George Poinar Jr. , a former UC Berkeley researcher now at Oregon State University in Corvallis .
Poinar and Yanoviak describ the new species of tetradonematid nematode , Myrmeconema neotropicum , in a paper to appear in the February 2008 issue of the journal Systematic Parasitology .
They also discovered that infected ants with red abdomens had been recorded before , and that some specimens resided in museum collections labeled as a variety of Cephalotes .
Yanoviak collected thousands of normal and infected ants in both Panama and Peru , near the Peruvian rainforest city of Iquitos , and demonstrated that , typically , about 5 percent of worker ants in a colony are infected .
Cephalotes colonies contain between a few hundred and several thousand ants .
Infected ants , normally black , develop a bright red abdomen , called a gaster , and tend to hold it in an elevated position , an alarm posture in ants .
The ants also get sluggish , and the gaster is easily broken off , making it easy for birds to pluck .
Dudley noted that birds usually do n't eat ants , especially C. atratus , as the ants are heavily armored and defended by bad - tasting chemical defenses .
Yanoviak and Poinar reconstructed the life cycle of the nematode , though Yanoviak admits that they never saw a bird eat an ant 's red gaster .
" Nevertheless , I definitely saw birds come in and seemingly stop and take a second look at those ants before flying off , probably because the ants were moving , " Yanoviak said .
" So I really suspect that these little bananaquits or tyrannids ( flycatchers ) are coming in and taking the ants , thinking they are fruit . "
Birds apparently are merely a way to spread the parasite 's eggs more broadly , since the eggs pass directly through into the feces .
Ants become infected when they feed to ant larvae the bird feces containing parasite eggs .
The nematodes hatch and migrate to the gaster of the ant pupae , where they mate .
After the pupae become adults , the adults tend the brood while the nematode females incubate their eggs inside them , stunting the ant 's growth somewhat .
Then , as the nematode eggs mature , the ants ' gasters turn red and the ants start foraging outside the nest , setting the scene for fruit - eating birds to be duped into eating an ant they would normally avoid .
" This is a really great example of the kinds of complex host - parasite interactions that can co-evolve , and also of the role of serendipity in tropical biology , " Dudley said .
The American Naturalist article will appear in print sometime this spring .

Kraft Foods , the conglomerate built on macaroni and cheese , is working on a new and unusual product line  food that is not only tasty , but kills intestinal worms .
It is not intended for sale in the United States , but is aimed at rural Asia , Africa and Latin America , where worms leave millions of children lethargic , dangerously anemic and , sometimes , passing blood .
The food is in the early development stage , and a spokeswoman said the company was not ready to say whether it would be a cheese , a pasta , a granola bar or something else .
But it will incorporate deworming chemicals developed by TyraTech , a company in Melbourne , Fla. , that makes safe pesticides .
The pesticides , explained R. Douglas Armstrong , chief executive of TyraTech , are derived from plant oils .

Tiresome Connections
Dave Weigel and Matt Yglesias are having fun picking on Marty Peretz 's personal assistant and I can't resist piling on .
Peretz 's Kirchick wrote :
[ R]egime change in Iraq was the official , bipartisan policy of the United States government years before it became fashionable for journalists to write tiresome , 5,000 - word articles linking Ahmed Chalabi , PNAC and Paul Wolfowitz .
( Emphasis supplied . )
I am tired of those pieces too .
But they at least have the virtue of being true .
Chalabi , Wolfowitz and PNAC were intimately connected .
Unlike the claims made in those once fashionable articles that connected Saddam Hussein , Osama bin Laden and mushroom clouds .
The other difference between those two types of tiresome articles is one type consists of rather meaningless blather .
The other contributed to the launching of the most disastrous strategic blunder since Vietnam .
Reference Recordings , the Bay Area - based audiophile label founded by John T. " Tam " Henderson in 1976 , has adopted a unique approach to computer and music server playback .
Later this month , the company will begin to market what they call " HRx " discs .
Incompatible with conventional optical disc players , these are data discs containing WAV files intended for playback on computer - based music servers .
Each HRx is a digit - for - digit copy of an original Reference Recordings 24 - bit / 176.4k
Hz digital master .
The format is slated for audition during this week 's CES .
It can be heard in the TAD , FIM , and Magico rooms at the Venetian , as well as in On a Higher Note 's Vivid / Luxman suite at the Mirage .
Actual HRx discs will be available soon thereafter .
" Like every record company , we have been frustrated knowing how wonderful our master tapes sound and what is lost when you transfer to CD , " Reference Recordings Vice President Marcia Martin told Stereophile .
" There are also losses when we transfer to LP , although those are different , and stem from mechanical issues you do n't have with CDs .
" Now that computers have improved , and we have huge hard drives , lots of memory , fast downloads , and new servers , it has finally become possible and practical to offer the incredible sound we 've been hearing all these years on the original masters .
It may not be great for preamp manufacturers , but hard drive playback is the future of audio . "
Reference Recordings has been at the forefront of high - quality sound ever since legendary audio designer and recording engineer " Prof . " Keith O. Johnson came on board in 1978 .
Johnson , who co-developed the HDCD process , recorded the very first HDCD disc released by RR 16 years ago .
He has also received no less than seven Grammy nominations for Best Engineered Album .
The latest , for Garden Of Dreams from David Maslanka and the Dallas Wind Symphony ( RR - 108 ) , could snatch Johnson and Reference Recordings a Grammy on February 10 .
RR has previously received Grammys for a recording of the Chicago Pro Musica and Domenic Argento's Casa Guidi with Frederica von Stade .
While some labels have opted to issue SACDs and / or DVD - As , Reference Recordings rejected that route some years back .
" Everyone here thought DVD - A was the better format technically , " says Martin .
" It can sound close to our master tapes , which for about 10 years have been 24 - bit / 176.4 kHz .
But the format never caught on because the DVD - A players that were being manufactured were n't really high - end .
My husband Keith was asked to design a DVD - A player that would have done the format justice , but when the manufacturer , Spectral , was asked to sign an agreement that made the company liable should anyone successfully make a DVD - A copy from the player , Spectral and other high - end companies stayed away .
As for SACD , our mastering engineer Paul Stubblebine felt the conversion to DSD changed the sound of our masters in a way we did n't like . "
Reference Recordings therefore stuck with HDCD .
Unfortunately , after Microsoft bought the rights to HDCD from Pacific Microsonics a few years back , it dropped development and support for the format .
Fortunately , two of Johnson 's dear friends and associates from those days , Michael Ritter and Pflash Pflaumer ( who co-invented HDCD with Johnson ) , have since launched Berkeley Audio Design Associates , and have developed an Alpha DAC that Martin claims sounds better in some ways than Pacific Microsonics ' no-longer - produced Model 2 HDCD encoder .
The Alpha DAC , which does not infringe on the HDCD patents that Microsoft now owns , will debut at CES this week .
Used with a PC equipped with an expensive Lynx sound card commonly capable of outputting digital data sampled at 176.4k Hz , the DAC will be used to demonstrate RR's HRx files .
I asked what program will be used to play the files .
" We 're only working with Windows XP , because Windows Vista is currently a disaster for audio , " says Martin .
" Vista tries to control and play files its way , which is not what we want .
. . . Meanwhile , one of the programs we 've been using is a free one called Media Monkey .
It goes up to 24/176.4 without messing up and changing the files and bits . "
Manufacturing HRx discs is an interim step to the eventual goal of making Reference Recordings ' high - resolution masters available for direct download and for pre-loading into music servers .
The download option hinges in large part on download time .
Martin estimates that downloading a single album at 176.4k
Hz sample rate and 24 - bit word lengths will take several hours .
Lossless compression with FLAC is a possibility , but Reference wants to ensure that decoding programs using FLAC decoding will optimally handle their files before proceeding .
In the meantime , Reference will offer HRx WAV files on disc .
Most will be encoded at 24/176.4 , although a few of RR 's older 24/88.2 masters will also be distributed in HRx format .
The price of HRx discs has yet to be set .
" Discs are a bit more trouble to create and distribute than downloads , " says Martin .
" We 're trying to keep it user - friendly , while ensuring we make a profit and stay in business . "
As far as I can tell , Reference Recordings is releasing the files free from DRM ( Digital Rights Management ) , but this writer is concerned that the financial losses associated with unauthorized copying and distribution of files would seriously impact such a small company .
[ It is fair to note that Linn ’s decision to make its high - resolution music files available without DRM does not appear to have had a negative effect , according to Ivor Tiefenbrun , with whom I discussed this subject just after the Christmas break .

In other developments , Reference Recordings is preparing to issue its first LPs in many a year .
Paul Stubblebine is currently completing a facility that will be used for mastering the LPs , which , tentatively , will be pressed in Germany .
First off the presses will be several of Reference 's analog recordings that were never issued on LP .
Shorter compositions may also be issued in 45rpm format .
And , despite Marcia 's reservations , a few SACDs will also be issued at the request of the label 's Chinese distributor .
In the hamlets and modest seaports that dot the coastal counties of New England , Bill Leavenworth trolls for the lost bounty of the Gulf of Maine .
His prey : the bound , handwritten logs kept by the captains of virtually every fishing boat that plied those rich waters between 1852 and 1866 .
The logs were once held in the region 's customs houses , but over time were scattered to the four winds .
Some landed in basements and attics , some were donated to local libraries and museums , and others returned to fishermen .
On Nantucket Island , a number were stuffed between the walls of a public building as insulation against the winter cold , and were only recently found during a renovation .
Others were undoubtledly used to start the fires of fish - house stoves or simply thrown away .
In the yellowing pages of these surviving logbooks lie the secrets of the ocean fisheries ' past – and perhaps lessons for its troubled present .
The books contain daily entries on the vessels ' movements , the weather , unusual occurrences , and careful tallies of the number of fish caught by each man aboard .
The numbers and words have yielded some bracing revelations about just how many cod there once were in New England and the Canadian Maritimes .
And so , Mr. Leavenworth , a University of New Hampshire ( UNH ) researcher often finds himself standing behind a lectern at churches , high schools , or libraries , describing his team 's work to commercial fishermen , gentleman farmers , retirees , and small - business owners who populate the coast .
" My last car had 232,000 miles on it , " says Leavenworth , whose own ancestor fished off New Hampshire in the 1660s .
Every trip will end , he hopes , with the winning of one more piece – one more logbook – in a historical puzzle .
***
Three years ago , Leavenworth was giving a talk to members of the Old Berwick Historical Society in southern Maine , just up the Salmon Falls River from Portsmouth , the once - bustling seaport where New Hampshire got its start .
The presentation ended and an audience member – the Historical Society 's president – came forward .
" Hey , I think we 've got some of those [ logbooks ] in our collections , " she told him .
Two weeks later , Leavenworth was back in Berwick , carefully photographing the logs of the schooner William Penn and eight other vessels that once plied the Gulf of Maine from nearby Kennebunkport , their successes and failures scratched out in ink on stout linen paper .
At other talks , fishermen have come back to Leavenworth with their third great - great - great - grandfather 's logs , occasionally bearing water stains from a Civil War era storm .
Volunteer staff at historical societies in tiny Maine ports have helped him hook others hidden in storage rooms .
The Gulf of Maine Cod Project – which Leavenworth 's work contributes to – is one of many efforts around the world that bring maritime historians and fishery scientists together to reconstruct the past and to answer the question :
What was marine life like before the 20th century ?
Danish researchers have been looking at monastery records , which tabulated tithes from fishing activities , while a British team is trying to reconstruct medieval cod and herring fisheries through discarded fish bones .
New Englanders ' logbooks are believed to be especially accurate , because fishermen had no incentive to over - or underreport their catches .
Individual fishermen were paid according to the number of fish they caught , while at the dock , the captain was paid by the weight of the catch .
Combined with log entries showing where the boats fished , this data allowed researchers to calculate the distribution of fish stocks and the average size of the fish caught .
Such reconstructions of past populations can be enormously important today for fisheries managers , which is what led Andrew Rosenberg to help create the UNH project .
A former deputy director of the National Marine Fisheries Service and a member of the US Commission on Ocean Policy , Mr. Rosenberg had a front row - seat during the collapse of many of New England 's commercial fish populations during the 1980s and 1990s .
" An awful lot of my work ... was focused on rebuilding fisheries , and we were stuck in this box where rebuilding targets were based on the levels of the 1980s , because there was more then than there is now , " recalls Mr. Rosenberg , who is now at UNH .
" But we know that overfishing has occurred for a much longer period of time , and that even in the 1980s , the stock was producing nowhere near what it could . "
Leavenworth 's haul of logbooks shows just how far back you have to go to understand the current fishery crisis – and the true extent of the ecological damage .
In 1855 , just 43 schooners out of Beverly , Mass. , were catching considerably more cod in the waters south of Nova Scotia in a season than their modern counterparts can catch today .
Crews fishing over the side with baited hand lines caught 7,800 metric tons of cod – about three times what fishermen caught in that area in 2006 .
And they did it within sight of land in coastal waters where today cod are virtually nonexistent .
Likewise , in 1861 , fishermen from a handful of Maine fishing hamlets using small sailboats and baited hand lines were able to catch more cod than were caught in the entire Gulf of Maine between 1996 and 1999 by the entire US fleet , with their powerful engines , enormous bottom trawling nets , high - tech fish finders , and satellite navigation systems .
" Ask yourself : what were [ the cod ] eating ? " suggests W. Jeffrey Bolster , the UNH maritime historian who is part of the project .
" When you think about the copepods and krill , all the way up to the alewives and mackerel that had to be present in the inshore area to feed them , it 's flabbergasting .
It was a totally different world out there . "
***
If nature 's bounty is not timeless , there may be a small consolation in knowing human nature is .
Part of the problem today , says Rosenberg , is in restraining younger fishermen who are too young to remember what fishing was like in the 1960s or 1970s .
One of his colleagues was once accosted by a fishermen in his 20s who was angry that bluefin tuna quotas were going to be lowered .
" He was screaming that there were more tuna out there than he'd ever seen in his life , " Rosenberg recalled .
" My friend listened for a while and said , ' Well , you 're not very old . ' "
But even in the 1850s , older fishermen were concerned that their sons and grandsons were unaware of the extent to which the fish populations had declined .
" There were petitions from fishermen – we have zillions of them – lamenting what was happening and demanding regulations , " says Mr. Bolster .
" We have people from each generation saying , basically , these young guys now do n't know what fishing was like when it was good . "
And even back then , fishermen 's warnings about the destructive power of new technology went unheeded .
In the 1850s , Swampscott , Mass. , hand - line fishermen begged state legislators to outlaw new long lines that used hundreds of hooks rather than one or two .
They warned that otherwise cod and haddock would become as " scarce as salmon . "
For researchers like Leavenworth , such stories make the hunt for logbooks more than an academic enterprise .
Understanding fish population trends is important , but so is telling the vivid tales found in these aging books .
" You just tell these stories to someone and they immediately get the picture , " says historian Karen Alexander , who coordinates the project .
" They get in their minds what real abundance looks like and what these ecosystems can really do – and then they want that . "
These are the second wave exits .
Not certain whether or not they ’re weighted .
Assume they ’re not .

President Putin wants Russia to be treated as an equal by the US
It is yet another sign of the worsening relationship between Moscow and the West .
It shows that this relationship was not improved in any substantial way by the informal meeting at the start of this month between the US and Russian presidents at the Bush family 's holiday home at Kennebunkport in Maine .
It is another diplomatic warning shot from Mr Putin across the bows of the Bush administration .
And with crucial issues like Iran 's nuclear programme and the political future of Kosovo looming at the United Nations , it raises a new set of questions about how far Russia might go to block initiatives backed by Washington and its key allies .
President Putin's move will be taken as yet another sign of a more assertive foreign policy - a policy buoyed up by Moscow 's rising income from oil and natural gas
The Russians have been threatening to suspend their participation in the CFE treaty for several months .
An emergency meeting in mid-June to discuss the issue made little if any progress .
The CFE treaty of 1990 was one of the most significant arms control agreements of the Cold War years .
It set strict limits on the number of offensive weapons - tanks , aircraft , artillery and so on - that the members of the Warsaw Pact and Nato could deploy in a broadly - defined Europe , stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals .
In the wake of the collapse of communism , the treaty was revised in 1999 , in part to address Russian concerns .
The most recent round of talks on the treaty failed
President Putin's decree to suspend application of the treaty is not the same as a full - scale withdrawal - that would require a formal notification of the other parties .
This suspension is a unilateral Russian measure and its practical impact will be limited .
Various routine inspections , exchanges of data , and so on will presumably be halted .
Irrelevant ?
In many ways the CFE treaty is not hugely relevant today .
The Cold War is over and whatever new tensions there may be between Russia and the West , nobody envisages a return to an armed stand - off on the European continent .
Nonetheless Mr Putin 's decision matters .
It is clearly nonsense to speak of a new Cold War
For a start it raises questions about yet one more arms control treaty at a time when disarmament experts fear that the whole network of arms control treaties established during the Cold War years is increasingly under strain .
The United States pulled out of another key agreement , the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty , in December 2001 .
In a sense Mr Putin is just demonstrating that what the Americans can do in the name of their vital interests , so Russia can also threaten in the name of its national interest .
President Putin's move will be taken as yet another sign of a more assertive foreign policy - a policy buoyed up by Moscow 's rising income from oil and natural gas .
But analysts wonder if this is really a sign of strength .
For all its energy revenues , Russia remains a shadow of the former Soviet Union in the superpower stakes .
Russian experts argue that Mr Putin realises this .
But in certain key areas , not least missile defence , he wants to be treated by Washington as an equal .
THE CFE TREATY Cornerstone of European security Limits amount of key military equipment in designated area Negotiated by Nato and ex-Warsaw Pact member states Signed in 1990 Came into force in 1992 Revised 1999 version never ratified by Nato
Russia 's new foreign policy
Russian opposition to US plans to deploy limited missile defence in Poland and the Czech Republic is at the heart of their current disagreements .
But Russia 's ever more muscular noises that it might block a proposed United Nations deal on the political future of Kosovo adds a worrying dimension to what up to now has been largely a rhetorical row .
Add in " local difficulties " like the dispute between London and Moscow over the murder of a former Russian agent living in Britain and there is real danger that relations between Russia and the West could be heading back to the freezer .
It is clearly nonsense to speak of a new Cold War .
But several Russian foreign policy experts have expressed concern that relations could deteriorate significantly .
Mr Putin 's position , they say , is more sophisticated and perhaps more nuanced than some Russian spokesmen 's pronouncements might indicate .
Mr Putin has gone some way , for example , in acknowledging that Iran does represent a potential missile threat .
But Mr Putin is drawing on a strong well of anti-Americanism in Russia 's military and foreign policy establishment .
That is why Mr Putin 's whole approach risks sounding , and indeed becoming , blunter and more dogmatic than even he probably wants .

An eye stamp : the equivalent of the modern medicine label
But they were also pioneers in the health arena - particularly in the area of eye care , with remedies for various eye conditions such as short - sightedness and conjunctivitis .
Perhaps most surprisingly of all is that the Romans - and others from ancient times , including the Chinese , Indians and Greeks - were also able also to carry out cataract operations .
The Romans were almost certainly the first to do this in Britain .
Surgical skills
Nowadays the procedure can be carried out with the help of ultrasound , but in Roman times technology was rather more basic - needles were inserted into the eye .
The sharp end of the needle was used for surgery and the blunt end heated to cauterise the wound .
A needle is to be taken , pointed enough to penetrate , yet not too fine , and this is to be inserted straight through the two outer tunics
Celsus , Roman author
Blows to the head were sometimes used to try and dislodge the cataract .
Dr Nick Summerton , GP and advisor to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) has written a book " Medicine and Health in Roman Britain " .
In it , he details how various medical instruments found in Britain indicate that the Romans carried out other advanced procedures , such as head surgery and induced abortions .
" Archaeological finds of eye medicine stamps , representations of eyes together with a sickness report from the Roman fort at Vindolanda suggest that eye diseases were a particular concern within Roman Britain , " said Dr Summerton .
" Interestingly the Roman author Celsus described cataract extraction surgery using a specially pointed needle - and possible cataract needles ( specilla ) have been found in Britain as well as elsewhere in the Roman Empire . "
Detailing the procedure Celsus said : " A needle is to be taken , pointed enough to penetrate , yet not too fine , and this is to be inserted straight through the two outer tunics .
" When the ( correct ) spot is reached , the needle is to be sloped ......... and should gently rotate there and little by little . "
The Romans were famed for their public baths
Dr Summerton explained how eye doctors ( oculists ) manufactured ointment sticks ( collyria ) stamped with the ingredients and the name of the eye specialist .
These were used to treat a range of eye problems such as conjunctivitis and other inflammatory or infectious eye condition in addition to short - sightedness .
A large number of the eye remedies contained antiseptics in one form or another .
" The vinegar lotion of Gaius Valerius Amandus ( from a stamp found at Biggleswade ) or the copper oxide of Aurelius Polychronius ( from a stamp found at Kenchester ) would have been very effective antiseptics either in treating conjunctivitis or in preventing any scar on the eye becoming infected while it healed . "
Excavations provide clues
Dr Summerton has also discovered that religion played an important role in eye care .
" It may be somewhat artificial to seek to rigidly separate out the spiritual from the physical aspects of Romano - British health care , " he said .
" At Wroxeter in Shropshire there may have been a particular focus on eye care with the discovery of two collyrium stamps in the names of Tiberius Claudius and Lucillianus together with a case of probable surgical instruments including an eye needle for cataract extraction .
" However , this evidence of ' physical medicine ' is complemented by the presence of eye votives ( offerings to the Gods ) .
" In 1967 a piece of sheet - gold in the shape of a pair of eyes was found at the north - west corner of the Baths - Basilica .
" In the same area bronze eyes have been unearthed in addition to numerous eyes carved from wall plaster .
" Wroxeter has also yielded an altar to Apollo who was considered to have a particular association with eyes . "
Dr Alex Ionides , eye surgeon at Moorfield eye hospital said an ancient method for treating cataracts was referred to as " couching " .
" A cataract is a clouding of the lens , which loses its transparency and becomes misty and foggy and white , " he said .
" The lens is held in place within the eye by multiple radial ' strings ' called zonules .
These become weaker with age and with cataract formation .
" ' Couching ' breaks these weakened strings so that the lens is no longer suspended in the correct position and falls away from the pupil , dropping into the back of the eye , allowing light into the eye once more .
" There are different ways of performing couching , one is with a blunt stick to ' knock ' the eye hard from the outside , thus dislodging the lens from the zonules by sheer blunt force .
" Another form of ' couching ' was with a sharp metal probe that would be inserted , without anaesthetic through the edge of the iris , into the eye , and wiggled around to dislodge the cataract from the pupil .
" It was n't until the 18th century that Daviel in France suggested opening up the eye and removing the cataract .
" This technique met with various success and blinded many people including Handel , who as a result of his cataract surgery , was blind for the last few years of his London life . "
Cataract surgery is now the commonest operation performed on the NHS with vastly superior techniques and generally excellent visual outcomes - although no surgery is without some risk .
We 've spent many long , lonely hours studying human sexuality in our lives : in magazines , DVDs and sometimes the lingerie section of the Sears catalog and it's taught us much .
However , as a public service , we felt like expanding the porn- saturated knowledge of the internet community with some sex- related weirdness that does n't apply to humans for a change .

Of all the military bugle calls , none is so easily recognized or more apt to evoke emotion than the call Taps .
The melody is both eloquent and haunting and the history of its origin is interesting and somewhat clouded in controversy .
In the British Army , a similar type call known as The Last Post has been sounded over soldiers ’ graves since 1885 , but the use of Taps is unique to the United States military , since the call is sounded at funerals , wreath - laying and memorial services .
Taps began as a revision for the signal of Extinguish Lights ( Lights Out ) at the end of the day .
Up until the Civil War , the infantry call for Extinguish Lights was the printed in Silas Casey ’s ( 1801 - 1882 ) Infantry Tactics and other manuals , the music which had been borrowed from the French .
The music for Taps was adapted by Union General Daniel Butterfield for his brigade ( Third Brigade , First Division , Fifth Army Corps , Army of the Potomac ) in July , 1862 .
Daniel Adams Butterfield ( 1831 - 1901 ) was born in Utica , New York and graduated from Union College at Schenectady .
He was the eastern superintendent of the American Express Company in New York when the Civil War broke out .
A Colonel in the 12th Regiment of the New York State Militia , he was promoted to Brigadier General and given command of a brigade of the 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac .
During the Peninsular Campaign Butterfield distinguished himself when , during the Battle of Gaines Mill and despite an injury , he seized the colors of the 83rd Pennsylvania and rallied the regiment at a critical time in the battle .
He was awarded the Medal of Honor for that act of heroism .
As the story goes , General Butterfield was not pleased with the call for Extinguish Lights , feeling that the call was too formal to signal the days end , and with the help of the brigade bugler , Oliver Willcox Norton ( 1839 - 1920 ) , wrote Taps to honor his men while in camp at Harrison ’s Landing , Virginia , following the Seven Days battle .
These battles took place during the Peninsular Campaign of 1862 .
The new call , sounded that night in July , 1862 , soon spread to other units of the Union Army and was reportedly also used by the Confederates .
Taps was made an official bugle call after the war .
The highly romantic account of how Butterfield composed the call surfaced in 1898 following a magazine article written that summer .
The August , 1898 issue of Century Magazine contained an article called “ The Trumpet in Camp and Battle , ” by Gustav Kobbe , ( 1857 -1918 ) a music historian and critic .
He was writing about the origin of bugle calls in the military and in reference to Taps , wrote :
“ In speaking of our trumpet calls I purposely omitted one with which it seemed most appropriate to close this article , for it is the call which closes the soldier ’s day …
Lights Out .
I have not been able to trace this call to any other service .
If as seems probable , it was original with Major Seymour , he has given our army the most beautiful of all trumpet - calls . ”
Kobbe was using as an authority the Army drill manual on infantry tactics prepared by Major General Emory Upton in 1867 ( revised in 1874 ) .
The bugle calls in the manual were compiled by Major ( later General ) Truman Seymour of the 5th U.S. Artillery .
Taps was called Extinguish Lights in these manuals since it was to replace the “ Lights Out ” call disliked by Butterfield .
The title of the call was not changed until later , although other manuals started calling it Taps because most soldiers knew it by that name .
Since Seymour was responsible for the music in the Army manual , Kobbe assumed that he had written the call .
Kobbe ’s inability to find the origin of Extinguish Lights ( Taps ) prompted a letter from Oliver W. Norton in Chicago who claimed he knew how the call came about and that he was the first to perform it .
Norton wrote :
“ Chicago , August 8 , 1898
I was much interested in reading the article by Mr. Gustav Kobbe , on the Trumpet and Bugle Calls , in the August Century .
Mr. Kobbe says that he has been unable to trace the origin of the call now used for Taps , or the Go to Sleep , as it is generally called by the soldiers .
As I am unable to give the origin of this call , I think the following statement may be of interest to Mr. Kobbe and your readers …
During the early part of the Civil War I was bugler at the Headquarters of Butterfield ’s Brigade , Morell ’s Division , Fitz - John Porter ’s Corps , Army of the Potomac .
Up to July , 1862 , the Infantry call for Taps was that set down in Casey ’s Tactics , which Mr. Kobbe says was borrowed from the French .
One day , soon after the seven days battles on the Peninsula , when the Army of the Potomac was lying in camp at Harrison ’s Landing , General Daniel Butterfield , then commanding our Brigade , sent for me , and showing me some notes on a staff written in pencil on the back of an envelope , asked me to sound them on my bugle .
I did this several times , playing the music as written .
He changed it somewhat , lengthening some notes and shortening others , but retaining the melody as he first gave it to me .
After getting it to his satisfaction , he directed me to sound that call for Taps thereafter in place of the regulation call .
The music was beautiful on that still summer night , and was heard far beyond the limits of our Brigade .
The next day I was visited by several buglers from neighboring Brigades , asking for copies of the music which I gladly furnished .
I think no general order was issued from army headquarters authorizing the substitution of this for the regulation call , but as each brigade commander exercised his own discretion in such minor matters , the call was gradually taken up through the Army of the Potomac .
I have been told that it was carried to the Western Armies by the 11th and 12th Corps , when they went to Chattanooga in the fall of 1863 , and rapidly made its way through those armies .
I did not presume to question General Butterfield at the time , but from the manner in which the call was given to me , I have no doubt he composed it in his tent at Harrison ’s Landing .
I think General Butterfield is living at Cold Spring , New York .
If you think the matter of sufficient interest , and care to write him on the subject , I have no doubt he will confirm my statement . ”
- Oliver W. Norton
The editor did write to Butterfield as suggested by Norton .
In answer to the inquiry from the editor of the Century , General Butterfield writing from Gragside , Cold Spring , on August 31 , 1898 wrote :
“ I recall , in my dim memory , the substantial truth of the statement made by Norton , of the 83rd Pa. , about bugle calls .
His letter gives the impression that I personally wrote the notes for the call .
The facts are , that at the time I could sound calls on the bugle as a necessary part of military knowledge and instruction for an officer commanding a regiment or brigade .
I had acquired this as a regimental commander .
I had composed a call for my brigade , to precede any calls , indicating that such were calls , or orders , for my brigade alone .
This was of very great use and effect on the march and in battle .
It enabled me to cause my whole command , at times , in march , covering over a mile on the road , all to halt instantly , and lie down , and all arise and start at the same moment ; to forward in line of battle , simultaneously , in action and charge etc .
It saves fatigue .
The men rather liked their call , and began to sing my name to it .
It was three notes and a catch .
I can not write a note of music , but have gotten my wife to write it from my whistling it to her , and enclose it .
The men would sing , “ Dan , Dan , Dan , Butterfield , Butterfield ” to the notes when a call came .
Later , in battle , or in some trying circumstances or an advance of difficulties , they sometimes sang , “ Damn , Damn , Damn , Butterfield , Butterfield . ”
The call of Taps did not seem to be as smooth , melodious and musical as it should be , and I called in some one who could write music , and practiced a change in the call of Taps until I had it suit my ear , and then , as Norton writes , got it to my taste without being able to write music or knowing the technical name of any note , but , simply by ear , arranged it as Norton describes .
I did not recall him in connection with it , but his story is substantially correct .
Will you do me the favor to send Norton a copy of this letter by your typewriter ?
I have none . ”
- Daniel Butterfield
On the surface , this seems to be the true history of the origin of Taps .
Indeed , the many articles written about Taps cite this story as the beginning of Butterfield ’s association with the call .
Certainly , Butterfield never went out of his way to claim credit for its composition and it was n’t until the Century article that the origin came to light .

There are however , significant differences in Butterfield ’s and Norton ’s stories .
Norton says that the music given to him by Butterfield that night was written down on an envelope while Butterfield wrote that he could not read or write music !
Also Butterfield ’s words seem to suggest that he was not composing a melody in Norton ’s presence , but actually arranging or revising an existing one .
As a commander of a brigade , he knew of the bugle calls needed to relay troop commands .
All officers of the time were required to know the calls and were expected to be able to play the bugle .
Butterfield was no different – he could sound the bugle but could not read music .
As a colonel of the 12th NY Regiment , before the war , he had ordered his men to be thoroughly familiar with calls and drills .

U.S. ( TGW ) – Half the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions needed to lower carbon dioxide to the IPCC recommended level can be made at a net profit to the global economy , a study has found .
The IPCC recommended level is 550 parts per million ( ppm ) of CO2 , twice the amount of before the industrial revolution .
The study concluded a global investment of $ 170 billion would often a 17 % profit of about $ 29 billion .
The investments would only encompass energy saving measures and could be done quickly and at a minimal cost .

Americans have given up celebrating George Washington 's birthday in exchange for a 3 - day weekend .
The price includes overlooking the wisdom he has to offer us .
That is particularly unfortunate at a time of intense political partisanship , illustrated by the Presidential campaigns , because he had plenty to say about such factionalism .
The danger of factions to American liberty was a major part of his 1796 Farewell Address .
Washington offered ' sentiments which are the result of much reflection , of no inconsiderable observation , and which appear to me all - important to the permanency of your felicity as a people . '
In particular , he insisted that we keep ' indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest … '
' One of the expedients of party to acquire influence …is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other [s ] .
You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations ; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection . '
' They serve to organize faction , to give it an artificial and extraordinary force ; to put , in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party … to make the public administration the mirror of the ill - concerted and incongruous projects of faction , rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by the common counsels and modified by mutual interests . '
' Liberty … is , indeed , little else than a name , where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction … and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyments of the rights of person and property . '
' Let me … warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party … in [ governments ] of the popular form , it is seen in its greatest rankness , and is truly their worst enemy . '
' The alternate domination of one faction over another , sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension … is itself a frightful despotism … the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it .
It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration .
It agitates the community with ill - founded jealousies and false alarms , kindles the animosity of one part against another …
' [ faction ] is a spirit not to be encouraged …
And there being constant danger of excess , the effort ought to be by force of public opinion , to mitigate and assuage it .
A fire not to be quenched , it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame , lest , instead of warming , it should consume . '
Americans , especially politicians , seem to have forgotten George Washington 's warning of how strongly factions undermine ' the benign influence of good laws under a free government . '
But we need to aim for the higher standard he called us to : ' It will be worthy of a free , enlightened , and at no distant period , a great nation , to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence . '
It is particularly important because , as he said elsewhere , ' preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered , perhaps , as deeply , as finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American People . '
Many have abandoned even the pretense of following the principles of the man our Capitol is named for .
Those principles , together with his actions in defending our freedoms and forming our country , are central reasons why he was ' First in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen . '
One of those principles was avoiding the disunity of factions , which pose serious risks to our liberty .
Instead of overlooking his insights in pursuit of factional advantages , we need to live up to Washington 's assertion that ' Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts , no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment . '
A 2,000 - year - old mechanical computer salvaged from a Roman shipwreck has astounded scientists who have finally unravelled the secrets of how the sophisticated device works .
The machine was lost among cargo in 65BC when the ship carrying it sank in 42 m of water off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera .
By chance , in 1900 , a sponge diver called Elias Stadiatos discovered the wreck and recovered statues and other artifacts from the site .
The machine first came to light when an archaeologist working on the recovered objects noticed that a lump of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it .
Closer inspection of material brought up from the stricken ship subsequently revealed 80 pieces of gear wheels , dials , clock - like hands and a wooden and bronze casing bearing ancient Greek inscriptions .
Since its discovery , scientists have been trying to reconstruct the device , which is now known to be an astronomical calendar capable of tracking with remarkable precision the position of the sun , several heavenly bodies and the phases of the moon .
Experts believe it to be the earliest - known device to use gear wheels and by far the most sophisticated object to be found from the ancient and medieval periods .
Using modern computer x-ray tomography and high resolution surface scanning , a team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at Cardiff University peered inside fragments of the crust - encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine .
Detailed imaging of the mechanism suggests it dates back to 150 - 100 BC and had 37 gear wheels enabling it to follow the movements of the moon and the sun through the zodiac , predict eclipses and even recreate the irregular orbit of the moon .
The motion , known as the first lunar anomaly , was developed by the astronomer Hipparcus of Rhodes in the 2nd century BC , and he may have been consulted in the machine 's construction , the scientists speculate .
Remarkably , scans showed the device uses a differential gear , which was previously believed to have been invented in the 16th century .
The level of miniaturisation and complexity of its parts is comparable to that of 18th century clocks .
Some researchers believe the machine , known as the Antikythera Mechanism , may have been among other treasure looted from Rhodes that was en route to Rome for a celebration staged by Julius Caesar .
One of the remaining mysteries is why the Greek technology invented for the machine seemed to disappear .
No other civilisation is believed to have created anything as complex for another 1,000 years .
One explanation could be that bronze was often recycled in the period the device was made , so many artefacts from that time have long ago been melted down and erased from the archaelogical record .
The fateful sinking of the ship carrying the Antikythera Mechanism may have inadvertently preserved it .
" This device is extraordinary , the only thing of its kind , " said Professor Edmunds .
" The astronomy is exactly right ... in terms of historic and scarcity value , I have to regard this mechanism as being more valuable than the Mona Lisa . "
The research , which appears in the journal Nature today , was carried out with scientists at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens where the mechanism is held and the universities of Athens and Thessaloniki .
A new type of ultrapowerful supernova discovered last year may blow its top again , according to a new study .
Researchers report that supernova 2006gy fits a model of star explosion that should have produced two flare - ups already and may culminate in a third before the star fizzles out .
A second study proposes that the explosion might have come about from the marriage of multiple stars .
SN 2006gy first caught astronomers ' eyes in September .
Burning 100 times brighter than a typical supernova , it maintained full strength for an amazing three months , by which point most of its counterparts would have begun fading .
Even eight months later it was as brilliant as a so - called type II supernova , the most common variety .
The energy unleashed implied that the exploding star was a behemoth of at least 100 solar masses ( suns ) .
Supernovas typically occur after a star bigger than 10 suns has gradually exhausted its supply of hydrogen and helium , which have fused into progressively heavier elements .
Unable to muster the heat to support its outer layers , the burnt - out star implodes , blasting its envelope outward in a last gasp of nuclear energy .
To explain SN 2006gy 's massive outburst , researchers invoked a competing mechanism called pair - instability , which theoretically kicks in for stars larger than 90 suns .
In this scenario , dating to 1967 , high - energy gamma rays inside the star convert into pairs of electrons and positrons , draining stellar energy that would normally help maintain its internal pressure , eventually leading to a premature collapse that liberates vast amounts of energy and light .
In a new Nature paper , astrophysicist Stan Woosely of the University of California , Santa Cruz , and his colleagues report that the observed changes in SN 2006gy 's brightness fit a model of pulsating pair - instability , assuming the star was initially 95 to 130 solar masses , with a helium - rich core of about 50 suns .
Developed by Woosely and co-author Alexander Heger in 2002 , the model predicts that the initial implosion of a 110 – solar mass star would shed several sun's worth of mass before igniting the star 's carbon and oxygen fuel and temporarily halting the collapse .
Roughly seven years later , pair - instability would cause a second breakdown that emits a smaller but faster pulse of material .
Normally , Woosely says , the star itself , bloated with age , would soak up most of such a shockwave 's energy without releasing light .
But in this case , the two pulses would slam into each other , sparking fireworks .
" Essentially [ the first pulse ] could act like a sponge to soak up the energy — and then reradiate that energy as light , " says Nathan Smith of U.C. Berkeley , a member of the group that first pointed out SN 2006gy 's peculiar brightness .
The new study " gives a nice numerical confirmation of the empirical model we proposed initially . "
Woosely says he " would n't want to bet the house " on the model , partly because it requires the initial star to lose mass slower than predicted by calculations of stellar evolution , but adds that " it 's the best model going . "
He notes that if the model is correct , SN 2006gy might flare up again or it might quietly collapse into a black hole .
Whatever the mechanism behind the explosion , a second Nature paper this week proposes that the initial star may have formed from the collision of a large , older star and a small , younger one .
This would explain the presence of hydrogen in SN 2006gy , even though big stars are thought to run out of hydrogen hundreds of thousands of years before going supernova , says co-author Simon Portegies Zwart of the University of Amsterdam .
Since SN 2006gy was discovered , astronomers have noticed a second , even brighter supernova that was first observed in 2005 but lasted for an ordinary amount of time .
Smith notes that a third explosion nearly matched the brilliance and duration of SN 2006gy , which has hogged the spotlight .
No Joke : Animals Laugh , Too Animals may be our friends .
But they wo n’t pick you up at the airport .
by Robert Roy Britt Life can be funny , and not just for humans .
Studies by various groups suggest monkeys , dogs and even rats love a good laugh .
People , meanwhile , have been laughing since before they could talk .
" Indeed , neural circuits for laughter exist in very ancient regions of the brain , and ancestral forms of play and laughter existed in other animals eons before we humans came along with our ' ha - ha - has ' and verbal repartee , " says Jaak Panksepp , a neuroscientist at Bowling Green State University .
When chimps play and chase each other , they pant in a manner that is strikingly like human laughter , Panksepp writes in the April 1 issue of the journal Science .
Dogs have a similar response .
Rats chirp while they play , again in a way that resembles our giggles .
Panksepp found in a previous study that when rats are playfully tickled , they chirp and bond socially with their human tickler .
And they seem to like it , seeking to be tickled more .
Apparently joyful rats also preferred to hang out with other chirpers .
Laughter in humans starts young , another clue that it's a deep - seated brain function .
" Young children , whose semantic sense of humour is marginal , laugh and shriek abundantly in the midst of their other rough - and - tumble activities , " Panksepp notes .
Importantly , various recent studies on the topic suggest that laughter in animals typically involves similar play chasing .
Could be that verbal jokes tickle ancient , playful circuits in our brains .
More study is needed to figure out whether animals are really laughing .
The results could explain why humans like to joke around .
Panksepp speculates it might even lead to the development of treatments for laughter 's dark side : depression .
Meanwhile , there 's the question of what 's so darn funny in the animal world .
Although no one has investigated the possibility of rat humour , if it exists , it is likely to be heavily laced with slapstick , " Panksepp figures .
" Even if adult rodents have no well - developed cognitive sense of humour , young rats have a marvellous sense of fun . "
Science has traditionally deemed animals incapable of joy and woe .
Panksepp 's response : " Although some still regard laughter as a uniquely human trait , honed in the Pleistocene , the joke ’s on them . "

She 's Laughing , He 's Not by Yuriy Zilinsky Source : pixdaus.com via pixdaus A guy enters bar carrying an alligator .
Says to the patrons , " Here ’s a deal .
I 'll open this alligator 's mouth and place my genitals inside .
The gator will close his mouth for one minute , then open it , and I 'll remove my unit unscathed .
If it works , everyone buys me drinks . "
The crowd agrees .
The guy drops his pants and puts his privates in the gator 's mouth .
Gator closes mouth .
After a minute , the guy grabs a beer bottle and bangs the gator on the top of its head .
The gator opens wide , and he removes his genitals unscathed .
Everyone buys him drinks .
Then he says : " I 'll pay anyone $ 100 who 's willing to give it a try . "
After a while , a hand goes up in the back of the bar .
It 's a woman .
" I 'll give it a try , " she says , " but you have to promise not to hit me on the head with the beer bottle . "
Not Funny , But LOL Anyway by Sarah Davidson Laughter soothes the wounded heart , lightens an awkward moment and , according to recent research , places an emotional emphasis on the words we say .
Even better , when someone laughs with us , relationships grow .
" Current research on laughter in general shows it 's more about communicating emotion than about humour , " says Carl Marci , lead author of a paper in the October issue of the Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases .
The study measured laughter in therapy sessions .
Patients regularly laughed at themselves , which suggests " the patient who is laughing is trying to say more than has been expressed verbally to the therapist , " Marci said .
" Laughter is an indication that the subject is emotionally charged . "
Therapists should explore the meaning of what is said immediately preceding laughter , Marci advises .
Laughter can be contagious , especially when the therapist pays attention , and is willing to laugh with their patient , the study revealed .
A laughing therapist is physically aroused , which in turn arouses the patient further .
This helps build a rapport between the two .
Ultimately researchers hope to learn if there are long term connections between laughter and improved mental health outside therapy sessions , scientifically proving that laughter really is the best medicine .

The true story of how your wife 's stalker rang her to discuss killing you is n't supposed to provoke mirth .
But when John Morreall , of the College of William and Mary in Virginia , related the events last week to a group of scholars in Tuebingen in Germany , they were in stitches as he divulged the details of how his wife tried to dissuade the confused young man by pleading that her mortgage was too large to pay without her husband 's help .
So why did they laugh ?
Dr Morreall 's thesis is that laughter , incapacitating as it can be , is a convincing signal that the danger has passed .
The reaction of the psychologists , linguists , philosophers and professional clowns attending the Fifth International Summer School on Humour and Laughter illustrates his point .
Dr Morreall survived to tell the tale and so had an easy time making it sound funny .
One description of how laughter is provoked is the incongruity theory developed by Victor Raskin of Purdue University and Salvatore Attardo of Youngstown State University , both in America .
This theory says that all written jokes and many other humorous situations are based on an incongruity - something that is not quite right .
In many jokes , the teller sets up the story with this incongruity present and the punch line then resolves it , in a way people do not expect .
Alternatively , the very last words of the story may introduce the absurdity and leave the listeners with the task of reconciling it .
For instance , many people find it funny that a conference on humour could take place in Germany .
Why do people laugh at all ?
What is the point of it ?
Laughter is very contagious and this suggests that it may have become a part of human behaviour because it promotes social bonding .
When a group of people laughs , the message seems to be " relax , you are among friends . "
Indeed , humour is one way of dealing with the fact that humans are " excrement - producing poets and imperfect lovers , " says Appletree Rodden of the University of Tuebingen .
He sees religion and humour as different , and perhaps competing , ways for people to accept death and the general unsatisfactoriness of the world .
Perhaps that is why , as Dr Morreall calculates in a forthcoming article in the journal Humor , 95 % of the writings that he sampled from important Christian scholars through the centuries disapproved of humour , linking it to insincerity and idleness .
Fear of idleness is why many managers discourage laughter during office hours , Dr Morreall notes .
This is foolish , he claims .
Laughter or its absence may be the best clue a manager has about the work environment and the mood of employees .
Indeed , another theory of why people laugh - the superiority theory - says that people laugh to assert that they are on a level equal to or higher than those around them .
Research has shown that bosses tend to crack more jokes than do their employees .
Women laugh much more in the presence of men , and men generally tell more jokes in the presence of women .
Men have even been shown to laugh much more quietly around women , while laughing louder when in a group of men .
But laughter does not unite us all .
There are those who have a pathological fear that others will laugh at them .
Sufferers avoid situations where there will be laughter , which means most places where people meet .
Willibald Ruch of Zurich University surveyed 1,000 Germans and asked them whether they thought they were the butts of jokes and found that almost 10 % felt this way .
These people also tended to classify taped laughter as jeering .
Future research will focus on the hypothesis that there is something seriously wrong with their sense of humour .

A BBC Radio 4 presenter drugged and raped a man he met at a New Year party after inviting him back to see his art collection , a court heard today .
Nigel Wrench snorted cocaine with the man at the party in south London and offered him the chance to sit in on his show , the Old Bailey was told .
Back at the PM presenter 's flat he poured them both a glass of champagne but when the 26 - year - old man took a gulp
he realised " not all was well " , a jury heard .
Scroll down for more ...
There were " flashes of darkness " and " periods of blackness " as the man , now a successful PA , went in and out of consciousness , the court was told .
The next thing he knew he was naked on Wrench 's bed , and the presenter was putting a pill into his mouth , it is alleged .
Constance Briscoe , prosecuting , said : " In order to get his way with the victim , he drugged him and he raped him and he sexually assaulted him . "
Wrench is accused of rape , sexual assault , and administering Temazepam with the intention of " stupefying or overpowering " his alleged victim to have sex , on January 1 last year .
The 47 - year - old , of Burgoyne Road , Finsbury Park , north London , a presenter on Radio 4's PM programme , denies all the charges .
The alleged victim had earlier in the evening met up with an ex-partner and the two men had a meal together .
Later he went on to the party in Kennington , south London , where he was introduced to Wrench and talked about his radio career .
During the conversation , the presenter offered the man cocaine and they snorted it together in the toilet , the court heard .
Later Wrench made a pass at the man but he rebuffed his advances .
Just before the party ended , some time after 4 am , the presenter asked him if he wanted to go back and look at his art collection , jurors were told .
The man was " a bit suspicious " , Miss Briscoe said , but Wrench told him : " Do n't worry , it 's not for sex . "
They took a taxi back to Wrench 's flat where the presenter showed him some of the paintings on the wall then offered him a drink .
" He went into another room and returned with two glasses of what ( the alleged victim ) believed was champagne , " said Miss Briscoe .
" He took a gulp of champagne and he knew that not all was well .
The champagne being drunk , he rushed to the toilet to wash his mouth out .
" His eyes started to turn in his head and he began to get flashes of darkness and that fluctuated with periods of blackness and flashes of lucidity .
He would say that he was in and out of consciousness .
" His next recollection was that he was somehow on the defendant 's bed .
His clothes had been removed .
" He remembers the defendant putting a pill in his mouth .
He remembers waking up and he had a very bad headache . "
It was then around 1 pm on New Year 's Day , seven hours after he had arrived at the flat , the man had since recalled .
" He remembers that when he was on the bed the defendant was wrestling with him and he was trying to kiss him at the same time .
" As he was trying to kiss him he was hitting and punching , slapping and biting him , " Miss Briscoe said .
Wrench sexually assaulted the man despite being told by him to stop , she said .
Then the presenter forced the man to perform a sex act on him , she added .
" The more ( the victim ) resisted him the more he punched and hit him . "
After the man left he met a friend and they went together to a police station to report what had happened .
A doctor who assessed the alleged victim found 12 separate injuries including swellings , scratches and bruises .
Police arrested Wrench on January 2 and he made no answer to questions asked by detectives .
Medication including Temazepam was found at his home .
The drug , whose effects include " dizziness , sedation , drowsiness , disorientation and reduced alertness " , was also detected in a blood sample from the alleged victim , Miss Briscoe said .
Wrench 's alleged victim gave evidence from behind a screen today as the presenter , wearing a grey suit and striped tie , sat in the dock .
The man , now 27 , described how he had first briefly met Wrench at a bar in Vauxhall where he had expressed his interest in doing work experience at Radio 4 .
They talked about it again when they met up at the party , he said .
" What he said was that I could sit in on a show of his and that way he could help me , " said the man , who can not be identified for legal reasons .
After chatting for about two hours , Wrench offered him cocaine and chopped out two lines on the toilet lid .
The man asked if both lines were for him and was surprised and upset at the response , he told the court .
" He said ' I 'm not your sugardaddy ' , " he told the court .
The trial was adjourned to tomorrow .
Tech giant IBM has inked a licensing agreement with Lenovo that will see the Chinese computer vendor making and selling a range of x86 servers .
The two firms are currently keeping quiet about the finer details of the deal , but it 's a move that demonstrates Lenovo 's wish to flex its muscles in the server market as well as extend its reach among small to medium - sized business ( SMB ) customers .
And , perhaps even more significantly , it 's a decision that will spark speculation that it signals IBM 's further retreat from hardware manufacturing in favour of services and solutions .
At the moment , however , Big Blue insists that 's not what 's going on .
Under the new deal the Chinese computer maker – which is currently ranked fourth behind rival Acer on worldwide shipments – will build one - processor and - two processor servers based on IBM's System x server technology .
A Lenovo spokesman told The Register that the agreement did not mean IBM was exiting the market .
He said that " we are not buying IBM System x because it is clearly not for sale " .
In fact , Lenovo thinks that the strategy will see IBM deepen its technology footprint in the x86 server market .
Echoing that sentiment , IBM modular systems manager Rich Hume said in a separate statement that Lenovo would help the tech multinational increase its SMB market share .
He said : " We chose to partner with Lenovo since they bought our PC business .
We will go in the same direction with the x86 server business .
The intent is to engage in a part of the business where we currently do n't participate . "
IBM said that it will continue to make and sell its own similar IBM - branded servers using the same technology , and that it will support Lenovo 's server sales with financing , maintenance and service contracts .
UK IT distie Interface is among the many firms hopeful to benefit from the new deal , with products expected to hit the channel in either the third or fourth quarter of 2008 .
Interface 's sales director Rob Tomlin told El Reg that IBM and Lenovo had " played a blinder " by deciding to combine forces and focus efforts on the tasty SMB server market .
He said that Interface had already reaped the benefits from the sale of IBM notebooks and PCs to Lenovo thanks to its " slick supply chain " , and claimed that " sales doubled " following the takeover .
" You 've got to hope they 'll do the same in SMBs with the x86 market , " he added . ®
The following was taken from a cave wall painting in southern Tunisia more than 300,000 years ago .
Fossil evidence suggests that the author was of the species Homo erectus .
To further expound upon the topic of last week ’s installment , I will address the more specific claims of Dr. Klomp and his radical theory that has been gaining wider acceptance throughout the community .
Once again I would like to thank our readers for sending in your fish bones and boar hides in support of this journalist ’s campaign to expose Dr. Klomp ’s trans - simianist prattle for what it is : a collection of wishful thoughts out of keeping with any factual evidence .
The term ‘ trans - simian ’ comes from the shortening of ‘ transitional simian , ’ a concept Dr. Klomp has developed to describe an individual who is in an evolutionary transition from simian to post - simian , though Klomp himself admits that he is not entirely clear what a true post - simian would be .
Characteristics exhibited by a trans - simian include augmentation of one ’s natural abilities with ‘ tools , ’ as well as one ’s mental capacities with what has been dubbed ‘ culture . ’
Klomp ’s primary argument rests on what he calls the ‘ Quickening , ’ an imagined point somewhere in the future when the advancement of ‘ culture ’ occurs so rapidly that its pace will far exceed that of biological evolution .
In his own words ,
" There will come a time when within a single generation we will develop one or possibly even two new ideas …
Current advancements in the ‘ bow ’ and ‘ arrow ’ industries suggest an exponential trend in the expansion of our technological capacities .
We are able to perform hunts in a fraction of the time it took our ancestors , thus freeing up valuable time to ’ think ’ of new ideas .
In the post - simian world , we may develop into a species that is not only intellectually superior to our current state , but capable of feats beyond the comprehension of a contemporary simian . "
Pardon this author for not holding his breath .
Notice that Klomp cherry - picks discoveries to better support his argument of an exponential growth .
It took more than a million years to develop fire and the hand - ax , and yet Klomp believes simply because it took only 2,000 years to develop bows and arrows that new inventions will spring up in even shorter timeframes .
This theory is an expansion of ‘ Morg ’s Law , ’ which states that since a sharpened rock can in turn become a chisel to make an even sharper rock , that the sharpness of hand - axes will increase exponentially over the span of tens of thousands of years .
While Morg ’s Law has so far proven accurate , Klomp ca n’t escape the reality that there is an upper limit , namely that a rock can only become so sharp .
We have already noticed a slight decline in the growth of hand - ax sharpness , but Klomp insists that when the potential of stone axes becomes exhausted , new materials will be discovered to replace the rocks and continue the exponential trend of sharpness .
As of the time of this article , however , he has provided no evidence of what these miracle rocks are .
Klomp also argues that there will come a time when we will use tools to create other tools , though naturally this is a laughable fiction since there has never been any recorded evidence of a tool making another tool , or even any records for that matter .
Another factor in Klomp ’s post - simian world is the development of " abstract thought " that will be aided by
" the ability to store memories and thoughts outside our brains onto physical media , perhaps on flattened tree bark .
To achieve this we will have to overcome the problem of turning words , which are sounds , into things we can see , but given current trends this is an engineering issue that will ultimately be resolved .
This will be the real catalyst for the Quickening , when the memories of one generation will literally become immortal and then build upon the memories of the next , creating a sort of mass mind that experts in my field are calling “ history . ”
In the post - simian world our era might even be referred to as pre-history . "
Here we see Klomp ’s predictions descend from unsupported speculation to sheer fantasy .
His recent cave painting , The Quickening is Near , explains in great detail different methods we may employ to transform words into some kind of visible format , but all are incomplete .
The simple fact remains that words are sounds , not pictures , and no amount of wishing will change that .
Even if such a thing were possible , it is doubtful that many would wish to store their memories externally .
This author , for one , would prefer it if his memories stayed in his head and not on some cold , lifeless bark .
The most shocking of Klomp ’s predictions , however , is that we apes will have little or no place in the post - simian world .
" As technological progress outpaces biology , new selective pressures will arise that will force our species to evolve mentally and physically beyond what we are now .
This is the same trend that gave rise to our own intelligent species , but it will only accelerate in the coming generations .
Our new environment increasingly favors higher dexterity and intelligence , and so the true post - simian will not be an ape at all .
It will share some similarities with the modern ape , but at the same time possess capacities far beyond our comprehension .
The thought capacity of a single post - simian could be greater than the combined brains of every ape in the world . "
More intelligent than an ape ?
Klomp fails to explain just what a post - ape can think of that we mere mortals cannot .
The capacity of the simian mind is already far beyond any animal in the world :
We are capable of using speech to let others know where we are , where to sleep and eat , and where to find shelter when it rains .
Exactly how fast do we need our brains to be to figure these things out ?
When will we decide that enough is enough ?
Let us assume , for the sake of argument , that such a post - simian future is possible or even probable .
Is it really a world we should want to strive for , where our very ape nature is stripped away in the name of efficiency ?
Technologies such as the bow and arrow already desimianize the act of hunting .
While our ancestors were able to experience the pure ape feeling of clubbing an animal to death with a rock , we are left with the cold , sterilized bow that kills cleanly and quickly from a safe distance .
This separation from basic daily activities is a slippery slope .
What would happen if we no longer had to gather fruits and nuts , and they simply grew wherever we wanted them , or had drinking water flow right to our feet instead of wandering in search of streams for days ?
These seeming conveniences would rob us of what it means to be an ape .
Klomp predicts that through a technology called ‘ hygiene ’ we could extend the simian lifespan well into the late 20s or possibly 30s .
What exactly will the post - simian do with all that time ?
Do we really want to live in a society populated by geriatric 27 - year - olds ?
In living so long and spending so much time ‘ thinking , ’ do we not also run the risk of becoming a cold , passionless race incapable of experiencing our two emotions ( fear and not fear ) ?
How much of our simianity are we willing to sacrifice for this notion of progress ?
Rest assured that while Klomp may have accru ed a recent following , there is no reality to his fantastic claims .
What is concerning is the increasing number of young apes spending less time clubbing animals and more time ‘ inventing , ’ ‘ thinking ’ and ‘ creating , ’ none of which contribute to the preservation of the simian way of life .
These sorts of fads come and go , however , and this author is confident that in a short while everyone will have forgotten about Klomp and the notion of being anything more than an ape . ”

Because I am a culturally Christian atheist the same way my atheist Reform friends are culturally Jewish , I look forward to Martin Luther King ’s Birthday  when the news momentarily replaces the rants of the faith - based spitfires with clips of what an actually Christlike Christian sounds like  with the kind of fondness with which my pal Ben looks back on the decent , affectionate ideal that was his summer camp .
I have become just another citizen whose only religion is the freedom of religion and as such I patrol the wall of separation between church and state like some jumpy East German guarding Checkpoint Charlie back before Ronald Reagan single - handedly tore it down .
Which is why I am relieved that journalists and voters keep asking Mike Huckabee , the Republican presidential candidate , what he meant 10 years ago when he told a meeting of his fellow Baptists , “ I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ . ”
That is a curiously unconstitutional opinion for someone seeking the job of defending the Constitution , not to mention historically inaccurate considering the mostly deist founders were about as spiritual as the original cast of “ Hair . ”
But I am also relieved when Mr. Huckabee occasionally blurts out some Sunday School sentiment about how he does n’t think a poor child should have to sleep in a car .
Of course , this whiff of Jesus makes some of his fellow Republicans turn on him as if he ’s Michael Dukakis .
Because they fear that trying to find the homeless homes translates into raising the taxes they must render unto Caesar .
Whoever wins the presidential election this year will be a Christian .
( Unless of course it ’s that one guy who is a member of a Muslim sleeper cell .
Just when you think the electoral process could n’t get any more stupid ....)
So the rest of us might as well suck it up and see if we can pick the Christian who is , if incapable of loving his or her enemies , the one who seems least likely to drum up a bunch of extra , new enemies to hate .
In this age of a slower , grubbier mutually assured destruction , when no one ’s typed the word “ nonviolence ” since the typewriter , it ’s worth reading Dr. King ’s quarrel with the cold war ’s MAD ploy .
In the “ loving your enemies ” text he tells a pretty little parable about how one night his brother A. D. drove him to Tennessee .
Infuriated by all the other cars ’ brights , A. D. vowed to crank his lights and blind the next driver passing by .
Dr. King told him not to , that it would just get everybody killed .
“ Somebody got to have some sense on this highway , ” he said .

The only difference is a “ for line in f : “ , instead of “ for line in f.readlines ( ) : “ .
This saves a LOT of memory , but is slower .

In this version , I use precompiled regular expresions , and the time - saving is noticeable .

Later I decided to use AWK to perform the heaviest part : parsing the big file , to produce a second , smaller , file that Python will read .
Running time : 14.8s .

Version 4
Instead of using AWK , I decided to use grep , with the idea that nothing can beat this tool , when it comes to pattern matching .
I was not disappointed .
Running time : 5.4s .

Version 5
I was not completely happy yet .
I discovered the -F flag for grep ( in the man page ) , and decided to use it .
This flag tells grep that the pattern we are using is a literal , so no expansion of it has to be made .
Using the -F flag I further reduced the running time to : 1.5s .

“ THE Mohammedans in their fanaticism seemed determined not only to exterminate the Christian population but to remove all traces of their religion and …civilisation . ”
So wrote an American consul in Turkey , in 1915 , about an incipient campaign by Ottoman Turkey against its Armenian population .
Today , Turkey explains the killings of huge numbers of Armenians — as many as 1.5 m died — as an unpleasant by - product of the first world war 's viciousness , in which Turks suffered too .
But Armenians have long campaigned for recognition of what they say was genocide .
On Wednesday October 10th America 's Congress stepped closer to endorsing the latter view .
The foreign - affairs committee of the House of Representatives passed a bill stating that “ the Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923 . ”
The bill has enough co-sponsors that it seems likely to pass the full House .
The speaker , Nancy Pelosi , has a large number of Armenians in her home district and has promised the measure a vote on the floor .
As a foretaste of the trouble this could stir up in Turkey , the country 's president , Abdullah Gul , immediately condemned the passage of the bill .
He called it “ unacceptable ” and accused American politicians of being willing to cause “ big problems for small domestic political games ” .
Turkey is enormously important to American military efforts in the Middle East .
So leading American politicians past and present have lined up to oppose the resolution .
President George Bush has said historians , not legislators , should decide the matter .
Turkey has hired Dick Gephardt , a former leader of the Democrats in the House , to lobby against the bill .
All eight living former secretaries of state , from Henry Kissinger to Madeleine Albright , who lost three grandparents in the Nazi Holocaust , oppose the bill .
So does Condoleezza Rice , who holds the post now .
Jane Harman , a powerful and hawkish Democrat , initially co-sponsored the measure .
But last week she urged its withdrawal .
A trip to Turkey , where she met the prime minister and the Armenian Orthodox patriarch , changed her mind .
Ms Harman echoed an argument that others have made against the resolution : that Turkey itself is tiptoeing towards normal relations with neighbouring Armenia .
The resolution could throw that process off course .
But in other ways
Turkey has not helped its own case : its criminal code has been used against writers within the country who dare to mention genocide .
And other Turkish behaviour has further distanced it from America .
Turkey recently signed a deal to develop oil and gas with Iran , and has made overtures to Hamas , which runs part of the Palestinian Authority and continues to refuse to recognise Israel .
Such behaviour has cost Turkey some support among Jewish Americans — formerly ardent supporters of Turkey as a moderate Muslim republic that is friendly to Israel .
Some even worry that a freshly insulted Turkey will not heed America 's opinion when , for example , it thinks about crossing the border into Iraq to pound Kurdish fighters .
It is hardly surprising that Turkey is feeling put-upon .
Last year , France 's National Assembly passed a bill not only declaring that the Armenian massacres constituted genocide , but making it a crime to deny it .
Had the bill made it into law this would have resulted in an absurd situation in which Turkish law forbade mention of genocide while French law forbade its denial , all during Turkey 's application to join the European Union .
Turks complained that the French bill had less to do with Armenians , and more to do with deterring Turkey 's EU membership .
The mood has not improved since .
France 's new president , Nicolas Sarkozy , is an outspoken opponent of Turkish membership .
Hurt feelings on both sides are pushing Turkey and the West apart : Turkey feels mistreated , and acts in such a way .
But the deal with Iran and its pell - mell pursuit of Kurdish terrorists into Iraq antagonise Americans and Europeans further .
At the least , the panicky reaction of the Bush administration over the genocide resolution shows that policymakers realise that they can no longer take Turkey 's friendship for granted .
Court backs Novato student 's protected speech
The U.S. Supreme Court left intact Tuesday a ruling that said Novato school district officials violated a student 's freedom of expression when they confiscated a high school newspaper because of an editorial attacking illegal immigrants .
The ruling , issued last May by a state appeals court in San Francisco , relied on a California law that protects freedom of the press in public schools more strongly than the constitutional rights guaranteed under the First Amendment .
Tuesday 's Supreme Court order , which denied a hearing sought by the Novato Unified School District , means that California students " will be able to publish very controversial political opinions without fearing retribution , " said Paul Beard of the Pacific Legal Foundation , a lawyer for the student who wrote the editorial .
The district 's lawyer was unavailable for comment .
High school senior Andrew Smith wrote the editorial for the Novato High newspaper , the Buzz , in November 2001 when he was 18 .
He said immigrants should stay out of the country if they can't go to the trouble of becoming citizens .
Authorities " should treat these people the way cops would treat a suspected criminal , " Smith wrote .
" If a person looks suspicious then just stop them and ask a few questions , and if they answer , ' Que ? ' detain them . "
After some students and parents protested , school district officials pulled remaining copies of the newspaper out of circulation and sent a letter to parents saying the editorial should n't have been published .
Smith and his father , Dale Smith , sued in Marin County Superior Court , claiming that the district had illegally censored the piece and subjected the younger Smith to public reprimand for expressing unpopular positions .
A judge dismissed the suit , noting that the editorial had been published and that the student had n't been disciplined .
But the First District Court of Appeal said the district had violated Smith 's rights by confiscating the paper and sending the message to parents .
The appeals court said state law guarantees freedom of the press on campus unless an article is obscene or libelous , or unless it creates a clear and present danger of lawbreaking or disorder on campus .
The school district " succumbed to the fear of disruption and discontent " when it removed the newspaper from circulation , the state court said .
Smith was awarded $ 1 and a declaration that his rights had been violated .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that public school officials could censor student newspapers and remove sensitive topics without violating the First Amendment .
California , however , is one of about a half - dozen states with laws that explicitly protect student expression even if it is controversial .
Tuesday 's case is Novato Unified School District vs. Smith , 07-783 .
Supreme Court denies a review of a lawsuit challenging warrantless surveillance .

Federal agency planned plane - crashing - into - building drill ... last Sept. 11 WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
In what the government describes as a bizarre coincidence , one U.S. intelligence agency was planning an exercise last Sept. 11 in which an errant aircraft would crash into one of its buildings .
But the cause was n't terrorism — it was to be a simulated accident .
Officials at the Chantilly , Va.- based National Reconnaissance
Office had scheduled an exercise that morning in which a small corporate jet would crash into one of the four towers at the agency 's headquarters building after experiencing a mechanical failure .
The agency is about four miles from the runways of Washington Dulles International Airport .
Agency chiefs came up with the scenario to test employees ' ability to respond to a disaster , said spokesman Art Haubold .
No actual plane was to be involved — to simulate the damage from the crash , some stairwells and exits were to be closed off , forcing employees to find other ways to evacuate the building .
" It was just an incredible coincidence that this happened to involve an aircraft crashing into our facility , " Haubold said .
" As soon as the real world events began , we canceled the exercise . "
Terrorism was to play no role in the exercise , which had been planned for several months , he said .
Adding to the coincidence , American Airlines Flight 77 — the Boeing 767 that was hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon — took off from Dulles at 8:10 a.m. on Sept. 11 , 50 minutes before the exercise was to begin .
It struck the Pentagon around 9:40 a.m. , killing 64 aboard the plane and 125 on the ground .
The National Reconnaissance Office operates many of the nation 's spy satellites .
It draws its personnel from the military and the CIA .
After the Sept. 11 attacks , most of the 3,000 people who work at agency headquarters were sent home , save for some essential personnel , Haubold said .
An announcement for an upcoming homeland security conference in Chicago first noted the exercise .
In a promotion for speaker John Fulton , a CIA officer assigned as chief of NRO 's strategic gaming division , the announcement says , " On the morning of September 11th 2001 , Mr. Fulton and his team ... were running a pre-planned simulation to explore the emergency response issues that would be created if a plane were to strike a building .
Little did they know that the scenario would come true in a dramatic way that day . "
The conference is being run by the National Law Enforcement and Security Institute .

The ' shot ' – that ’s what Ambassador James Jeffrey called the decision to use an an Aegis SM - 3 to try to shoot down satellite USA 193 in the next 3 - 12 days .
Holding the aside the politics of this — which are terrible — the briefing on debris risk left me cold .
I have to say that I am very , very uneasy about this decision — our missile defense tests have been heavily scripted to minimize debris creation and modeling of debris creation is n’t an exact science .
The burden of proof really should be on these guys to demonstrate that the risks to the ISS and other objects in space are minimal .
General Carwright , to his credit , provided enough technical information to model the intercept .
David Wright is working on that right now — for those of you who can’t wait , the important numbers are :
1 . The intercept will occur at 240 kilometers ( 130 nautical miles )
2 . The mass of the satellite is 2,300 kg ( 5,000 pounds )
3 . The mass of the interceptor is 20 kg. ( From CBO )
4 . The closing velocity will be 9.8 km/s ( 22,000 mph ) , suggesting a virtually head - on collision .
Other pertinent observations .
At 240 km , the satellite should be traveling 7.8 km /s ; the SM - 3 has a burnout velocity of 3 km/s .
I am very worried about the debris creation — particularly the debris that the light - weight interceptor will kick into higher orbits when it hits the massive ( bus - sized ) satellite .
Think , as Geoff Forden suggested , of a ping pong ball hitting a superball .
Virtually all the debris should come down quickly .
Cartwright said 50 percent would come down within two orbits , with the rest coming down in weeks and months .
That seems plausible , at first blush .
But those two orbits could be hairy and some of the debris will remain in orbit .
Michael Griffin , NASA Administrator , said there are “ good times and bad times ” to conduct the intercept , based on the position of the ISS but that “ bad times are not all that bad ” comparing the risk to an order of magnitude lower than flying the shuttle .
Last I checked , the Space Shutle 's PRAN ( probability risk assessment number , of complete loss of life ) was 1 in 100 .
Extrapolating , there would be only a 1 in 1000 chance of wiping out the ISS .
Great .
Anyway , we should be able to get some real numbers in the next 24 hours .

Stephan C. Schuster and Webb Miller of Penn State , working with Thomas Gilbert from Copenhagen and a large international consortium , discovered that hair shafts provide an ideal source of ancient DNA -- a better source than bones and muscle for studying the genome sequences of extinct animals .
Their research achievement , described in a paper to be published in the journal Science on Sept. 28 , includes the sequencing of entire mitochondrial genomes from 10 individual woolly mammoths .
Schuster and Miller , working at Penn State 's Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics , and Gilbert , from the Center for Ancient Genetics at the University of Copenhagen , led a team of collaborators that includes a large group of researchers and museum curators from the United States , Russia , Belgium , Denmark , France , Italy , Sweden and the United Kingdom .
The research team obtained hair from 10 woolly mammoths collected from a wide swathe of northern Siberia and with dates of death spanning approximately 38,000 years -- from 50,000 years to 12,000 years ago .
Before this study , only seven mitochondrial genomes from extinct animals had been published : four from ancient birds , two from mammoths and one from a mastodon .
" DNA in bones and muscle usually degrades and becomes contaminated with genetic material from other sources such as bacteria , limiting its usefulness in scientific studies , " Schuster explained .
Because only a tiny proportion of ancient bones and muscle are preserved in such a way that uncontaminated DNA can be recovered , research with such materials has involved laborious efforts , sometimes spanning as long as six years for a single study .
In contrast , Miller said , " Once I get the data from the genome sequencer , it takes only five minutes to assemble the entire mitochondrial genome . "
The discovery to be published in Science demonstrates that hair clippings can give researchers enormous power and efficiency for divining the genetic makeup of ancient species .
The methods the team members developed for efficiently generating and analyzing large amounts of ancient mitochondrial - genome sequences now position them to generate such data for other extinct species , as well as to sequence the huge nuclear genome of an extinct species .
" The data already generated from this study set the stage for the sequencing of a complete mammoth genome , " said Schuster .
" We realized that the keratin in hair could protect the DNA it contains from outside influences and hence from the sorts of degradation that affect DNA in other parts of the body , such as bone , " Gilbert said .
Hair also can more easily be cleaned of environmental contaminants , such as bacteria .
The researchers discovered that , even if the hair is washed in a solution that kills and washes off external DNA , the genetic material within the hair is unaffected .
" When people thought of sequencing DNA from hair , the usual assumption was that the material must come from the hair root , which contains recognizable cells , because the hair shaft appears to be dead , " Miller explained ; " however , we now know that a hair shaft consists essentially of DNA encased in a kind of biological plastic . "
Protected in this way , the DNA resists damage and readily can be separated from any bacteria that may contaminate the sample .
" We discovered , moreover , that the DNA in hair shafts is remarkably enriched for mitochondrial DNA , the special type of DNA frequently used to measure the genetic diversity of a population , " Gilbert added .
Several of the hair samples investigated were up to 50,000 years old .
One of the samples came from the first specimen ever recorded : the so - called Adams mammoth , found in 1799 and dug out of the permafrost between1804 and 1806 by the botanist Michael Adams and members of the Tungus tribe .
This mammoth died around 36,000 years ago .
" Hair samples from this find were stored in a Russian museum for 200 years at room temperature , but still allowed for a complete analysis of its mitochondrial genome using only 0.2 grams of hair , " Schuster said .
As a result , he uses the term " museumomics " for his dream of deriving molecular - genomic - analysis data from the specimens stored in the collections of Charles Darwin , Alexander von Humboldt and Carl von Linne .
The new route to the genetic material of extinct animals also will enable researchers to study the relatedness of individual animals from different populations at a much higher resolution than previously thought possible .
" We plan to use hair and other keratin - containing body parts , such as nail and horn , to untangle the secrets of populations that lived long ago , so these populations can send a message from the past about what it might have taken for them to survive , " Schuster said .
" This discovery is good news for anyone interested in learning more about how species of large mammals can go extinct . "
Hospital lawyer : Pakistani police stopped doctors from conducting Bhutto autopsy John Byrne
Published : Monday December 31 , 2007

Print This Email This
The police chief of the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi prevented doctors from performing an autopsy on the corpse of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto , according to a lawyer on the hospital 's board .
The dramatic new revelation emerged as new videotape showed a gunman in close proximity to Bhutto in the moments before her assassination , and a surgeon said he'd felt pressure to conform to the government 's official story on Bhutto 's killing .
Pakistan 's interior minister had previously said that Bhutto's husband , Asif Ali Zardari , had requested the autopsy not be performed .
" Even if the family of a murder victim refuses to allow the autopsy , no investigation can be completed if doctors do not perform the autopsy and conclusively find the cause of death , " Athar Minallah , a top lawyer and a member of Rawalpindi General Hospital where Bhutto was taken after the attack said in an article by Times of India .
" The doctors were worried that their initial report , which did not determine the definite cause of death , is being politically twisted . "
The decision was taken despite the fact a post - mortem examination is required under Pakistani law in the cases of murder .
Doctors performed an " external " post mortem and distributed cropped images of Bhutto 's skull to reporters .
Under the official story , Bhutto was killed by the sunroof of her armored LandCruiser after a bomb went off when she was standing up to wave to a crowd .
In an open letter Monday , Minallah released the doctors ' notes .
" In the letter , " according to CNN , " Minallah said the doctors ' suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy , ' but that Rawalpindi police chief Aziz Saud " did not agree . "
He noted that under the law , police investigators have ' exclusive responsibility ' in deciding to have an autopsy . "
Minallah told CNN he was voicing his concerns because doctors did n't feel they could speak out , saying they were " threatened . "
" They are government servants who can not speak -- I am not , " he told the network , saying the failure to perform an autopsy has fueled " a perception that there is some kind of cover - up , though I might not believe in that theory . "
The medical report of Bhutto's death identified a wound of several centimeters above her left ear , with no foreign body felt .
Pakistan 's interior ministry says they are open to exhuming the body ; Bhutto's husband opposes the move , saying he does n't trust the government .
The police meddling at the hospital would not mark the first time officers ' actions have come into question regarding Bhutto 's assassination .
At the rally where she was killed Thursday , police abandoned their posts before the attack by a gunman and suicide bomber .
The scene of the attack was also hosed down within an hour , destroying untold amounts of potential evidence .

Forward Matt Halischuk scored at 3:36 of overtime to lift Canada to a 3 - 2 win over Sweden in the gold - medal game at the world junior hockey championship on Saturday .
Brad Marchand and Claude Giroux added first - period goals in Pardubice , Czech Republic , to help the Canadians win their fourth consecutive gold and 14th overall .
" Our kids just grabbed the rope and said ' You know what ?
We 'll find a way to get this thing done , ' " Canadian coach Craig Hartsburg said .
On the winning goal , Halischuk jammed a loose puck in the crease by Sweden goalie Jhonas Enroth after Canadian forward Shawn Matthias drove to the net from the corner .
" Shawn Matthias did a great job of taking the puck to the net , " said Halischuk , who plays for the Ontario Hockey League 's Kitchener Rangers .
" I just tried to go to the net and it was just sitting there so I whacked it home and saw the ref pointing , so it was pretty special . "
Jonathan Carlsson and Tomas Larsson , the latter with 38 seconds left in regulation , scored for the Swedes , who posted a come - from - behind 4 - 3 victory over the Canadians in the preliminary round .
With Canada smelling victory Saturday and Enroth on the bench for an extra attacker in the dying seconds of the third period , Larsson gave the Swedes some life .
His initial rebound attempt was stopped by defenceman Drew Doughty on the goal line , but he made no mistake on his second shot as Canadian netminder Steve Mason was caught out of position .
" The Swedes turned their game up a notch and it was real hard for us to stay with them speed - wise , " Hartsburg said .
Mason , coming off a 33 - save performance in Friday 's semifinal win over the United States , was named the most valuable player and top goalie of this year 's tournament and also voted by the media to the all - star team .
The biggest of his 26 stops came in OT when he denied Swedish forward Tony Lagerstrom , who stood alone in front of the Canadian net .
The only negative for Canada was the loss of forward Stefan Legein to a separated right shoulder in the first period .
He played one shift and did n't return .
Trailing 2 - 0 , Sweden got on the board at 5:13 of the third period on a Carlsson power - play goal .
Johan
Alcen set up the goal , skating behind Canada 's net and slipping a back - hander to an open Carlsson , who beat Mason to the short side .
Marchand beat Enroth 87 seconds after the opening faceoff for his third goal in as many games against Sweden over the last two years .
He was on the spot when a shot from the faceoff circle by Giroux bounced above Enroth 's head .
The puck appeared to either go off a part of Marchand 's anatomy or a Swedish defender , but it rolled off Enroth and over the goal line .
Later in the frame , Marchand notched his sixth point in the last six games when he set up Giroux .
For the Swedes , who entered the game with a 5 - 0 - 0 record , it was their first medal at the world juniors in 12 years .
They had n't medalled since losing to Canada in the final at the 1996 tournament in Boston , but are 0 - 5 all - time against the Canadians in the medal round .
Sweden 's lone title in this tournament came in 1981 in Germany .
Canada 's road to the final required a 4 - 2 quarter - final win over Finland before beating the U.S. 4 - 1 in a semifinal .
It felt like a home game for the Canadian players , who enjoyed vocal support from about 2,000 fans among the announced crowd of 7,480 — by far the loudest contingent at Pardubice Arena .
Ten Canadian players , including Kyle Turris , Steve Stamkos and John Tavares , are eligible for next year 's tourney in Ottawa .
Canada will also host in 2010 and 2012 and the U.S. gets it in 2011 .
Earlier Saturday , Russia defeated the Americans 4 - 2 in the bronze - medal game .
Nikita Filatov and Alexei Cherepanov led the attack with three points each .

MONEY obviously matters in American politics , but some who wish to be president clearly get a better return on their investments than others .
The big Democratic spenders ( Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama ) have already shelled out more than $ 40 m dollars each for their campaigns ; the Republican Mitt Romney has spent over $ 50 m .
At least they have some delegates to show for it .
Rudy Giuliani , so far , has spent over $ 30 m and has just a single delegate ( this should change in the Florida primary on Tuesday January 29th ) .
The most efficient is Mike Huckabee , who claims 40 delegates for an outlay of $ 1.6 m , a rate of about $ 42,000 per delegate compared with , for example , Mr Romney 's $ 908,000 .
A Democrat needs 2,025 delegates to seal the nomination , a Republican needs only 1,191 .

McCain tried to be tricky about this : he did n't use the matching funds he had qualified for as collateral , but he did use the fact that he could qualify for them at any time .
That 's why he had to give away his legal right to withdraw from the campaign if he lost : to satisfy his lenders , he had to promise to stay in long enough to actually get the matching funds he qualified for , and to give them first dibs on those funds .
Whether or not this violates the law -- a law McCain authored -- I have no idea , but it is certainly an attempt to wriggle out of its requirements , and it ought to put paid , once and for all , to the idea of McCain as a straight - talking man of principle .
Apparently , the FEC has the same questions I had about McCain 's loan .
The AP reports ( h/t TPM ) :
" The government 's top campaign finance regulator says John McCain can't drop out of the primary election 's public financing system until he answers questions about a loan he obtained to kickstart his once faltering presidential campaign .
Federal Election Commission Chairman David Mason , in a letter to McCain this week , said the all - but - certain Republican nominee needs to assure the commission that he did not use the promise of public money to help secure a $ 4 million line of credit he obtained in November .
McCain 's lawyer , Trevor Potter , said Wednesday evening that McCain has withdrawn from the system and that the FEC can't stop him .
Potter said the campaign did not encumber the public funds in any way . (...)
By accepting the public money , McCain would be limited to spending about $ 54 million for the primaries , a ceiling his campaign is near .
That would significantly hinder his ability to finance his campaign between now and the Republican National Convention in September . "
The FEC 's letter to McCain is here ( pdf ) ; the amount McCain has already spent during the primaries is $ 49,650,185.36 ; the exact FEC limits on primary spending are not yet available , but if this were 2007 , they would have been $ 40.89 million , which is considerably less than McCain has already spent .
I assume that the AP got its figure of " about $ 54 million " from the FEC ; if so , then McCain has about four and a half million dollars to spend between now and the Convention in September .
One further problem :
" Complicating the dispute is the FEC 's current lack of a quorum .
The six - member commission has four vacancies and Senate Democrats and Republicans are at loggerheads over how to fill them .
In his letter , Mason told McCain he would need the votes of four commissioners to accept his withdrawal from the system .
" The commission will consider your request at such a time as it has a quorum , " Mason wrote .
Without action by the Senate , McCain could be waiting indefinitely .
(...)
Potter [ McCain 's lawyer ] said McCain will continue with his campaign and not adhere to the public financing system 's limits on spending .
Without a full commission , Mason has little enforcement power .
Likewise , without an FEC , McCain has no way to appeal Mason 's conclusion . "
The FEC thinks it needs a quorum in order to approve McCain 's withdrawal .
But it also needs a quorum in order to enforce its decisions .
And as Mark Schmitt said about McCain , " it 's pretty clear that his attitude toward the Federal Election Commission on this question is , " Come and get me ! " "

MULTIDISCIPLINARY
science is all the rage these days .
Even so , the synergies between archaeology and pharmacology are not , at first sight , obvious .
But there is a connection .
An analytical technique developed for the former , to work out how old things are , is now being used in the latter , to discover , before expensive clinical trials are undertaken , whether promising drugs are likely to fail .
At the moment , a third of drug candidates do not pass such trials .
This may be because they fail to reach the part of the body where they are intended to work many molecules , for example , cannot cross from the bloodstream into the brain .
Or it may be that the body breaks down the active ingredients before the drug has time to act .
Identifying such problems early in the testing process would be a boon .
Trials on animals can help , but how other species react is not always a good indication of how people will .
What is needed is a way of testing potential drugs on people , but in a way that cannot possibly cause any harm .
That is where the archeologists come in .
For decades , archaeologists have used a technique called carbon dating to work out how old their finds are .
Some of the carbon dioxide absorbed by plants during photosynthesis is radioactive .
That is because it contains carbon atoms which are heavier than run -of - the - mill carbon , and are thus unstable .
The radioactive carbon atoms weigh 14 atomic units , whereas the more usual ones weigh 12 units .
Food grains , scraps of cloth , bits of wood and so on can thus be dated by finding out how much radioactive carbon is left in them : the less there is , the older they are .
To measure this , archaeologists use a device called an accelerator mass spectrometer .
This machine shatters minuscule amounts of a sample into its component atoms , ionises those atoms in order to give them an electric charge , and then uses that charge to attract the atoms along a tube .
As they travel , they are deflected by a magnetic field .
Light ones are more easily deflected than heavy ones , so the two forms of carbon get separated , and when each atom reaches a detector at its expected arrival spot , it can be counted .
The technique is so sensitive that it can detect one radioactive carbon atom hiding among a quadrillion ordinary ones .
A few years ago researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , in California , realised that accelerator mass spectrometers tuned to detect radioactive carbon might be adapted to see how drugs survived in the body .
This would be done by including a few radioactive carbon atoms in molecules of the drugs in question .
That has now happened .
Volunteers are given tiny traces of a radioactively labelled drug too small to harm them , and typically just a hundredth of the estimated full dose in a drink .
They are then kept in hospital for two or three days while blood samples are taken every few hours .
Their urine and faeces are also collected .
By examining these samples for the presence of radioactive carbon , the developer of a particular drug can see whether the active ingredients are absorbed into the body and , if they are , how long they persist there .
If they do get absorbed and then persist , the drug is probably worth developing further .
If not , then it can be abandoned before any more expensive tests are conducted .
And by using people rather than experimental animals for the tests , the researchers can be confident that the results are applicable to humans .
The regulatory authorities in America , Europe and Japan have welcomed the idea of microdosing , as the technique is known , and are developing guidelines for its use .
Meanwhile , a number of companies have already been established to offer the technique to drug firms .
One of them , Xceleron , which was formed by scientists from the University of York , in England , has already tested 40 molecules and has recently signed contracts with several large drug companies .
Given the difficulties and delays involved in developing new drugs , microdosing could prove a shot in the arm for pharmaceutical companies .

( Updates below - Update I : NYT matches AP 's obliviousness ; Update II :
In latest article by Star - Telegram , " former head of the FBI in Dallas who was in charge of the agency 's investigation of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing " slams Service Service 's actions at rally . )
On Thursday , I wrote about a frightening lapse in security at Wednesday 's Obama rally in Dallas .
Reporter Jack Douglas Jr. of the Fort Worth Star - Telegram broke the story and has since written a follow - up , to which he updated yesterday .
I noted on Thursday that the mainstream media ( with the exception of UPI ) had completely ignored this story , which has largely continued , with the Associated Press going so far as to publish an article Friday titled " Many Blacks Worry About Obama 's Safety " yet without referencing in the piece what had occurred at Wednesday 's Dallas rally .
Friday 's broadcast of NBC Nightly News did mention an alleged breach of security , but the report - a shoddy piece of journalism driven solely by the Secret Service 's official denial - was summarily tacked on to the end of a separate report on the Obama campaign .
Additionally , in comments left on Douglas ' articles on the Star - Telegram 's website ( one of which he published in his follow - up ) and other sites around the web ( including this one ) , people have provided firsthand accounts of the same type of lax security at Obama rallies throughout the country ( yes , they need to be corroborated , but they reveal a pattern of lax security that also demands further investigation into this matter ) .
First , an exploration of the insufficient Secret Service response to these charges , followed by the deplorable NBC Nightly News segment and then a brief reminder of who controls the Secret Service .
Secret Service Denies Security Lapse
Jack Douglas ' follow - up includes the Secret Service 's denial of any security breach :
" There were no security lapses at that venue , " said Eric Zahren , a spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington .
He added there was " no deviation " from the " comprehensive and layered " security plan , implemented in " very close cooperation with our law enforcement partners . "
Zahren rebutted suggestions by several Dallas police officers at the rally who thought the Secret Service ordered a halt to the time - consuming weapons check because long lines were moving slowly , and many seats remained empty as time neared for Obama to appear .
" It was never a part of the plan at this particular venue to have each and every person in the crowd pass through the Magnetometer , " said Zahren , referring to the device used to detect metal in clothing and bags .
So basic checks , the kind performed at any major sporting or music event , were never " part of the plan " ?
If such checks can be carried out for , say , 20,000 people at a Springsteen concert or 50,000 at a Yankee game , why is it too much to expect the same for our nation 's leading Democratic presidential candidate ?
Douglas goes to report that Zahren " declined to give the reason for checking people for weapons at the front of the lines and letting those farther back go in without inspection . "
Why ?
" We would not want , by providing those details , to have people trying to derive ways in which they could defeat the security at any particular venue , " Zahren said .
Sure , he would n't want to tip off those would - be criminal masterminds to what thousands of people across the country already know : that ( at least up until now ) arriving late and hanging in the back of the line is the surest way to enter without being checked for a weapon .
The article ends with unique spin from the Dallas police brass :
Lt. V.L. Hale III , a spokesman for the Dallas Police Department , said in a statement Friday that he would not comment on security measures at the Obama rally except to say there was no arrest or incident and that it was a " success from a police standpoint . "
So according to Dallas Police Department officials ( as opposed to the officers who were shocked and alarmed by the lapse in security ) , no one actually getting shot or blown up is a " success . "
Of course , that 's not success , but luck .
In Douglas ' updated article , he reports on an additional bit of PR spin , provided by a " lawyer and consultant for security concerns , " who , unwittingly , seems to confirm a security lapse did indeed occur .
The Secret Service may have been doing all it could at the rally , said Keith Howse , a lawyer and consultant for security concerns and a former assistant police chief for the sprawling Baylor Health Care System .
Howse , who was not at the rally , said the Secret Service may have been screening the people closest to the candidate while letting others go in unchecked who were seated far away in the spacious , 17,000 - seat arena .
" It may have ended up not being the best of all worlds , but it might not have been a flat - out security breach , " he said , adding : " I think it 's important to understand that the Secret Service would not sink below minimum protection " for a presidential candidate .
Settling for making the possible future President of the United States merely a slightly harder target is an acceptable level of security ?
Does n't Obama , as well as Hillary Clinton and John McCain , deserve " the best of all worlds " when it comes to federal protection ?
( Incidentally , I 'd be interested to know if Douglas contacted Howse , or if Howse contacted him unsolicited - and if so , if Howse is working in the capacity of security consultant and council for the Dallas Police Department in this matter , or , possibly , even in that role for the Secret Service in this particular case . )
NBC Nightly News Coverage of the " Alleged " Security Breach
Brian Williams spared 75 seconds for this story on Friday night .
He sounded annoyed while framing it for his viewers , his voice betraying an utter lack of curiosity .
Williams ' handling of this segment displayed the worst of network news : a failure to frame a story with intellectual honesty or to ask and follow up on the most glaringly obvious questions .
NBC may have been better off taking its competitors ' lead and ignoring this news altogether .
Instead , this lame effort turned out to be even more insulting - to its viewers , to the safety of a potential future president , and to journalism in general .

The near - human performance of a virtual teacher called Eve created by Massey researchers has drawn the attention of scientists across the computing world .
Eve is what is known in the information sciences as an intelligent or affective tutoring system that can adapt its response to the emotional state of people by interaction through a computer system .
The system “ Easy with Eve ” is thought to be the first of its type .
The ability of virtual Eve to alter her presentation according to the reaction of the child facing her at the keyboard has been hailed as an exciting development in the $ 25 billion e-learning market .
The Massey scientists , led by Dr Hossein Sarrafzadeh at the Auckland - based Institute of Information and Mathematical Sciences , tell the story of creating Eve and the teaching system in the latest issue of the leading international journal on information sciences , Elsevier .
Because one - to - one teaching is known to be the most effective teaching method , Dr Sarrafzadeh says the researchers wanted to create a virtual teacher that could pick up body language and facial expressions – like a real teacher – to interact and to ensure they are holding the attention of students .
He says the realisation that software systems would significantly improve performance if they could adapt to the emotions of the user has spawned research and development in the field of affective or intelligent tutoring systems .
“ With rising demand for long - distance learning and online tutoring , a computer programe capable of detecting human emotions may become a critical teaching tool . ”
Although Eve was developed for one - to - one maths teaching with eight - year - olds , she is a significant new character in the future of human computer interaction and could be a personalised virtual tutor by any name .
Linked to a child via computer , the animated character or virtual tutor can tell if the child is frustrated , angry or confused by the on - screen teaching session and can adapt the tutoring session appropriately .
The animated Eve ( with a human - sounding voice ) can ask questions , give feedback , discuss questions and solutions and show emotion .
To develop the software for this system the Massey team observed children and their interactions with teachers and captured them on thousands of images .
From these images of facial expression , gestures and body movements they developed programs that would capture and recognise facial expression , body movement , and ( via a mouse ) heart rate and skin resistance .
The system uses a network of computer systems , mainly embedded devices , to detect student emotion and other significant bio-signals .
“ When we interact with people we expect them to take note of our feelings and reactions .
Soon we will be able to expect the same from a computer , ” says Dr Sarrafzadeh .

far too much emphasis on function at the organism level
The term " junk DNA " was not coined on the basis of not knowing what it does .
It was not a cop - out or a surrender .
Susumu
Ohno coined the term in 1972 in reference to a specific mechanism of non-coding DNA formation that he thought accounted for the discrepancies in genome size among species : gene duplication and pseudogenization .
That is , a gene is duplicated and one of the copies becomes degraded by mutation to the point of being non-functional with regard to protein coding .
( Sometimes the second copy takes on a new function through " neofunctionalization " , or the two copies may split the original function through " subfunctionalization " ) .
" Junk " meant something that was functional ( a gene ) but now is n't ( a pseudogene ) .
It was not a cop -out or a surrender .

" Junk " meant something that was functional ( a gene ) but now is n't ( a pseudogene ) .
Since the first discussions about DNA amount there have been scientists who argued that most non-coding DNA is functional , others who focused on mechanisms that could lead to more DNA in the absence of function , and yet others who took a position somewhere in the middle .
This is still the situation now .
Lots of mechanisms are known that can increase the amount of DNA in a genome : gene duplication and pseudogenization , duplicative transposition , replication slippage , unequal crossing - over , aneuploidy , and polyploidy .
By themselves , these could lead to increases in DNA content independent of benefits for the organism , or even despite small detrimental impacts , which is why non-function is a reasonable null hypothesis .
Evidence currently available suggests that about 5 % of the human genome is functional .
The least conservative guesses put the possible total at about 20 % .
The human genome is mid-sized for an animal , which means that most likely a smaller percentage than this is functional in other genomes .
None of the discoveries suggest that all ( or even more than a minor percentage ) of non-coding DNA is functional , and the corollary is that there is indirect evidence that most of it is not .

None of the discoveries suggest that all ( or even more than a minor percentage ) of non-coding DNA is functional , and the corollary is that there is indirect evidence that most of it is not .
Identification of function is done by evolutionary biologists and genome researchers using an explicit evolutionary framework .
One of the best indications of function that we have for non-coding DNA is to find parts of it conserved among species .
This suggests that changes to the sequence have been selected against over long stretches of time because those regions play a significant role .
Obviously you can not talk about evolutionarily conserved DNA without evolutionary change .
Examples of transposable elements acquiring function represent co-option .
This is the same phenomenon that is involved in the evolution of complex features like eyes and flagella .
In particular , co-option of TEs appears to have happened in the evolution of the vertebrate immune system .
Again , this makes no sense in the absence of an evolutionary scenario .
Most transposable elements do not appear to be functional at the organism level .
In humans , most are inactive molecular fossils .
Some are active , however , and can cause all manner of diseases through their insertions .
To repeat : some transposons are functional , some are clearly deleterious , and most probably remain more or less neutral .
Any suggestions that all non-coding DNA is functional must explain why an onion needs five times more of it than you do .
So far , none of the proposed unilateral functions has done this .
It therefore remains most reasonable to take a pluralistic approach in which only some non-coding elements are functional for organisms .
It is commonly suggested by anti-evolutionists that recent discoveries of function in non-coding DNA support intelligent design and refute " Darwinism " .
This misrepresents both the history and the science of this issue .
I would like to provide some clarification of both aspects .
When people began estimating genome sizes ( amounts of DNA per genome ) in the late 1940s and early 1950s , they noticed that this is largely a constant trait within organisms and species .
In other words , if you look at nuclei in different tissues within an organism or in different organisms from the same species , the amount of DNA per chromosome set is constant .
( There are some interesting exceptions to this , but they were not really known at the time ) .
This observed constancy in DNA amount was taken as evidence that DNA , rather than proteins , is the substance of inheritance .
These early researchers also noted that some " less complex " organisms ( e.g. , salamanders ) possess far more DNA in their nuclei than " more complex " ones ( e.g. , mammals ) .
This rendered the issue quite complex , because on the one hand DNA was thought to be constant because it's what genes are made of , and yet the amount of DNA ( " C- value " , for " constant " ) did not correspond to assumptions about how many genes an organism should have .
This ( apparently ) self - contradictory set of findings became known as the " C- value paradox " in 1971 .
This " paradox " was solved with the discovery of non-coding DNA .
Because most DNA in eukaryotes does not encode a protein , there is no longer a reason to expect C - value and gene number to be related .
Not surprisingly , there was speculation about what role the " extra " DNA might be playing .
In 1972 , Susumu Ohno coined the term " junk DNA " .
The idea did not come from throwing his hands up and saying " we do n't know what it does so let 's just assume it is useless and call it junk " .
He developed the idea based on knowledge about a mechanism by which non-coding DNA accumulates : the duplication and inactivation of genes .
" Junk DNA , " as formulated by Ohno , referred to what we now call pseudogenes , which are non-functional from a protein - coding standpoint by definition .
Nevertheless , a long list of possible functions for non-coding DNA continued to be proposed in the scientific literature .
In 1979 , Gould and Lewontin published their classic " spandrels " paper ( Proc. R. Soc. Lond . B 205 : 581-598 ) in which they railed against the apparent tendency of biologists to attribute function to every feature of organisms .
In the same vein , Doolittle and Sapienza published a paper in 1980 entitled " Selfish genes , the phenotype paradigm and genome evolution " ( Nature 284 : 601-603 ) .
In it , they argued that there wasin explanations for the presence of so much non-coding DNA .
Instead , they argued , self - replicating sequences ( transposable elements ) may be there simply because they are good at being there , independent of effects ( let alone functions ) at the organism level .
Many biologists took their point seriously and began thinking about selection at two levels , within the genome and on organismal phenotypes .
Meanwhile , functions for non-coding DNA continued to be postulated by other authors .
As the tools of molecular genetics grew increasingly powerful , there was a shift toward close examinations of protein - coding genes in some circles , and something of a divide emerged between researchers interested in particular sequences and others focusing on genome size and other large - scale features .
This became apparent when technological advances allowed thoughts of sequencing the entire human genome : a question asked in all seriousness was whether the project should bother with the " junk " .
Of course , there is now a much greater link between genome sequencing and genome size research .
For one , you need to know how much DNA is there just to get funding .
More importantly , sequence analysis is shedding light on the types of non-coding DNA responsible for the differences in genome size , and non-coding DNA is proving to be at least as interesting as the genic portions .
To summarize ,
You can tell someone who knows very little about the science or history of " junk DNA " when they make one or more of the following claims :
1 ) All scientists have always thought it was all totally irrelevant to the organism .
2 ) New evidence is suggesting that it is all functional .
3 ) " Darwinism " led to the assumption that non-coding DNA is non-functional .
The opposite is true in each case .

The occam -π programming language
occam-π ( occam - pi ) is a concurrent programming language using the process - oriented programming model , which aims to make it straightforward to write correct , expressive concurrent programs .
occam -π is supported on a variety of platforms by a collection of open source tools , and is used and maintained by a community of developers around the world .
Resources
If you 're new to occam -π , the Learning Resources page should probably be your first port of call .
The OccamDoc pages are an online reference to the occam -π standard libraries , generated automatically from the source code .
occam -π resources at the University of Kent include the original occam -π pages , and the PLAS Wiki , which contains various information useful for occam -π programmers , including a language reference , a style guide and the OccamDoc manual .
WoTUG is a forum for users of the CSP programming model ; it organises the Communicating Process Architectures conference series .
Implementations
KRoC ( the Kent Retargetable occam Compiler ) is an open - source collection of tools and libraries for occam -π development .
Currently , KRoC can run occam -π programs using two different approaches :
Using IA32 native - code compilation and CCSP , an extremely efficient scheduler that dynamically schedules lightweight processes across multiple processor cores .
Using the Transterpreter , a highly - portable , lightweight virtual machine for occam -π programs that works on both conventional machines and small microcontrollers .
Work in progress includes developing a new occam -π compiler , and generating more efficient code for multiple platforms using LLVM .
History
The occam programming language was originally developed by INMOS for the transputer concurrent microprocessor .
The last INMOS version of occam was occam 2.1 . INMOS are now part of SGS Thomson , and the ST20 microprocessor used widely in set - top boxes and GPS receivers is a direct descendent of the transputer .
Development of the occam programming language , along with its associated tools and libraries , was continued by the occam for all project at the University of Kent.
occam -π is Kent 's extended version of occam 2.1 , introducing features from the pi-calculus to support large - scale dynamic concurrency .
While several of occam -π's developers still work within the Programming Languages and Systems group at the University of Kent , occam - π is now used and maintained by developers around the world .
Language extensions
occam -π remains a language under development .
A list of proposed , accepted and rejected extensions to the language can be found on the occam enhancement proposals page .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Foreclosures were once the turf of the most aggressive investors , but these days ordinary home buyers can hunt for fire - sale house prices on a wealth of Internet sites .

Foreclosures were once the turf of the most aggressive investors , but these days ordinary home buyers can hunt for fire - sale house prices on a wealth of Internet sites .
REUTERS / Mark Avery
Large real estate sites such as PropertyShark.com and RealtyTrac.com showcase a growing number of U.S. properties in pre-foreclosure and foreclosure , a phenomenon that is becoming far more common with the U.S. subprime mortgage meltdown .
They pull together thousands of listings based on public information , adding photos or aerial images of the houses and eliminating the need to sift through court documents .
In some cases , they offer phone numbers of homeowners and court dates .
In March , Yahoo Real Estate opened a comprehensive site on foreclosures together with RealtyTrac , expanding the reach of such data to its nearly 500 million global users .
“ The goal for you as a buyer is to purchase a property at least 20 percent below full market value , although better deals are often possible , ” Yahoo ’s site tells the uninitiated .
Perhaps the most significant change is that ordinary home buyers are making more use of these sites , less hesitant to capitalize on the financial misfortune of others .
They will find many more opportunities , as the U.S. foreclosure rate by the end of 2007 had risen nearly 80 percent from a year earlier .
“ It is what it is .
I ’m not going to sit here and tell you otherwise , ” said Bill Staniford , partner at Property Shark .
“ This is a debacle going down from the top of government to the mortgage brokers .
There ’s lots of blame to go round , but the more people in this industry there are , the better off the homeowner . ”
WAIT FOR THE GAVEL
Potential buyers are also getting involved earlier in the process , finding a way to speak directly to owners on notice for default rather than wait for the gavel to come down .
“ Many people think about the auction when they think about foreclosure .
They get fixated on it , ” said Staniford .
“ But most of the transactions are getting done before the auction . ”
RealtyTrac says traffic to its site has tripled to about 3 million unique visitors every month from 1 million just two years ago .
It estimates as many as 40 percent of visits come from first - time home buyers rather than investors or brokers .
Yahoo Real Estate saw a fivefold increase in traffic to its foreclosure listings since it expanded the site last year .
“ There are a lot of people who have been priced out of the market and they ’re seeing their rents go up , ” said Rick Sharga , vice president of marketing at Realty Trac .
“ Probably until next year , the level of foreclosure activity will remain at historically high levels . ”
RealtyTrac is seeing increased interest in its site from overseas investors , fueled by a weak U.S. dollar .
The company aims to expand its subscription U.S. listings service to foreign nationals as early as 2008 , and may eventually offer foreclosure information from markets abroad .
“ The challenge is that there is n’t something exactly like U.S. foreclosure laws in every country , ” Sharga said .
Fresh data from PropertyShark shows the number of scheduled foreclosures in four large metropolitan areas -- New York City , Miami , Los Angeles and Seattle -- reached two - year highs in January .
The number of foreclosures more than doubled in Miami and nearly quadrupled in Los Angeles in that time .
For Web users , a simple search shows how popular the term “ foreclosure ” has become , but the quality of many sites is unclear .
FLIP SIDE
Foreclosure.com this week cited more than 362,000 pre-foreclosure listings , nearly 39,000 sheriff sales and almost 281,000 bankruptcies .
ForeclosureUniversity.com aggregates news articles on the topic , while other sites give information on home auctions on a state - by - state basis .
On the flip side , the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development offers advice on how to avoid foreclosure if one can't make mortgage payments .
Their recommendation : Do n't ignore your lender ( here ) .
Buyers interested in foreclosures should be wary of everything from hidden liens on a property to navigating their first approach to an owner .
“ This is not something we recommend people get into without educating themselves , ” Steve Schultz , director of product management at Yahoo Real Estate , told Reuters .
“ There are a lot of pitfalls , ” Schultz said .
“ You may end up getting into a situation where you ’re going to upset a particular buyer .
You ’re going to make a phone call and they ’re not really ready to get into a sales conversation . ”
If there is a silver lining , experts say , it ’s that regular home buyers may be less aggressive in the discounts they seek , offering some maneuvering room for people out of luck .
Sharga said the worst of the foreclosure growth could end by June , after a huge wave of adjustable subprime loans resets .
Barring other economic upsets , the real estate market could take six more months to stabilize , he said .
“ A lot of the properties in foreclosure are there for really bad financing , ” he said .
“ You ’re actually offering a sort of life raft for home owners in a sea of distress . ”
A ticket quota is a policy that encourages or requires officers to give out a certain number of traffic tickets regardless of how many people are actually violating the law .
Here ’s a quick roundup of stories from this year where ticket quotas were discovered around the country .
November
Washington State Police Use Ticket Quotas
Officials with the Washington State Patrol set numeric goals that encourage state police officers to issue as many traffic citations as possible .
The effect has been a significant increase in the number of tickets written — 50,000 additional tickets were issued between 2005 and 2006 .
A Bellvue state patrol sergeant issued a memo ordering troopers to meet the accountability goals , writing : “ No matter how many cars you stop , the goal … is 80 percent enforcement ( tickets ) . ”
Those failing to meet the goal may lose vacation time or receive other sanctions .

Georgia : Speed Trap Caught Using Ticket Quotas
WGCL - TV reports that DeKalb County Police officers are told during roll call that they must issue 65 citations a month and make 25 arrests .
Those on traffic duty must issue a minimum of 150 citations a month and make 11 arrests .
Unlike in many states , ticket quotas are not illegal in Georgia .
September
Texas : Ticket Quota Memo Uncovered
Police officers in Midlothian , Texas received a written memo ordering them to issue twenty traffic citations each month .
With more revenue , police officials believed they would be able to expand the small department .
WFAA - TV in Dallas confirmed the quota ’s existence through unnamed department sources , marking the second time this year a numeric traffic ticket quota has been uncovered in Ellis County .
August
Michigan : Community Protest Torpedoes Ticket Quota
A planned protest at the Redford Township , Michigan police station helped kill a ticket quota that officials had adopted last month .
Since mid-July , township police had been handed one hour ’s worth of overtime pay for every two traffic citations issued .
This meant that a typical officer could pocket up to $ 21 in cash for each individual ticket issued .
The Mary Church Terrell Council for Community Empowerment now plans to go after the ticket quota in Dearborn Heights .
The Detroit suburbs of Livonia , Oak Park , Rochester and Trenton also depend on numeric ticket quotas for police .
May
Iowa : Police Chief Suspended Over Ticket Quota
The Pleasant Hill , Iowa city manager suspended the city ’s police chief on April 26 after evidence surfaced that he had instituted an illegal traffic ticket quota .
According to local police union leader Ron Zimmerman , 33 , officers were being told to issue between five and ten tickets each month .
A sergeant chided Officer Zimmerman on “ the low number of tickets ” that he issued .
Although Chief William Hansen , 58 , denies the existence of a quota , a Des Moines Register review of court documents shows the amount of ticket revenue has more than doubled under Hansen ’s watch .
Denver , Colorado Ticket Quota Uncovered
Police officials in Denver , Colorado confirmed that they have placed pressure on rank - and - file officers to issue a minimum number of traffic citations .
Since September , those that have failed to produce have faced disciplinary action .
“ We ’re always looking at performance , ” Denver Police Captain Eric Rubin told KCNC - TV .
“ If an officer is under the average set we might discuss it with the officer . ”
Rubin insisted that these requirements are not a quota .
Instead , they are a “ measure of performance . ”
March
Texas : Police Chief Faces Ticket Quota Charges
The police chief in Red Oak , Texas faces charges that he imposed an illegal traffic ticket quota .
The city council last week suspended Police Chief Donald “ Red ” Fullerton and Deputy Chief Stephen Anderson pending the conclusion of an outside investigation by a retired Fort Worth policeman .
Evidence shows that the city ’s police force began issuing a traffic ticket every twenty minutes during a severe budget shortfall .
The police chief budgeted $ 3.4 million in citation revenue , which required each officer to issue 320 tickets a month .
A bulletin board in the police station displayed how each officer measured up .
February
Utah : Police Chief Blocks Ticket Quota Ban
It is n’t often that a police chief can block the action of an entire state legislature .
However , Ogden Police Chief Jon Greiner stopped a ticket quota bill aimed directly at him from being considered by the state Senate .
Greiner , a newly elected state Senator representing the Ogden area , cast the deciding vote on the Senate Judiciary , Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee where the measure failed 2 - 2 .
Representative Neil Hansen ( D - Ogden ) had introduced a bill that had passed the House to prohibit municipalities , counties , sheriffs and police chiefs from requiring officers to issue a certain number of tickets in a given amount of time .

The confirmation , delivered by CIA Director Michael Hayden on Tuesday , that the U.S. intelligence agency did indeed use the now - infamous severe interrogation technique of waterboarding on three major 9/11 suspects was given the green light by President Bush in a rare show of ( relative ) transparency .
Reuters India :
“ The president authorized Gen .
Hayden to say what he said in the testimony yesterday , ” White House spokesman Tony Fratto told reporters .
Bush ’s decision to allow testimony on waterboarding , a major shift from his policy of keeping it under wraps , was prompted by heated public debate and a consensus in the administration on the need “ to be very clear about how those techniques were used and what the benefits were , ” Fratto said .
Hayden told the Senate Intelligence Committee that waterboarding was used on suspected Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and senior al Qaeda leaders Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .

The model of vortex structure in laser speckle .
Open vortex lines are in red , while closed vortex loops are in white .

Light may not seem very interesting in our everyday lives .
But to scientists , light ’s properties are a constant source of intrigue .
The nature of light as both wave and particle , light as the universal speed limit , and the way light interacts with magnetic fields in the atmosphere to form auroras are a just a few examples of light ’s fascinating behavior .
Recently , researchers from the University of Glasgow and the University of Bristol in the UK have discovered another unusual property of light – or , more accurately , the darkness within light .
As the researchers explain , natural light fields are threaded by lines of darkness , which create optical vortices that appear as black points within the light .
The group has modeled this phenomenon , and found that the lines of darkness exhibit fractal properties with Brownian ( random ) characteristics .
Further , the characteristics of these optical vortices suggest universal properties , which could help connect different areas of physics .
Many people have noticed the phenomenon of laser speckle , which occurs when coherent , monochromatic laser light bounces off a rough surface , giving the surface a speckled appearance .
The black specks are interference patterns generated by a superposition of highly coherent light waves reflected from different points on the rough surface .
Sometimes the speckled pattern can even appear to sparkle when the viewer moves relative to the surface .
In a recent issue of Physical Review Letters , the UK researchers describe how they developed a model of the superpositions that create the dark optical vortices , using numerical simulations and experiments .
In their experiments , they created laser speckle with a 10 - mm - diameter helium neon laser beam shining through a screen made of ground glass .
By measuring the superpositions with an interferometer , the scientists could generate a 3D map of the structure of the optical vortices .
They found two types of vortices .
Infinite vortex lines , which account for about 73 % of the dark vortices , percolate entirely through the light beam .
The remaining 27 % of the vortices form closed loops , which occur when a vortex line returns to its starting point within a small enough area .
When investigating the lines of darkness further , the researchers found that they exhibit scale invariance .
In other words , the vortices look the same no matter how much you zoom out – they are fractals .
Lead author Kevin O’Holleran of the University of Glasgow said that , while he and his colleagues suspected vortex lines to exhibit fractal properties , they were quite surprised to find that the fractality was of a Brownian nature .
“ To find that the vortex lines in light have Brownian characteristics is exciting , ” O’Holleran told PhysOrg.com .
“ Brownian structures are inherently random , so the coherence of our model was in no way limiting the fractal behavior of the vortex lines .
We are looking forward to exploring these properties in more detail .
More specifically , we hope to investigate the topological side of random light fields , such as how often vortex lines are knotted or linked . ”
Interestingly , the researchers noted that these properties of optical vortices ( the ratio of vortex lines to loops and their scale invariance ) are very similar to the properties of cosmic strings , according to the cosmic string lattice model .
The model describes the configuration of cosmic strings in the early universe – the very thin but very dense one - dimensional defects in space - time that could be responsible for the formation of galaxies .
The researchers do n’t think this similarity is likely to be coincidental .
They suggest that these properties could be universal for all optical fields , and they plan to investigate the analogy further .
“ The greatest significance [ of this study ] is the connection to other fields in physics , ” O’Holleran said .
“ Universal properties connect fields of research at deeper levels than the exact formulation of each system .
Shared fundamental properties or restrictions ( like how lines can be embedded in 3D space ) result in universal exponents appearing in varied and apparently disconnected fields of research .
The fact that vortex lines in light exhibit power laws suggesting universal properties means that these lines are governed by more general laws than wave equations . ”

BELGRADE ( Reuters ) - Scores of protesters smashed their way into the U.S. embassy in Belgrade on Thursday in anger at Kosovo ’s independence , ransacking rooms and setting fires before riot police dispersed the crowd .

Police , nowhere to be seen earlier as the building was attacked , moved in half an hour later , firing teargas and beating and detaining rioters .
Local media said more than 30 people were injured , half of them police , and taken to hospital .
Police in armored vans secured the streets and tried to cordon off the whole embassy district .
Local agencies reported attacks on missions of several other countries , among them Britain , Croatia , Bosnia and Turkey .
People tried to flee clouds of painful teargas .
Police helicopters flew over the area .
Serbian President Boris Tadic urged rioters to stop .
“ I appeal to our citizens to protest calmly .
All those who take part in the unrest I want to withdraw from the streets and stop attacking foreign embassies , ” he said on a visit to Romania , according to Beta news agency .

“ This only keeps Kosovo distant from Serbia . ”
The storming of the U.S. embassy , which had been closed and boarded up after rioters stoned it earlier in the week , came during a state - backed rally to protest at Kosovo ’s secession on Sunday attended by some 200,000 people .
Rioters -- many wearing balaclavas and scarves to hide their faces -- had attacked the building with sticks and metal bars after destroying two guard boxes outside .
They ripped metal grilles from windows and tore a handrail off the entrance to use as a battering ram and gain entry .
One man climbed up to the first floor , ripped the Stars and Stripes off its pole and briefly put up a Serbian flag .
Other people jumped up and down on the balcony , holding up a Serbian flag as the crowd below of about 1,000 people cheered them on , shouting “ Serbia , Serbia ” .
Black smoke billowed out of the embassy .
Papers and chairs were thrown out of the windows , with doors wedged in the window frames and burning .
Some 200 riot police arrived half an hour later , driving the crowd away .
Some protesters sat on the ground , bleeding .
Fire engines arrived to put out the flames , local media reported .
Meanwhile , the main rally proceeded as planned with a march to the city ’s biggest Orthodox cathedral for a prayer service , just several hundred meters ( yards ) away .
State television switched between scenes of the rioting and the choral singing of the church service .
News agencies said some foreign banks and McDonalds fast - food stores were also attacked and eight city buses damaged .
With the Stock Market Down , Perhaps Diamonds Are a Good Place to Invest
Not the sort of diamonds you wear on your finger , but baseball diamonds .
Randy Newsom , a minor league baseball player , recently offered himself up as an I.P.O.
Interested investors can buy up to 4 % of his future major league income .
The price is not that high : $ 20 per share , with each share entitling the owner to .0016 % of his potential major league earnings .
So the total revenue he will raise in return for 4 % is $ 50,000 .
What does this tell us about the 25 - year - old major leaguer ?
If he were risk - neutral , it would tell us he expects career earnings of less than $ 1.25 million ( which is the expected value implied by selling his future at this price ) .
Given that the minimum salary of a major leaguer is nearly $ 400,000 a year , and the median salary is about $ 1 million , the price does not seem very high .
This means either that ( a ) Newsom is very risk averse ( which might make this a very good investment opportunity ) ; ( b) Newsom is very dumb and is pricing himself too cheaply ; ( c ) Newsom knows that he does not have the talent to make it to the major leagues ( in which case he is probably very smart ) .
My first thought is that option ( c ) is the most likely scenario .
Here is a description of some of his exploits :
In 2007 , Randy had a dominating 1.50 E.R.A. in Advanced - A Kinston .
He was quickly promoted to AA and was selected to the Eastern League All - Star Game in July .
For the season , Randy went 4 - 1 with 18 saves and an outstanding 3.12 E.R.A. as a closer for the Southern Division champion Akron Aeros .
After quickly establishing himself as a prospect in the Indians ’ farm system , Randy was invited to play in the Arizona Fall League .
The A.F.L. is the top winter ball program in the country , only available to top prospects .
After throwing a hitless first inning in the A.F.L. , Randy continued to dominate other top prospects , throwing seven scoreless innings in the A.F.L. , including two scoreless innings in the championship game .
For the entire 2007 season , Randy went 4 - 2 , with 18 saves and a 2.51 E.R.A .
Those sound like pretty good numbers to me .
Perhaps some blog readers have sabermetric models that can inform the rest of us about Newsom ’s chances of making it to the major leagues ?
I ’m always suspicious of people who are trying to sell things , especially when they provide a lot of private information .
What are the advantages of selling shares to the public rather than going through more traditional risk - pricing mechanisms like Lloyd ’s of London ?
The fact that Newsom ’s shares are not exactly flying off the shelves furthers my suspicions ; 2,319 1,345 [ additional press coverage here - Ed. ] of the original 2,500 shares are still available for purchase .
On the other hand , there is a brilliance to Newsom ’s strategy and what the web site RealSportsInvestments.com is trying to do generally .
What they are selling is not just a flow of future earnings , but a dream .
There are very few forms of investment that are also fun : owning a race horse , collecting expensive art , etc .
Investors should be willing to accept a lower return on their investment in return for having fun .
Selling a small share of himself probably does n’t diminish the fun of pursuing the dream for Newsom ( maybe it even enhances it because now he has an army of supporters rooting for him ) , but it gives him a way to charge others for living vicariously through him .
Thus , there are potentially large gains to be made in allowing fans to own pieces of players .
While absent in team sports , this sort of staking relationship is common in other settings .
Many high - stakes poker players are staked , with others buying a piece of their action .
When professional golfers first make the P.G.A. tour , they often have backers who pay their expenses in return for a share of earnings .
I even had a friend who bought a piece of a professional bowler .
Given how much time and energy millions of Americans devote to fantasy baseball and football , taking real ownership in players seems like a logical next step .
Maybe I ’ll buy a few shares .
After all , the guy has a submarine delivery .

Women infected with dormant toxoplasmosis are more likely to give birth to boys than women who are Toxoplasma negative , according to research by S. Kankova and colleagues from the Departments of Parasitology , Microbiology and Zoology , Charles University ; the Centre of Reproductive Medicine ; and GynCentrum , in the Czech Republic .
They found that the presence of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii in the mothers ’ blood , one of the most common parasites in humans with a worldwide prevalence of 20 - 80 % , increased the likelihood that these women would give birth to a boy .
This is the first study [ 1 ] , published in Springer ’s journal Naturwissenschaften this week , to suggest an effect of parasitic infection on the sex of a baby .
Kankova and colleagues analysed the effect of latent ( or dormant ) toxoplasmosis [ 2 ] on the probability of the birth of a boy in humans .
Latent toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic but is usually a life - long infection characterised by the presence of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies in the blood .
They analysed over 1800 clinical records of babies born between 1996 - 2004 in private maternity clinics in the Czech Republic .
Women attending these private clinics were routinely tested for toxoplasmosis .
The records contained information on the mother ’s age , the concentration of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies in the mother ’s blood , previous deliveries and abortions , and the sex of the newborn .
On average worldwide , for every three children born , only one is a boy .
Kankova ’s team found that Toxoplasma positive mothers gave birth to more boys than did Toxoplasma negative women .
The probability of a male birth also increased , up to two boys in three children , with increasing levels of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies .
According to the researchers , the increased survival of male embryos in infected women may be explained by toxoplasmosis ’ modulating and suppressing effects on the immune system .
The authors caution that this observational study suggests that toxoplasmosis may be the cause of this increase in male births , but it cannot establish cause and effect .
They conclude that “ an independent confirmation of this tentative conclusion by a manipulative experiment ( by experimental infection of animals ) is necessary . ”

Women infected with parasite Toxoplasma have more sons .
( Naturwissenschaften , DOI 10.1007/s00114-006-0166-2 )
2. Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by parasites transmitted to humans from consumption of raw or undercooked meat of an intermediate host ( such as pig , sheep and rabbit ) and food or water contaminated with soil containing cat feces .
If a pregnant woman is infected with toxoplasmosis , this has potentially fatal consequences for the fetus .
A faulty signature update from Kaspersky Lab on Wednesday flagged up Windows Explorer ( explorer.exe ) as infected with a low - risk virus , Huhk - C .
As a result the core Windows component was quarantined or worse .
Kaspersky released a revised update alongside advice on how to recover legitimate system and application files from quarantine ( the default setting ) within two hours .
But that 's not much consolation for users that had set their software to auto - delete infected files , who found themselves with hosed systems .
Among those affected was Reg reader Carl .
" A false positive caused the deletion of explorer .exe. , " he reports .
" It would have only caused problems for companies performing their network scan during the hours that the dodgy update was present - which included me , unfortunately .
I was working out of hours to fix the previous Kaspersky update problem .
I finally finished sorting it all at 5 am . " .
Postings to Kaspersky 's forum reveal Carl was far from alone in experiencing problems as a result of the issue .
The false alert flap follows just days after earlier problems in updating Kaspersky Lab anti-virus software led to some machines locking up .
The close proximity of the two events has raised questions about the reliability of the Russian anti-virus firm 's testing regime .
Faulty anti-virus signature updates are not uncommon across the industry .
However , the latest Kaspersky SNAFU affects a core Windows component .
David Emm , senior technology consultant at Kaspersky Lab UK , said one UK enterprise customer and three end -users had reported problems with the false alert .
" False alarms occasionally happen , and we take the issue seriously when it does , " he told El Reg .
" We have test systems in place to minimise the risk of this happening , but this seemed to have slipped through the net . "
He added that Kaspersky would review the false alert , alongside last week 's glitch , to see what improvements might be made to its internal testing system in order to minimise the risk of any similar errors in future . ®
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Tuesday Iran was still seeking to build nuclear weapons and called for a greater international effort to prevent Tehran from succeeding .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Israel 's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert address a news conference after talks at chancellery in Berlin February 12 , 2008 .
Olmert said on Tuesday that all options should be considered in international efforts aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons .
REUTERS / Hannibal Hanschke
“ We are certain that the Iranians are engaged in a serious ... clandestine operation to build up a non-conventional capacity , ” Olmert said at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting .
Israel , widely believed to have built hundreds of atomic warheads , has said it considers a nuclear Iran a threat to its existence .
Olmert said he was sharing information with other countries about Iran ’s nuclear program .
He later told journalists he had discussed the issue at length with Merkel during their talks on Monday and Tuesday .
“ As ( U.S. ) President ( George W. )
Bush once said : no option is ruled out , ” in dealing with Iran ’s atomic ambitions , he said , while voicing support for a diplomatic solution .
Bush and Olmert have made clear they still consider Tehran a threat despite a recent U.S. National Intelligence Estimate that said Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
Briefing journalists who traveled with him from Israel to Germany , Olmert declined to estimate when Iran -- which says it is only seeking nuclear energy -- might have an atomic arsenal .
“ I have said many times in the past ... and the latest intelligence reports bear this out , that Iran is not as close as it contends to achieving a non-conventional weapons capability but it is not as far from it as we would like , ” Olmert said .
Last month , Germany joined the five permanent U.N. Security Council members -- Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States -- in circulating a proposal for a third sanctions resolution against Iran calling for mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and vigilance on all banks in Iran .

“ I have always said that I believe strongly in a solution via diplomatic channels , that I count on a diplomatic solution and nothing else , ” Merkel told the news conference .
PRESSURE ON GAZA
Turning to the situation in the Gaza Strip , Olmert said Israel would keep pressure on Hamas militants but did not disclose whether political leaders of the Islamist group running the territory would be attacked .
Israeli leaders have vowed to step up their operations against Hamas in a bid to halt the cross - border rocket fire .
But Defence Minister Ehud Barak said earlier a full - scale military campaign against the group would not take place right away .
The daily rocket barrages rarely cause serious casualties but they have disrupted life in southern Israel .
Hamas says attacks from the Gaza Strip , including rockets fired by its own militants and others are a response to Israeli military operations in the territory and in the occupied West Bank and would end if Israel stopped all such activity .
Olmert reiterated he would continue to pursue peace talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and intended to meet him next week , despite the ongoing Gaza violence .
“ I see no Israeli interest that justifies a delay or suspension ” of peace negotiations , Olmert said , repeating that he still hoped for a deal with Abbas by the end of the year .
Merkel said the humanitarian situation in Gaza -- home to 1.4 million Palestinians -- was difficult .
Israel tightened restrictions on the Gaza Strip after Hamas seized control in June after routing Abbas ’s Fatah forces .
Merkel said Israel and Germany would start regular government consultations , with a first meeting in March .
Jan. 10 , 2008  --
More than a dozen Eden Prairie , Minn. , high schoolers walked out of class to protest the school 's punishment of students caught by administrators partying on Facebook pages .
The move came after 42 students at the well - regarded Minnesota public school were questioned by school administrators who viewed online photos of the young people drinking alcohol .
" Photos were presented to us of some of our students in possession of , or consuming , illegal substances , " said Principal Conn McCartan in a written statement provided to ABCNEWS.com .
Thirteen of the 42 students involved in the investigation have since been punished , according to McCartan .
" All students who participate in school activities have to sign a liability brochure saying they understand the rules and will follow them , " said Dave Stead , the executive director of the Minnesota State High School League , of which Eden Prairie High is a member .
" Rules include not using , possessing , giving , buying alcohol or drugs .
These students signed the pledge and then violated it — so appropriate penalties were given . "
The majority of high schools in Minnesota collaborate to determine punishments for such incidents , Stead told ABCNEWS.com , and Eden Prairie has since abided by them .
For the first offense of breaking the pledge , students are suspended from two extracurricular events or are suspended for two weeks , whichever punishment is greater , Stead said .
With each additional offense , the length of the suspension increases , rising to 28 days or 16 events .
" We hope that the punishments will be a deterrent , but also hope that the students will learn how important it is to sign contracts , " said Stead , who added that this sort of incident has occurred at other schools in the state , but he thinks Eden Prairie 's good reputation has likely added fuel to the fire .
" They must learn there are some things you can and cannot do . "
How , exactly , the school administrators obtained the photos is unclear — many students ' profiles were " limited " and therefore could only be viewed by people they accepted as friends on Facebook .
Stead said that he believed the photos were presented to the school administration , and McCartan has denied allegations that the school sought out the photos .
Michael O'Leary , whose son is a sophomore at Eden Prairie but was not involved in this incident , is upset about how much negative attention the school is getting .
" I do n't think [ Eden Prairie ] is any different from any other school , " said O'Leary , who added that he does speak to his son and friends about the dangers of underage drinking .
" No matter where you go you 'll have this type of problem , but it does n't need to be publicized . "
The school 's outstanding reputation as one of the best schools both academically and athletically — the football team has won several state championships in recent years — is more important that its drinking culture , said O'Leary .
" They 're good kids who are smart kids , " said O'Leary .
" That 's not to say we do n't have problems , but we 're comparable to other schools . "
Max Friedman , one former Eden Prairie student whose sister was involved in the investigation , said that drugs and alcohol were prevalent during his high school years .
" In terms of drinking , the high school is probably the same as any other high school in the United States , " Friedman told ABCNEWS.com .
" Drinking is always available and marijuana was also used . "
His sister Natalie Friedman told the Minnesota Star Tribune that she was questioned because of a photo depicting her behind a bar at a friend 's house , surrounded by drinks .
" I did n't get into any trouble , " Natalie Friedman told the paper .
" It 's not going to stop kids from drinking .
We 're just going to re-evaluate what we put out in public .
We 're going to be more cautious . "

Poppy seeds in food , common over - the - counter medications and traces of banned substances are enough to warrant four - year prison sentences in the United Arab Emirates , travellers were warned today .
Visitors to Dubai and Abu Dhabi are now being advised to " take extreme caution " and " avoid arrest for ' possession ' of a controlled substance " .
The advice , issued by the legal charity Fair Trials International , follows a recent spate of arrests and imprisonment .

The charity , which assists those facing trial abroad , has urged travellers to ensure they are completely free of any substances prohibited by the country they are visiting .
Earlier this week , a 43 - year - old from Middlesex was imprisoned for four years after 0.003g cannabis was found in the tread of his shoe by customs officials in Dubai .
Keith Andrew Brown was stopped in transit from Ethiopia to London last September .
The amount of the drug found on his shoe would not be visible to the naked eye and weighs less than a single grain of sugar .
Fair Trials International Chief Executive Catherine Wolthuizen said : " We have seen a steep increase in such cases over the last 18 months .
" Customs authorities are using highly sensitive new equipment to conduct extremely thorough searches on travellers and if they find any amount - no matter how minute - it will be enough to attract a mandatory four - year prison sentence . "
And the list of banned substances in the UAE includes many products which are available over - the - counter and off - the - shelf in the UK .
These include medications such as codeine , a common ingredient in pain relief and cold - and - flu medication , and the common baking ingredient , poppy seeds .

Ms Wolthuizen added : " What many travellers may not realise is that they can be deemed to be in possession of such banned substances if they can be detected in their urine or bloodstream , or even in tiny , trace amounts on their person .
" We even have reports of the imprisonment of a Swiss man for ' possession ' of three poppy seeds on his clothing after he ate a bread roll at Heathrow . "
The UAE is becoming one of the world 's most popular tourist and transit destinations - partly due to extensive marketing of its beaches and shops .
Charities now say travellers must be alerted to the risks they face if they are not completely clean of any banned substance or do not have a prescription for their medication .
Only last month a German citizen was detained for an alleged drugs offence when entering Dubai .
Cat Le-Huy , 31 , was found carrying melatonin pills to help with jetlag and sleeping problems .
More than 2,000 people have now signed a petition asking for the British - based technical expert to be released .
Other recent cases include that of a 33 - year - old Londoner who was arrested at Dubai airport last May after travelling to the UAE on business .
Customs officials found 2g of cannabis in his pocket which he had forgotten about .
He was sentenced to four years ' imprisonment , but granted clemency and released in October 2007 .
Customs officers in Dubai also alleged they found 0.03g of cannabis on Robert Dalton , 25 , from Kent when he travelled to Dubai last year .
He was stopped and searched at the airport and arrested .
He is currently on trial and if convicted , will mostly likely receive a four - year prison sentence .
Tracy Wilkinson , 45 of West Sussex , was arrested at Dubai airport in 2005 for possession of codeine which she had been using to ease chronic back pain .
She was held in custody for 8 weeks before officials accepted proof from her doctor of its use for prescribed medical purposes only .
19 French nationals have been arrested in the past 18 months for possession of banned substances .
Fair Trials International are publishing a comprehensive list of banned pharmaceuticals on their website .

Michelle Stepney 's daughters were born healthy
Michelle Stepney developed a tumour but was only diagnosed with cervical cancer when she was taken to hospital with a suspected miscarriage .
But doctors found her twins ' kicking had dislodged the tumour .
Mrs Stepney , from Cheam , south - west London , refused to undergo chemotherapy and a hysterectomy which would have meant the termination of her twins .
She has been nominated for a Woman of Courage Award by Cancer Research UK .
" I could n't believe it when the doctors told me that the babies had dislodged the tumour , " she said .
I owe my life to my girls , and that 's why I could have never agreed with a termination
Michelle Stepney
" I 'd felt them kicking but I did n't realise just how important their kicking would turn out to be . "
Mrs Stepney , who also had a five - year - old son called Jack , said she opted to have her life - saving operation after the twins were born .
" I owe my life to my girls , and that 's why I could have never agreed with a termination , " she said .
" It was a very difficult decision to make .
We wanted to make sure what we did was right by Jack but we did not want to do what was wrong by the girls . "
' Kept me strong '
Doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital gave Mrs Stepney limited chemotherapy .
The twins , Alice and Harriet , were delivered by caesarean section 33 weeks into the pregnancy .
They were healthy but born without hair because of the cancer treatment .
Mrs Stepney had a hysterectomy four weeks later , and has been given the all - clear .
She said she had relied on the support of her husband Scott , 36 .
" I could n't have got through it without him , " she said , adding : " The twins were also a huge support .
They kept me strong throughout it all . "
Cancer Research UK 's women - only fundraising event Race for Life - in which women are sponsored to walk , jog or run 5 km - takes place between 3 May and 31 July .
I found Melissa Bell , the 38 - year - old mother of Mychal Bell , in one such black neighborhood , “ The Quarters , ” in the trailer she and her children have called home for the past four years .
On an unseasonably cold day , she lay huddled beneath a blanket on her couch , with a space heater plugged in , the oven on and open , and four gas burners flaming blue into the darkness .
Until her son ’s arrest , Melissa Bell ’s life had been both prosaic and emblematic .
Her father was imprisoned when she was 16 .
She graduated from Jena High and at 20 , after half a year of college , gave birth to Mychal .
She had a daughter and another son and by 23 was largely on her own with three children , working nights and relying on her mother ’s help .
She and Mychal ’s father , Marcus Jones , were never a couple , Jones told me ; and when Mychal was little , she took Jones to court for child support .
In 2000 , when Mychal was 10 , Jones decamped for Dallas , returning only for intermittent visits until 2007 , when he came to free the son he ’d left behind .
“ He has not been there , ” said Anthony Jackson , a teacher at Jena High who is related to Marcus Jones .
“ The mother has had the responsibility of raising Mychal . ”
Melissa
Bell worked a series of low - wage jobs — at a hospital , Burger Barn , Procter and Gamble — and had her own run-ins with the law , including a stream of bounced checks , for amounts as small as $ 4 , in 2005 .
To her son , she was more friend than limit - setter , according to Mychal ’s best friend , John McPherson .
And she was often at work .
At 16 , Bell was coming into manhood on his own .
By the first semester of his junior year , he was spending most of his time with McPherson and his wife in their nearby trailer .
McPherson , an oil - field worker , is white — a fact that defenders of the town have made much of — but for him , race was irrelevant .
He bonded with Mychal over football and became a mentor to him .
“ I just knew he needed somebody to give him a break , ” says McPherson , who is now 20 .
Given the poverty of Bell ’s background , the odds were against him : black men in Louisiana are five times as likely to go to prison as to college ; in LaSalle Parish , they are incarcerated at twice their proportion in the population .
But Bell ’s athletic gift gave him a shot at a college scholarship .
He combined a knack for the game with the work ethic to make it look easy .
After the team watched a game film together , Mychal would borrow it to study more .
When opponents lined up , he knew exactly what they were going to run , Mack Fowler , his former coach , says : “ He was like a coach on the field ” — a leader .
As a junior , Bell was already one of the 10 best players Fowler had seen in a 34 - year career .
The erratic , and occasionally embarrassing , performance of Jena High ’s football team has never diminished the town ’s devotion .
Schools love to play Jena because of its “ gates ” — so many townspeople turn out .
The Wal - Mart Supercenter sells Jena Giants clothing , and local businesses sponsor the player of the week and plaster the playing field with ads , making the games profitable for the school , too .
Bell was a draw , which helps explain why , when he began to get in trouble — to be trouble — so many adults looked the other way .
Or as his father put it , “ He could n’t have been too bad — I mean , y’all did n’t prosecute him all this time here . ”
Smash Bros. Brawl Officially Delayed in U.S .
The setback pushes the game more than two months past its original pre-holiday release date of December 3 .
Japanese gamers will get to enjoy the game two weeks earlier than U.S. gamers on January 28 -- the newly set Japanese release date for the game .
Twenty percent of students polled would trade their vote for an iPod touch .
Most at NYU say their vote has a price
Two - thirds say they 'll do it for a year 's tuition .
And for a few , even an iPod touch will do .
That 's what NYU students said they'd take in exchange for their right to vote in the next presidential election , a recent survey by an NYU journalism class found .

Only 20 percent said they 'd exchange their vote for an iPod touch .
But 66 percent said they 'd forfeit their vote for a free ride to NYU .
And half said they 'd give up the right to vote forever for $ 1 million .
But they also overwhelmingly lauded the importance of voting .
Ninety percent of the students who said they 'd give up their vote for the money also said they consider voting " very important " or " somewhat important " ; only 10 percent said it was " not important . "
Also , 70.5 percent said they believe that one vote can make a difference — including 70 percent of the students who said they 'd give up their vote for free tuition .
The class — " Foundations of Journalism , " taught by journalism department chairwoman Brooke Kroeger — polled more than 3,000 undergraduates between Oct. 24 and 26 to assess student attitudes toward voting .
" The part that I find amazing is that so many folks think one vote can make a difference , " Sociology Department Chairman Dalton Conley said .
He added , " If we take them at their word , then perhaps they really think votes matter , and that 's why someone might pay a year 's tuition to buy theirs . "
Sixty percent of the students who said they 'd give up their vote for tuition also described their families ' income as upper - middle or high .
Their reasons for giving up their votes varied .
" At the moment , no candidate who truly represents my political beliefs has a chance of winning a presidential election , " one male junior studying film and television at the Tisch School of the Arts wrote on the survey .
" It is very easy to convince myself that my vote is not essential , " wrote a female CAS sophomore .
" After all , I 'm from New York , which will always be a blue state . "
Other students wrote that they were disgusted by the thought .
" I would be reversing history — a lot of people fought so that every citizen could be enfranchised , " said a female in her second year at the Stern School of Business .
One CAS junior went even further , writing that " anyone who 'd sell his lifelong right to vote should be deported . "
Lily Quateman reports for New York University 's Washington Square News .
Washington Square News is partnering with Campus Politico for the 2008 elections .
Would you give up your vote for anything ?
If so , what would it take ?
Post a comment here and let us know .
Ivan , a Category Four cyclone , has winds of more than 200 km/h ( 125 m ph ) and is capable of uprooting trees .
It is due to make landfall shortly , about 250 km ( 155 miles ) north of the capital Antananarivo .
Last month at least 13 people died when the first cyclone of the season tore through western parts of Madagascar .
( Mental Floss ) --
1 . Flower - Flavored PEZ ®
There are some foods that people would eat only if they were stranded on a deserted island .
No , that 's not a typo .
Although it would be equally disgusting , we 're talking about flower , not flour .
Introduced in the late 1960's , flower - flavored PEZ was designed to appeal to the hippie generation -- complete with a groovy , psychedelic dispenser .
But even in the decade of free love , no love could be found for the flavor power of flower .
Floral scents make for great perfume , but nobody eats perfume , and apparently , there 's a reason why .
The flower version flopped , and became the next addition to PEZ 's long and disturbing list of flavor failures .
Since its introduction in 1927 , the company has also sold ( however briefly ) coffee , licorice , eucalyptus , menthol , and cinnamon flavors .
2. ' I Hate Peas !'
For as long as children have been shoving Brussels sprouts under mashed potatoes and slipping green beans to the dog , parents have been hunting desperately for a way to end the vegetable discrimination .
Finally , in the 1970's , American Kitchen Foods , Inc. came to the rescue ( or at least tried ) with the release of " I Hate Peas ! "
Since kids love French fries so much , the company decided that disguising peas in a fry - shaped form was a sure - fire way to trick tots into getting their vitamins .
Not a chance .
Children all over America saw through the ruse .
After all , a pea is a pea is a pea , and the name of the product was more than apropos , no matter what it looked like .
There were other thinly disguised vegetables in the company 's " I Hate " line , but kids hated those , too .
3. Reddi-Bacon
Any company smart enough to bless mankind with sprayable whipped cream -- the sort that promotes direct - to - mouth feeding -- has got to know a thing or two about immediate gratification .
But sadly , the makers of Reddi - wip® were unable to meld their keen understanding of human laziness with one of processed meat .
They figured , if you 're cooking breakfast in the morning and you 've got a hankering for bacon , why dirty up a pan you 'll only have to clean later ?
The solution : foil - wrapped Reddi-Bacon you could pop into your toaster for piping - hot pork in minutes .
It seemed perfect for the busy 1970 's household , and what 's more , the stuff actually tasted pretty good .
Too bad the absorbent pad intended to soak up the dripping grease tended to leak , creating not only a fire hazard , but also a messy ( if not totally ruined ) toaster .
Ultimately , the product lasted about as long as it took to cook ; the company scrapped it before it went to market nationwide .
4. Coffee - flavored JELL-O®
In 1918 , the makers of JELL - O introduced a new flavor : coffee .
Its release was ostensibly based on the logic that , since lots of people like to drink coffee with dessert , they'd be game for combining the two after - dinner treats .
Not the case .
The company soon realized if anyone wants dessert coffee , they 're going to have a cup of it .
In fact , if anyone wants coffee at all , they 're going to have a cup of it .
Not surprisingly , this realization came about the time they yanked the product off the shelves .
All in all , it has n't harmed the company too much .
At least they learned their lesson , right ?
Wrong .
Cola - flavored JELL- O was sold for about a year starting in 1942 , and for a brief while , the clear , wiggly dessert was sold in celery and chocolate flavors , too .
5. Heublein's Wine & Dine
In the mid-1970's , Heublein introduced Wine & Dine , an upscale , easy - to - make dinner that included a small bottle of vino .
How refined .
How decadent .
How confusing .
Consumers knew Heublein for their liquor and wines , so how were they supposed to know the wine included in Wine & Dine was an ingredient for the pasta sauce ?
Hasty consumers who did n't read the directions closely ended up pouring the contents of the bottle into a nice glass and getting a less - than - pleasant mouthful of salted wine .
6. Funky Fries
While Americans are n't always fond of the French , they do love their French fries .
In 2002 , hoping to follow the success of Heinz 's new " kiddie " ketchup versions ( in green and purple ) , Ore -Ida introduced Funky Fries : chocolate - flavored , cinnamon - flavored , and blue - colored French fries .
An awful lot of money was sunk into the product , but after a year of marketing , consumers still found the idea funky -- in the bad way .
Funky Fries were pulled off the shelves in 2003 , and images of blue fries with green ketchup were once again relegated to the world of Warhol - esque pop art .
7. Pepsi A.M.
Creating a super - caffeinated soda worked well for the makers of Red Bull , but not for the folks at Pepsi .
With 25 percent more caffeine than a cup of Joe , PepsiCo introduced the cola - flavored product in 1989 , only to discover that most people just could n't bring themselves to drink soda with their cornflakes .
For those who wanted a Pepsi in the morning , regular Pepsi did just fine , thankyouverymuch .
Pepsi A.M. , like the coffee - flavored Pepsi Kona before it , was scrapped after just a few months .
8. Gerber Singles
At some point in time , almost every adult has tasted baby food and discovered that the stuff is n't half bad .
But that does n't mean people want to make a meal out of it .
For some reason , Gerber had to learn that lesson the hard way .
In 1974 , the company released Gerber Singles , small servings of food meant for single adults , packaged in jars that were almost identical to those used for baby food .
It did n't take long for Gerber execs to figure out that most consumers , unless they were less than a year old , could n't get used to eating a pureed meal out of a jar -- particularly one depressingly labeled " Singles . "
Baby food for grown - ups was pulled from the marketplace shortly after its birth .

BEIRUT –
The young woman was walking with her husband along a Baghdad street when she was abducted , held captive and raped repeatedly by five militia men for several days .
" Before , she was very proud of her body but now she is overweight  she eats to protect herself and not to attract people , " says therapist Sana Hamzeh about her 27 - year - old Iraqi patient , who recently escaped to Lebanon as a refugee .
" When she first came here she hated her body and was very isolated .
She could not touch her husband .
She sat rigidly , clenched ; she could not relax or talk about her feelings . "
Hamzeh works at the recently opened Restart center in Beirut , a charity funded by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( UNHCR ) that provides free therapy and psychological therapy rehabilitation for up to 70 mostly Iraqi refugees who are victims of torture .
The center also gathers documentation to help argue their case for asylum .
The center is a brief respite for a few Iraqis fleeing torture , death sentences and the grinding violence of daily life back home .
But they arrive in Lebanon only to find themselves dangerously illegal , and subject to discrimination and exploitation .
Few can find counseling and support .
" We have many challenges , " project director Suzanne Jabbour tells IPS .
" First , people are afraid to get psychological help because it ’s not normal in Lebanese , or Iraqi culture .
Second , we need to learn about Iraqi culture , history and traditions to deal with people .
The third challenge is that Iraqis are treated inhumanely here .
Most have low self - esteem , and because they do n’t know how things work , they ca n’t adapt quickly . "
The UNHCR conservatively estimates that 2.2 million people have left Iraq since 2003 , the majority to Syria and Jordan .
A recent Danish Refugee Council ( DRC ) survey found around 50,000 Iraqis in Lebanon ; half of them Shia , the rest Christian and Sunni .
Nearly 80 percent of the refugees entered the country illegally , while many of the rest overstayed their short - term tourist visas .
Lebanon is not considered a final resettlement destination , but the UNHCR faces a huge challenge moving the refugees to permanent home countries .
" There were only 600 accepted from Lebanon for resettlement last year , " says agency spokeswoman Laure Chedrawi .
" This is less than one percent , which is a very , very small number of Iraqis .
There are few resettlement countries and they have a lot of criteria , so we are now prioritizing only the most vulnerable cases . "
Since Lebanon is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention , refugees are afforded little protection with UNHCR - issued identification , and are prey to what Human Rights Watch calls " the whim of the law enforcement officer at the checkpoint . "
Those arrested are sent back to Iraq after they serve out prison sentences alongside criminals , or detained indefinitely if they refuse to go home .
These hard realities contribute to the UN agency ’s low registration of 10,000 refugees , and to the isolation of the rest .
Mohammed , a refugee in his late 20s , is a particularly hard off case .
" He came to our center for psychological treatment but had no money to eat , or a place to sleep  so how could we deal with his psychological suffering ? " asks Jabbour .
" We arranged a place to sleep for him on a personal level .
Usually UNHCR has other partners who do this . "
A patient of Hamzeh ’s , Mohammed was a former bodyguard for Saddam Hussein and was later imprisoned by the U.S. - led coalition .
" He suffered torture , unbelievable torture  they gouged out one of his eyes , and he ca n’t walk properly , " she says .
" He is very , very depressed .
Every time I see him I do n’t know if it ’s the last , because he ’s suicidal .
But he ’s also religious and feels that suicide will condemn him to hell , so for this reason he stays alive . "
Hamzeh looks down at the ground .
" Every day I think about him . "
The DRC found that most Iraqis here eke out a living as laborers , making tea in offices or as building guards for an average monthly household salary just over the 200 dollar minimum wage .
They lack the most basic access to health care , and only a little over half of the children attend the overcrowded Lebanese school system .
However , DRC says that for most refugees " returning to Iraq despite the hazards ( here ) is considered a last resort . "
Restart ’s goal this coming year is to reach out to those suffering torture or trauma from the 40,000 Iraqis not registered with UNHCR .
" We want to open community - based rehabilitation centers because not all refugees can travel to our office here , " explains Jabbour .
" We will train charities , health professionals and lawyers on how to work with refugees , and how to document the legal , physical and psychological aspects of torture . "
" I come here because it ’s like a family , and the only place where I can relax , " says 33 - year - old Eyad with a warm smile .
" I ’ve cried here and laughed  let go of all my emotions . "
Eyad was part of a government security force safeguarding Baghdad ’s schools when he received threats from a militia to stop work .
He was then abducted by men dressed like the Iraqi army  which he says they were not  and was beaten and tortured .
They ripped out his nails , sliced his forehead with a knife , and dripped melting plastic all over his arms .
His body is riddled with scars from his wounds , that were finally treated when he fled to Syria .
Eyad now lives on his own in the Hezbollah - controlled southern suburbs of Beirut , a relative safe haven for many Iraqi Shia avoiding the Lebanese security forces .
He works as an office window cleaner for 300 dollars a month and dreams he will be safely reconciled with his family in Iraq .
" All humans are humans at the end of the day , " he says softly .
" No one should be judged by their identification only . "

Bush administration lawyers cited national security concerns Tuesday in urging a federal judge to toss out a lawsuit accusing a Boeing Co. subsidiary of illegally helping the CIA secretly fly terrorism suspects to overseas prisons to be tortured .
The American Civil Liberties Union sued Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. last year in San Jose federal court , accusing it of aiding the CIA in the “ forced disappearance , torture and inhumane treatment ” of five suspected terrorists in violation of national and international laws .
The ACLU alleges that Jeppesen , based in San Jose , knowingly participated in the program by supplying aircraft , crews and logistical support to the CIA flights .
On Tuesday , Justice Department lawyers asked U.S. District Judge James
Ware to toss the lawsuit without further litigation because of unspecified national security risks .
( Original Article )
The Israeli government has been reportedly approved a military plan , similar to the U.S invasion of Iraq in 2003 , within underway preparations to massively attack Gaza .
According to the Jewish Press online website on Wednesday , Israeli sources said that a plan , drafted by the Israeli general staff , has been endorsed by the Israeli defense minister , Ehud Barak .
The website also reported that such a planned invasion has been discussed by several panels of the Israeli cabinet , involving many cabinet members .
A part of the plan , Israel is intending to diminish the Hamas regime in Gaza , with targeting the Hamas leaders and controlling most areas of the Gaza Strip , in a way that dejects momentum of likely international response .
At least 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers , backed by warplanes and warships and battle tanks , will be employed in the Gaza invasion , to be deployed at four main access , including the Mediterranean sea side .
In addition , the Israeli army will dismember the coastal region into three parts , starting with the Gaza international airport of Rafah city in the south , the Jewish online publication added .
Nevertheless , the plan requires approval of the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , who is supposed to await the United States ’ permission to the proposed invasion of Gaza .
Among the possible scenarios of such an offensive , an Israeli army presence on the Gaza - Egypt border line , with a possibility of installing a NATO force into the region , following the Israeli withdrawal .
Recently , a number of Israeli ministers have gestured possibility to eliminate the Hamas regime in Gaza , once and for all .
Israel has warned of massively attack the Gaza Strip as some ministers proposed leveling to the ground entire Gaza neighborhoods , after having evacuated the residents .

A Prayer for America
by US Rep Dennis Kucinich
The following speech was given on February 17 , 2002
I offer these brief remarks today as a prayer for our country , with love of democracy , as a celebration of our country .
With love for our country .
With hope for our country .
With a belief that the light of freedom cannot be extinguished as long as it is inside of us .
With a belief that freedom rings resoundingly in a democracy each time we speak freely .
With the understanding that freedom stirs the human heart and fear stills it .
With the belief that a free people cannot walk in fear and faith at the same time .
With the understanding that there is a deeper truth expressed in the unity of the United States .
That implicit in the union of our country is the union of all people .
That all people are essentially one .
That the world is interconnected not only on the material level of economics , trade , communication , and transportation , but innerconnected through human consciousness , through the human heart , through the heart of the world , through the simply expressed impulse and yearning to be and to breathe free .
I offer this prayer for America .
Let us pray that our nation will remember that the unfolding of the promise of democracy in our nation paralleled the striving for civil rights .
That is why we must challenge the rationale of the Patriot Act .
We must ask why should America put aside guarantees of constitutional justice ?
How can we justify in effect canceling the First Amendment and the right of free speech , the right to peaceably assemble ?
How can we justify in effect canceling the Fourth Amendment , probable cause , the prohibitions against unreasonable search and seizure ?

" It is inevitable that we will end up joining with Spain , " the author of The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis told the newspaper Diario de Noticias in Lisbon at the weekend .
Saramago , who has lived on the Spanish island of Lanzarote for the past 10 years , said a united Iberian peninsula of some 55 million people would benefit both Portugal and Spain .
" What do we see when we look at the Iberian peninsula ? " he asked .
" We see an undivided whole made up of different nationalities , some with their own languages , which have lived more or less in peace . "
He denied that the Portuguese people , or their culture , would lose out in a union with Spain .
" We would not stop speaking Portuguese or writing in our language and , with 10 million people , we could do nothing but gain from such closeness and territorial , administrative and structural integration , " he said .
The 1998 Nobel prize winner , who left Portugal in the early 1990s after a row with the then conservative government over his controversial novel The Gospel According to Jesus Christ , denied he was motivated by anger with his home country .
Critics , however , claimed Saramago was giving vent to anti-Portuguese feelings .
" Saramago 's vision belongs to the 19th century , not the 21st , " former foreign minister and Madrid ambassador Martins da Cruz , told Diario de Noticias yesterday .
" It is very easy to hate Portugal from abroad .
What is difficult is to defend our interests , and that is what Saramago fails to do . "
Any attempt to unite Portugal with Spain would run into considerable opposition .
Portuguese commentators already complain loudly whenever major Spanish banks and companies buy up Portuguese counterparts .
The two countries also row over water , with Portugal complaining that too much is taken out of shared major rivers such as the Tagus and the Douro by the Spaniards .
A poll carried out three years ago found the Portuguese considered the second most important date in their history to be the day in 1640 when they regained independence from Spain .
Only the 1974 Carnation Revolution , ending a 40 - year rightwing dictatorship , beat it .
Saramago is not the only so - called " iberista " in Portugal , however .
A poll in the Sol weekly newspaper earlier this year revealed that 28 % of his countrymen were in favour of union with Spain .
A similar poll in Spain 's Tiempo magazine found 45 % of Spaniards would approve of union - as long as Madrid was the capital and republican Portugal could be persuaded to take on Spain 's royal family .
Saramago confirmed his own union with Spain yesterday , marrying Spanish journalist Pilar del Río at a ceremony in her home town of Castril , near Granada , according to the Cadena Ser radio station .
The small civil ceremony was reportedly carried out because they had failed to register an earlier wedding in Lisbon .
During Friday night 's Real Time , Republican Congressman Jack Kingston took to the airwaves to echo the right wing talking points of Obama being " not patriotic enough " .
One of the memes that Kingston brought up was about Obama not wearing his lapel pin .
Let 's take a look at people not wearing their lapel pin :

How interesting .
That looks like Rep. Jack Kingston talking about Obama not wearing his lapel pin .
What 's missing ?
Jack Kingston 's lapel pin .
So does this make Kingston unpatriotic , a hypocrite or just plain stupid .
Of course this is n't the first time Kingston played a game of " open mouth , insert foot " .
A little over a year ago , Kingston said if families could n't survive on the old minimum wage then they needed to work longer hours .
Just a month before that he was crying that working a 5 day work week in Congress would " take away from families " .
I guess his family is more important than yours or mine .

1997 : Dolly the sheep is cloned
Scientists in Scotland have announced the birth of the world 's first successfully cloned mammal , Dolly the sheep .
Dolly , who was created at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh , was actually born on 5 July 1996 although her arrival has only just been revealed .
Dolly is the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult cell .
Previous clonings have been from embryo cells .
The sheep 's birth has been heralded as one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of the decade although it is likely to spark ethical controversy .
Scientists in Scotland cloned a ewe by inserting DNA from a single sheep cell into an egg and implanted it in a surrogate mother .
They now have a healthy seven - month - old sheep - Dolly - who is an exact genetic duplicate of the animal from which the single cell was taken .
DNA tests have revealed that Dolly is identical to the ewe who donated the udder cell and is unrelated to the surrogate mother .
It will enable us to study genetic diseases for which there is presently no cure
Dr Ian Wilmut , embryologist
A couple years back , we asked several scientists from various fields what they thought were the greatest mysteries , resulting in the list below .
None of them has been solved since .
Now we 'd like you to decide which is the single greatest mystery of science .
Voting continues through Sunday , May 3 .
We 'll enshrine the whole Top 10 of your chosing in a new list .

Back in December , I said this election year would be characterized by the collapse of the alleged " front - runners "  i.e. presidential candidates favored by the pundits and the Beltway know - it - alls  and so it has come to pass .
Barack Obama has upended the supposedly inevitable Hillary , and the GOP electorate , too , has humbled those formerly exalted as " major " candidates .
What explains this inversion of expectations , as I put it last year , is the rise of a new politics in this country :
" The paradigm that best describes what is happening on the ground in Iowa , New Hampshire , and beyond , is n’t ‘ right ’ versus ‘ left , ’ ‘ Christianism ’ versus secularism , or red-versus - blue state mindsets , but populist demands for change against our hidebound , insular , arrogant elites in the media as well as in government .
And no issue has underscored the growing chasm between the people , on the one hand , and the Washington - New York axis of power , on the other , than the war in Iraq .
The intersection of the war , as an issue , with the growing populist rebellion against the status quo portends a revolution . "
John McCain and plenty of conservatives  especially the neocons  are now deriding Obama as a purveyor of platitudes , whose rhetoric recalls Gertrude Stein ’s opinion of her birthplace , Oakland , California : " There ’s no there there . "
But of course there is a there there  and it ’s called Iraq .
Obama has become more outspoken in his opposition to the Iraq war as the campaign has progressed , and not only that but has denounced the " mindset " among our rulers , and the leaders of both parties , that led us into that trap to begin with .
This has legitimized his standing as the outsider in the year of the insurgents , and given heft to his soaring rhetoric , which , you ’ll note , is often delivered in terms of an anti-interventionist riff , such as in this very substantive speech laying out his foreign policy vision for America .
Yet it ’s hard to please some people , especially antiwar people on the right  and there are more of them than you might imagine  when it comes to Obama ’s candidacy .
Here is Daniel Larison , a paleoconservative writer  and blogger - in - chief over at The American Conservative , who has also posted at the Antiwar.com blog  warning explicitly not to be fooled by the alluring siren song of Obama-ism :
" Given the rather grim prospects for antiwar voters this election , it is understandable why many look to Obama and think that they have found someone they can trust .
But this is a mistake .
It is n’t that Obama is wrong on Iraq , but that he has happened to be right about it basically in spite of his own foreign policy views . "
If you follow the link above , you ’ll arrive at my last peroration on the subject of Obama : yet Larison ’s affixing a warning label on Obama ’s medicine for the masses  keep away from children and over - enthusiastic antiwar voters  is n’t really necessary .
I have pointed out Obama ’s flaws at length , and in detail , in these pages , and there ’s no need to reiterate all that here .
Larison also reminds us that Obama had the wrong position on Israel ’s latest attack on Lebanon , and that he kowtowed to AIPAC on this and other issues : all undeniably true .
He also tells me something I did n’t know about top Obama advisor Samantha Power : that she has no great love for us " Copperhead isolationists , " as she puts it , which is always good to know .
Of course , I never said that Obama intends to fundamentally alter the direction and basic assumptions of US foreign policy  although his pledge to end the " mindset " that led to US intervention in Iraq implies an attempt to do so .
Yet it is undeniable that he is directly appealing to antiwar voters and the populism that resents the arrogance of our elites  in both parties  who have ignored the popular will :
" When we end this war , we can recapture our unity of effort as Americans .
The American people have the right instincts on Iraq .
It ’s time to heed their judgment .
It ’s time to move beyond Iraq so that we can move forward together .
I will be a President who listens to the American people , not a President who ignores them . "
" When we end this war " is a phrase that he repeats throughout his standard stump speech , these days , and it has become the leitmotif of his campaign .
No , he is n’t a pure anti-interventionist : he ’s no Ron Paul .
Yet he is , without a doubt , the antiwar candidate this election season , and that is precisely why he has a good chance to win the White House .
It is also a good reason for anti-interventionists of the left , the right , and the center to cheer .
Of course , paleocons like Larison may oppose Obama on grounds other than foreign policy , but , as for myself , I take my direction from the late Murray N. Rothbard , who rightly saw that the issue of war and peace is the decisive question , which  all by itself  determines whether we ’re going to have liberty or tyranny .
It was on these grounds that Rothbard , the founder of the modern libertarian movement  and the real intellectual energy behind the founding and early years of the Cato Institute  supported none other than Adlai Stevenson for President , and later joined the " League of Stevensonian Democrats " ( LSD ) to press John F. Kennedy to appoint Stevenson Secretary of State .
As Rothbard related in his recently - published memoir , The Betrayal of the American Right :
" It was time to act ; and politically , my total break with the Right came with the Stevenson movement of 1960 .
In 1956 I had been for Stevenson over Eisenhower , but only partly for his superior peace position ; another reason was to try to depose the Republican “ Left ” so as to allow the Old Right to recapture the party .
Emotionally , I was then still a right - winger who yearned for a rightist third party .
But now the third - party lure was dead ; the Right was massively Goldwaterite .
And besides , Stevenson ’s courageous stand on the U - 2 incident  his outrage that Eisenhower had wrecked the summit conference by refusing to make not only a routine , but a morally required apology for the U - 2 spy incursion over Russia  made me a Stevensonian .
Politically , I had ceased being a right - winger .
I had determined that the crucial issue was peace or war ; and that on that question the only viable political movement was the “ left ” wing of the Democratic Party .
By consistently following an antiwar and isolationist star , I had shifted  or rather been shifted  from right - wing Republican to left - wing Democrat . "
Of course , Rothbard was never a " left - wing Democrat , " and yet his emphasis on the centrality of foreign policy made it seem so , at least to the superficial observer .
Rothbard realized that , irrespective of the rhetoric about the " free market " and " individual liberty " that came out of the mouths of conservatives , objectively the result of their policies  specifically , their foreign policy of relentless aggression and confrontation with the Soviet Union  would lead to the exact opposite of their stated intentions .
He saw that , as long as we were leading a global crusade , and pouring billions down the " anti-Communist " rat - hole , building up a huge military apparatus and national security bureaucracy  complete with an arsenal of nuclear weapons that could destroy the world several times over  our liberties , indeed our very lives , would be threatened with extinction .
The same holds true today .
Obama may be a left - wing Democrat , with economic views quite the opposite of my own  although , in truth , I believe he ’s significantly less of an old - style statist than is Hillary  and yet I can cheer his ascendance as the Democratic nominee because he is , after all , the antiwar candidate in this race .
And , no , it does n’t matter that he ’s not consistent  i.e. that he ’s no Ron Paul  and for two reasons :
1 ) The voters believe he ’s the exact opposite of the Cheneyites who have seized control of the foreign policy levers : that s why he ’s always talking about " reclaiming " the ship of state from their grip , and that ’s what ’s propelling his campaign .
This election , if Obama is nominated , will be a referendum on the war , and on our interventionist foreign policy in general .
The neocons know this , which is precisely why they loathe him  and will do anything to stop him .
Larison avers : " When we see neoconservatives go after Obama and his advisors , it is tempting to want to defend them against baseless charges , and to the extent that we can draw attention to the accusations that Obama ’s critics have been hysterically throwing at him over Israel , then we should do that as a way of showing their style of fearmongering and misrepresenting others ’ views .
But we should n’t forget that " he ’s just fool ’s gold , and not the Real Deal .
Yet I have to say that , unlike the paleos , who still retain a sentimental attachment to the GOP , the neocons know who their real enemies are .
They are also political realists , who realize that , once catapulted into the White House by a massive wave of antiwar / anti-interventionist sentiment , Obama ’s unlikely to be willing to pay the political price of launching another war , in , say , Pakistan .
2 ) We do n’t have a lot of time to turn the ship of state around and set a new course  because the course we ’re on is headed straight for the rocky shores of fiscal catastrophe .
As Ron Paul has constantly pointed out , our present policy of guns - and - butter cannot be sustained : the value of the dollar is falling dramatically , and the economic crisis is upon us .
The central bankers of the world are n’t scurrying around trying to shore up the shaky foundations of our financial system just because they need the exercise .
There is a very real danger that , unless we stop the bleeding of our resources into the charnel house of Iraq , we could be plunged  and very shortly  into a major worldwide depression .
The complete collapse of the American economy is not out of the question  unless the war is ended , and soon .
Ending the war would send a signal to the markets that the worst excesses of the Bush era are over , and that the country just might return to some version of fiscal sanity before long .
Naturally , I do n’t have a lot of faith in Obama ’s economic nostrums , which would be costly as well as counterproductive  yet not nearly as costly and damaging to the economy and the nation as a whole as the McCainiac program of perpetual war and unmitigated militarism at home and abroad .
In short , what we are facing is nothing less than an emergency : the present policies cannot be continued , without incurring the grave risk of a major catastrophe , either economic or military - political .
The sand in the hourglass is fast diminishing .
Obama is far from perfect , and yet his every speech and public pronouncement refutes the opening line of Larison ’s complaint : " Given the rather grim prospects for antiwar voters this election "
That is not " given , " not at all .
It is quite enough that Obama wants to end the war in 2009 , and bring all our troops home .
More than that , in these dark days , we have no right to expect or hope for .
Yet it is enough , for now .
It remains to be seen to what degree Obama ’s imperfections in the realm of foreign policy will impact our lives : if and when he decides to invade , say , Pakistan , or " liberate " Darfur , those who propelled him into the White House will either follow him , blindly , or else begin to question the doctrine of interventionism in principle .
It is the latter that the anti-interventionist movement must directly address , in the event of a betrayal by an Obama administration .
This is how people learn  they have to go through certain experiences in order to come out , at the end of it , transformed .
That is how many liberals , who initially supported Franklin Delano Roosevelt , came to join the old America First Committee ( yes , it ’s those " Copperhead isolationists , " Samantha ! ) : it is how many of today ’s liberals , such as Glenn Greenwald , have become sympathetic to Ron Paul and certain aspects of libertarianism .
And while I ’m on the subject of electoral politics and options for antiwar voters : it looks like Ron Paul is re-energizing his presidential campaign .
That ’s good news : the more options we have , the better .
The year of the insurgents has also had its effect on the right , with Paul pulling in a good 10 percent of the Republican primary voters  and possibly more , if , as I believe he might , the Good Doctor runs as a third party candidate .
Now imagine  and it ’s not hard  a scenario in which the Clintonian " super - delegates " snatch the nomination away from Obama , and spark a wave of populist anger .
Paul , if he’s on the ballot in the general election , could have a real impact , because Obama ’s voters , in a very real sense , are his voters .
The anti-interventionist movement  that is , the movement to make a fundamental change in our foreign policy of dominationism  is bigger than any political candidate , or party .
We do n’t endorse candidates here at Antiwar.com , and not just because we ’re a nonpartisan nonprofit foundation : in order to succeed , and really make that change , we ’re going to have to transcend party , and even ideology , and come together as Americans to stop the carnage and the tragic loss of resources , both human and material .
Politicians and parties come and go , but we ’re in this for the long haul .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I ca n’t believe what a hectic week this has been , what with our fundraising campaign and all the major developments on the international and domestic scenes .
I ’m rushing to write this , so I can write the copy for our Friday fundraising page : and , I have to tell you , I ’m getting just as sick of it as you are .
But , you know what ?
It will continue as long as it has to in order to ensure our survival , because we do n’t have any choice .
It ’s been slow going , but we ’re getting there .
Now , we just have to get over this last hump  and here ’s where your contributions are even more important than before .
Because if we do n’t make it , we ’ll have to start making major cutbacks  and you wo n’t like that , I can guarantee it .
So , please , if my work has been valuable to you over the years , now is the time to make that extra contribution that could put us over the top .
If ever we needed your support , it ’s now  so do n’t hesitate .
Do it now .
A " sea change in the computing industry "
A new startup out of MIT emerged from stealth mode today to announce that they 're shipping a 64 - core processor for the embedded market .
The company , called Tilera , was founded by Dr. Anat Agarwal , the MIT professor behind the famous and venerable Raw project on which Tilera 's first product , the TILE64 processor , is based .
Tilera 's director of marketing , Bob Doud , told Ars that TILE64 represents a " sea change in the computing industry , " and the company 's CEO is n't shy about pitching the chip as the " first significant new chip architectural development in a decade . "
So let 's take an initial look at what was announced about TILE64 today , with further information to follow as it becomes available .
TILE64
Tell me if this sounds familiar : a grid of processor " tiles " arranged in a mesh network , where each tile houses a general purpose processor , cache , and a non-blocking router that the tile uses to communicate with the other tiles on the chip .
If you 've followed my coverage of Intel 's Terascale research project — especially the 80 - core Polaris prototype — then you know that this description fits what Intel has been working on for the past few years and aggressively publicizing for a year or so .
But the basic tile + processor / cache + router + mesh network idea was pioneered by Dr. Agarwal and MIT 's RAW project about a decade ago , and now those same ideas also form the basis for TILE64 .
TILE64 consists of a mesh network of 64 tiles , with each tile containing a general - purpose processor core and a non-blocking router .
The short - pipeline , in - order , three - issue cores implement a MIPS - derived VLIW ISA with a few important and peculiar features .
Tilera 's PR department is extremely focused on the mesh network and larger SoC architectures as the initial selling points of the processor , so information on the individual cores is hard to come by .
Based on my discussion with Tilera and the diagrams that the company provided ( see below ) , each core has a register file and three functional units : two integer ALUs and a load - store unit .
The cores also have a split L1 cache ( probably 16 K ) , and a 64 K chunk of L2 that has an interesting feature .
When there 's a miss in one core 's L2 , the core checks the L2 caches of the other cores for the needed data before propagating the miss out to main memory .
In this respect , the L2s collectively act like a large 4MB L3 .
As you can probably make out from the diagram above , TILE64 has four DDR2 controllers , two 10 - gigabit Ethernet interfaces , two gigabit Ethernet interfaces , two four - lane PCIe interfaces , and a flexible I/O interface that can be software - configured to handle a number of protocols .
TILE64 is fabbed on TSMC 's trailing - edge 90nm process and runs at speeds from 600MHz to 900 Mhz .
The launch of a 90nm product at a time when the processor market is moving from 65nm to 45nm was undoubtedly done in order to keep costs down .
Tilera wo n't be able to afford to migrate this product to a smaller process node until they get enough volume to justify the investment .
The initial entries in the TILE64 line are now shipping on PCIe daughterboards for development and production purposes .
The processor is also available in lots of 10,000 for $ 435 , and further entries to the TILE family are planned to include different core counts .
Berkeley to decide on revoking Marines letter Hundreds expected to advise council on Marine recruiters

Berkeley is hunkering down for what is expected to be its largest and most raucous protest in years as hundreds of demonstrators from near and far pour into town for Tuesday night 's City Council showdown over a Marine Corps recruiting station downtown .
Protesters from all sides of the debate over the Iraq war - from the anti-war Code Pink to groups supporting the troops and the war - have promised to spend the day in front of old City Hall , drumming , singing , chanting and exchanging barbs with bullhorns .
" Nothing has really gotten the press or the world 's attention about war protests like this has , " said Lisa Rubens , historian at the Regional Oral History Office at UC Berkeley 's Bancroft Library .
" There 's been this wonderfully out - of - proportion , knee - jerk response .
It 's clever , inflammatory and symbolic . "
The council , at the request of members Betty Olds and Laurie Capitelli , is scheduled to decide tonight whether to revoke a letter it approved two weeks ago telling the Marines they are " unwelcome intruders " and should leave their post , which is one block from the UC Berkeley campus .
Some groups protesting the council 's earlier action want it to go further - by apologizing to the Marines and revoking permits to allow Code Pink a parking space outside the recruiting station on Shattuck Square and the use of a bullhorn at its weekly protests there .
Anticipating big and rowdy crowds , the city is advising staff members who work at Maudelle Shirek City Hall to leave by 3 p.m. and keep public meetings to a minimum .
The city also is setting up barricades so staff can get in and out of the building safely and is beefing up police , fire and paramedic services throughout the day .
Code Pink activists got an early start on the demonstration by camping out Monday night on the lawn at City Hall .
About 60 activists , including a few of the tree - sitters from UC Berkeley 's Oak Grove , danced , sang , listened to jazz and drank carrot juice as they pitched their tents for the night .
" This is a great gift to us to be able to ignite a national debate , " said Medea Benjamin , Code Pink spokeswoman .
" We 're drawing a line in the sand on Shattuck Avenue and saying the war stops here . "
Berkeley has hosted big and rowdy war protests for decades , but today 's activities are the first anyone can remember that are drawing demonstrators from multiple and extreme sides of an issue .
Code Pink , which once organized a breast - feeding playgroup at the Marines station , will share the City Hall lawn with AM radio hosts , the American Legion and outraged veterans from across the nation .
" It 's an indication that the '60s are not completely dead in Berkeley , " said Charles Wollenberg , chair of social sciences at Berkeley City College and author of " Berkeley : A City in History . "
" The tragedy is that the issue of the war seems to have gotten lost .
The issue instead has become Berkeley itself , and I do n't think that 's what the City Council had in mind . "
Councilwoman Linda Maio , who led the charge to tell the Marines they were n't welcome in town , agreed .
" We did not expect it to explode like this , " she said , adding that the council received more than 24,000 e-mails on the topic .
" But we 'll take the heat and the attacks .
Even though we 're under a lot of pressure , I think it 's fair to say this war is a misuse of our young people .
And we 'll stand up for that . "
This is hardly the first time Berkeleyans have taken on the U.S. military .
A similar protest occurred in 1959 , when UC Berkeley students protested the mandatory ROTC classes on campus .
As a result of the demonstrations , the military classes were no longer required for all male students .
The victory emboldened students to conduct one of the nation 's first Vietnam War teach - ins , and by the late 1960s Berkeley had become a center of campus anti-war activism .
One regular at Berkeley demonstrations who will be noticeably absent from today 's rallies is Country Joe McDonald , a Navy veteran and Vietnam - era peace activist famous for singing his " I Feel Like I 'm Fixin ' to Die Rag " at Woodstock in 1969 .
He says he will sit this one out .
The issue has very little to do with the Marines and a lot to do with political grandstanding and NIMBYism , McDonald said .
" The council said the Marines can't recruit here , they should recruit somewhere else , " he said .
" And if there 's a problem , we still want you to help us .
It 's astounding .
It allows everyone to make fun of Berkeley again . "
He said protesters on both sides are driven by " civilian guilt . "
" Most people yell and scream about this issue because they 're trying to show how patriotic they are , " he said .
" At this rate , Berkeley 's going to be a damn noisy place . "
A study of Lyndon B. Johnson provides new evidence that the 36th President stole his first election to the United States Senate , in 1948 .
The book , '' Means of Ascent , '' by Robert A. Caro , is the second volume of a projected four - volume study , '' The Years of Lyndon Johnson . ''
With a first printing of 250,000 copies , it is to be published on March 15 by Knopf , and excerpts have appeared in The New Yorker .
Mr. Caro maintains that although ballot fraud was common in the late 1940's in some parts of Texas , the Johnson campaign of 1948 raised it to a new level .
Mr. Caro supports his charge with an interview with Luis Salas , an election judge in Jim Wells County who said he acknowledged his role only after all others involved in the theft had died .
Determined to Win at All Costs
It has been alleged for years that Johnson captured his Senate seat through fraud , but Mr. Caro goes into great detail to tell how the future President overcame a 20,000 - vote deficit to achieve his famous 87 - vote victory in the 1948 Democratic runoff primary against a former Governor , Coke Stevenson .
A South Texas political boss , George Parr , had manufactured thousands of votes , Mr. Caro found .
Johnson died in 1973 , Stevenson and Parr in 1975 .
Mr. Caro says the election showed Johnson 's determination to win at all costs as well as his coolness under fire and his ability to select gifted lieutenants , whom he then manipulated .
Musical taste ?
I have externalized it .
Now I just log on to iTunes and it tells me what I like .
I click on its recommendations , sample 30 seconds of each song , and download the ones that appeal .
I look on my iPod playlist and realize I ’ve never heard of most of the artists I listen to .
I was once one of those people with developed opinions about the Ramones , but now I ’ve shed all that knowledge and blindly submit to a mishmash of anonymous groups like the Reindeer Section — a disturbing number of which seem to have had their music featured on the soundtrack of “ The O.C . ”
Memory ?
I ’ve externalized it .
I am one of those baby boomers who are making this the “ It ’s on the Tip of My Tongue Decade . ”
But now I no longer need to have a memory , for I have Google , Yahoo and Wikipedia .
Now if I need to know some fact about the world , I tap a few keys and reap the blessings of the external mind .
Personal information ?
I ’ve externalized it .
I ’m no longer clear on where I end and my BlackBerry begins .
When I want to look up my passwords or contact my friends I just hit a name on my directory .
I read in a piece by Clive Thompson in Wired that a third of the people under 30 ca n’t remember their own phone number .
Their smartphones are smart , so they do n’t need to be .
Today ’s young people are forgoing memory before they even have a chance to lose it .
Now , you may wonder if in the process of outsourcing my thinking I am losing my individuality .
Not so .
My preferences are more narrow and individualistic than ever .
It ’s merely my autonomy that I ’m losing .
I have relinquished control over my decisions to the universal mind .
I have fused with the knowledge of the cybersphere , and entered the bliss of a higher metaphysic .
As John Steinbeck nearly wrote , a fella ai n’t got a mind of his own , just a little piece of the big mind — one mind that belongs to everybody .
Then it do n’t matter , Ma . I ’ll be everywhere , around in the dark .
Wherever there is a network , I ’ll be there .
Wherever there ’s a TiVo machine making a sitcom recommendation based on past preferences , I ’ll be there .
Wherever there ’s a Times reader selecting articles based on the most e-mailed list , I ’ll be there .
I ’ll be in the way Amazon links purchasing Dostoyevsky to purchasing garden furniture .
And when memes are spreading , and humiliation videos are shared on Facebook — I ’ll be there , too .
I am one with the external mind .

Iran Focus
London , Jul. 24  An Iranian opposition satellite channel has broadcasted shocking footage of a public execution of a woman and two men in Iran .
Simay-e Azadi aired the footage on Monday .
It is believed the woman and two men were hanged as recently as this month .
The clip was captured by a bystander and smuggled out of Iran .
Simay-e Azadi said it obtained the video from supporters of the Peoples Mojahedin ( MeK ) .

A recent study conducted by the University of Minnesota shows that atheists are more distrusted and despised than any other minority and that an atheist is the last person for whom Americans would vote in a presidential election .
“ Muslims , recent immigrants , gays and lesbians ” all ranked higher than atheists in public acceptability .
Furthermore , Americans are “ least willing to allow their children to marry ” atheists .
State laws instill and perpetuate this attitude .
Article IX , Sec. 2 , of the Tennessee constitution states : “ No person who denies the being of God , or a future state of rewards and punishments shall hold any office in the civil department of this state . ”
Arkansas , Maryland , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Texas have similar laws .
George H. W. Bush while campaigning for President in 1987 exhibited this same attitude , “ I do n’t know that atheists should be considered as citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
This is one nation under God . ”
Apparently all theists good and all atheists bad .
If this is the case , atheist and agnostic businesspersons like Microsoft ’s Bill Gates , investment guru Warren Buffet , Apple ’s Steve Jobs and CNN founder Ted Turner should all be exiled for their unbelief .
Do n’t forget to include the 93 % of National Academy of Science members who lack belief in a personal deity .
What about atheist Pat Tillman , Arizona Cardinal football star , who left a $ 3,600,000 salary to enlist in the U.S. Army and subsequently got killed in Afghanistan ?
The oft - repeated theist claim , “ there are no atheists in foxholes ” insults a true American hero .
Is there a rationale for this prejudice against atheists or is this just plain theist bigotry ?
Why are atheists more “ despised and distrusted ” than any other minority ?
Why do theists promote this malicious slander ?
Has it ever occurred to theists to judge themselves by the same standards they judge others ?
Did n’t Jesus say something about taking the log out of your own eye before you take the splinter out of another ’s eye ?
How about the theist record ?
Theist Roman emperor Constantine had 3,000 Christians plus a wife and son murdered .
Roman Catholic theists instigated the murderous Crusades and the Inquisitions .
Theist Charlemagne had 4,500 Saxons beheaded all in one morning .
Protestant theists arbitrarily tortured and burned at the stake tens of thousands of women because of the Bible ’s admonition against witches .
Luther , Calvin and Zwingli advocated death for heretics .
Christian theists have persecuted Jews for the past eighteen centuries –most notably by the Roman Catholic theist Adolph Hitler who murdered 6,000,000 Jews .
Naively , many Americans assume theists never act immorally nor lie for fear of their God ’s anger .
Yet a recent study by The Center for Public Integrity finds that President George Bush and his top administration officials ( all theists ) issued 935 false statements about the national security threat from Iraq in the two years following the 2001 terrorist attack .
The study concludes these false statements “ were part of an orchestrated campaign that effectively galvanized public opinion and , in the process , led the nation to war under decidedly false pretenses . ”
That ’s 935 good reasons to question god-fearing theist morality .
The January / February 2008 Psychology Today magazine contains an article , “ An Atheist in the Pulpit , what happens when religious leaders lose their faith . ”
The author interviewed Lutheran , Pentecostal , Catholic and Episcopalian clergymen and recorded theism ’s cognitive dissonance in their own words .
“ We tend to ignore how much cognitive effort is required to maintain extreme religious beliefs , which have no supporting evidence whatsoever . ”
“ The disjunction between what clergymen say publicly and what they believe privately is so common that serious cognitive dissonance comes with the territory . ”
“ We spend our lives impersonating who we think others want us to be and end up living as impostors .
So when someone comes to me and tells me they are losing their faith , I congratulate them .
You ’re starting to embrace your own thinking self – the essential , immutable , immortal self – as opposed to the accidental criminal you have been made to think you are . ”
Integrity and cognitive health are theism ’s real sacrifice .
So why this centuries - old acrimony against atheists ?
Granted some atheists have committed atrocities too .
Communists Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse -tung are two heinous examples .
Does such justify the entirely one - sided bigotry and prejudice commonly accepted among Americans ?
America , the land of intellectual freedom , has granted hard - core theists free reign to preach their bigotry against Jews , Blacks , women and homosexuals .
However , the deep - seated prejudice against atheists merits special attention because atheism challenges theism ’s very existence .
A question seldom asked is what does the prejudice against atheists tell us about those who hold that prejudice ?
Are theists fearful that their god may not really be omnipotent , omniscient and omnipresent ?
Does the cognitive dissonance experienced when trying to explain their god ’s indifference to events like 9/11 , Katrina , and the 2004 Christmas Tsunami trouble their psyche ?
Maybe their religious fire insurance has been shaken .
When theists must struggle with the ineptitude of their god , who better to lash out at than atheists ?
Has religious tolerance for prejudice and bigotry toward atheists so intimidated Americans that they do not even recognize it ?
Evidently yes , especially when one might be branded one of those terrible atheists .
Nevertheless , an intellectually free America , as intended by our founders , remerges as more and more atheist / agnostic freethinkers come out of the closet and stand against theism ’s last bigoted prejudicial stronghold of intolerance .
As one astute college student said to me , “ a man without religion is like a fish without a bicycle ” — who needs it ?
I find the whole business of religion profoundly interesting .
But it does mystify me that otherwise intelligent people take it seriously .
- Douglas Adams in The Salmon of Doubt
One of many ' isms ' , the word ' atheism ' comes from the Greek atheos meaning ' without God ' .
While there are several definitions of atheism , a typical atheist is generally someone who has made a conscious decision that they do not believe in any form of god .
However , they are still allowed to believe in aliens , soulmates , human kindness and so forth , and it should be noted that lacking belief in a supernatural being does not preclude such things as moral values or a full and happy life .
While it is usually clear to atheists that they are normal people who just are n't religious , some parties tend to deliberately equate atheism with nihilism in order to devalue the atheistic way of life .
Great care should be exercised to avoid confusing atheism with terms such as agnosticism or antitheism .
Agnosticism comes from the Greek meaning ' without knowledge ' , and concludes , not unreasonably , that it is impossible to determine absolute truth .
Agnostics thus suspend judgement regarding the possible existence of god(s ) and tend to make no argument either for or against such beliefs .
Agnosticism is thus a state of uncertainty rather than a form of atheism .
Antitheism is a state of active opposition to theism , and some antitheists even work to promote the removal of religion from legislature and public institutions .
Not all atheists are antitheists !
Atheists should also not be confused with pagans , satanists or Jedis .
Why be an Atheist ?
The reasons for being an atheist are many , ranging from the lack of evidence that there is a god to the assertion that the existence of one would be either contradictory or downright silly .
Being a ' strong ' atheist allows a person to use their own set of morals and to look at the world in their own way , and it is up to them to use their conscience to decide what they should do with their life .
However , atheism has its downsides in that you have no religious figure to turn to in times of need , but fortunately the near - equality of the modern world means that atheists are generally not discriminated against as they were centuries ago .
Common Misconceptions
Atheists think religions are a waste of time - some atheists are quite happy to coexist with those who are religious , though ' strong ' atheists tend to find evangelism and attempts at proselytisation very irritating .
Some consider the existence of religion a mixed blessing as it makes so many people happy but also provides pretexts for hatred which are exploited by a minority of believers .
Atheists are offended by and want to rename or secularise religious festivals - most atheists do not find religious festivities the slightest bit offensive , and it is therefore best to ask their feelings instead of assuming they will be upset by greetings cards that read ' Merry Christmas ' .
Atheists lack moral values - this is not necessarily true , as the morals of an atheist depend on who they are , just as the morals of those who observe monotheisms and polytheisms can vary greatly .
Many atheists believe that no religious grounding is required to lead an ethical life .
Atheism is responsible for some of the worst crimes against humanity - while it is claimed by some that Stalin , Mao and Pol Pot acted the way they did due to a lack of religious belief , it was in fact their extreme political dogma that led to these occurrences .
Meanwhile , it should be pointed out that Hitler was not an atheist .
Atheists consider life to have no meaning or purpose - actually , some simply think we should be kind , happy and make the most of what we have .
Some also think it 's ' 42 ' .
Atheists are just a small minority - actually , a BBC study in 2004 found that 15.5 % of those living in the UK were atheists , coming third after the Protestants ( 47 % ) and the Roman Catholics ( 16 % ) , and with agnostics making up 4 % of the total .
Around 8 % of those living in the USA were atheists , and this was also found to be the average across all the countries included in the study .
In total , 1.1 billion people worldwide do not believe in any god , and at least 220 million of that number are atheists .
There is no such thing as discriminating against atheists - in the UK , atheists now receive the same protection from discrimination as those who are religious .
Atheists feel a need to prove they are right - some do , some do n't .
However , the ones that do can often be the noisier ones .
Atheists will recoil at the sight or sound of god - some religious people do in fact believe this to be the case and may be surprised to hear that atheists do not melt upon contact with holy icons .
Atheists are afraid to die - this is very much a matter of each to his own , and also depends on the culture in which the atheist lives .
An atheist is just as likely to give their life to save another as anyone else .
Atheists subscribe to the Big Bang and Darwin 's theory of Evolution - they do n't have to , though some atheists simply see these theories as being sensible and helpful in their understanding of who they are .
However , few atheists rely solely upon these as validation of their decision to reject god , and most will eventually lose patience if forced to listen to in - depth arguments in favour of creationism .
Atheists deny the existence of god solely due to lack of evidence or scientific explanation - atheism is a personal choice in the same way as following a religion is , and is n't necessarily to do with a need for explanations .
Atheism is just an easy way out - this is true for some , but does not mean that all atheists are such because they cannot cope with the deeper questions in life .
In fact , atheism can be more complicated as it removes the explanation that a god governs everything .
The idea that atheists deny the existence of god in order to live easier , guilt - free lives is deemed by some to be very offensive .
Atheists are such only due to their ignorance and apathy , and therefore need teaching about religion - this is simply not the case , and it is unwise for evangelists to treat all non-believers as clean slates in need of filling .
The Bible claims that atheists know there is a god , so they must all be liars - the Bible is a religious text and is not considered to be factual by all .
Atheists may even consider it to be imaginative mythology mixed with personal opinion , and so the above claim could well be met with a Paddington hard stare .
There are no atheists in foxholes - the claim that in times of stress , atheists will turn to religion is considered offensive by some atheists and is not supported by the stories told by various atheist military veterans .
Atheists will never find out if they were right - being right is n't always everything , and there is in fact an easy way to die as an atheist .
Simply smile ironically as you die in the knowledge that you were right - if you 've got it wrong , you 'll have all the time you need to think about your mistake , but assuming that you 're right you should make the most of the little time you have .
Also , remember that you can either be happy that life has been good to you or , if it has n't , then you can be glad it wo n't be bothering you for much longer .
Atheists are n't allowed to believe in Father Christmas - do n't be silly - we all know he 's real , so what 's there to believe in ?
Weak and Strong Atheism
As with those who follow classical theism , atheists are spread across a spectrum which marks how certain their feelings are .
' Strong ' atheism positively affirms the non-existence of any form of god or gods , and is generally regarded as ' genuine ' atheism .
On the other hand , ' weak ' atheists do not believe in a god , but do not go as far as positively affirming the non-existence of any form of god or gods .
Some weak atheists are such only due to the implicit nature of not having learnt of the matter , making them atheists only implicitly .
Others occupy the ' weak ' category due to apathy .
Agnostics who do not believe in a god can also be said to be weak atheists , and weak atheists who are such due to uncertainty can be labelled agnostics .
Thus it is only the so - called ' strong ' atheists that formally assert an absolute disbelief in god .
Subgroups of Atheism
While not all atheists consider themselves as occupying a particular subgroup , there are several different types of atheist with varying opinions .
Some common examples are :
Humanism - humanism encourages a view of the world based only on what is really there , along with a positive outlook on life in which humans can gain and share knowledge and moral values without the help of a supernatural being .
Though humanism does not require atheism as a basis , its views do not conflict with it either .
Naturalism - naturalists such as the Brights consciously reject the idea of the supernatural and the mystical , preferring instead to base life upon a ' naturalistic worldview ' .
Though naturalism does not require atheism as a basis , its views do not conflict with it either .
Secularism - secularism demands the separation of the state and the church such that countries do not have an institutional religion .
This is due to the view that it is unfair for the religious to receive privileges , for atheists to be forced to take religious oaths in public sector jobs , and that blasphemy should not be criminalised .
They also encourage the teaching to school children of all religions equally and as being equal .
Note that being a secularist does n't make someone an atheist - it 's just that some atheists are secularists .
In fact , an enforcement of atheism by the state would go against the ideals of secularism .
Rationalism - the scientific approach to atheism , rationalism encourages acceptance of facts based on reason and evidence .
Rationalists believe in equality and an open society in which beliefs may be held without prejudice .
Postmodernism - this approach states that all religions are derived from human interactions and social groupings , with the effects of religion being due to the underlying motives of the people involved .
There are also some religions which allow individuals to choose their beliefs , hence allowing room for atheism :
Atheist Buddhism - always one to confuse the definitions of theism and atheism , Buddhism actually teaches the path to enlightenment and does not endorse any god or claim to be in some way divine .
It is therefore possible for a Buddhist to decide that no god exists and that there is no such thing as reincarnation or the afterlife .
Unitarian Universalism - created in opposition to Christian doctrines , this religious movement presents a grey area in that it does not represent atheism , but instead allows for beliefs of all kinds .
They do however hold moral values and ethical living quite highly .
Some misnomers also exist , such as ' Christian Atheism ' , which refers to Christians who chose not to indulge in Christian mythology but still believe in their god .
Meanwhile , Humanistic Judaism is closer to agnosticism in that followers do not accept any evidence of the presence or lack of a god .
Famous Atheists
Naturally , many scientists over the years have been atheists , including Francis Crick and James Watson , Albert Einstein , Marie Curie , Linus Pauling and Steven Weinberg .
However , famous atheists have come from all walks of life , ranging from businessmen and politicians to authors and musicians .
Atheist authors include Douglas Adams , Terry Pratchett , Phillip Pullman and Isaac Asimov , while non-believers also include Pink Floyd singer David Gilmour , musician Billy Joel , screenwriter Joss Whedon , actor Sir Ian McKellen , comedian Woody Allen and Linus Torvalds , creator of the Linux kernel .
Finally , a mention should be made of the atheist philosophers , which include Karl Marx , Friedrich Nietzsche , Bertrand Russell and Jean - Paul Sartre .

' The God Delusion ' by Richard Dawkins explores arguments against religion and looks at how atheists can lead happy and fulfilling lives .
Although Dawkins is highly critical of religion , he makes some interesting points such as his belief that children should not be labelled by their parents ' religion .
Meanwhile , ' The Evolution of Cooperation ' by Robert Axelrod looks at how those with selfish aims may in fact end up cooperating without any guiding force , and ' The Origin of Virtue ' by Matt Ridley explores the ways in which biology can explain morality and altruism , thus negating the need for a god to impose moral values .
The latter two books both make use of game theory , with variations of the Prisoner 's Dilemma featuring .

Big news , and I had not an inkling of it , lest you think your loyal correspondent always has the inside track : Starbucks is shredding its deal in place since 2001 , originally with MobileStar then T - Mobile , to switch to AT&T as their Wi -Fi provider .
That moves 7,000 locations from T - Mobile 's ledgers of nearly 9,000 to AT&T's .
It turns AT&T from " McDonald 's plus , " with a relatively small footprint of other locations , to a 17,000 - location giant .
It also means that 12 million DSL customers and fiber ( U - Verse ) subscribers and 5 million remote - access business customers now get free access to Starbucks .
AT&T says in their press release that all Starbucks Card holders , which is simply their value - storing swipe card system , will get two hours of free Wi -Fi a day .
No purchase is needed : you just need an active card , I confirmed with the company .
Walk in , buy a $ 5 value card , activate it , and you 're on for two hours a day from then forward .
You can also use multiple devices with a single account , within reason , Starbucks told me .
AT&T has also lowered the price for usage from T - Mobile 's somewhat egregious $ 6 per hour or $ 10 per day to $ 4 for a two - hour session .
The monthly price , like the rest of AT&T 's network , is $ 20 per month for outsiders , which also includes all 70,000 domestic and international locations in their worldwide roaming network .
And --yes , there 's an and -- all Starbucks employees , 100,000 " partners " ( read : wage slaves and management ) get free access at all Starbucks locations .
Which you have to admit is a nice perq .
AT&T is also part of Boingo 's roaming network , which means that their customers suddenly get 7,000 highly desirable domestic roaming locations at no additional cost .
( iPass has long had a T - Mobile roaming relationship . )
The same is true for other AT&T roaming partners , an AT&T spokesperson confirmed .
T- Mobile HotSpot subscribers will still be able to access Starbucks locations .
Starbucks posted a separate press release stating that T - Mobile will be a roaming partner onto the AT&T network through a side deal ; no additional cost is involved .
There 's some leverage here , because T - Mobile does have about 2,000 other locations , including some premium airports like San Francisco .
Existing roaming / aggregation deals among Boingo , AT&T , and T - Mobile were partly predicated on the airport market , where millions of subscribers to each network pass through each year .
I should have seen this coming , because it was extremely odd when Apple partnered with Starbucks for the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store service , when their exclusive iPhone partner is AT&T and Starbucks had the T - Mobile deal .
This also may pave the way for in - store iTunes Store media servers , which would -- as I have written too much about in the last few years -- allow someone to use the edge network , the WLAN not the Internet , to pull down a movie in a few minutes instead of an hour or two on a home network .
Wayport just sent out their press notification ; the Austin , Texas , firm has been providing managed services for AT&T for the telecom 's own network for a few years , but also operates through its own relationship the 8,000 +
McDonald 's locations .
AT&T has been the backhaul provider , as I understand it , for most of the McDonald 's deal .
It 's a bit intertwined .
Wayport 's hotspot growth has been limited in recent years as the market for where Wi-Fi could go became saturated ; this move is exceptionally good for the privately held firm .
The deal goes into place starting market - by - market in the second quarter of 2008 , and will be completed this year .

Having a huge network of online friends does not mean you have any more close friends than the rest of us , a British researcher has said .
Social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace are changing the nature of how people connect by making it easy to collect hundreds of friends and acquaintances online .
" Our data suggests weak ties are ( more common ) but there is no difference in the number of close friends people have , " said Will Reader , an evolutionary psychologist at Sheffield Hallam University .
" Nearly all our close friends require face - to - face contact , " Mr Reader told a meeting sponsored by the British Association for the Advancement of Science .
The researchers focused on Facebook and MySpace , two of the most popular sites where millions of people express themselves online with personal photographs , musings and other content while adding " friends " to their network .
In their study , Mr Reader and colleagues asked people a series of questions about their attitudes toward friendships and found 90 per cent of individuals said it was imperative to know somebody face - to - face to form the tightest bonds .
The key it seems is face - to - face interaction where people can interpret social clues such as laughs and smiles that help determine if others are friends to be counted on , Mr Reader said .
" That weird experience of laughing together where people can find they have similar goals and experiences is necessary , " Mr Reader said .
" It is a bit like a dance between two scorpions where one is wondering if the other is going to eat me or sleep with me . "
Other studies have shown most people have about 150 people in their extended networks , with just a small number considered a member of the inner circle of close friends , Mr Reader said .
Even when people 's social networks ballooned into many hundreds or more than a thousand people , the number of close friendships did not change , he said .
" One of the possibilities is that changing the nature of these networks can decrease the cost of maintaining friendships , " Mr Reader said .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
The Grateful Dead , the San Francisco cult rock band that has played at political events since the 1960s , will reunite on Monday for the first time in four years to rally support for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , a spokesman said on Friday .
Band leader Jerry Garcia died in 1995 .
Surviving members have played together occasionally since then , most recently in 2004 .
On Monday , original members Mickey Hart , Phil Lesh and Bob Weir will play at a San Francisco theater a day before California ’s primary .
“ They have agreed to reunite for this one - time - only event in order to lend support to Senator Obama leading into the crucial ‘ Super - Tuesday ’ series of primaries held on Tuesday , February 5th , ” the band said in a statement .
The band gained fame with its free - form psychedelic music when the counterculture movement flourished in San Francisco in the 1960s , and they attracted many loyal fans who came to be known as “ Deadheads . ”
Staff say all customers are asked for proof of age
Check - out staff at Morrisons in West Kirby , Wirral , demanded Tony Ralls prove he was old enough to buy his two bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon .
Mr Ralls asked to see the manager who put the wine back on the shelf .
The grandfather - of - three said he had refused to confirm he was over 21 as it was a " stupid question . "
Mr Ralls , a retired insurance firm regional manager , said he expected the store manager to resolve the situation but he was disappointed .
" I felt like saying ' What do I look like ?
Are you a fool ?'
It 's bureaucracy gone mad
Tony Ralls
" He picks up the wine and , in the manner of a child taking home his ball , says ' Well , we wo n't serve you ' . "
The pensioner abandoned his shopping on the conveyor belt and left the store - but not before demanding a complaints form and phone number for Morrisons ' headquarters .
Mr Ralls said : " It is bureaucracy gone mad .
If the check - out lady , who was about 40 , had asked me with a twinkle in her eye perhaps I would not have been so tetchy .
" But she asked me the question with a perfectly straight face and I said I would n't dignify the question with an answer .
" And if the manager had explained that all the staff had to ask everyone because they had previously been fined , but said I was clearly over 21 , it would have been fine - but he showed no sense of humour . "
Mr Ralls added that he felt embarrassed to return to the supermarket and wanted an apology for " the stupid and unnecessary confrontation . "
He added : " I applaud any efforts to stop kids being served and standing on street corners getting drunk .
But this was just totally stupid . "
A Morrisons spokesman said : " We take our responsibility with regard to selling alcohol very seriously and all our stores operate the Task 21 scheme , which addresses the difficulties our staff face in being able to determine if a customer is legally old enough to buy alcohol .
" To further limit any element of doubt staff at the West Kirby store are required to ask anyone buying alcohol to confirm that they are over 21 . "

ACLU requests Supreme Court review of warrantless wiretaps Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 3 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Attempting to force a definitive ruling on the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping scheme , the American Civil Liberties Union has asked the Supreme Court to consider an appeal of its lawsuit against the National Security Agency .
The ACLU joined with lawyers , scholars and journalists who argue that the NSA 's possible interception of their phone calls and e-mails violated their rights and interfered with their jobs .
The Supreme Court petition comes as Congress is considering a permanent update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that the ACLU says would give President Bush even more authority to intercept Americans ' communications than he claimed in authorizing the warrantless wiretapping program .
The ACLU 's lawsuit was dismissed earlier this year by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals , which said the plaintiffs were ineligible to sue the government because they could not prove their communications were intercepted .
The administration has refused to release details about the program 's scope or the number of Americans who were eavesdropped on , saying such information is classified .
 The president has claimed the power to disregard any law that , in his view , infringes on his ability to collect intelligence ,  Steven R. Shapiro , National Legal Director of the ACLU , said in statement .
 The government should not be able to avoid scrutiny of its surveillance activities simply by refusing to identify the victims of its unlawful behavior .
The ACLU argues that the 2 - 1 appeals court decision was wrongly decided and did not address the underlying legality of the NSA program .
The Supreme Court ought to intervene , the ACLU argues , because of the need for a definitive judicial ruling on the program .
In its petition to the court , the ACLU outlines past government abuses of its surveillance authority that led to FISA 's passage , such as spying on suspected Communists in the 1950s to wiretaps of Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights and anti-war activists during the Nixon administration .
A judicial review of the program 's merits is needed to prevent similar abuses of Americans ' privacy rights under the new program , the ACLU argues .
 Innocent people who are harmed by illegal government surveillance should be able to challenge that surveillance in court ,  said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLUs National Security Project .
 It should not be left to executive branch officials alone to determine what limits apply to government surveillance and whether those limits are being honored . 

ACLU sues DEA on behalf of truck whose money was seized
ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. ( AP ) —
A trucker has sued the Drug Enforcement Administration , seeking to get back nearly $ 24,000 seized by DEA agents earlier this month at a weigh station on U.S. 54 in New Mexico north of El Paso , Texas .
Anastasio Prieto of El Paso gave a state police officer at the weigh station permission to search the truck to see if it contained “ needles or cash in excess of $ 10,000 , ” according to the American Civil Liberties Union , which filed the federal lawsuit Thursday .
Prieto told the officer he did n’t have any needles but did have $ 23,700 .
( Original Article )
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown consulted with his Iraqi counterpart Wednesday , following the release of a video showing a British national who was kidnapped in Iraq .
Peter Moore as he appears in the video broadcast on Al - Arabiya .
Downing Street said Brown spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki about the video that was released on Tuesday on the Arabic - language network Al - Arabiya .
It shows one of five Britons taken hostage on May 29 in Baghdad .
" The PM has been in close contact with PM Maliki on this case , and discussed it again with him over the ' phone this morning , " a statement from Brown 's office said .
" Both leaders deplored the taking and public parading of hostages , and agreed to continue their close cooperation to secure their early release . "
In the video released Tuesday , a man who identified himself as Peter Moore pleaded with the British government to perform " a simple exchange " of prisoners with his captors so " we can go home . "
Moore appears alone in front of what appears to be a red curtain .
His appearance is far different than in a Dec. 9 photo on the Web site of The Sunday Times in London .
The Times photo shows a clean - shaven Moore with strawberry blond hair and glasses .
In the video , Moore has dark hair , a dark moustache and full beard , and no glasses .
In the video , Moore calls on Brown to arrange a prisoner exchange so the five can be released .
" It 's a simple exchange -- release those that they want so we can go home .
It 's as simple as that .
It is a simple exchange of people .
This is all they want , just have their people released , " he said .
The five Britons were seized along with two Iraqis from an Iraqi Finance Ministry building in Baghdad and were said to have been taken toward the Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City .
According to an anchor at Al - Arabiya , the network " received a tape that had a statement and a video showing a man who appears to be a British hostage .
The video is signed by a group calling itself the Shiite Islamic Resistance in Iraq .
" The statement was addressed to the British people , asking them to demand that their government release nine Iraqis that have been detained for a year now and , in return , the organization vows to release five British hostages that they 've had for several months . "
According to CNN reporters in Baghdad , this appears to be only the second time anyone has heard of this group .
However , they noted that there are hundreds of organizations , militias , splinter groups and gangs in Iraq .
They also tend to change names when leadership or alliances change .
The last video of one of the hostages was dated Nov. 18 , but released in December and also came from the Shiite Islamic Resistance in Iraq .
It showed one of the hostages , identified only as Jason .
The kidnappers warned that a hostage would be killed if British troops did not leave Iraq in 10 days .
Moore was teaching Iraqis computer skills when he was kidnapped , the Times said , and had previously worked in Guyana assisting with relief operations following floods in 2005 .
Moore 's employer , the Virginia - based management and technology consultant firm BearingPoint , confirmed his identity to CNN .
" We are all praying for the urgent and safe release of Peter , " Betsy Palmer , an executive vice president , told CNN .
Palmer said Moore , a computer consultant , had been with the company only a few months before he was abducted .
She added that the company is in contact with the British government .
Moore is a full - time employee with Bearing Point , she told CNN ; the other four men are contractors working for the firm .
According to the Times , the four were bodyguards .
The British Foreign Office issued a statement Tuesday saying the videos are : " greatly distressing to the families of those involved .
Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time .
" We urge those holding the group to release them immediately .
We are in close contact with the Iraqi authorities and doing everything we can to try and secure a swift release .
We ask all those who may be able to influence those holding the five men to make every effort they can to secure the safety and the release of the hostages . "

Are you a MacBook or MacBook Pro owner who recently installed Apple 's Keyboard Firmware Upgrade 1.0 ?
It turns out that the update brings more than the first keypress after the machine has been sitting idle .
It also brings a some embedded song lyrics and a quote from 1984 !
This tip was submitted by an eagle - eyed reader with too much time on his hands and confirmed by , well , us .
There are apparently two executables that come as part of the keyboard updater package .
The goods are located in HIDFirmwareUpdaterTool : open it in a text editor of some sort and search for " sand dunes . "
The first line , " If you 're fond of sand dunes and salty air , quaint little villages here and there , " is from the song " Old Cape Cod " ( iTunes link ) by Patti Page .
It 's quite a nice song actually .
And Cape Cod is also pretty nifty .
Good seafood .
The second line , creepily recounted in all caps and no punctuation , reads " WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH . "
This , of course , is a line from the book 1984 by George Orwell — more specifically , it is the Party 's slogan in the book and the reasoning behind the perpetual war .
Apple does have an unusual " thing " for 1984 , as the company 's historic Macintosh commercial is based around it .
But what does the whole hidden message mean ?
Steve Jobs likes his clam chowder with a side of RDF ignorance ?
Lobster and dictatorship go well with a perfectly - paired wine ?
Cape Cod is Oceania ?
We 'll refrain from any further speculation .
Battle it out in the comments .

Translation From PR - Speak to English of Selected Portions of Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang ’s Company - Wide Memo Regarding the Microsoft Takeover Bid
Company - wide memo from Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang earlier today , capitalization sic , as filed with the SEC :
Subject : Building on our strengths
Subject : Shitting our pants
first off , I want to thank you for the great job you ’re doing staying focused on executing our priorities .
there ’s obviously been a lot of talk about yahoo !
in recent days and we wo n’t let it distract us from pursuing our transformation strategy .
Thank you for not quitting last Friday .
roy and I have communicated about the thorough review process our board is going through right now .
the board is focused on maximizing the value of yahoo ! ’s tremendous assets for our shareholders .
and it is going to take the time it needs to do it right .
We very much want to say “ no ” but ca n’t figure out how without triggering a shareholder revolt .
as we ’ve said , no decisions have been made about microsoft ’s proposal .
our board is thoughtfully evaluating a wide range of potential strategic alternatives in what is a complex and evolving landscape .
and we ’ve hired top advisors to assist through the process .
Does anyone have any wealthy relatives with 40 or 50 billion dollars to invest ?
what ’s become clear in the past few days is how much people care about this company .
we ’ve seen a strong show of support from our users , advertisers , and publishers , reminding us how much they love our products and services .
and i’ve heard from many of you — and from other friends and colleagues from around silicon valley and across the globe — that we need to do what ’s best for yahoo !
and our shareholders .
i promise you that the board is going to do that .
Everyone seems to agree that Microsoft would fuck Yahoo up but good .
the microsoft interest highlights the tremendous strength of the yahoo !
brand and assets : our half billion users around the world , our leading products and services , our open ad network , our technology , and most of all , our amazingly talented people .
Yahoo ’s stock was clearly undervalued by the market , which means those bastards in Redmond are getting a good deal and there ’s nothing we can do about it .
we have a lot to be excited about and there ’s more good news to come .
Where by “ more ” I mean “ some ” .
yesterday we announced a digital music partnership with rhapsody and our acquisition of foxytunes , maker of the popular music toolbar plugin .
We are completely irrelevant in digital music .
today we launched zimbra 5.0 , a next generation e-mail and collaboration suite that ’s a great milestone in our open platform and starting point strategies .
Zimbra will be the first product taken out back to be shot in the head once the Microsoft takeover goes through .
as we look to build on the progress we ’ve been making , i want to make sure you all realize how essential you are to yahoo ! ’s success .
Please do n’t quit .
as this process moves forward , we ’re going to keep you informed .
your hard work and strong commitment are more important now than ever before .
Welcome to Microsoft .
( Updates with more Bush comments )
FREDERICKSBURG , Va. , Dec 17 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush said on Monday he supports Russia sending enriched uranium to Iran for civilian power use because it meant that Tehran did not need to pursue their own enrichment capabilities .
" If the Russians are willing to do that , which I support , then the Iranians do not need to learn how to enrich , " Bush said .
" If the Iranians accept that uranium for a civilian nuclear power plant , then there 's no need for them to learn how to enrich . "
Russia has delivered the first shipment of nuclear fuel to Iran 's Bushehr atomic power station , which Moscow and Washington say should convince Tehran to shut down its disputed uranium enrichment program .
Bush said Iran was a danger so long as it pursued a nuclear program that could lead to the development of weapons .
Tehran insists its program is for peaceful energy purposes only .
Despite a U.S. intelligence assessment that Tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 , Bush said : " I think Iran 's a danger to peace .
My attitude has n't changed toward Iran .
If somebody had a weapons program what 's to say they could n't start it up tomorrow ? "
The United States is seeking another round of U.N. sanctions against Iran .
" They owe an explanation to the world , " Bush said .
" That ( intelligence ) report says to me , when you read it carefully , Iran was a threat , Iran is a threat to peace , and Iran will be a threat to peace if we do n't stop their enrichment facilities , " Bush said .
The party of Nawaz Sharif ( centre ) is in second place
Mr Musharraf told the Wall Street Journal there was a need to move forward to help bring about a stable democratic government in Pakistan .
US President George Bush called the vote a victory for Pakistani democracy .
Meanwhile the party of late former PM Benazir Bhutto says it is ready to form a coalition with Nawaz Sharif 's PML-N .
A union of Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) with the PML - N would have more than half parliament 's seats .
Will they be friends of the United States ?
I certainly hope so
US President George Bush
The main party backing President Musharraf suffered a heavy defeat , and correspondents say the president appears to be in a very difficult position .
If a new governing coalition manages to muster a two - thirds majority in parliament , it could call for Mr Musharraf to be impeached .
However , unofficial results suggest the two leading parties will not reach this total on their own , so would need to rely on support from other parties or independents .
US ally
But Mr Musharraf said that he would try to work with any new government .
NATIONAL RESULTS SO FAR PPP ( Bhutto's party ) : 87 PML - N ( Nawaz Sharif ) : 66 PML-Q : ( pro-Musharraf ) 39 MQM ( Sindh - based ) : 19 ANP ( Secular Pashtuns ) : 10 MMA ( Islamic alliance ) : 3 Others : 34 Source : Election commission
Can Musharraf survive ?
" I would like to function with any party and any coalition because that is in the interest of Pakistan , " he told the Wall Street Journal .
" The clash would be if the prime minister and president would be trying to get rid of each other .
I only hope we would avoid these clashes , " the president added .
Mr Musharraf was re-elected to the presidency last October , in a parliamentary vote boycotted by the opposition as unconstitutional .
He has been a major US ally in the " war on terror " but his popularity has waned at home amid accusations of authoritarianism and incompetence .
PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari invited Mr Sharif to join a coalition
President Bush , speaking in Ghana , said the elections were " judged as being fair , and the people have spoken .
I view that as a significant victory " .
When the new government is formed , he added , " the question then is : ' will they be friends of the United States ? ' and I certainly hope so " .
' End of dictatorship '
At a press conference on Tuesday , Ms Bhutto 's widower and the PPP leader , Asif Ali Zardari , said his party would " form a government of national consensus which will take along every democratic force " .
" For now , the decision of the party is that we are not interested in any of those people who are part and parcel of the last government , " he said , seemingly ruling out any coalition with the Pakistan Muslim League 's pro-Musharraf wing , the PML -Q .
With votes counted in 258 out of 272 constituencies , the PPP has won 87 seats , according to the Election Commission of Pakistan .
HAVE YOUR SAY Perhaps Musharraf should leave Pakistan so that reforms can begin Clifford Power
The PML - N , or Pakistani Muslim League - Nawaz , is in second place with 66 seats so far .
The party 's leader , former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , said earlier on Tuesday that he was prepared to discuss joining a coalition with Mr Zardari 's party in order " to rid Pakistan of dictatorship forever " .
The two parties so far have a combined total of 153 seats in parliament .
PML - Q chairman , Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain , told Associated Press Television News his party accepted the results " with an open heart " and was prepared to " sit on opposition benches " .

Steve posted Fri about ABC News ’
Jake Tapper 's article that completely misrepresented what Bill Clinton said in a speech delivered in Denver on Wed regarding climate change and the economy .
Brad at Sadly No! justifiably raked Jake over the coals for his apparent illiteracy in interpreting what Clinton meant from the transcript , but I must add that after seeing the video which Tapper has posted several links to in his article , I 'm inclined to believe there 's just no way anyone could have misinterpreted what he meant .
See for yourself .
Download Download
Even though Tapper apparently watched that same video , he has since added in an update that he " was n't sure just what Clinton meant . "
Now whether it is even possible for a journalist at ABC to be that stupid or whether he just continues to be deliberately misleading , I suppose that could be open to debate , but the problem is that now , days after Jake 's misleading piece had been thoroughly debunked and taken to task by blogs on the left and the right , the story unsurprisingly made it into the echo chamber where it was picked up by the likes of Drudge , Rush Limbaugh and now is showing up in publications with titles such as " Bill Clinton Wants An Economic Slowdown " and " Slow The Economy ?
Chill , Bill . "
I can only shake my head .
Churchill was so right .
( Yes , it most certainly will , just as sure as people in Hell want Ice water )
If tiny bubbles floating up from the ocean floor could tell tales , we might learn a thing or two on the surface .
On the heels of Iran announcing the grand opening of its new " Oil Bourse , " not many US financial institutions are cutting colorful ribbons or breaking Champaign bottles in celebration over this announcement .
In fact , Wall Street is painfully developing acid reflex because this could very well be the beginning of the end for monopolizing " Texas Tea " exclusively being sold using only American dollars .
In truth , this could very well plummet the American dollar deeper into the abyss of nothingness .
Having said that , strange things are surreptitiously happening on the ocean floor with scant reporting in the US corporate mainstream news media ... sneaky little devils .
Since the end of January – nine ( or more ) major fiber optic cables – on the ocean floors have suspiciously been cut , disrupting most or all telecommunications / internet capabilities for the Middle East , North Africa and South Asia .
From Egypt to India and most points in between , cable cuts in the Persian Gulf , Egypt , Malaysia and France have predominately affected Muslim nations .
Bottom line , this is keeping them " off - the - communication grid " slowing their international markets for trade and commerce to a standstill .
And , this has delayed the grand opening for the Oil Bourse .
To no surprise in these days of worthless news reporting competing with Hollywood Bimbo Slut alerts , little attention was afforded in the corporate media about this little tidbit .
And when it was mentioned or ticker - taped , a few lame excuses were offered , such as ...
1 ) Was this a multiple million to one natural caused anomaly ?
2 ) Was it a multiple ship mishap coincidently dragging their anchors along the ocean floor causing the breaks ?
3 ) ( the unmentioned )
Was it a blatant ocean espionage mission orchestrated to prevent Iran from opening their new Oil Bourse ?
Gee , I 'm so undecided ...
Well , after much skull scratching on my itchy , analytical head , and after a simple internet search giving detail how the US Navy has many sophisticated submarine teams specially out - rigged with cable cutting capability ( for doable secret covert espionage missions such as this ) , those tiny little bubbles floating to the surface truly found their voice for me .
However , I have to admit , I do believe part of the " bogus anchor - drag - fairytale . "
It truly is unfortunate for us that real soon , US war ships will probably start launching smart missiles and mini nukes at Iran because of nervous Wall Street investors and crazy war hawks ... and that in itself is an " anchor drag " of magnanimous misfortune for everyone involved .

The Federal Reserve announced another $ 20 billion in funds auctioned off to commercial banks today in order to help prop them up in the wake of the global mortgage meltdown .
Especially telling is why the auction is working so well when previous attempts to throw cash out of helicopters inject liquidity into the market have n’t worked so well :
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues decided to try the new process because their efforts to inject funds into the banking system through the Fed ’s discount window , which makes direct loans to banks , had proven less successful than Fed officials had hoped .
Many banks had avoided using the Fed ’s discount window out of concern that investors would see the move as an indication of underlying problems at their financial institutions .
The auction process was developed as a second way to get money into the banking system with the hopes that it would not carry the stigma of the discount window .
( Emphasis added . )
In other words , “ This is n’t a bailout .
Nothing to see here .
Move along .
Do n’t mind the dead bull in the middle of the street . ”
Merrill Lynch , meanwhile , is predicting that we wo n’t see the end of the bubble until at least 2012 :
But with the sales backdrop still softening , they may have to slice their construction plans by another 30 % before we hit bottom on a cyclical basis .
And , that bottom could be as long as a year away .
Beyond that , weak demographic fundamentals point to years of sluggish real estate activity , particularly in terms of the â€œpriceâ€ .
The looming dominance of the â€œmove downâ€ buyer suggests that home values will continue to soften long after the building industry mops up the current excess supply .
In fact , real estate pricing in general can be expected to be in the doldrums through 2012 .
The report ( which I found thanks to Kevin Drum ) notes in the next paragraph that this may induce more after - tax saving and investing from consumers as a way of replacing the idea of the home as the primary retirement vehicle .
I ’m a big fan of that idea , but if consumer spending continues to spike , the chances of greater saving will drop drastically .
Given how much of our economy is based on spending , every dollar spent on building better financial futures for oneself and one ’s family is a dollar not spent on shiny toys and consumer goods , after all .
Meanwhile , the heat generated by Bush and Paulson ’s false mortgage rescue plan continues to burn the wrong people , as spittle - flecked invective from the likes of Michelle Malkin and her commenters indicates :
Comments like this are typical of the reaction to any of the housing bubble bailout plans floating about the Hill these days , which is the preferred reaction , actually .
By focusing the ire of angry homeowners , renters , and savers at those “ irresponsible people ” who “ lived way beyond their means , ” it deflects attention from the fact that plans such as the Federal Reserve ’s new guidance for lenders are pretty much worthless –like Barney Frank says , if you believe the Fed is looking out for you , you believe in Santa Claus .
But this is the aim , you see–direct the ire of angry consumers at other individual consumers , using coded language that camouflages barely veiled racist sentiments that the bubble was predicated by black and Hispanic borrowing , rather than flippers and specuvestors looking to make a quick buck .
Above all else , make sure the “ individual responsibility ” rhetoric is n’t targeted at the larger failures of a system that flooded the market with cheap dollars , used deceptive lending tactics to fool people into expensive loans , and funnels billions to banks that took big risks while foreclosures continue to soar .
Like I said in the title , there is a housing bailout going on , but the bailing out is n’t being done for consumers–it ’s being done by them , at their expense .
Last night , I took to the floor of the House of Representatives and outlined our case as to why this Congress must hold immediate hearings on Rep. Kucinich ’s Articles of Impeachment .
I did n’t do it alone : I was armed with nearly 200,000 signatures of support from you and so many others .
Please watch the video of this speech and forward it to as many people as possible .
I 've posted it on the front page of www.WexlerWantsHearings.com
This morning , I delivered letters to all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives , urging them to support Cheney Impeachment Hearings .
You can read a copy of both the letter to my colleagues as well as the letter to Chairman Conyers I am asking them to sign at :
http://www.wexlerforcongress.com/news.asp?ItemID=230
Additionally , I have delivered to my colleagues in the Judiciary Committee a list of names who have signed up at www.WexlerWantsHearings.com .
We now have almost 200,000 patriotic Americans dedicated to this cause .
We are beginning to make some progress .
I have urged the Democratic Leadership to enforce the subpoenas being ignored by Harriet Miers and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten by holding them in contempt of Congress .
This fight is not over .
You must continue the pressure on your representatives and the media , or Congress will take no notice .
That would be a historic mistake – one we must prevent Congress from making .
We stand at a critical juncture in our efforts .
Forget all of those arguments that it is too late or that we have run out of time .
You ca n’t run the clock out on our Constitution .
Those of us dedicated to this fight – Rep. Dennis Kucinich , the online community , and millions of patriotic Americans – will keep the pressure on .
I will be furiously lobbying my fellow members of Congress to get behind these efforts and sign onto my letter to Chairman Conyers .
Please continue to spread the word and help deliver accountability to the corrupt Bush - Cheney administration .

As many people are starting to realised TV - Link , a site which linked to TV programmes of many types , has been shut down and the man behind it arrested .
Details were reported last Friday , with FACT ( Federation Against Copyright Theft ) being behind the action .
The site had been a firm favourite with those at Digital - Lifestyles , as it made available content that just is n’t available anywhere else .
To those of you who lived through the original rise of music sharing services , you ’ll be experiencing a total sense of Deja-vu .
One of the major reasons that people resorted to using music sharing sites was that they could n’t get access to the music in any other way .
Many wanted to pay for the content , but just could n’t get it .
The industry shouted ‘ FOUL !’ because they saw it as theft of their content .
The users responded with , “ What do you expect ? ”
Having to resort to sharing network eventually bred a culture amoung the young that music did n’t have to get paid for – it ’s the only way the knew when they grew up .
It ’s just stunning to see that the TV and film world have n’t sorted themselves out by making their programmes available for people to watch online – in the time between then and now .
The end result ?
People are bypassing the owners of the content and going to any source where they can find the programmes .
Hence the rise of sites like TV - Link and AllUC .
Again we ’ll see large media organisations shouting “ FOUL ! ” and insisting that “ Something must be done about this . ”
If they had n’t spent so much time worrying about trying to get DRM working – treating their customers a thieves – and more time getting the content ready to be available to their customers , they might not have been in this position .
Potentially it ’s too late for the TV business to change like the music business is finally starting to do .
How many times does this have to be said before big business understands ?
–
Technology is a steam roller , if you do n’t get on board , you ’ll end up getting crushed .

A [ url=http://forums.thedailywtf.com/forums/p/7509/139904.aspx#139904]while[/url] ago I promised a story / rant about
Microsoft translators .
Well , here it is .
I 'm not sure if the issue I describe is known stuff , or whether it is
appropriate to the forum , or if it 's too long , so " AS IS " , etc .
You probably know that Microsoft distributes a lot of localized Windows ( and not just Windows , obviously ) versions .
Of course , it is nice to see the strings translated to your native tongue , especially if you do n't know English at all .
But sometimes , translators go too far .
A relatively benign example is that they translate program names .
Well , " Звукозапись " ( or " Фонограф " , as it was in Win95 ) is somewhat more intelligible that " Sound Recorder " , but " Проигрыватель Windows Media " ?
Why did n't they translate " Internet Explorer " ( since " Explorer " is " Проводник " ) , or , for that matter , " Windows " ?
Still , that 's only mildly amusing , and I can live with it .
But sometimes the translators poke their noses where they really should n't .
For example , the messages that were shown by Windows 98 bootloader if something went wrong were " localized " .
Well , the Cyrillic font obviously is n't loaded at this stage , so all that came out was the unintelligible mess of accented characters and symbols for the artist - formerly - known - as - Prince .
And the Windows XP bluescreens ( at least in SP1 ) made the same mistake .
Yeah , I 'm very happy that ïðîèçîøëà êðèòè÷åñêàÿ îøèáêà .
Anyway , bluescreens do n't happen very often , and I can live with it .
( That was just the foreword , the actual story follows .
8 = ] )
Circa 1996 , I had a computer ( wow ! ) .
And it had the übercool OS installed on it — Windows 95 !
And it was really cool ( I mean , I was just a kid back then ) .
Well , besides such cool things as Paint and Wordpad , I had a certain [ url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Gods_%28video_game%29]game[/url].
And it was ( you guess it ) cool .
And that 's about all about this period .
But circa 2001 , an upgrade happened .
And one of the consequences was that the trusty Windows 95 was replaced by Windows 98 .
Which was cool , but not so much .
Months passed and I remembered The Game .
Anticipating hours of fun gameplay , I installed it , but when I tried to launch it , it popped up a strange dialog : " To play War Gods you must close all other CD applications and insert the game CD .
Retry / Cancel ? "
I scratched my head and went on to verify that CD is , in fact , in the cupholder , and that no other applications are accessing it , or , for that matter , are running .
After realizing the futility of repeatedly clicking the Retry button , I was reduced to watching the demo mode , which was entertaining , but not as entertaining ( and cool ) , as , say , [ i] playing [ / i ] the game .
Afterwards , I uninstalled it and started exploring some other game .
PowerPoint , probably .
The upgrade to Windows Me , which happened soon , did n't help the situation .
The upgrade to Windows XP , which happened not - so - soon , did n't either .
Fast - forward to 2006 .
By this point I already had an Internet connection and my programming knowledge was growing exponentially .
After I learned some x86 assembly , I suddenly thought : Hey !
I 'm a 1ee7 cr@xx0r now !
I can look into the game disassembly and find the bug which prevents me from kicking ass !
So I grabbed a [ url=http://www.ollydbg.de/]debugger[/url] and plunged into the realm of teh machine codez .
By setting a breakpoint on the MessageBox function call , I quickly located the CD binding code .
Here begins the interesting part .
The game talked to Windows using MCI ( [ url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms709461(VS.85).aspx]Media Control Interface [ /url ] ) .
Basically , it sent a string and received a string in return .
The first command issued was < font face = " Courier New " > status cdaudio ready < / font > , and the response was < font face = " Courier New " > true </ font > , since the drive was indeed ready .
The game was happy with it and proceeded to request another bit of detail : < font face = " Courier New " > status cdaudio media present </ font > .
The response was identical and the game displayed curiosity again with < font face = " Courier New " > status cdaudio number of tracks </ font > .
To my surprise , the answer was < font face = " Courier New " >15</font >!
After some head - scratching , I opened Windows Media Player and realized that the game data was on the first track , while the rest were music from the game .
The game agreed that 15 tracks is just enough and then entered an interesting loop for < font face = " Courier New " >i</ font > = 1 to 15 .
In each iteration the value of < font face = " Courier New " > i</ font > was substituted into < font face = " Courier New " > status cdaudio type track % u</ font > , and subsequently executed .
This command is [ url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms713277(VS.85).aspx]supposed[/url] to return either < font face = " Courier New " > audio </ font > or < font face = " Courier New " > other < / font > , depending on the track type .
Imagine my surprise when it returned some garbage string instead !
In the first iteration , this string was deemed unequal to " audio " and thus OK ; however the garbage of the second iteration was expected be be equal to " audio " , and thus the check for authencity failed .
Fine , I found the culprit , but what now ?
Windows is buggy ?
Since you 've read the intro , you probably guessed the problem already , but I was flabbergasted .
Not knowing what to do , I hacked together a simple VB program to experiment with MCI commands .
Since I possess supreme C skillz now , I present you a C equivalent :
#include < stdio.h > # include < wchar.h > # include < locale.h >
# define UNICODE #include < windows.h> # define BUFSIZE 1024 wchar_t inbuf [ BUFSIZE ] , outbuf [ BUFSIZE ] ; int main ( ) { setlocale ( LC_ALL , " " ) ; while ( fgetws ( inbuf , BUFSIZE , stdin ) ) { MCIERROR err ; size_t len = wcslen ( inbuf ) ; if ( inbuf [ len - 1 ] == L '
') inbuf [len - 1 ] = L'\0 ' ; err = mciSendString ( inbuf , outbuf , BUFSIZE , NULL ) ; if ( err == 0 ) fwprintf ( stdout , L " %s
" , outbuf ) ; else if ( mciGetErrorString ( err , outbuf , BUFSIZE ) ) fwprintf ( stdout , L " %s
" , outbuf ) ; else fputws ( L" WTF ?
" , stderr ) ; } return 0 ; }
I punched in the same commands as the game did :
status cdaudio ready true status cdaudio media present true status cdaudio number of tracks 15 status cdaudio type track 1 [ b ] друго й [ /b ] status cdaudio type track 2 [ b ] ауди о [ / b]
[ b] ZOMGWTFBBQROTFLMAOP&PIMP face 'o'table !!1 ! [ i ]
They translated the [ u ] MAGIC STRING [ /u ] ?!? 17 !?!?! seventy one ?!?!?!? [ / i] [ / b]
When the stream of profanity run out , I opened the game executable and overwrote the magic string " audio " with the sorta- magic string " аудио " , and the message box nagged me no more .

A 1922 political cartoon on the British invasion of Iraq .
In the 1920 ’s , Britain imposed a H?shimite monarchy on Iraq and defined the territorial limits of Iraq without taking into account the politics of the different ethnic and religious groups in the country , in particular those of the Kurds and the Assyrians to the north .
During the British occupation , the Shi’ites and Kurds fought for independence .

In the first chapter of The Descent of Man , Charles Darwin identified roughly a dozen anatomic traits that he gleefully described as “ useless , or nearly useless , and consequently no longer subject to natural selection . ”
The list included body hair , wisdom teeth , and the coccyx — superfluous features that served as Exhibit A in his argument that humans did not descend from “ demigods ” but rather from a long line of fur - insulated , plant - chewing creatures that sported tails .
Darwin ’s catalog of oddities was far from complete — our bodies are littered with parts we do n’t need .
Some are vanishing leftovers from our prehominid ancestors , such as muscles useful for walking on all fours or hanging from trees that appear in various atrophied forms .
Others are by - products of a natural redundancy inherent in human sexual development , including nipples on men and the tiny vestigial sperm ducts lurking behind the ovaries of women .
Then there are curiosities that , having outlived their apparent usefulness , linger simply because there ’s no real reason to leave :
What good or bad is hair on the little toe — or even the little toe itself ?
Nearly a century and a quarter after Darwin ’s death , science still can’t offer a full explanation for why one outdated anatomic trait lingers in the gene pool and another goes .
Modern genomics research has revealed that our DNA carries broken genes for things that seem as though they might be useful , like odor receptors for a bloodhound ’s sense of smell or enzymes that once enabled us to make our own vitamin C .
In a few million years , humans may very well have shed a few more odd features .
So look now before they ’re gone .
PARANASAL SINUSES
The nasal sinuses of our early ancestors may have been lined with odor receptors that gave a heightened sense of smell , which aided survival .
No one knows why we retain these perhaps troublesome mucus - lined cavities , except to make the head lighter and to warm and moisten the air we breathe .
A cross section of a skull from the collection of Matthew Cryer , a doctor and dentist whose Internal Anatomy of the Face was published in 1901 , is housed at the Mütter Museum at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia .
Cryer most likely used the skull to analyze the anatomy of paranasal sinuses , which come in four sets : frontal ( in the forehead ) , maxillary ( beneath the cheeks ) , and ethmoid and sphenoid ( behind the nose ) .
In animals with an acute sense of smell , the sinuses are largely lined by olfactory tissue .

A tiny pit on each side of the septum is lined with nonfunctioning chemoreceptors .
They may be all that remains of a once extensive pheromone - detecting ability .
Extrinsic Ear Muscles
This trio of muscles most likely made it possible for prehominids to move their ears independently of their heads , as rabbits and dogs do .
We still have them , which is why most people can learn to wiggle their ears .
Wisdom Teeth
Early humans had to chew a lot of plants to get enough calories to survive , making another row of molars helpful .
Only about 5 percent of the population has a healthy set of these third molars .
Neck Rib
A set of cervical ribs — possibly leftovers from the age of reptiles — still appear in less than 1 percent of the population .
They often cause nerve and artery problems .
Third Eyelid
A common ancestor of birds and mammals may have had a membrane for protecting the eye and sweeping out debris .
Humans retain only a tiny fold in the inner corner of the eye .
Darwin's Point
A small folded point of skin toward the top of each ear is occasionally found in modern humans .
It may be a remnant of a larger shape that helped focus distant sounds .
Subclavius Muscle
This small muscle stretching under the shoulder from the first rib to the collarbone would be useful if humans still walked on all fours .
Some people have one , some have none , and a few have two .
Palmaris Muscle
This long , narrow muscle runs from the elbow to the wrist and is missing in 11 percent of modern humans .
It may once have been important for hanging and climbing .
Surgeons harvest it for reconstructive surgery .
Male Nipples
Lactiferous ducts form well before testosterone causes sex differentiation in a fetus .
Men have mammary tissue that can be stimulated to produce milk .
Erector Pili
Bundles of smooth muscle fibers allow animals to puff up their fur for insulation or to intimidate others .
Humans retain this ability ( goose bumps are the indicator ) but have obviously lost most of the fur .
Appendix
This narrow , muscular tube attached to the large intestine served as a special area to digest cellulose when the human diet consisted more of plant matter than animal protein .
It also produces some white blood cells .
Annually , more than 300,000 Americans have an appendectomy .
Body Hair
Brows help keep sweat from the eyes , and male facial hair may play a role in sexual selection , but apparently most of the hair left on the human body serves no function .
Plantaris Muscle
Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students , the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet .
It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population .
Thirteenth Rib
Our closest cousins , chimpanzees and gorillas , have an extra set of ribs .
Most of us have 12 , but 8 percent of adults have the extras .
Male Uterus
A remnant of an undeveloped female reproductive organ hangs off the male prostate gland .
Fifth Toe
Lesser apes use all their toes for grasping or clinging to branches .
Humans need mainly the big toe for balance while walking upright .
Female Vas Deferens
What might become sperm ducts in males become the epoophoron in females , a cluster of useless dead - end tubules near the ovaries .
Pyramidalis Muscle
More than 20 percent of us lack this tiny , triangular pouchlike muscle that attaches to the pubic bone .
It may be a relic from pouched marsupials .
Coccyx
These fused vertebrae are all that ’s left of the tail that most mammals still use for balance and communication .
Our hominid ancestors lost the need for a tail before they began walking upright .
The exposed tailbone of a male pelvis from the collection of 19th - century anatomist George McClellan rests on a humble seat at the Mütter Museum .
The human coccyx is highly variable but is generally composed of three to five vertebrae .
On rare occasions , infants are born either with no coccyx at all or with tails .
While some have suggested that the coccyx helps to anchor minor muscles and may support pelvic organs , surgically removing it has no discernible effect on health .
Below the top twenty :
It was quite a good year for filmed nudity , and that caused some worthwhile entries to miss the top 20 .
Here are some , but by no means all , of my favorites among the also - rans .
Three worth noting : Laetitia Casta made the top twenty for her performance in Le Grand Appartement , but that was just because she 's Laetitia Casta , and was stark naked in the movie .
I actually enjoyed Stephanie Pasterkamp 's scene much more .
Jimmy and Judy was a movie that came out too late in 2006 to draw significant notice on last year 's list , and got only a single vote .
It would have done better if we had saved it for the 2007 list .
I would guess it was a sure Top 20 .
( To avoid repeating this problem , I have decided to save Ang Lee 's new film for the 2008 list . )
In addition , I really expected Catalina Moreno , acclaimed star of Maria , Full of Grace , to make the top twenty for her full - frontal performance in The Hottest State , but she narrowly missed .
A few screen veterans returned to nudity after long absences :
Some years ago , Laura Harring was the dark - haired partner for Naomi Watts ' lesbian scenes in Mulholland Drive .
All but forgotten since then , she flashed some flesh in 2007 in Ghost Son .
Some years ago , Jane March performed in two of the most erotic mainstream films of all time , The Color of Night and The Lover .
Her career petered out , but she returned to nudity this year in The Stone Merchant .
Joan Severance is surely in the film nudity Hall of Fame , but is now approaching 50 and had not added to her nudography in about a decade before 2007's Sex and Consequences .
Priscilla Barnes is another 50ish actress who demonstrated she still has it in Sex Sells .
Lucy
Liu did some nudity before she hit the A - list in those Charlie 's Angels movies , but she stopped when she hit it big .
2007 was her naked comeback year with Rise : Blood Hunter .
Gabrielle Anwar 's only previous nudity had been way back in 1993 , in Body Snatchers .
After a 14 - year hiatus , she took off her shirt for 9 _Tenths .
Melanie Lynskey had not shown her substantial sweater - fillers since Heavenly Creatures , but returned to form in the obscure Park .
A few of the celebrity nudity veterans did scenes which just fell short of top 20 material : Nicole Kidman showed her shapely bum for the umpteenth time in Fur.
Former supermodel Amber Valetta showed some acting chops to go with her breasts in The Last Time .
Roselyn Sanchez always seems just a hair short of breaking through to stardom , but never quite makes it .
She demonstrated a variety of different talents in Yellow , which she also produced .
Eva Mendes is already a star and seems just about ready to burst through as a superstar .
She flashed a breast in We Own the Night .
Since every human being on the planet has seen Bai Ling 's breasts , or at least her nipples , she had no problem showing them again in Shanghai Baby .
Lowbrow comedies produced their usual outpouring of sexy material : Epic Movie was considerably less than its title promised , but Audra Lynn did a nice full frontal scene .
Sophie Monk came just short of the full monty in Sex_and_Death_101 .
Other sexy laughs were delivered by Irina Voronina in Reno 911 , Malin Akerman in The Heartbreak Kid , Chelan Simmons in Good Luck Chuck , and Laura Niles in a wild threesome on TV's Californication .
Finally , our rookie of the year came from this category .
Nicole Rayburn provided some breasts for three different films : Blur , Cougar Club , and her best effort in Kisses and Caroms .
And finally , there 's usually plenty of flesh on view in horror and murder films : Olivia Wilde stood out in Alpha Dog. Megan Brown was a sexy victim for Mr. Brooks .
Another murder victim , Kristina Klebe , did full frontal and rear nudity in Rob Zombie 's Halloween .
And Nicole Wilder did some nice full body nudity in one of the strangest horror films of the year , The Tripper , in which the killer was The Gipper .
Special Mention and Gold Stars :
There were three films released in 2007 which have better celebrity nudity than most if not all of the top twenty .
They are limited release films , and not known to a wide spectrum of our voters .
But we can't fail to mention them .
* Valeria Golino in Il Sole Nero ( 3.9 at IMDb ) Charlie 's French Cinema Nudity site reported that Valeria was totally naked and seen from every angle for approximately the first five minutes of this film .
* Asia Argento in The Last Mistress ( 6.5 at IMDb ) Asia needed some airbrushing on her enormous and distinctive abdominal tattoo to present herself as a 19 century aristocrat in this typically explicit film from Catherine Breillat .
Of course , that was balanced off by her rather anachronistic breast implants .
* Wei Tang in Lust , Caution ( 8.1 at IMDb ) Director Ang Lee ( Crouching Tiger ) always delivers a film which looks beautiful , and this deliberate , NC - 17 thriller is no exception .
On to the winners :
20t Radha Mitchell in Feast of Love ( 6.7 at IMDb )
She has delivered some brief nudity before , but it always seemed like a tease .
The tease is now officially over .
She delivered the goods in Feast of Love .
20t Vera Farmiga in Never Forever ( 5.2 at IMDb ) Turning 30 liberated her .
Before that birthday : no nudity .
Since then : enough nude scenes in a short enough time to make Nastassja Kinski envious .
18t Ally Walker in Tell Me You Love Me Despite the impressive sex scenes performed by her co-stars , it seemed that Ally could n't possibly make this list .
Her character was not having sex with her husband .
Then she had a great breakthrough at the end of the series and the couple got it on with some hot mutual masturbation .
18t Monica Bellucci in The Stone Council ( 4.7 on IMDb )
If I had to name the single sexiest woman in the world today , Monica would certainly make my short list , but she deliberately de-glammed for this role .
You can see to the right how butt - ugly she looked .
17 Ashley Judd in Bug ( 6.2 at IMDb )
This is a weird , low - budget arthouse film which is virtually unknown , despite having been directed by William Friedkin of The Exorcist fame .
But no film slips past our voters if a big Hollywood star gets naked from head to toe .
15t Jaime Murray on Dexter Dexter did not get a running start in the nudity department , but once Jamie started removing her top there was no stopping her .
Our voters noticed that , and could n't help but notice that she 's mighty fine !
There 's not much meat on her bones , but what 's there is prime .
15t Laetitia Casta in Le Grand Appartement ( 5.6 at IMDb )
Since the 1990's , we have always had some flood protection algorithms built into our polling process , but they 've never identified any suspicious balloting until this year .
Laetitia got only 13 of the first 450 ballots , then suddenly got almost all of the next 50 !
If we ignored the necessary statistical corrections , this scene would have finished third in the balloting , but that brief surge of votes was eliminated and La Casta finished tied for 15th .
Somebody really wanted her to win .
Then again , look at her .
Who could blame him ?
14 Sonya Walger in Tell Me You Love Me
All three of this show 's young stars made the top 20 .
Sonya may have had the least memorable sex scenes of the three , but she had the most memorable cup size .
13 Carice van Houten in Black Book ( 8.0 at IMDb )
As you probably know , this annual list is based on a poll , not my personal opinion .
If the list consisted of my own choices , this would probably be the top theatrical film .
It places lower on the list because it's in Dutch and German and is virtually unknown in the States .
My case :
It has a beautiful and talented star .
She 's frequently naked .
The photography is gorgeous .
The film is terrific , both profound and entertaining ( a rare combo ) .
And it 's one of the best film roles ever written for a woman .
' nuff said
12 Julianne Nicholson in Flannel Pajamas ( 5.4 at IMDb )
You say you never heard of this film ?
Then you ought to be impressed that it finished this high .
If it 's an obscure film with a poor IMDb rating and an unknown star , you can bet that a top twenty finish involves some copious nudity , including full frontals .
11 Lena Headey in 300 ( 8.0 at IMDb )
She 's been turning in excellent performances in worthwhile films since 1992 , many of them naked , yet few people outside the UK had any idea who she was .
It took just one $ 200 million blockbuster to make the world aware of her almost overnight .
10 Sienna Miller in Factory Girl ( 6.1 at IMDb )
When King John signed the Magna Carta , he agreed that there would always be one female A - list celebrity in the UK who would remain clothing - free , both off and on " ye stage . "
When Elizabeth Hurley finally stepped down from this role in the past two years , Sienna Miller was only too happy to pick up the gauntlet .
9 Keeley Hazell in Cashback ( 7.6 at IMDb )
What you see to the right is what you get .
That 's pretty much the entire scene .
And since neither the film nor Keeley is widely known outside the UK , the otherwise inexplicably high ranking for this scene means one thing : men love big breasts .
But you already knew that , did n't you ?
8 Alice Henley in Rome Season 2 , Episode 9
When an unknown actress makes the top ten list , you know the scene ought to be good , and it is .
And there were also other great scenes , featuring other actresses , in that same episode .
( See film clips below . )
This scene was rated second among the TV entrants , and might have remained the best TV nude scene ever created for a non-exploitation production , except that Tell Me You Love Me came along a few months later and changed the rules completely .
7 Heather Graham in Adrift in Manhattan ( 5.1 at IMDb ) Sometimes it bothers me that the voters in this poll inevitably seem to vote for the popularity of the stars rather than the actual quality of the nude scenes , but in this case I was willing to make an exception .
This is a hot scene , and the fact that it 's the perennially adorable Rollergirl makes it even hotter .
6 Gillian Anderson in Straightheads ( 5.8 at IMDb ) Agent Scully did a topless scene in The Turning , before her X - Files days , but this was the first one she has done since she left the TV scene .
That means 15 years passed between nude scenes .
We are hoping that they start to come more frequently .
5 Madeline Zima in Californication
If these polls have taught me anything over the years , it 's that people love the first time a star gets naked , and they love it even more when the star is someone who grew up before their eyes on TV or in films .
That combination of elements has won this poll in the past for such actresses as Katie Holmes and Christina Ricci .
This year it assured top five finishes for Natalie Portman and Madeline Zima .
Having noted that , let 's acknowledge that the poll result is n't hurt any when the former child actress grows up to have a shape like this !
4 Michelle Borth in Tell Me You Love Me
This was the top rated television scene , and was the effort that got my personal vote .
Michelle got naked many times in the run of the series , and my guess is that her sex scenes were not faked .
If they were , it was an impressive impersonation .
( See one example to the right , and many , many film clips below . )
Whether the sex was real or just a convincing simulation , Tell Me You Love Me definitely raised the bar for adult content in legitimate cable dramas .
3 Natalie Portman in Hotel Chevalier ( 7.4 at IMDB )
If this scene had been performed by anyone else but Natalie Portman , it would not have received a single vote .
There 's nothing to see except two peeks at her butt from oblique angles .
( Although it is a very sexy bottom indeed . )
The high ranking reflects the immense reach of her own personal popularity .
( NOTE : Hotel Chevalier is a 13 - minute short which precedes The Darjeeling Limited . )
2 Marisa Tomei in Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead ( 8.1 at IMDb )
This marks two recent nude scenes for Marisa after a previous lifetime of abstinence .
I do n't know if she is going to follow the Laura Linney Tao of Nudity ( stay fully dressed until 40ish , then never wear clothes again ) , but I hope so .
For a while at least .

Republican strategists work on calibrating approach aimed at protecting the party against charges of being racist or sexist .
| Composite image by POLITICO GOP fears charges of racism , sexism
Top Republican strategists are working on plans to protect the GOP from charges of racism or sexism in the general election , as they prepare for a presidential campaign against the first ever African - American or female Democratic nominee .
The Republican National Committee has commissioned polling and focus groups to determine the boundaries of attacking a minority or female candidate , according to people involved .
The secretive effort underscores the enormous risk senior GOP operatives see for a party often criticized for its insensitivity to minorities in campaigns dating back to the 1960s .
Advertisement
The RNC project is viewed as so sensitive that those involved in the work were reluctant to discuss the findings in detail .
But one Republican strategist , who asked that his name be withheld to speak candidly , said the research shows the daunting and delicate task ahead .
Republicans will be told to “ be sensitive to tone and stick to the substance of the discussion ” and that “ the key is that you have to be sensitive to the fact that you are running against historic firsts , ” the strategist explained .
In other words , Republicans should expect a severe backlash if they say or do anything that smacks of politicizing race or gender .
They did n’t need an expensive poll to learn that lesson , however .
They could simply have asked Joe Biden , John Edwards , Bill Clinton or any number of Democratic politicians who stung over their choice of words in this campaign already .
GOP officials are certain their words will be scrutinized ever more aggressively .
They anticipate a regular media barrage of accusations of intolerance – or much worse .
They seem most concerned about Obama right now .
“ You ca n’t run against Barack Obama the way you could run against Bill Clinton , Al Gore or John Kerry , ” said Jack Kemp , the 1996 GOP vice presidential nominee , who expressed concern that the party could be reduced to an “ all white country club party ” if it does not tread cautiously .
“ Being an African American at the top of the ticket , if he makes it , is such a great statement about the country , ” he added , “ Obviously you have to be sensitive to issues that affect urban America .
… You have to be careful . ”
GOP operatives have already coined a term for clumsy rhetoric : “ undisciplined messaging . ”
It appears as a bullet point in a Power Point presentation making the rounds among major donors , party leaders and surrogates .
The presentation outlines five main strategic attacks against an Obama candidacy , with one of them stating how “ undisciplined messaging carries great risk . ”
“ Republicans will need to exercise less deafness and more deftness in dealing with a different looking candidate , whether it is a woman or a black man , ” Republican strategist Kellyanne Conway said .
“ But at the same time , really charge back at any insinuation or accusation of sexism or racism .
“ You ca n’t allow the party to be Macaca - ed , ” she continued , referring to a much - publicized remark made by former GOP Sen .
George Allen that played a significant role in his 2006 defeat .
“ I think the standards are higher and the bar is lower for the Republican Party . ”
Republicans interviewed for this story uniformly believe they will have to be especially careful .
Many expect to be held to a higher rhetorical standard than is customary in campaigns , in part because of perceptions of intolerance that still dog the party .
“ Fair or unfair , but that ’s going to be a reality , ” said GOP strategist John Weaver , a longtime confidant of John McCain .
“ The P.C. [ politically correct ] police will be out and the standards will be very narrow . ”
The McCain camp is only beginning to explore this dilemma , aides said .
McCain ’s strategic team still lacks survey research on either of their likely opponents in the general election , inhibiting their capacity “ to discuss it intelligently , ” a top adviser said .
The campaign is currently occupied with “ getting our act together structurally . ”
“ But my basic thought on it is that McCain is not much of a negative campaigner anyhow , ” the advisor said .
“ When he does get into debates with people it ’s on issues , substance .
So I do n’t think we are going to have to train our candidate not to insult people . ”
The potential for mischief reaches well beyond any “ undisciplined messaging ” that the Republican nominee might engage in .
In the case of the Clinton campaign , it has been the surrogates – like former President Clinton – who have been the source of much of the blowback for imprudent language .
“ What I would not do is do what Bill Clinton has done , ” said Ed Rollins , Mike Huckabee ’s campaign chairman .
“ I would not in any way , shape , or form trivialize the strength of an Obama or compare him to another candidate . ”
But some on the right are equally wary of unnecessary timidity .
According to their thinking , the Democratic candidate begins as the frontrunner in the general election – and that will compel the Republican Party and its nominee to run a fiercely aggressive campaign .
“ If we approach this campaign from the standpoint that we need to take political sensitivity training because one candidate is a woman or one candidate is black , I think we are approaching it from the wrong standpoint because that already handcuffs us , ” said Republican strategist Tony Fabrizio .
“ If McCain is afraid , or shies away from taking on Obama because that ’s what they worry about , then they ’ve lost the battle to begin with . ”
WINNING PROJECTS FROM THE FELLOWSHIP BAPTIST CREATION SCIENCE FAIR 2001
– FROM THE ARCHIVE –
Elementary School Level :
1st Place : “ My Uncle Is A Man Named Steve ( Not A Monkey ) ”
Cassidy Turnbull ( grade five ) presented her uncle , Steve .
She also showed photographs of monkeys and invited fairgoers to note the differences between her uncle and the monkeys .
She tried to feed her uncle bananas , but he declined to eat them .
Cassidy has conclusively shown that her uncle is no monkey .
2nd Place : “ Pine Cones Are Complicated ”
David Block and Trevor Murry ( grades four ) showed how specifically complicated pine cones are and how they reveal God ’s design in nature .
Middle School Level :
1st Place : “ Life Does n’t Come From Non-Life ”
Patricia Lewis ( grade eight ) did an experiment to see if life can evolve from non-life .
Patricia placed all the non-living ingredients of life – carbon ( a charcoal briquet ) , purified water , and assorted minerals ( a multi- vitamin ) – into a sealed glass jar .
The jar was left undisturbed , being exposed only to sunlight , for three weeks .
( Patricia also prayed to God not to do anything miraculous during the course of the experiment , so as not to disqualify the findings . )
No life evolved .
This shows that life cannot come from non-life through natural processes .
2nd Place : “ Women Were Designed For Homemaking ”
Jonathan Goode ( grade seven ) applied findings from many fields of science to support his conclusion that God designed women for homemaking : physics shows that women have a lower center of gravity than men , making them more suited to carrying groceries and laundry baskets ; biology shows that women were designed to carry un - born babies in their wombs and to feed born babies milk , making them the natural choice for child rearing ; social sciences show that the wages for women workers are lower than for normal workers , meaning that they are unable to work as well and thus earn equal pay ; and exegetics shows that God created Eve as a companion for Adam , not as a co-worker .
High School Level :
1st Place : “ Using Prayer To Microevolve Latent Antibiotic Resistance In Bacteria ”
Eileen Hyde and Lynda Morgan ( grades ten & eleven ) did a project showing how the power of prayer can unlock the latent genes in bacteria , allowing them to microevolve antibiotic resistance .
Escherichia coli bacteria cultured in agar filled petri dishes were subjected to the antibiotics tetracycline and chlorotetracycline .
The bacteria cultures were divided into two groups , one group ( A ) received prayer while the other ( B ) did n’t .
The prayer was as follows : “ Dear Lord , please allow the bacteria in Group A to unlock the antibiotic - resistant genes that You saw fit to give them at the time of Creation .
Amen . ”
The process was repeated for five generations , with the prayer being given at the start of each generation .
In the end , Group A was significantly more resistant than Group B to both antibiotics .
2nd Place : “ Maximal Packing Of Rodentia Kinds : A Feasibility Study ”
Jason Spinter ’s ( grade twelve ) project was to show the feasibility of Noah ’s Ark using a Rodentia research model ( made of a mixture of hamsters and gerbils ) as a representative of diluvian life forms .
The Rodentia were placed in a cage with dimensions proportional to a section of the Ark .
The number of Rodentia used ( 58 ) was calculated using available Creation Science research and was based on the median animal size and their volumetric distribution in the Ark .
The cage was also fitted with wooden dowels inserted at regular intervals through the cage walls , forming platforms which provided support for the Rodentia .
Although there was little room left in the cage , all Rodentia were able to move just enough to ward off muscle atrophy .
Food pellets and water were delivered to sub-surface Rodentia via plastic drinking straws inserted into the Rodentia - mass , which also served to allow internal air flow .
Once a day , the cage was sprayed with water to cleanse any built - up waste .
Additionally , the cage was suspended on bungee cords to simulate the rocking motion of a ship .
The study lasted 30 days and 30 nights , with all Rodentia surviving at least long enough afterwards to allow for reproduction .
These findings strongly suggest that Noah ’s Ark could hold and support representatives of all antediluvian animal kinds for the duration of the Flood and subsequent repopulation of the Earth .
Honorable Mention :
“ Geocentrism : Politically Incorrect ” – Richard Cody ( grade nine )
“ Young Earth , Old Lies ” – Melvin Knuth & Glenna Reher ( grade eleven )
“ Thermodynamics Of Hell Fire ” – Tom Williamson ( grade twelve )
Sony ’s PlayStation 3 has everything a gamer / geek needs : Linux compatibility , blockbuster games , Blu-ray , and the ability to render interactive 3D models in real - time — dynamic lighting effects included .

This is by no means an exhaustive list -- here are some more of the classic kisses :
Socratic kiss really a Platonic kiss , but it 's claimed to be the Socratic technique so it'll sound more authoritative ; however , compared to most strictly Platonic kisses , Socratic kisses wander around a lot more and cover more ground .
Kantian kiss a kiss that , eschewing inferior " phenomenal " contact , is performed entirely on the superior " noumenal " plane ; though you do n't actually feel it at all , you are , nonetheless , free to declare it the best kiss you 've ever given or received .
Kafkaesque kiss a kiss that starts out feeling like it's about to transform you but ends up just bugging you .
Sartrean kiss a kiss that you worry yourself to death about even though it really does n't matter anyway .
Russell - Whiteheadian kiss a formal kiss in which each lip and tongue movement is rigorously and completely defined , even though it ends up seeming incomplete somehow .
Hertzsprung - Russellian kiss Oh , Be A Fine Girl / Guy , Kiss Me. Pythagorean kiss a kiss given by someone who has developed some new and wonderful techniques but refuses to use them on anyone for fear that others would find out about them and copy them .
Cartesian kiss a particularly well - planned and coordinated movement : " I think , therefore , I aim . "
In general , a kiss does not count as Cartesian unless it is applied with enough force to remove all doubt that one has been kissed .
( cf. Polar kiss , a more well - rounded movement involving greater nose - to - nose contact , but colder overall . )
Heisenbergian kiss a hard - to - define kiss -- the more it moves you , the less sure you are of where the kiss was ; the more energy it has , the more trouble you have figuring out how long it lasted .
Extreme versions of this type of kiss are known as " virtual kisses " because the level of uncertainty is so high that you 're not quite sure if you were kissed or not .
Virtual kisses have the advantage , however , that you need not have anyone else in the room with you to enjoy them .
Nietzscheian kiss " she / he who does not kiss you , makes your lust stronger . "
Epimenidian kiss a kiss given by someone who does not kiss .
Grouchoic kiss a kiss given by someone who will only kiss those who would not kiss him or her .
Harpoic kiss shut up and kiss me .
Zenoian kiss your lips approach , closer and closer , but never actually touch .
Procrustean kiss suffice it to say that it is a technique that , once you 've experienced it , you 'll never forget it , especially when applied to areas of the anatomy other than the lips .

On May 10th , 1933 , university students and German citizens burned 25,000 volumes of books deemed ‘ un - German ’ , as nationalist students marched in torchlight parades “ against the un-German spirit . ”
The scripted rituals called for high Nazi officials , professors , rectors , and student leaders to address the participants and spectators .
At the meeting places , students threw the pillaged and unwanted books into the bonfires with great joyous ceremony , band - playing , songs , “ fire oaths , ” and incantations .
Un -German Literature is Sorted Out for the Book - Burning Ceremony
Book Burning Ceremony : Against the Un - German Spirit ( 1933 )
Flock 1.0 have been out for a while now , and I ’ve been using it as my primary browser , both on the laptop and on my workstation , for a few days now .
These are my impressions .
The Social Web Browser
First of all , Flock markets itself as a social web browser , and integrates with a number of social services , such as Facebook , Twitter , del.icio.us , YouTube , Flickr , Blogger , TypePad , WordPress.com , and so on .
The list is extensive , but far from complete .
Where ’s Jaiku , MySpace , Digg , and so on ?
Maybe that ’ll arrive later on .
The social stuff works in a few different ways .
For instance , your media browser opens between your tabs and the toolbars , while the People sidebar handles text - based social services , such as Facebook or Twitter .
This means that you can check out what your Facebook friends are doing , or post tweets , right in the sidebar in Flock .
Nothing particularly new for people used to pimping their Firefox installs with wicked extensions , but still cool and nifty .
Get Blogging
There ’s support for publishing to both blogging services such as Blogger and WordPress.com , but also self - hosted blogs .
The blog writing tool is easily configured and pretty accessible , just a button in the small social toolbar ( configured in my screenshots ) to the top left .
It looks nice enough , with a wysiwyg editor , and the opportunity to edit the code .
I ’ve done a few posts with it , and it does the job , but this one ’s not for me .
Sure , it ’s very handy to have a blog editor in your browser , when reading something that pisses you off and makes you want to rant , but at the same time I can see a lot of weird things happening , especially if you have multiple blogs .
A post could be published on the wrong blog , for instance , and I doubt the Devlounge readers would like to get the recent big black latino asses I ’ve scavenged from the web .
Not that I ’m into that sort of thing , of course …
Seriously , I can see the blog posting tool working out for a lot of users .
It ’s not for me though , but it ’s there and that ’s fine .
Web Clips and Bookmarks
The web clips , however , could be something I got around using .
It ’s another sidebar , to which you can drag text , links or images , for latter use .
Just mark the text , or drag the image , and drop it in that little box , and it ’s stored in the sidebar , easy to access .
I have n’t gotten used to doing this yet , but I ’ll definitely give it a go and see if this is something that works in the long run .
Bookmarks ’ got support for del.icio.us of course .
At first I looked around after that nifty little tagging button that the del.icio.us plugin gives you for Firefox ( and others ) , but could n’t find it .
Well , turns out that all I had to do was bookmark a page , and I got a nice little dialog asking me how I wanted to store my bookmark .
Very nice , and great for someone like me as well , who use both del.icio.us , and the bookmark bar , as you can see from the screenshots .
Not 100 % Bug Free
Speaking of the bookmarks bar , among the few bugs I ’ve encountered , there ’s this cute little thing .
“ Pownce ” is a bookmark added to the bar , but as you can see there ’s spacing before the first letter ( it ’s hovered in the screenshot ) .
This occurs every now and then when you create or drag a bookmark to the bookmarks bar , but there ’s nothing visual to remove when editing it .
Delete and redo .
An annoying , but not very dangerous , little bug .
Worse is the URL bug .
Sometimes the URL field just is n’t updated , so I can surf Twitter , and suddenly realize that I ’m over at some unknown person ’s Twitter page , but the URL still says twitter .com / rethord .
If I mark this and press enter , it loads twitter .com / rethord as well , so it ’s not just a visual thing .
Surfing via links or bookmarks while this occurs works as usual , but it ’s really annoying .
Hopefully this is something they ’ll come to terms with pretty soon .
Can You Browse The Web With It ?
So how ’s the browsing then ?
Well , Flock is built on the same engine as Firefox ( Gecko ) and seems to render everything the same way .
The browser is responsive and fast , and it does n’t seem to leak memory in the same crazy manner that Firefox does ( or used to do , it ’s gotten better , although it still hogs those valuable megabytes ) .
I ’ve yet to experience a crash as well , which is very positive .
However , despite Flock being based on the same engine as Firefox , your old extensions for the latter wo n’t work .
That means no Firebug , which means that Flock still have a way to go before it really can push Firefox out of the way for web developers out there .
Likewise , extensions available for Flock is a mere nothing compared to what ’s out there for Firefox , which tweakers are sure to dislike .
For now , Flock is my default browser – a great verdict by itself .
At least when just browsing the web , sending e-mails , doing social stuff , and for blogging research .
When it comes to development , I need my Firebug extension and then I ’ll boot up Firefox again .
Check it out over at flock.com , and make sure you take the tour if you want to learn more .

His plan : Beam it down from balloons hovering at the edge of space .
This is n't just hot air .
His company , Space Data Corp. , already launches 10 balloons a day across the Southern U.S. , providing specialized telecom services to truckers and oil companies .
His balloons soar 20 miles into the stratosphere , each carrying a shoebox - size payload of electronics that acts like a mini cellphone " tower " covering thousands of square miles ...

Do n’t you love the days following a rainstorm ?
The streets seem to gleam , the air is cleaner , and people are generally in a better mood to finally see the sun again .

The slats on these benches can rotate to the dry side by cranking the handle .

Not every migraine has a prologue or “ aura , ” and not every aura is followed by a headache .
Nevertheless , these overtures to pain or isolated events are the most peculiar aspect of the illness and may offer insights into the nature of perception itself .
As a child I had what I called “ lifting feelings . ”
Every once in a while , I had a powerful internal sensation of being pulled upward , as if my head were rising , even though I knew my feet had n’t left the ground .
This lift was accompanied by what can only be called awe — a feeling of transcendence .
I variously interpreted these elevations as divine ( God was calling ) or as an amazed connection to things in the world .
Everything appeared strange and wondrous .
The lights came later in my life — showers of stars that begin on one side , usually the right , sharp black points surrounded by shining light that cascade downward and then move toward the center of my vision or brilliant lights surrounded by black rings or just tiny black spots swimming in air .
I ’ve had fogs and gray spots that make it hard to see what ’s in front of me , weird holes in my vision , and a sensation that there ’s a heavy cloud in my head .
I ’ve had feelings of euphoria that are indescribably wonderful and supernatural exhaustion — a weariness unlike any other I ’ve experienced , a pull toward sleep that is irresistible .
Sometimes I have fits of yawning that I can’t stop .
Also , often just before I wake up with a migraine , I have an aphasia dream .
I am trying to speak , but my lips wo n’t form the words and every utterance is terribly distorted .
But my most remarkable pre-migraine event was hallucinatory .
I was lying in bed reading a book by Italo Svevo , and for some reason , looked down , and there they were : a small pink man and his pink ox , perhaps six or seven inches high .
They were perfectly made creatures and , except for their color , they looked very real .
They did n’t speak to me , but they walked around , and I watched them with fascination and a kind of amiable tenderness .
They stayed for some minutes and then disappeared .
I have often wished they would return , but they never have .
Lilliputian hallucinations before migraine are rare .
There are other documented cases , however .
The neurologist Klaus Podoll , who will soon be contributing to this site , has written about a woman who during her migraine attacks sees amusing little beetles with faces that run across her floor and ceiling .
Another reported case involved tiny Indians , and yet another , a dwarf .
It was n’t until after my duo had vanished that I understood I had seen a miniature version of two legendary , oversized characters from my childhood in Minnesota : Paul Bunyon and his blue ox , Babe .
The giant man and his huge animal that I had read about in stories had shrunk dramatically and turned pink .
It was then that I asked myself about the content of the hallucination .
What did it mean that my aura took that form , rather than something else ?
Are these visions purely nonsensical ?
What memory traces are activated during these experiences ?
A man I met in the hospital , where I teach a writing class to psychiatric inpatients , told me that he had hallucinated little green men getting into a space ship during a psychotic episode .
This stereotypical vision of Martians appeared during his crisis , but unlike most of the migraineurs I ’ve read about , he found his little aliens disturbing .
Psychosis , alcoholism , dementia , epilepsy , and hallucinogens like LSD can all produce neurological disturbances that conjure tiny , life - size , or gigantic persons and animals , as can a disorder called Charles Bonnet syndrome , often but not always associated with deteriorating vision .
In his book “ Phantoms in the Brain , ” the neurologist V.S. Ramachandran reports that during a conversation he had with one of his patients , she told him that she saw little cartoon characters scooting up his arms .
Why Paul Bunyan ?
Why Martians ?
Why cartoon characters ?
Oddly , all of these visions have a folkloric quality , more contemporary versions of the mythological little people around the world : leprachauns , brownies , fairies , gnomes , goblins , Nordic nisse and tomten , the Hawaian Menehune , the Greek kalikauzari , the Cherokee yumwi .
Where did all these wee folk come from ?
The recognizable content of these hallucinations must surely be at once personal and cultural .
My dear little creatures were migrainous figments , aura products similar to other experiences of complex visual hallucinations , which although they may have various medical causes , bear a resemblance to one another and no doubt have some neurobiological connection .
As Oliver Sacks points out in his book , “ Migraine , ” we all hallucinate in our sleep .
We generate dream images and stories that are often peculiar , violate the laws of physics , and are highly emotional .
But why we dream remains a scientific mystery .
Sigmund Freud proposed that dreams protect sleep .
Mark Solms , a neurologist and sleep researcher , agrees .
In a recent e-mail message to me , he wrote : “ Patients who lose the ability to dream due to brain damage suffer from sleep - maintenance insomnia — they have difficulty staying asleep . ”
We human beings may have a need to create stimulating imagery that keeps us busy while we ’re in that parallel state and the waking world has vanished .
Another ordinary form of spontaneous mental images are hypnogogic hallucinations , which appear on the threshold between sleeping and waking .
I had always believed that the brilliant mutating images I see as I drift off every night are universal , but I have since discovered that while common , not everyone falls asleep to visions .
I am deeply attached to my pre-sleep cinema of ghouls and monsters , shifting faces and bodies that grow and shrink , to my own nameless cartoon characters who flee over mountain tops or jump into lakes , to the brilliant colors that explode or bleed into gorgeous geometries , to the gyrating dancers and erotic performers that entertain me while I am still conscious but falling toward Morpheus .
Except as a spectator , I play no role in this lunatic borderland .
It is a world distinct from that of my dreams , in which I am always an actor , and therefore it is more closely allied to my Lilliputian experience .
I watched them , but I felt no need to interact with them .
They were simply there for my viewing pleasure .
It is comforting to think that visual perception is a matter of taking in what ’s out there , that a clear line exists between “ seeing things ” and the everyday experience of looking .
In fact , this is not how normal vision works .
Our minds are not passive containers of external reality or experience .
Evidence suggests that what we see is a combination of sensory information coming in from the outside , which has been dynamically translated or decoded in our brains through both our expectations of what it is we are looking at and our human ability to create coherent images .
We do n’t just digest the world ; we make it .
For example we all have a blind spot in each eye at the place where the optic nerve enters the retina , but we do n’t sense that hole because our minds automatically fill it in .
As Dr. Ramachandran and the philosopher Patricia Churchland have argued , “ filling in ” is n’t always the covering over of a blank with more of the same ; there are instances when the brain provides pictures — a normal form of hallucination .
Dr. Sacks points out in his earlier post that our perception relies on “ the self - organizing activity ” of huge numbers of neurons in the visual cortex .
The patterns and geometric forms that recur in so many cultures may well be inherent to the human mind — a clue to how we parse the world of images .
From this perspective , abstraction precedes figuration .
More elaborate hallucinatory pictures of landscapes , people , and animals seem to call on both visual memories and interpretation ( the language areas of the brain ) .
Who are those guys ?
They must be Martians .
What seems certain , however , is that , for the mind , absence can be a catalyst for presence .
In his beautiful memoir , “ And There Was Light , ” Jacques Lusseyran describes his experience of the world after he went blind at age eight : “ Light threw its color on things and on people .
My father and mother , the people I met or ran into in the street , all had their characteristic color which I had never seen before I went blind .
Yet now this special attribute impressed itself on me as part of them as definitely as any impression created by a face . ”
For Lusseyran , losing his vision became an avenue to almost mystical insight .
He found himself lifted up into a world of color and light drenched with meaning .
A lot of research had been done on visual perception .
Scientists have isolated cells in particular areas of the seeing parts of the brain that serve special functions : the recognition of verticality , color , and motion , for example , but mysteries remain .
Philosophers , neuroscientists , and cognitive scientists argue madly over “ the binding problem ” — how an object can appear whole and unified to us when each of its features is channeled through disparate networks in the brain .
Qualia — the subjective experiences of things — are just as controversial .
I do n’t see a consensus coming any time soon .
Migraine auras of light , color , black holes and fogs , of high feeling and dread , and of peculiar little creatures that run or dance or just amble about occupy a special place in the medical literature .
They are anomalies , no doubt , tics of the nervous system that affect some , not all , but they could well help explain more general human qualities — who we are , what we feel , and how we see .
I suspect that everyone has a few Lilliputians in hiding .
It may be just a question of whether they pop out or not .

The World from Berlin No ' Swiss Cheese ' for the Palestinians
President Bush went to Israel this week and sketched a vision of peace -- including a " contiguous " Palestinian state that wo n't resemble " Swiss cheese . "
Can he really achieve that with just one remaining year in his final term in the White House ?
He compared himself to Ronald Reagan challenging Gerald R. Ford for the Republican nomination in 1976 .
“ He was the pariah of the party , ” he said .
“ Now people love Ronald Reagan . ”
On the Democratic side , after being in Washington on Friday , Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama switched coasts on Saturday , campaigning in Maine , which holds its caucuses on Sunday .
Both then headed to Virginia where they were due to address about 4,000 Democratic officials and activists Saturday night at the state party ’s annual Jefferson - Jackson day fund - raiser .
The dinner stands as a major barometer of support among the state ’s most dedicated Democrats with the two candidates virtually deadlocked in their quest for national convention delegates three days before Mid-Atlantic neighbors Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia hold their primaries .
Then comes a brief intermission , followed by a string of election nights , some crowded , some not .
The date of March 4 looms large , with 370 delegates in primaries in Ohio , Texas , Rhode Island and Vermont .
In Louisiana meanwhile , exit polls showed about one in five voters said gender was an important factor in their vote in the historic Democratic contest to nominate either the first black or first woman for president , The Associated Press reported .
About as many said the same thing about race .
Of those whites who said race was an issue in their vote , almost 9 in 10 of them voted for Mrs. Clinton , while blacks who said it was important voted 9 in 10 for Mr. Obama .
The racial gap in Louisiana was more extreme than in many other states this year : 9 in 10 blacks voted for Mr. Obama , while 7 in 10 whites voted for Mrs. Clinton .
Unlike previous Democratic contests , there was apparently no significant gender gap , with men and women voting in similar ways , even across races .
Mrs. Clinton won the votes of most white men , a group she has lost to Obama in some states but has tended to win in the South .
Those women who said gender was important to their vote went 6 in 10 for Mrs. Clinton , while women who said gender was n’t important went 6 in 10 for Mr. Obama .
Voters over 50 years old were much more likely than those under 50 to say they were looking for a candidate with experience , and those looking for experience voted overwhelmingly for Mrs. Clinton .
While older whites favored change and experience about evenly , more than half of younger whites favored a candidate who would bring about needed change .
But even though Mr. Obama tends to be associated with change in this campaign , most younger whites voted for Mrs. Clinton instead of Obama .
Blacks of all ages favored change , and they voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Obama .
Most younger voters were black , while most older voters were white .

" ... assessment of terrorist risks persuaded the White House to remake the program as a permanent feature of ' the new reality , based on what the threat looks like , ' a senior decisionmaker said . "
Implementation of COG Was Kept Hidden from Congress
Key congressional leaders say they did n’t know President Bush had established a “ shadow government , ” moving dozens of senior civilian managers to secret underground locations outside Washington to ensure that the federal government could survive a devastating terrorist attack on the nation 's capital , The Washington Post says in its Saturday editions .
Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle ( D - S.D. ) told the Post he had not been informed by the White House about the role , location or even the existence of the shadow government that the administration began to deploy the morning of the Sept. 11 hijackings .
An aide to House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt ( D - Mo. ) said he was also unaware of the administration 's move .
Among Congress 's GOP leadership , aides to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert ( Ill. ) , second in line to succeed the president if he became incapacitated , and to Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott ( Miss . ) said they were not sure whether they knew .
Aides to Sen. Robert C. Byrd ( D - W. Va. ) said he had not been told .
As Senate president pro tempore , he is in line to become president after the House speaker .
Continuity of Government ( " COG " ) measuresimplemented on 9/11 .
For example , according to the 9/11 Commission Report , at page 38 : Likewise , page 326 of the Report states :
See also footnotes cited therein and this webpage
You might assume that the COG measures ceased soon after 9/11 .
However , CNN reports that -- 6 months later -- Similarly , the Washington Post stated in March 2002 that " the shadow government has evolved into an indefinite precaution . "
The same article goes on to state :
As a CBS article makes clear , virtually none of the Congressional leadership knew that the COG had been implemented or was still in existence as of March 2002 : Similarly , the above - cited CNN article states :
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , D - South Dakota , said Friday he can't say much about the plan .
" We have not been informed at all about the role of the shadow government or its whereabouts or what particular responsibilities they have and when they would kick in , but we look forward to work with the administration to get additional information on that . "
a few months ago
How They Might Have Maintained COG to the Present
Indeed , - in summer 2007 - Congressman Peter DeFazio , on the Homeland Security Committee ( and so with proper security access to be briefed on COG issues ) , inquired about continuity of government plans , and was refused access .
Indeed , DeFazio told Congress that the entire Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. Congress has been denied access to the plans by the White House ( video ; or here is the transcript ) .
DeFazio concluded : " Maybe the people who think there ’s a conspiracy out there are right ” .
But could the White House have maintained COG operations to the present day ?
One hint may be contained in the above - cited CNN article :
continuously
While I have no direct evidence that the COG is still in effect , the fact that key players have said that the measures would be permanent , the
continuous exaggeration
by the administration
of major terrorist threats , and the
that the COG measures are still in effect all argue for their continued existence .
If they are still in effect , it could help explain
Indeed , COG measures can
.
It is well - documented that the administration has been crying wolf about looming terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda ever since 9/11 .
By claiming that Washington is the target of a major strike , the Neocons may have been able to maintain the COG and the " shadow government " ever since 9/11 .
One of the most amazing episodes in modern American journalism has emerged from a flagrantly inaccurate and misguided Time magazine column by Joe Klein .
He ’s a political writer whose work in this case may become Exhibit A for what ’s wrong with the craft today .
Klein ’s column attacked congressional Democrats ’ effort to pass electronic surveillance legislation that would restrain the Bush administration ’s wish for essentially no restraints or oversight whatever .
In his piece , Klein got some vital facts dead wrong , giving a totally misleading message to his readers .
Needless to say , bloggers and others who care about truth and the Constitution jumped on this outrageous stuff .
No one did a better job than Salon ’s Glenn Greenwald , who pointed out the misstatements in great detail .
Klein , obviously responding to Greenwald ( though never saying so ) , defended himself without actually dealing with the actual facts — and even more amazingly asserted that telecom companies should do whatever the government orders them to do , even if it ’s completely illegal .
Bloggers continued to attack both the original piece and his absurd justifications .
Then Klein sort of , kind of admitted error in a follow - up — though he made obvious something even more amazing :
He has n’t read the legislation he attacks .
Meanwhile , neither Klein nor Time has put corrections into the original , flagrantly inaccurate column , which also ran in the print edition .
What makes all this so bad is Time ’s reach and influence .
Millions of people probably read the original .
Very , very few will know , even now , that fundamental premises were false .
Why Time employs Klein is a mystery to me , though I suppose it should n’t be .
He ’s a member of the Washington journalistic establishment , where forgetting reality is all too common .
As Wired News ’ Ryan Singel noted , Klein ’s record includes publicly lying about his anonymous authorship of the novel Primary Colors ( one of the best books of fiction about politics in recent memory , incidentally ) .
Singel then adds , and I agree :
But Time ought to stop Klein from writing about any substantive topic , especially FISA .
Because when it comes to these topics , Klein is well beyond stupid .
He ’s dangerous .
( Corrected : I got Ryan Singel ’s affiliation wrong the first time ; apologies . )
With victories Tuesday in three more elections , Barack Obama has now won 23 of the 35 sanctioned Democratic primaries and caucuses so far .
But he has not yet solved his problem with Mannie Rodriguez .
Rodriguez supports Hillary Rodham Clinton -- and his vote matters more than most .
He is a “ super delegate , ” one of the 796 Democratic Party insiders who will break the tie if neither Obama nor Clinton emerges from the primary balloting with a clear victory , a strong possibility even after Obama ’s wins Tuesday .
Obama ’s task Tuesday was not only to carry Maryland , Virginia and Washington , D.C. -- which he did in dominating fashion -- but to win the argument now emerging among the super delegates over whether and how to use their strength .
And that contest is far from producing a winner .
Advertisement
Rodriguez , a party official from Colorado , reserves the right to back Clinton , no matter that Colorado and a majority of other states have so far chosen Obama .
“ I do not go with the candidate who is always winning .
I go with the candidate I believe in , ” he wrote recently to a voter who asked how he could side against the Democratic voters in his own state .
Dan Parker , chairman of the state party in Indiana and a super delegate , feels just as strongly -- even though his state will not vote until May .
“ I have made my decision , and I am supporting Sen. Clinton , and that is not going to change , ” Parker said .

Even as the primary schedule rolls on -- Wisconsin and Hawaii vote next Tuesday -- the campaigns are devoting a huge amount of energy to gaining the upper hand in the private conversation among the super delegates , most of whom are members of Congress or party officials .
Clinton has won pledges from just over 200 super delegates so far , and Obama from about 150 , according to unscientific media tallies .
The super delegates can change their allegiance at any time .
In a breakthrough for Obama , his victories Tuesday pushed him ahead for the first time in the race for delegates overall , according to an Associated Press tally .
Obama is certain to use his victories in Tuesday ’s so - called Potomac primaries to try to change the minds of super delegates such as Parker and Rodriguez by building the case that the party ’s elite insiders would set off angry protests if they overturned the will of the voters .
Advertisement
The strength of Obama ’s winning coalition Tuesday could help him in that effort .
In Virginia , for example , which many had considered Clinton ’s best shot at an upset , Obama won 90 % of the black vote and 52 % of the white vote , according to exit polls cited by the Associated Press .
He also won in Virginia among women , Latinos and lower - income voters -- constituencies that have been key for Clinton .
That counts as a significant achievement for Obama , who had built many of his prior victories with a much smaller share of white and female voters .

Some super delegates are already saying that the party insiders should be wary of overturning the collective decision of rank - and - file Democratic voters .
“ My one vote should n’t matter more than a voter who stood in a long line in the rain in St. Louis to vote , ” said Donna Brazile , a party strategist and super delegate who has threatened to quit her post with the Democratic National Committee if super delegates decide the race .
At the same time , the Tuesday results will only add fuel to a debate over how to measure whether Obama or Clinton is leading in the primary balloting .
In the absence of a clear - cut winner , complex rules mean there are several ways to determine who is ahead .
Advertisement
To win the nomination , a candidate has to win a majority of the more than 4,000 delegates who will convene at the party ’s nominating convention in Denver this summer .
Both campaigns have already acknowledged that , when all the primary and caucus voting ends in June , neither Clinton nor Obama is likely to have enough delegates to clinch the nomination .
In that case , victory would have to come from the votes of super delegates .
With his decisive wins Tuesday , Obama moves closer to building a large lead in one measure of success : the number of so - called “ pledged delegates . ”
Advertisement
These are the delegates who are selected according to the vote in each state .
Aides to Obama said he had emerged from the races in Maryland , Virginia and Washington with so many of these delegates that Clinton would not catch up unless she won overwhelming victories in the March 4 contests in Texas and Ohio , and in Pennsylvania in April , the next large , delegate - rich states considered favorable ground for her .
And the Obama camp has said that whoever has the most pledged delegates will be the nominee , signaling that they will apply enormous public pressure to the super delegates to fall in line .
Some super delegates are backing the Obama campaign ’s claim that the party insiders should throw their support to whoever wins the most pledged delegates .
Advertisement
“ The super delegates will vote for whoever is in the lead ” among pledged delegates , said Colorado restaurateur Debbie Marquez , a super delegate who backs Obama .
The Clinton campaign has focused instead on the overall delegate count , a consequence of its lead among the super delegates .
Tuesday ’s results make that argument even harder for the Clinton campaign , now that Obama has surpassed her in the overall count .
Other Clinton allies are saying that super delegates should look to another measure : whoever has won the popular vote .
Because many of Obama ’s victories have come in states that hold nominating caucuses , which draw a far smaller number of participants than do primary elections , Obama could emerge from the primary season with the most delegates , but Clinton could emerge as the leader in the popular vote .
Advertisement
“ Just because you have more pledged delegates does n’t mean you ’ve won more votes , ” said Parker , the Indiana chairman .
California ’s Democratic Party chairman , Art Torres , said Tuesday that he remained an uncommitted super delegate .
But he predicted that he and his cohorts would have to consider the ramifications of siding against their local constituencies .
“ Woe to the person who goes against the political will for their own selfish interests , ” Torres said .
Some insiders , eager to avoid a showdown over the super delegates ’ role , expect that pressure will mount on Clinton to concede if she does not win in Ohio and Texas next month and in Pennsylvania in April .
Advertisement
“ If they lose Ohio , Texas or Pennsylvania , or all three , then I think that would really create a great deal of pressure on Hillary Clinton to try to take a step toward unifying the party , ” said Leon Panetta , a Clinton supporter who was chief of staff in former President Bill Clinton ’s White House .
But , he added , the people running Clinton ’s campaign will be loath to pull out .
“ They ’re going to do everything possible to play this out to the convention , ” Panetta said .

A friend of mine wanted to copy some files from an iTunes playlist to an external drive , but iTunes would n't allow her to simply let these files being dragged to the intended destination folder in Finder .
She asked me what she could do about it .
I thought about it for a minute , knowing that it would n't work with iTunes alone - but I realized that it 's probably simple to code a solution .
Even better than having a separate standalone application for it , I figured I could write a new FUSE file system - making use of the excellent MacFUSE OSXFUSE macFUSE project !
Enter iTunesFS , a FUSEOFS based file system for your Mac , which makes all your iTunes playlists available in Finder !
And not only that … as you can see in the screenshot below , version 1.1 adds support for iPods in the very same manner !
Now you can easily copy content of your iTunes library and your iPods in Finder or the Terminal - ideal for , err , backing up specific content .
Whatever .
As noted by Peter da Silva , the above statement is n't really true for current ( 7.x ) iTunes versions .
In fact , these versions allow you to drag files from playlists to mounted filesystems , effectively making them copyable via drag and drop .
However , this still is n't true for mounted iPods within iTunes .
Also , the playlist ordering wo n't be preserved by doing so , thus using iTunesFS still has quite a lot of advantages .
Dr Williams made his comments in a BBC radio interview
Dr Williams interview
Dr Rowan Williams said the UK had to " face up to the fact " some citizens did not relate to the UK legal system .
Culture Secretary Andy Burnham said such moves would create " social chaos . "
But Bishop of Hulme , the Rt Rev Stephen Lowe , criticised the " disgraceful " way in which the archbishop had been " ridiculed " and " lampooned " by some .
" We have probably one of the greatest and the brightest archbishops of Canterbury we have had for many a long day , " he said .
Taken aback
The robust defence follows criticism of Dr Williams in some circles .
The BBC understands from sources who work on Christian - Muslim interfaith issues that the Dr Williams has faced a barrage of criticism from within the Church and has been genuinely taken aback by how his words were received .
Islamic Sharia law is a legal and social code designed to help Muslims live their daily lives , but it has proved controversial in the West for the extreme nature of some of its punishments .
[ The ] implication that British courts should treat people differently based on their faith is divisive and dangerous
Trevor Phillips
Equality and Human Rights Commission
Reaction in quotes : Sharia law Profile : Rowan Williams
Dr Rowan Williams told BBC Radio 4 on Thursday that he believed the adoption of some Sharia law in the UK seemed " unavoidable " .
He said adopting parts of Islamic Sharia law could help social cohesion .
For example , Muslims could choose to have marital disputes or financial matters dealt with in a Sharia court .
But Gordon Brown 's spokesman said the prime minister " believes that British laws should be based on British values " .
He added that Mr Brown had a good relationship with the archbishop , who was perfectly entitled to express his views .
Shaista Gohir , a government advisor on Muslim women and director of Muslim Voice UK , said she did not believe there was a need for Sharia courts because " the majority of Muslims do not want it " .
SHARIA LAW Sharia law is Islam 's legal system
It is derived from the Koran and the life of the prophet Mohammed Sharia rulings help Muslims understand how they should lead their lives A formal legal ruling is called a fatwa
In the West , Sharia courts deal mainly with family and business issues English law recognises religious courts as a means of arbitration
Q and A : Sharia law explained
She told BBC News : " Many Muslim commentators and the media are wrongly assuming that all Muslims want Sharia law in the UK .
" Various polls have so far indicated that around 40 % want Sharia law .
Although this is a significant percentage , why ignore the views of the other 60 % ? "
Following the archbishop 's comments , Home Office Minister Tony McNulty said : " To ask us to fundamentally change the rule of law and to adopt Sharia law , I think , is fundamentally wrong . "
Shadow community cohesion minister Baroness Warsi told BBC News 24 : " Dr Williams seems to be suggesting that there should be two systems of law , running alongside each other , almost parallel , and for people to be offered the choice of opting into one or the other .
That is unacceptable . "
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said he had " an enormous amount of respect " for Dr Williams , but could not agree with him on this issue .
He said : " Equality before the law is part of the glue that binds our society together .
We cannot have a situation where there is one law for one person and different laws for another . "

Trevor Phillips , who chairs the Equality and Human Rights Commission , said the " implication that British courts should treat people differently based on their faith is divisive and dangerous " .
In an interview with BBC correspondent Christopher Landau , Dr Williams said Muslims should not have to choose between " the stark alternatives of cultural loyalty or state loyalty " .
He stressed " nobody in their right mind would want to see in this country the kind of inhumanity that 's sometimes been associated with the practice of the law in some Islamic states ; the extreme punishments , the attitudes to women as well " .
' Respect and tolerance '
But Dr Williams said an approach to law which simply said " there 's one law for everybody and that 's all there is " was dangerous .
Under English law , people may devise their own way to settle a dispute in front of an agreed third party as long as both sides agree to the process .
HAVE YOUR SAY
There is , and should only be , one law which covers all people and to suggest it can be otherwise is to seriously damage our rights Patricia London , UK
Muslim Sharia courts and Orthodox Jewish courts which already exist in the UK come into this category .
Dilwar Hussain of the Islamic Foundation , an influential think - tank on Muslims in Europe , said non-Muslims needed to be reassured that nobody wanted to invent a new legal system .
He said : " Most Muslims are perfectly happy with the legal system as it exists in the UK .
They support it .
It protects them , it includes provisions for Halal food and for banking services .
In other words , some of the most important things that concern people are already there in the system .
" We are not seeking the introduction of a new system - absolutely not .
But there are some areas , issues around families for example , where many Muslims would like to be able to find solutions according to what they believe .
That is not incompatible with our law . "
Ibrahim Mogra , of the Muslim Council of Britain , said : " We 're looking at a very small aspect of Sharia for Muslim families when they choose to be governed with regards to their marriage , divorce , inheritance , custody of children and so forth .
" Let 's debate this issue .
It is very complex .
It is not as straight forward as saying that we will have a system here . "

An Obstacle for Women in the IT Industry

When early on I was warning that XML is an unnecessary regression to the bad old days of hierarchic databases ( see several articles in my Against the Grain series ) , one of its proponents argued that I was missing XML 's point :
" XML is just a nice , little low - level technique which has some nice properties at the current state of technology for transmitting data ... [ it ] was developed for entirely physical purposes : to provide a fairly rich and adaptable format for sending small collections of data between systems in a way that has some nice performance characteristics ( readable , lo-tech , integrates with URLs , etc. ) . "
But whatever the original intent of XML inventors , absent foundational knowledge , it was just a matter of time before the industry would do what it usually does -- extend technology or products to unintended areas , for which they are ill suited .
So the current resident fad is XML databases and DBMSs , a bandwagon that the press , always eager for new advertising sources , promptly jumped on .
In a January Network World Fusion article " Working Out the Bugs in XML Databases , " for example , John Cox sees " a growing belief that XML - based information needs its own database . "
" As network executives begin to experiment with Web services , they 're likely to find that they need a new kind of data store : the XML database .
These software products are designed to efficiently store and manage the growing numbers of XML documents that users are creating , especially in Web interactions with business partners and customers .
Advocates cite several advantages of XML databases compared with traditional databases : simplicity , ease of application development , ability to search and query XML documents , and fast document retrieval . "
" These software products " are DBMSs , not databases .
Anyway , Cox has it backwards , of course : XML DBMSs are more " traditional " then he realizes .
Like most trade journalists , who have no understanding of data fundamentals , he is unaware that XML DBMSs are a throwback to the old hierarchic DBMSs , predominant decades ago and discarded precisely because they were complex , inflexible and difficult for application development , the exact opposite of what is now being claimed for their XML reincarnation :
Note : Here 's an excerpt from the manual for IBM's old IMS hierarchic DBMS ( brought to my attention by Chris Date ) : " Logically deleting a logical child prevents further access to the logical child using its logical parent .
Unidirectional logical child segments are assumed to be logically deleted .
A logical parent is considered logically deleted when all its logical children are physically deleted .
For physically paired logical relationships , the physical child paired to the logical child must also be physically deleted before the logical parent is considered logically deleted . "
" There 's no formal , standard definition of an XML database , although the XML : DB Initiative describes such a database as one that defines a logical model for an XML document ( not for the data in the document ) , and manages documents based on that model .
The key point is the database ' thinks and acts ' based on XML - XML goes in , and XML comes out , even though these products can physically store the documents in an object or relational database or a proprietary storage model , such as indexed files . "
I wonder how a DBMS ( not database ! ) can " think and act based on XML " without a formal precise definition of an XML data model ?
Nevertheless ,
Cox considers relational DBMSs , which do have a precise formal logical foundation , just physical storage managers for XML documents , and XML products , which do n't have one , DBMSs .
Go figure .
Obviously , Cox does not understand the important distinction between files and databases , and is unaware that the latter are the technological progress that replaced the former .
Neither does he appreciate the difference between data and documents from a logical perpective ( see next ) .
" The lack of formal definition is just one issue that raises the hackles of critics .
They also point to the immaturity of the products and of XML standards ; the absence of a standard , reliable query language to match the SQL used in relational databases ; and possible data integrity problems .
Relational vendors are also adding better support for XML .
For example , Microsoft is developing the Yukon release of SQL Server .
Oracle demonstrated to customers in December a technology called Project XDB .
The goal of both projects is to let the databases treat XML documents as a new data type and manage them as they now work with relational data and objects . "
The hierarchic approach underlying XML does , in fact , have a formal foundation : graph theory .
But as the XML 1.0 specification explicitly states , it does not adhere to to the theory .
The reason is the same as that for which old hierarchic database management ( e.g. , IBM 's IMS ) eschewed the theory too : it is extremely complex .
What is more , the real world is not thoroughly hierarchic , but the hierarchic approach can handle only hierarchies .
This means that hierarchy and its complexity must be hoisted upon any and all database representations , whether justified ( e.g. organizational , or bill - of - material structures ) or , as is more often the case , not .
Since the relational approach can handle both non-hierarchic and hierarchic data in a formal and much simpler way ( see Chapter 7 in my Practical Issues in Database Management , what exactly is the advantage of the hierarchic approach underlying XML ?
And what kind of product " maturity " and query language " reliability " can be expected in the absence of a theoretical foundation ?
Here 's Hugh Darwen on the so - called " XML query algebra " : " Now , my eyes light up at the word " algebra " ...
Originally , I understood it to mean a set of operations that are closed over some type .
That is , every operation in X Algebra operates on zero or more values of type X and returns a value of type X . Hence , set algebra , Boolean algebra , relational algebra and the algebra of numbers that gives us arithmetic .
Over what is the XML Query Algebra closed ?
Nobody has ever given me an answer that makes sense ( apart from the occasional , honest " I do n't know " ) . "
But it 's integrity ( which Cox mentions only in passing , without amplifying on ) that makes XML databases a highly questionable proposition .
The meaning of a database is in its schema ( what Cox refers to as a formal logical definition ) , and a schema is nothing but the sum total of integrity constraints on the data ( see Chapter X in my book ) .
The fact is that XML did not initially provide any support for integrity , without which database management is meaningless ( see below ) .
" If I had an Oracle ( relational ) database , I 'd want to really know what 's going in the background to handle XML , " says Larry Hanson , data architect for the California Board of Equalization ( BOE ) ... " if you store these documents as objects , for example , can you query them , and tag them ? "
Oracle claims that these actions will be possible with XDB but how well the technology performs when processing lots of data or very large data sets remains to be seen . "
Note how terminology is thrown around with disregard as to meaning :
Oracle is not a RDBMS , only a SQL DBMS -- big difference !
Where do " objects " fit in a ( supposedly relational ) SQL DBMS ?
Are " objects " a physical storage , not a logical model construct ?
If so , what is logical level in object database management ?
What kind of integrity and queries do tags per-se permit ?
e.g. how does the DBMS know whether the data -- the content of a document -- is valid ?
And if it does not know , how reliable is the data and how meaningful are the answers it produces ?
As to performance , text files are not exactly a recipe for maximizing it .
Hanson 's point , echoed by others , is that XML data is fundamentally different from relational data .
" XML data are extremely well - suited to hierarchical storage , " says Hanson , who is a former database administrator .
" In XML databases , an online tax return can be stored in its entirety .
In a relational database , each line of the return would have to be a different table [ of data in rows and columns ] .
" Trying to " force fit " an XML document into the rigid relational structure can waste storage space and lead to inefficiencies in queries and retrievals . "
Data is not intrinsically relational or XML .
Any data can be represented either relationally , or in XML documents ( see Chapter 1 in my book ) .
In either case the underlying data model -- relational or hierarchic -- is purely logical .
Logical representations that users see should be insulated from physical storage details .
SQL , ODBMS and XML fail to to provide adequate insulation , contributing to the logical - physical confusion so rampant in the industry ( including academia : see Denormalization for Performance - Et Tu Academia ?.
It is almost impossible to find arguments not corrupted by it ( see The Logical Physical Confusion .
The table representation of lines in a tax return ( logical ) has nothing to do with how the data is stored ( physical ) , so the notion of relational " force - fitting " is pure bunk ( Ironically , as mentioned above , it 's actually XML that force - fits hierarchy on all data , although this has nothing to do with physical storage either ) .
If there are any " inefficiencies in queries and retrievals " , they have nothing to do with relational technology at the logical level and everything to do with physical implementation details of SQL databases and DBMSs .
" Companies are finding that new applications such as Web services , which are built on XML , tend to have data models [ sic ] that do n't map well to traditional relational structures , " says Philippe Gelinas , CEO of software developer Xiasoft , which developed the TextML Server for XML documents .
" Often customers try to make these applications work first with an existing [ relational ] database and find it does n't work , " he says .
" Then they shop for an XML database . "
That is only because customers do not possess the necessary foundational knowledge , and succumb to industry hype , particularly that by XML vendors with a text / publishing background who know very little , if anything , about database management .

EPA chief sits and takes his punishment Boxer lambastes Johnson over refusing waiver
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , holds tape which covered correspondence the committee received from the EPA during a hearing of the committee on Capitol Hill in Washington , Thursday , Jan. 24 , 2008 , to discuss California 's request for a greenhouse gas waiver .

Environmental Protection Agency chief Stephen Johnson faced a blistering critique from lawmakers and governors Thursday for rejecting California 's attempt to set the nation 's most stringent greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks .
At his first appearance before Congress since denying California 's request for a waiver to enforce its new rules , Johnson was hit from all sides .
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley , a Democrat , called the EPA chief 's decision " shameful , outrageous and irresponsible . "
Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas , a Republican , said the ruling infringes on states ' rights and undercuts state efforts to fight climate change .
California Sen. Barbara Boxer , who chaired the hearing , accused Johnson of trying to hide documents from Congress showing that he had overruled his staff in denying the waiver last month .
EPA first refused to release the documents , then turned over papers that were mostly whited out .
Finally he allowed Boxer 's staff this week to hand copy them under the eye of EPA lawyers .
" I have never seen such disregard and disrespect by an agency head for Congress and for the committees with the responsibility for oversight of his agency , " Boxer said .
Johnson , an EPA career veteran , attempted a rope - a - dope strategy :
He sat placidly while taking the pounding from lawmakers , then insisted again and again that he'd made the right call .
" While many urged me to approve or deny the California waiver request , I am bound by the criteria in the Clean Air Act , not people 's opinions , " he said .
" My job is to make the right decision , not the easy decision . "
The hearing highlighted the high stakes in the clash between California and the Bush administration over the proposed rules .
Fourteen other states have now adopted California 's standards and four more plan to adopt them - meaning more than half the nation 's population has embraced the state 's tougher regulations for vehicles .
In his testimony , Johnson tried to explain the rationale for his decision :
He said the state did not show the compelling and extraordinary conditions required under the Clean Air Act to grant a waiver because global warming is an international problem and requires global , not a regional , solutions .
" Unlike pollutants covered by other waivers , greenhouse gas emissions harm the environment in California and elsewhere , regardless of where the emissions occur , " he said .
" Therefore , this challenge is not exclusive or unique to California . "
But lawmakers were skeptical of his explanation .
Many said the administration was simply seeking to block the states from taking more aggressive action to combat climate change .
" Your agency 's decision to deny California a waiver just defies logic to me , " said Sen .
Amy Klobuchar , D - Minn .
" And it 's clearly a decision , I believe , that 's based on politics and not on fact . "
Democrats on the committee also seized on documents showing that EPA 's lawyers told Johnson that California could prove that it had compelling and extraordinary conditions because of the impacts of warming on the state , from an increase in wildfires to water shortages to flooding of coastal areas .
" This is what your staff told you , and then you come out and say , ' It does n't meet ... the test for compelling interests , ' " Boxer said .
" You 're walking the American taxpayers into a lawsuit that you are going to lose . "
Johnson argued that it was better for the country to pursue a single national standard - such as the new fuel economy standards , passed by Congress and signed by President Bush last month - instead of what he has called a patchwork approach of regulation by the states .
But several lawmakers took strong issue with his characterization .
Under the Clean Air Act , if California is granted a waiver other states are allowed to adopt the state 's standards .
" The California standards do not threaten us with a regulatory patchwork , " said Sen. Joe Lieberman , independent - Conn. , a chief sponsor of climate change legislation in the Senate .
" Two standards - one applying to the half of the country that chooses to adopt California standards and one applying to the other half - simply do not make a patchwork . "
While the new federal rules would require cars and trucks to get 35 miles per gallon by 2020 , California 's rules would require vehicles to get significantly better mileage : 44 miles per gallon by 2020 .
State officials estimate the California rules would cut greenhouse gases 74 percent more than federal law .
Johnson had only one major ally Thursday : Oklahoma Sen.
James Inhofe , the panel 's ranking member and Congress ' leading climate change skeptic .
He was the only Republican lawmaker to show up at the hearing , which he denounced as political theater .
" The effect that California 's politicians are trying to achieve through this waiver provision is something they cannot achieve through federal legislation - even tighter fuel economy standards than what the Congress passed in the energy bill just last month , " Inhofe said .
Boxer , who has long clashed with Johnson , said she plans to continue an investigation of how he made his decision .
She is requesting e-mails between the White House and EPA , which Johnson said he expects to deliver by Feb. 15 .
Johnson admitted he had spoken with the president and other White House officials , but said the decision was his own .
" I was not directed by anyone , " he said .
Boxer told Johnson his ruling undermines the central role of his agency in protecting public health and the environment .
" You are going against your own agency 's mission and you are fulfilling the mission of some special interests , " she said .
Boxer , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , and 14 other senators introduced a bill late Thursday that would override the EPA and grant the waiver request to California and the other states .
Update :
And if done in the EU we ’d ave you mate .
Update again : Jeremiah is now allowing people to direct questions to Plaxo via his blog .
Well done to him .
Let ’s see how they react to probing questions
Update : Jeremiah basically gave Plaxo a free pulpit where they tried to justify their actions using a smokescreen about a “ Data Trust ” .
Total and utter bollox .
Looks like they are going to roll this out and are unrepentent .
Weâ€ ™re going to have a conversation with Facebook ( that is starting now ) and will roll this feature out .
There ’s a minor , gnat on a rhino ’s arse issue going on around the tech blogger and twitter communities at the moment about data and Facebook .
It will not change the world or unsteady it .
If you are bored by this ( and you should be ) I ’d suggest you skip this post .
If you ’re hardcore tech gossip nerd , then read on .
I really do like Robert Scoble and I do n’t think he is malicious or someone with criminal intent .
Saying that , I do think what he did today is very wrong .
So to begin : A while back Robert Scoble friended anyone on Facebook that wanted to be his friend , like he still does on Twitter .
It was the in - thing that all the coolnerd kids did for a while – Friend the Scobleizer .
Grand I suppose .
Trouble is that the Facebook API allows any application to access the data of people I ’m connected to .
It can suck down their name , date of birth and other bits and pieces but NOT email address .
But then Robert decided he ’d use a new unreleased tool from Plaxo to get the data on all 5000 people connected to him AND their email addresses too .
Name , location , date of birth , full contact details .
Alarm bells yet ?
Facebook ’s security through obscurity meant I had limited protection if data identity thieves wanted to get my details .
But now Robert has an automated tool that took disparate information and combined them .
While many are happy for their data to be scattered about the place , it is through technnology and aggregation that all these pieces which were once scattered or loose are now firmly joined .
This issue is about how weak identity it , but it is also about the fact that this is simply data theft in my view and Robert Scoble , a guy I have a lot of respect for is the one with the crowbar coming into my world taking things I stored on Facebook without permission .
Robert broke into Facebook to get information he was not allowed .
I gave Facebook permission to store my data , I give it to Google .
They give me some lightweight guarantees that they ’ll be careful with it .
Plaxo and I are not friends and they have not asked to hold or transport or fondle my data .
Robert gets rewarded in ways with our friendship by being able to access data but this does n’t mean I wanted him to harvest it .
I ’m ok with some of this information being exported but en masse ?
People are talking about this being a gambit for Data Portability .
That ’s utter bollox .
That ’s a smokescreen .
You can campaign for data portability without stealing .
You can tell me my identity is not secure without accessing my bank account .
This is not some proof of concept on how insecure Facebook is either .
This was a commercial move by Plaxo .
If Google did this or Microsoft they ’re be war .
I ’d like to know what Robert is doing with my contact data and what Plaxo is also doing it it and what they are doing with the other 4,999 names , addresses , phone numbers , dates of birth and email addresses .
I really hope they destroyed it right away .
I ’d also like to know whether Facebook will notify authorities about my data being stolen from them and see are there better ways to protect the data I invested in them ?
I agree 100 % at what Nick Carr said today too .
Dare to a degree too .
“ You had a Rudy Giuliani who wound up not being really competitive , and you had a candidate who emerged on the right , ” said Carl Forti , the Romney campaign ’s political director .
“ When a candidate emerged on the right and with no one to check McCain on the left , it gave him more room to grow , and we were in the middle . ”
Image Mitt Romney with Ann Romney at a conservative conference on Thursday in Washington .
He tried to become a Reagan - like figure through issues like abortion rights and gun control .
Credit ... Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
But in an election cycle in which authenticity is an overriding concern among voters , the perception of Mr. Romney remaking himself into a Reagan - like figure through his positioning on issues like abortion rights and gun control exposed him to biting , often mocking attacks from his rivals , who were almost universal in their scorn of him .
His fellow Republicans used the flip - flopping accusations to reframe everything he did .
Even in the final hours of Mr. Romney ’s candidacy , Mr. McCain was running advertising suggesting Mr. Romney had shifted radically in his view of Ronald Reagan .
The authenticity issue was a problem his advisers recognized early on .
As Mr. Romney was laying the groundwork for his run back in 2006 , Alex Castellanos , one of the campaign ’s chief media strategists , put together a 77 - slide PowerPoint presentation , first reported by The Boston Globe , which listed some of Mr. Romney ’s vulnerabilities , including the perception of him as an ideological panderer , as well as his Mormonism and his inexperience in military affairs .
But his advisers perceived there was a gap in the field for an electable conservative and pounced on that opportunity in recasting Mr. Romney ’s image .
They believed that he could overcome the more moderate views he had espoused in the past as governor of Massachusetts and while running for the Senate in 1994 against Edward M. Kennedy by being up front about his most obvious change on abortion .
They also spotlighted Mr. Romney ’s family , arguing he lived his values and that examining his beliefs up close would reveal that his inner convictions were conservative .
“ Ultimately , we thought if we put everything into the crucible , people would say , ‘ Wait , this guy is conservative , and he ’s honest and straightforward , ’ ” said Alex Gage , Mr. Romney ’s director of strategy .
But Mr. Gage acknowledged that in Mr. Romney ’s rush to beat back the attacks questioning his conservative credentials , he may have swung too far in the other direction , ultimately taking some of the most - pronounced stands against illegal immigration and social issues .
“ Maybe we overcompensated , ” Mr. Gage said .
Competing against far better - known candidates , the campaign ’s strategy from the beginning was to “ win early and often , ” backed by an unprecedented early advertising strategy that resulted in the campaign spending more than $ 30 million on television commercials .
The German press is reporting this morning that there 's been an explosion at Porsche 's factory in Stuttgart where the 911 and many of its variants are built .
Apparently a furnace used for drying coating sheaths was the source of the boom , which set off the sprinkler systems and ground 911 production to a halt .
Reports say production will be down at least 2 - 3 days , which means Porsche could lose about 320 to 480 units of production , not to mention the cost of damage to property .
Fortunately , there were no fatalities , but two Porsche workers were hospitalized with injuries .
As to why the furnace blew up , the cause is unknown at this time .
Automotive News confirms that the explosion happened at Porsche 's spray - painting facility in Zuffenhausen , Germany .

Langley , West Va - ( AssoCIAted Mess ) : Spooks at the President George Herbert Bush Center for Intelligence ( sic ) HQ of the CIA have said that rogue Scientology computer hackers have been bankrolled by Opus Dei to hack into power companies and blackmail entire incontinents .
" Just look at what happened when they put the screws on the French , " a top CIA analyst said today , " the entire financial system blew exposing the massive SocGen scam that has already paid out $ 7 billion in bribes and extortions .
" Those intelligence - lead losses at UK Northern Crock Bank were a piece of cake ... maybe even uranium yellowcake for all we know . "
At first the hackers targeted national utility companies but large - scale raiding of gas and electricity meters was such a doddle that bigger targets became the weapon of choice .
This lead to more sophisticated scams .
Using know - how gained from the 2000 hacking into an Australian sewage control system that managed to flood airports , parks , rivers and city malls with millions of gallons of raw sewage , the gang easily adapted their Windows program to hack into British intelligence agencies and swamp their files with WMD crap that became the basis for Tony Blair 's " dodgy dossier " on Iraq .
" Those 2007 UK personal data losses of tax details and military records - they 're the entry point of a current scam that is blackmailing up to two dozen overexposed British financial institutions including the UK Treasury , " CIA sources continued .
" Our first intelligence break came late last year when Portuguese authorities asked us to file - share backdated stuff on a British couple involved in an alleged kidnap .
" Since then the whole house of cards has begun tumbling down . "
Gorgon Brown is quaking with rage .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- U.S. Army Brig .
Gen. Jeffrey Dorko was injured Monday when a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle in Baghdad , Pentagon sources said .
U.S. Army Brig .
Gen. Jeffrey Dorko has been evacuated to Germany , Pentagon sources said .
Dorko is believed to be the highest - ranking U.S. military officer injured in the war .
He suffered shrapnel wounds and has been evacuated to Germany , the sources said .
Dorko took command of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Gulf Region Division in Baghdad on October 10 , according to the Corps of Engineers Web site .
Also on Monday , the Iraqi army freed seven tribal sheikhs abducted Sunday in eastern Baghdad , Baghdad commander Gen. Abboud Qanbar told al - Iraqia state television .
Qanbar said eight sheikhs had been abducted , but one was killed Sunday while resisting .
Earlier , a Diyala tribal leader who is a member of the reconciliation committee in the province said that 11 sheikhs had been kidnapped , eight had been released and three more remained in captivity .
The freed sheikhs were Shiite , from Anbakiya tribe , the tribal leader said .
The tribal leader said the body of a Sunni sheikh , who was from the al - Azza tribe , was later found near where the kidnapping took place .
He said the three remaining sheikhs were Sunni .
An Interior Ministry official had originally told CNN that 10 tribal sheikhs -- seven Sunni and three Shiite -- had been kidnapped
Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammed al - Askari told CNN that four kidnappers were killed in the raid , which took place in Baghdad 's Rusafa district on the Tigris River .
Earlier Monday , the U.S. military blamed the kidnappings on former Mehdi Army militia brigade commander Arkan Hasnawi .
The military said Hasnawi " has joined forces with Iranian - supported special groups that are rejecting [ Mehdi Army leader ] Muqtada al - Sadr 's direction to embrace fellow Iraqis . "
Al - Sadr , an Iraqi Shiite cleric who controls the Mehdi Army , has called on the militia to obey a cease - fire following deadly firefights in August with rival Shiite militias .
Iran has denied that Iranian agents are helping train and equip militants in Iraq .
The sheiks were kidnapped while returning home to Baquba after meetings in Baghdad with Iraqi government officials , an Interior Minister official said .
The meetings concerned the reconciliation process in the nation .
Cycling suicide bomber kills 28
In Baquba on Monday , a suicide bomber riding a bicycle killed at least 28 Iraqi police at an Iraqi police base , the U.S. military said .
The blast also wounded 17 police officers and three civilians , the military said .
Iraqi police had reported 24 deaths earlier , describing them as police and police recruits .
Local health officials put the death toll at 27 , with a woman and child among the wounded .
Baquba , the capital of Diyala province , is 32 miles ( 51 kilometers ) northeast of Baghdad .
Akram Salman , 22 , a Sunni from Baquba 's central Tahrir area told The Associated Press that he was among about 60 recruits when the attack happened .
Al Qaeda in Iraq " has threatened us before and prevented us from joining the police , " Salman told the AP .
" They slaughtered many policemen , burned their houses , killed their families and blew up their headquarters .
Now , when the people have defeated al Qaeda and cooperated with the government , al Qaeda staged this operation to show their presence and to give a message that they are still in control . "
Col. David W. Sutherland , commander of U.S. - led coalition forces in Diyala province , said , " This attack is typical of al Qaeda 's barbaric and hateful ways , targeting Iraqi security forces who have been working to secure Baquba and enable progress . "
North of Baquba , Iraqi police on Monday killed a man attempting to enter a police station and detonate a suicide vest in Hibhib , the U.S. military said .
After police killed the man , the vest detonated outside the station , but no one was wounded and no damage was reported , the military said .
Also Monday , a deadly bombing struck about four miles west of Baiji , an Iraqi oil center about 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) north of Baghdad .
The device , placed in a parked car , killed seven civilians and wounded another 15 people , local police said .
In the capital Monday , a bomb in a parked car wounded at least five Iraqi civilians at a bus stop and taxi stand , an Interior Ministry official said .
The attack took place in southwestern Baghdad 's predominantly Shiite al - Baya 'a district , the official said .
Karbala province returns to Iraqi control
In an apparent sign of progress among coalition forces to secure areas south of Baghdad , the U.S. Army handed over responsibility for security of Karbala province to the Iraqi military in a ceremony Monday .
Recent clashes between Shiite factions had delayed the Karbala handover , but the area is now considered to be more peaceful than many other sections of the war - torn country .
During the ceremony at a soccer stadium in the provincial capital , Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and other dignitaries listened to speeches and watched a parade that ended with a cheerleading - style performance and mock paramilitary drill by Iraq soldiers .
Watch al - Maliki and Iraqi forces at the ceremony »
Al - Maliki challenged Iraqi commanders to work on bolstering security forces so they could assume responsibility in more provinces .
" We should all take responsibility for building military capability , " the prime minister said .
He added , " Allow me to say that we are late ; we are late in building our security forces , and that is for reasons I do not want to talk about here . "
The U.S. military said it will maintain a presence in the province to support the Iraqi military .
" Step by step , Iraqis are assuming control for the security in their provinces , and Karbala today is leading the way , " said Maj .
Gen. Rick Lynch , commander of the U.S. troops in the province .
" We are only a phone call away . "
Karbala , a Shiite province south of Baghdad , will be the eighth of 18 Iraqi provinces to be handed over to the Iraqi government by coalition forces .
The other provinces returned to Iraqi control are Najaf , Muthanna , Thiqar , Maysan , Duhuk , Irbil and Sulaimaniya .
Iraqi security forces are set to assume security responsibility in mid-December for the southern province of Basra , al - Maliki said .
Other developments
Iraqi leaders at a military camp east of Baghdad have given the U.S. military a $ 1,000 check to aid victims of California 's wildfires , a U.S. military official said Monday .
" In the months I 've been here , I have never been so moved , " Army Col .
Darel Maxfield , the senior U.S. military official at Camp Besmaya , said in an e-mail .
Many of the Marines at that camp are from Camp Pendleton , the U.S. Marine Corps facility north of San Diego that has been the scene of some of the fires .
A battalion of about 800 Kurdish troops moved closer to Iraq 's border with Turkey over the weekend , according to U.S. military officials .
It was unclear whether Kurdish leaders or Iraq 's prime minister requested the peshmerga militia .
Iraqi and Kurdish leaders have been under pressure to crack down on the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK , rebels who have triggered a crisis on the northern border with Turkey .
Turkish authorities blame the PKK for the recent deaths of dozens of soldiers and civilians and want Iraq to handle the rebels .
Turkey has warned that it can't wait indefinitely for Iraq to do so .

All About Muqtada al - Sadr • Iraq War
Before the ink on the " No WMD " NIE report had a chance to dry , neo -conservatives hit the talk show circuit and the broadcast Lords of Loud radio right went into overdrive to spin the information into a full scale intel overdrive ...
" Who are you going to believe ... the NIE intelligence or the president's ? "
Neoconworld sent out the hit squad of Podhorertz and Bolton to attack the reports and the firm of Limbaugh , Levin , and Hannity echoed the message : " Sham ! "
- Sixteen intel agencies are in collusion to embarrass and undermine the President .
- The report was not fact , but agenda , driven .
Alan Dershowtiz called it " Stupid Intelligence , " which would seem to be the present condition of the American voter .
In a Rasmussen Poll , only 18 % of voters are buying the report 's conclusion with 66 % believing Iran is still building WMD .
You say that they must have only polled Fox News viewers ?
Think again while I splash cold water on the idea that a Democratic administration is a Jan 20 , 2009 slam dunk .
Only 29 % of liberal voters believe the report .
Hey , poll - ees !
Were you on some sort of narcotic bender right before the poll ?
Do the words " Iraq " and " 4,000 dead American soldiers " bring anything to mind ?
The slow down in troop deaths getting to you ?
Six years in a bloody quagmire not enough ?
Or is it that you 're pushing the " only thing we learn from history is that we do n't learn from history " envelope ?
With these numbers , I do n't blame the President for continuing to spin the report like a drunken dreidel ( my wife did n't think I could connect this story with the never - ending Chanukah holiday ) .
Why not ?
What has n't worked for the country , seems to have worked just swell for this president and his policy failure beneficiaries .
Maybe it's that the entire idea of rapprochement through diplomacy is n't dangerous enough for a country born out bullets , blood and John Wayne movies .
America : Open up your cerebellum !
Your being sold another silo of bullshit and you can't even smell the difference between intelligence and fear and hate - charged fabrications to boonswaggle Americans to vote against their own best interests ... AGAIN !
You re-elected Bush / Cheney after tax cuts that gave you a few extra dollars while the top .5 % of " earners " ( to use the term loooooosely ) were averaging over $ 50,000 in their tax cut stockings .
You already allowed these bastards to send the " they 'll follow us here " message to ramp up one war .
Now you want to give them a pass as they grease the pads for one more before they step into oil - soaked retirement .
Activist judges , gay marriage and Christmas - warring - oh my - sweeping the country if you dare bring in a Democratic presidency .
Global warming , dollar weakening due to thunderous debt , record - breaking incompetence in government , erosion of civil liberties and protections , and you still believe these guys ?!
What the hell is wrong with you ?!
It is n't that we should n't be concerned by whackjobs around the world .
But that we choose to believe a bunch of right wing whackjobs right her in America is what is so troubling .
It leaves one thinking that we may be just blind , deaf and dumb enough to elect the new warmonger next time .
And if we are to believe the Rasmussen numbers , my guess is that is just who we 'll find ourselves with sometime a little more than thirteen months from now .
Intel wrong .
Neocon whackjobs who have gotten it wrong from day one , right .
Amazin ' .

About author Award - winning TV writer and Award - winning TV writer and political satirist , Steve Young , is author of " Great Failures of the Extremely Successful " and blogs at SteveYoungOnPolitics.com
I 've read a decent number of O'Reilly titles over the years .
My bookshelf for technical books is a rainbow of the various volumes , each with their wood carving style cover .
I do n't think in all those years I 've ever read an introduction like the one in annoyances .
O'Reilly authors tend to be enthusiastic about their topic and are often well known proponents of the technology discussed .
I can only guess that Karp is not a huge fan of Vista .
The preface begins with a section labeled " Why am I annoyed ? " and that section concludes with the question , " Would Microsoft be making decisions like these if it had to compete fairly for your business ? "
The first sentence of the first chapter is , " Windows Vista is like a papaya : sleek on the outside , but a big mess on the inside . "
And Karp never lets up .
Throughout the book , from start to finish , he never tries to gloss over the ugliness of Vista .
This book may be hazardous to the health of Microsoft fanboys .
I would imagine that too much time reading would lead to high blood pressure at the very least .
In view of the mess that is Vista , Karp informs the reader that , " Whether it goes down smoothly or gives you heartburn is up to you . "
The point of the book is to give the reader the information that they need to make Vista palatable .
This may sound simple but it brings up what I thought was the most difficult issue for Karp .
Vista Annoyances is written with a level of detail and explanation that marks it clearly for the user with casual knowledge of personal computers and how they work .
Karp takes the time to explain things like what it means to zip a file , what happens when defrag is run on a hard drive , networking basics and so on .
This is great for someone like me , who is sure to start getting a slew of calls from friends and family as some of them move to Vista .
The problem is , many of the solutions revolve around steps that are not necessarily a good idea for the pc novice .
A large portion of the solutions revolve around editing the registry .
The third chapter of the book deals solely with the registry .
How it works , how to navigate within it and how to alter it .
For some people this could be a great route to take , for many it could lead to much more serious problems than they had in the first place .
For the technically proficient , this book will seem a bit bloated .
They do n't need all the explanation given for the beginner .
Many of the books solutions are not just Vista specific .
They give information and work arounds for Windows issues that have existed in XP and possibly back to 98 .
The saving grace is a thorough index .
The person who buys this as a reference to help out others , or deal with some specific issue will find that the extensive index helps to not waste time working through what could feel like a lot of extra material .
I do n't think this issue of complexity is necessarily the author 's fault .
Many of the changes users will want to make to Vista just can't be made any other way than through the registry .
Where it is possible to use a programitic interface ( gui or command line ) Karp gives thorough and detailed instructions , with screen shots on how to do so .
But for many options those tools do n't exist or have been removed , leaving direct editing of the registry as the only solution left .
Another issue , that is somewhat similar , is that for most home users , some of the better solutions wont be available as they wont have access to tools available in Vista Ultimate and Business editions .
This is n't Karps fault again , but it means for many the book will have a lot of information that they just can't use .
Dealing with the various editions and their features is handled immediately in the first chapter .
That chapter , " Get Started with Windows Vista " , also covers installation .
Karp goes over the various types of installs and gives tips on how to deal with failed installs , how to best set up prior to an install and how to deal with licensing .
Throughout the book , Karp makes note when he is talking about a feature , choice or tool that is limited to a subset of the Vista family .
Keeping track of it all can be a bit confusing .
Once again , I do n't really see this as a shortcoming on the part of the author .
It 's just the nature of the beast .
The title of the second chapter threw me at first .
It is , " Shell Tweaks . "
When I hear the word shell my mind immediately brings up bash or ksh .
In this case Karp is talking about Windows Explorer .
As this is the primary interface for users working with the Vista file system , the chapter holds some vital information for attaining a sane and consistent user experience .
Karp points out that many of the defaults are not going to endear themselves to many users and in many cases do not make much sense .
When Karp discusses explorer he explains how to modify it when opened to various folders and also in the context of the desktop and taskbar .
Karp points out many third party tools that he feels will help the user .
Many are free , some are not .
The tools mentioned more than any other are Creative Element 's Powertools .
Powertools can be downloaded for a free 45 day trial period but costs $ 18 to license beyond that time frame .
This is important as many of Karps solutions can be managed without this software but would be very cumbersome .
This is especially true of all the editing done in the registry .
The registry chapter is thorough and offers a detailed explanation of what the registry is and how it works .
This material could be useful for anyone using any version of windows .
The issue of trying to make Vista useful for non-technical users rears its head here quite a bit , as I mentioned .
I found myself reading explanations of hex and binary as well as reading how to create a patch file for the registry .
This could be useful information for me , in helping others with Windows issues .
But when I consider my parents , there is no way I would want them trying out half of what is in this chapter .
They would in all likelihood need a complete reinstall in no time .
What reading this said to me , more than anything was that most people are going to just have to settle for Vista the way Microsoft gives it to them .
The chapter on dealing with multimedia was interesting and could prove helpful for users with less experience .
There are solid explanations on codecs , players and how to get the most out of media , especially video .
There is very little said about Vista and DRM .
There is no mention of possible problems with hardware due to DRM .
In fact the discussion on DRM was primarily limited to a short mention of Tunebite and MyFair Tunes for DRM removal .
I assume that this is because finding and explaining such issues would have required a lot more time , research and hardware .
Vista annoyances pretty much sticks to the basics of media use .
I had to chuckle a bit as I read the chapter on performance as many of the recommendations involve turning off much of what differentiates Vista from XP .
It is useful though , as Karp explains what the configurable options are and how much one can expect in gains .
He does make it clear that the initial defaults are less than ideal and it is worth the time to dig in and make adjustments .
The same can be said for security and in that regard the chapters on networking and users are indispensable .
Once again , getting all the tools will involve having Ultimate / Business and installing third party tools to bring Vista into line .
I 've rated the book 8 out of 10 .
This is due to two issues .
The first negative I have explained quite a bit and that is the book speaks to the novice but requires someone with more experience in many cases .
While this is may not be the fault of the author and a necessity brought on by the subject matter , it still makes the book less useful .
The second is that quite often I found the author bringing up points only to say that he would explain more later in the same chapter or in another chapter .
This is because the chapters themselves are built around topics like performance and troubleshooting .
But when Karp is working his way through each option of a menu it branches out into other topics , as many options in Vista are spread all over the place .
Once again , this seems to be more of a Vista issue , but hinders learning none the less .
After finishing this book , my first thought was that I am going to do all I can to make sure that no family or friends buy a machine with Vista if possible .
Service Pack 1 will address just a few of the issues that Vista brings to the table .
From what I 've read about it fixing activation ' loopholes ' it could make some things worse .
Should I find myself approached by someone who already has Vista and wants help , I would recommend this book if they have some idea of what they are doing or can learn without getting into too much trouble .
For that classic parent or grandparent always brought up as an example , I think I would just tell them Visa is the way it is and hope that they adjust .
If I like them enough , I 'll pull this book off the shelf and head on over to help them out .

DUBLIN ( Reuters ) - Ireland should consider giving up driving on the left to reduce accidents by foreigners accustomed to right side motoring , a senior politician said Friday .
Donie Cassidy , the leader of Ireland ’s upper chamber Senate , cited Sweden -- which moved to the right in 1967 -- as an example of a country that switched decades after most of Europe did .
Ireland ’s economic growth over the past decade has attracted tens of thousands of workers especially from central and eastern European countries .
It is also a popular tourist destination for visitors from the United States .
“ We have all of these people coming in from Europe and from America and ( because of ) the roads that they are used to driving on in their own countries it is a huge difficulty when they start driving here , ” Cassidy told public broadcaster RTE .
“ I know when I go to America it takes me five or six days to adjust . ”
Motoring body the AA said the idea was “ completely impractical . ”
As another remedy , Cassidy suggested in the Senate on Thursday that people from countries driving on the right should observe a 50 mile per hour speed limit , compared with speeds up to 120 km permitted for Irish drivers .
Besides Ireland , many former British colonies such as India and Australia keep to the left as does Japan .
One of the first questions people ask you when you are introduced as a chef is " Have you ever spat in the food ? " .
There just seems to be a fascination with what goes on behind the closed doors of the kitchen !
Now i can personally say that I have never done anything remotely like that although you can be pushed to the limit by needy customers especially working for the rich and famous .
There are countless stories , a lot of them being a mixture of urban myth and the inevitable exaggeration the story receives as it gets passed on from person to person but the following stories are all 100 % true as I have witnessed them with my own eyes !
These are my top 4 favourite stories of annoying customers and funny kitchen incidents and how they have been dealt with over years ....
4. This is one that never goes down well but believe me happens a lot on a day to day basis !
Even Gordon Ramsey said it on Hells kitchen ( although he later retracted it as a joke ! ) and I have seen it happen countless times all over the world .
Basically vegetarian soup usually tastes like nothing so chefs add chicken stock to make it actually have flavour .
Terrible practice and totally shocking to our vegetarian friends but believe this happens a lot !
3.Nothing shocking actually happened here but I was cooking for Posh Spice and she ordered a bowl of fresh berries with sweet mascarpone and she sent it back 4 different times .
First she wanted the mascarpone removed , then the anglaise sauce , then the icing sugar and finally the lazy bony waif sent it back cause she did n't want the piece of mint on top , I mean come on , lift your manicured finger and lift it off yourself you lazy $ " $ $ !
2.Working in a very prestigious Michelin star restaurant one of the senior chefs made the ultimate mistake of over cooking a steak that had been requested rare .
I watched as he removed it from the oven and tried soaking it in blood on a tray he had in his fridge to try and make it appear it was rare and get past the monster of a head chef who was plating the dish .
He got it past the chef only to see it return 2 minutes later , I 'll let you figure out what happened next !
1. The chef bought the fish on Friday but it did n't sell over the weekend so now its Monday evening and he wants to get rid of it .
He washes the smell off under running water for 10 minutes then puts it on the menu with a spicy rub to mask any remaining smell !
Horrible but seen it at least 100 times !
The rule i go by is if i would n't eat it myself i would n't serve it .
The good news is that 99.99 % of chefs are well trained professional operators who ensure you get the best food possible but like any industry there will always be a few rogue operators out there !
The difference with other industries is that even though their actions might effect you directly you do n't have to put it in your mouth and eat it !
Congressman Pete Stark from California is polling the public on his website about whether Congress should impeach President Bush .
Go here to let him know your thoughts !
This film is parodied in Die unglaubliche Reise in einem verrückten Flugzeug ( 1980 ) , so much so , that the producers of that comedy bought the rights to this movie and used some of the dialogue word for word .

WASHINGTON 
What would Mike Huckabee say about George Washington almost being arrested for not attending church on a Sunday shortly after he was elected as the first president ?
And what would evangelical voters think of Benjamin Franklin taking it upon himself to edit the words of Jesus by rewriting several prayers ?
Would any of the Founding Fathers be electable today ?
Those are the types of questions raised in the Rev. Gary Kowalski's new book , Revolutionary Spirits : The Enlightened Faith of America 's Founding Fathers .
In his fifth and most recent book , Kowalski seeks to shatter what he regards as a myth , commonly exhorted by politicians and religious groups .
His spiritual portraits of Washington , Franklin , Thomas Paine , John Adams , Thomas Jefferson and James Madison argue that the founding fathers were neither devout Christians nor secularists .
Instead , he depicts them as curious , strong - spirited , scientifically - minded men who were determined to keep religion out of government .
" I wanted to set the record straight , " said Kowalski , 54 , senior minister at the First Unitarian Universalist Society in Burlington , Vt . " I really felt that their legacy had been misappropriated by the religious right . "
Before he could educate the public , Kowalski had to educate himself .
He first became interested in the early Americans ' spiritual beliefs as an undergraduate at Harvard .
In 2003 , Kowalski could no longer tolerate what he saw as an influx of historical inaccuracy , and set about researching the true spiritual nature of the historical icons .
Kowalski read several authoritative biographies on each man .
When there were questions of accuracy , he would resort to original documents written by Washington , Jefferson , Adams and the others .
" Most of the biographies focused on military , government and foreign affairs , " Kowalski said , " but they gave a short shrift to their religious lives . "
What he discovered in his research is in stark contrast to some of today 's political leaders .
The fathers of American democracy came from different religious backgrounds , but they all had some things in common .
They were fascinated by the new scientific discoveries of their day .
They were adamant about America being inclusive for all religions , not just Protestantism .
And though each may have had a unique brand of spirituality , they were much more circumspect about their beliefs .
" I think they would be surprised at how much our political leaders advertise their religious beliefs , " Kowalski said , " as well as the preponderance of evangelicalism in the country today . "
Kowalski's book maintains that the Founding Fathers liked an ample dose of reason mixed in with their Christianity .
In an age of witch and heresy trials , they were often wary of the message from the pulpit .
Adams distrusted church revival crowds as he did street gangs , claiming both were prone to passions instead of reason .
Paine felt that organized religion leads to piousness instead of humility when incorporated with powers of the state .
He excoriated it in his writings .
In 1731 , Franklin took a more humorous approach when he wrote a satirical story , for the Pennsylvania Gazette , about a Puritan - led witch burning — to expose the silliness of believing in witchcraft .
And although Washington never chopped down a cherry tree , he was detained by law officers in New England for traveling on the Sabbath .
His excuse ?
He was merely running behind schedule .
Though Kowalski says these founding fathers were not avid churchgoers , he is careful to point out that they were not secularists either .
His book illustrates their religious beliefs as an amalgam of various religions and the intellectual discoveries of their day .
They had their own particular faiths and wanted the same for everyone else .
" I think they would be very pleased by the spiritual diversity in our country today , " Kowalski said .
" With greater diversity , there 's less chance for one religion to become too powerful . "

Cindy Sheehan is in Egypt Protesting on Behalf of Terrorists
Just when you thought you heard it all when it came to Cindy Sheehan comes this story .
Cindy Sheehan is in Egypt protesting in favor of suspected terrorists .
Members of the Muslim Brotherhood will be going on trial in Eqypt for terrorism and Sheehan does n’t think it is fair .
Here is the Brotherhood ’s motto , according to Wikipedia :
Allah is our objective .
The Prophet is our leader .
Qur ’an is our law .
Jihad is our way .
Dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope
Here is how the Brotherhood feels about women , again from Wikipedia :
On the issue of women and gender the Muslim Brotherhood interprets Islam quite strictly .
Its founder called for “ a campaign against ostentation in dress and loose behavior , ” “ segregation of male and female students , ” a separate curriculum for girls , and “ the prohibition of dancing and other such pastimes
Here are some of the activities that the Brotherhood are alleged to be involved with :
The Brotherhood is widely believed to have had a `secret apparatus` responsible for terrorist attacks in Egypt including the assassination of Egypt ’s prime minister in 1948 .
The Brotherhood currently advocates suicide bombing attacks on civilians to fight Zionism , and its Palestinian wing Hamas targets both civilians and the military in Israel .
Newsweek journalists Mark Hosenball and Michael Isikoff report connections between al - Qaeda and Brotherhood figures Mamoun Darkazanli and Youssef Nada .
A similar article in the Financial Times reported financial links between 74 - year - old Swiss Muslim convert , businessman and neo -Nazi Ahmed Huber , and MB members , notably Youssef Nada , Ali Himmat and who founded the Al Taqwa Bank .
According to the U.S. government , Al Taqwa “ has long acted as financial advisers to al - Qaeda . ”
Huber himself is noted in Europe for his links with alleged neo -Nazi and other far right elements .
He is reported to have “ confirmed ” having “ had contact with associates of Osama bin Laden at an Islamic conference in Beirut , ” whom he called `very discreet , well - educated , very intelligent people .
`
Abdul Rahman al - Amoudi , an “ expert in the art of deception ” was an influential lobbyist and founder and head of the Brotherhood - linked American Muslim Council before being convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for conspiracy to murder Saudi Prince Abdullah at the behest of Libyan leader Muammar al - Gaddafi .
Cindy Sheehan has this to say about the suspected terrorist who are to go on trial :
“ I am here to protest the trial of civilians in front of a military tribunal as this is a violation to international law , ”
I am not sure why I let the actions of this one obviously deranged woman bother me , but I do .
Just think about this scenario for a second .
Cindy Sheehan is no longer just protesting the war .
While I may disagree with her war protest , that was her right .
Cindy Sheehan is now protesting on behalf of terrorists , this is different and much worse that protesting a war .
Cindy Sheehan has gone from war protester to terrorist sympathiser , she is embarrassing her son ’s name , and demeaning what he fought for .
She has now gone well beyond what I find reasonable , responsible , and acceptable .
She has now entered Jane Fonda territory .
Oh , it 's 4:00 .
I guess it 's time for some whine and cheese .
TVNewser :
Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace tells Politico's Michael Calderone that " the Democrats are damn fools [ for ] not coming on Fox News . "
Wallace thinks that once the party has a nominee " they probably will come on , because they know that we get a lot of voters they are going to need if they are going to win the election . "
" Just imagine if the Republicans , under pressure from right - to - life groups , refused to appear on CNN or MSNBC , " Wallace said .
" I think there would be holy unshirted hell . "
Read on ...
Gosh , Chris , why do you suppose Democrats would refuse to go on FOX ?
Ya think it might have to do with hackery like this ?

Symptoms of the Credit Crisis
The turmoil in the US subprime mortgage market has developed into an international credit crisis .
It is eroding investor confidence in credit and credit - related products and , most important , raising concerns about the solidity of the banking sector , as evidenced by banks ' elevated funding terms and diminished stock prices .
As a direct response to the credit crisis , the US Federal Reserve Bank first pared the Federal Funds Target Rate twice — by 50 bp on September 18 , another 25 bp on October 31 , and another 25 bp on December 11 — bringing the official rate to 4.25 % .
The lowering of borrowing costs came despite the fact that the FOMC had been stressing " inflation risks " since early 2006 .
Meanwhile , financial markets are speculating that the US central bank could cut rates even further .
For instance , the level of the 2 - year Treasury Bill rate , which has declined by quite a margin below the official interest rate , suggests that investors keep betting their money on forthcoming reductions in US Fed rates .
Figure 1 : US interest rates ( % ) , US S&P 500 index and gold ( US$ per ounce )
In this context , it is interesting to note that the US dollar price per gold ounce rose from US $ 268 in January 2001 — when the US Fed started cutting interest rates — to close to US $ 800 in December 2007 .
In other words , the exchange value of the US dollar fell around 67 % vis-à - vis gold — the world 's ultimate means of payment .
For comparison , the exchange value of the greenback declined 14 % against US stocks ( as expressed by the US S&P 500 index ) in the same period .
The Cause of the Credit Crisis
The cause of the international credit crisis has a name : the government - controlled paper - money regime .
This is the diagnosis when taking on board the theoretical insights provided by the monetary theory of the trade cycle ( MTTC ) as developed by Ludwig von Mises , one of the leading scholars of the Austrian School of economics .
In his magnum opus , Human Action , Mises wrote :
The wavelike movement affecting the economic system , the recurrence of periods of boom which are followed by periods of depression , is the unavoidable outcome of the attempts , repeated again and again , to lower the gross market rate of interest by means of credit expansion .
There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion .
The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion , or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved . [ 1 ]
Mises foresaw that a government - controlled paper - money - supply regime , once established , would pursue a monetary policy of pushing down the market interest rate through credit and money expansion — driven by an ideologically rooted " anticapitalist mentality " :
In the eyes of cranks and demagogues , interest is a product of the sinister machinations of rugged exploiters .
The age - old disapprobation of interest has been fully revived by modern interventionism .
It clings to the dogma that it is one of the foremost duties of good government to lower the rate of interest as far as possible or to abolish it altogether .
All present - day governments are fanatically committed to an easy money policy . [ 2 ]
Mises predicted that once an economic crisis unfolds — which he saw as the inevitable consequence of a relentless increase in paper - money supply — the public would call for even lower interest rates , as such a policy would be seen as a remedy against recession and deflation .
However , Mises said that such a monetary policy would ultimately end in the destruction of the exchange value of money :
The boom can last only as long as the credit expansion progresses at an ever - accelerated pace .
The boom comes to an end as soon as additional quantities of fiduciary media are no longer thrown upon the loan market .
But it could not last forever even if inflation and credit expansion were to go on endlessly .
It would then encounter the barriers which prevent the boundless expansion of circulation credit .
It would lead to the crack - up boom and the breakdown of the whole monetary system . [ 3 ]
The Market Interest Rate — Reflecting Peoples ' Time Preference
Ever since , people have been unsympathetic , even hostile , to the interest - rate phenomenon .
The interest rate is seen as an obstacle to output and employment gains .
As a result , government authority over the money supply is preferred to a free - market money regime , as the former allows reducing the interest rate by way of increasing the money stock at the discretion of the central bank .
Such a lack of understanding of the very nature of the interest rate spells trouble .
Mises stressed that the interest rate ( or , as Mises put it , the " orginary interest rate " ) is a category of human action .
In an unhampered market , it reflects peoples ' " time preferences . " [ 4 ]
Because of scarcity , people value goods and services available today ( " present goods " ) more highly than goods and services available at a later point in time ( " future goods " ) .
This is why present goods trade at a premium over future goods .
That premium is the interest rate , or the " time preference rate . "
The equilibrium market interest rate is an outcome of savers wanting to exchange present goods against future goods and investors willingly exchanging future goods against present goods in the " time market . "
Because of time preference , the supply of present goods ( that is , the demand for future goods ) is positively related to the interest rate , while the demand for present goods ( supply of future goods ) is negatively related to the interest rate .
Figure 2 A Declining Time Preference in the Time Market
The interest rate is neither the motive for savings nor a reward for abstaining from consumption .
It simply expresses individual valuations of future against present goods .
The interest rate varies according to peoples ' degree of time preference .
If , for instance , peoples ' time preference declines , people will consume less out of current income and save and invest more .
A declining time preference , other things being equal , would argue for a decline in the equilibrium market interest rate .
A falling time preference underlies economic growth : as peoples ' time preference declines , a growing portion of current income is saved and invested , and thereby put to productive use .
As a growing portion of present goods is devoted to production rather than consumption , the supply of present goods in the future can be increased .
To give an illustration , the market equilibrium interest rate is at point A in Figure 2 , where savings ( that is the supply of present goods ) amount to S 0 and investment ( that is the demand for present goods ) amounts to I 0 .
A decline in the time preference of the suppliers of present goods would move the savings schedule from S to S ' .
As a result , the new equilibrium interest rate is i 1 , where savings amount to S 1 and investment to I 1 .
Point B marks a stable equilibrium : the interest rate i 1 reflects peoples ' true time preferences , that is , their truly desired savings and investments .
A Rise in Paper Money Supply — Action that Spells Trouble
As noted above , in a free market the interest rate changes in response to changes in peoples ' time preferences .
However , there will be severe trouble if the market interest rate is artificially lowered through government interference .
This is typically done by allowing commercial banks to increase the stock of money supply through lending .
Assume banks increase the supply of loans and money .
The interest rate in the money market declines .
Businesses make use of the artificially lowered interest rate .
They invest in new equipment , hire additional staff , buy new raw materials , and build up inventories .
They expand the production of investment goods relative to consumer goods .
In fact , firms act as if savings had genuinely increased .
However , the increase in the additional demand for production factors is not accompanied by a rise in the economy 's resources : the increase in the stock of money has not increased the amount of present goods willingly supplied in exchange for future goods .
As a result , the money - induced increase in the demand for production factors bids up prices for scarce resources such as , for instance , commodities and wages .
All this takes place even though peoples ' time preference has not declined .
The truth is that the public does not want to save and invest more than it has prior to the increase in the stock of money .
Sooner or later people can be expected to restore their actually desired consumption - savings proportions .
They reign in the savings and increase their demand for consumption goods .
Figure 3 A Rise in Paper Money Supply in the Time Market
As people restore their preferred savings - consumption proportions , it is revealed that businesses invested too much in capital relative to consumption goods .
The demand for investment goods falls short of producers ' expectations , and the investment industry experiences a downturn .
To give an illustration , in Figure 3 , point A marks the market equilibrium in which savings equal investment .
Now assume that banks increase the money supply .
The increase in the money stock ( DM ) moves the S to S ' ( with S ' = S + DM ) .
In the new equilibrium , point B , the interest rate , declines to i 1 , while savings rise to S 1 and investment expands to I 1 .
When moving from point A to point B , the economy enjoys a boom , due to money - induced additional investment .
However , the new equilibrium — with a lowered interest rate , higher savings and investment and therefore overall output — does not represent a stable equilibrium in the sense that would correspond to peoples ' true time preferences .
This is because in point B the interest rate i 1 is lower than peoples ' time preference rate i 0 , brought about by an increase in money supply .
Savings and investment are now greater than at point A. People would therefore want to return their original savings - consumption equilibrium , which would imply a move from point B to point A . [ 5 ]
Such a shift represents the bust , following the boom .
The Crisis Entails Policies that Cause an Even Greater Crisis Later On
The ensuing economic contraction — the inevitable result of a government - sponsored lowering of the market interest rate — would , according to the Austrians , trigger further attempts at lowering the interest rate by way of a further increase in money supply .
While such action might keep the boom alive for some time , it entails further malinvestment and inflation , and the costs of the final collapse of the artificial boom increase .
As Murray N. Rothbard put it ,
Like the repeated doping of a horse , the boom is kept on its way and ahead of its inevitable comeuppance by repeated and accelerating does of the stimulant of bank credit .
It is only when bank credit expansion must finally stop or sharply slow down , either because the banks are getting shaky or because the public is getting restive at the continuing inflation , that retribution finally catches up with the boom .
As soon as credit expansion stops , the piper must be paid , and the inevitable readjustments must liquidate the unsound over - investment of the boom … . [ 6 ]
Mises understood that the recurrence of boom and bust , the direct outcome of ongoing attempts to push the market interest rate below the originary interest rate , would actually increase inflation and ultimately lead to a destruction of the currency :
But then finally the masses wake up .
They become suddenly aware of the fact that inflation is a deliberate policy and will go on endlessly .
A breakdown occurs .
The crack - up boom appears .
Everybody is anxious to swap his money against " real " goods , no matter whether he needs them or not , no matter how much money he has to pay for them .
Within a very short time , within a few weeks or even days , the things which were used as money are no longer used as media of exchange .
They become scrap paper .
Nobody wants to give away anything against them . [ 7 ]
Crises Erode Support for Capitalism
One of the major fears on the part of Austrian economists is that a crisis , once it unfolds , makes people draw a false conclusion about its cause .
People would most likely become disenchanted with the concept of capitalism .
They would want the boom to continue ( the very source of the crisis ) , and would want to escape the bust ( the necessary cleansing of the economic system from the preceding boom ) :
The boom produces impoverishment .
But still more disastrous are its moral ravages .
It makes people despondent and dispirited .
The more optimistic they were under the illusory prosperity of the boom , the greater is their despair and their feeling of frustration .
The individual is always ready to ascribe his good luck to his own efficiency and to take it as a well - deserved reward for his talent , application , and probity .
But reverses of fortune he always charges to other people , and most of all to the absurdity of social and political institutions .
He does not blame the authorities for having fostered the boom .
He reviles them for the inevitable collapse .
In the opinion of the public , more inflation and more credit expansion are the only remedy against the evils which inflation and credit expansion have brought about . [ 8 ]
The Austrian School of economics not only suggests that the current credit crisis is a direct result of government - controlled paper - money - supply monopolies , which have embarked upon a policy of artificially suppressing the market interest rate ; it also suggests that central banks will continue to respond to a monetary - induced crisis by a further increase in the stock of money , thereby increasing malinvestment and inflation .
All this might explain why the paper - money price of gold has been going up strongly in recent years — reflecting peoples ' concern that the value of the currency is now in great danger .
If this is the case , there should be little doubt that the free and peaceful societal cooperation as supported by the free market concept would be endangered as well .
It is against this backdrop that Austrians argue that manipulating the interest rate — the inevitable outcome of a government money supply monopoly — is a recipe for disaster .

What attributes can contribute to a highly successful software developer versus the ordinary run -of - the - mill kind ?
I do n’t believe the attributes listed here are the end - all , be - all list , nor do I believe you have to be born with them .
Nearly all things in life can be learned , and these attributes are no exception .
Like this article ?
Check out my new book , Writing High - Performance .NET
Code .
Humility
Humility is first because it implies all the other attributes , or at least enables them .
There are a lot of misunderstandings of what humility is and sometimes it ’s easier to explain it by describing what humility is n’t :
humility is n’t letting people walk all over you
humility is n’t suppressing your opinions
humility is n’t thinking you ’re a crappy programmer
C.S. Lewis said it best , in the literary guise of a devil trying to subvert humanity :
Let him think of [ humility ] not as self - forgetfulness but as a certain kind of opinion ( namely , a low opinion ) of his own talents and character .
. .
Fix in his mind the idea that humility consists in trying to believe those talents to be less valuable than he believes them to be .
. .
By this method thousands of humans have been brought to think that humility means pretty women trying to believe they are ugly and clever men trying to believe they are fools . *
Ok , so we realize humility is n’t pretending to be worse than you are and it ’s not timidity .
So what is it ?
Simply put , humility is an understanding that the world does n’t begin and end with you .
It ’s accepting that you do n’t know everything there is to know about WPF , or Perl , or Linux .
It ’s an acknowledgment of the fact that , even if you ’re an expert in some particular area , there is still much to learn .
In fact , there is far more to learn than you could possibly do in a lifetime , and that ’s ok .
Once you start assuming you ’re the expert and final word on something , you ’ve stopped growing , stopped learning , and stopped progressing .
Pride can make you obsolete faster than you can say “ Java ” .
The fact is that even if you ’re humble , you ’re probably pretty smart .
If you work in a small organization with few programmers ( or any organization with few good programmers ) , chances are you ’re more intelligent than the majority of them when it comes to computers .
( If you are smarter than all of them about everything , then either you failed the humility test or you need to get out of that company fast ) .
Since you happen to know more about computers and how software works than most people , and since everybody ’s life increasingly revolves around using computers , this will give you the illusion that you are smarter than others about everything .
This is usually a mistake .
Take Sales and Marketing for example .
I have about 50 Dilbert strips hung in my office .
I would guess half of them make fun of Sales or Marketing in some way .
It ’s easy , it ’s fun , and it ’s often richly deserved !
But if they did n’t sell your software , you would n’t get paid .
You need them as much as they need you .
If someone asked you to go sell your software , how would you do it ?
Do you even like talking to people ?
As clueless as they are about the realities of software development , they have skills you do n’t .
There are some industries where extreme ego will get you places .
I do not believe this to be the usual case in software , at least in companies run by people who understand software .
Ego is not enough–results matter .
If you have a big ego , you ’d better be able to back it up .
Unfortunately , the problem with egos is that they grow–eventually you wo n’t be able to keep up with it , and people will see through you .
The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull ; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility , and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague .
– Dijkstra
Without humility , you will make mistakes .
Actually , even with humility you ’ll make mistakes , but you ’ll realize it sooner .
By assuming that you know how to solve a problem immediately , you may take steps to short - circuit the development process .
You may think you understand the software so well that you can easily fix a bug with just a few tweaks … and yet , you did n’t realize that this other function over here is now broken .
A humble programmer will first say “ I do n’t know the right way to solve this yet ” and take the time to do the analysis .
Finally , humble people are a lot more pleasant to work with .
They do n’t make their superiority an issue .
They do n’t always have the “ right answer ” ( meaning everybody else is wrong , of course ) .
You can do pair programming with a humble person , you can do code reviews with a humble person , you can instruct a humble person .
Leave your ego out of programming .
It ’s not at all important to get it right the first time .
It ’s vitally important to get it right the last time .
– Andrew Hunt and David Thomas
Perhaps most importantly , a humble programmer can instruct him / herself …
Love of Learning
If you ’re new to this whole programming thing , I hate to break it to you : school has just begun .
Whatever you thought of your BS / MS in Computer Science you worked so hard at–it was just the beginning .
It will get you your first job or two , but that ’s it .
If you ca n’t learn as you go , from now until you retire , you ’re dead weight .
Sure , you ’ll be able to find a job working somewhere with your pet language for the rest of your life –COBOL and Fortran are still out there after all , but if you really want to progress you ’re going to have to learn .
Learning is not compulsory .
Neither is survival .
– W. Edwards Deming
This means reading .
A lot .
If you do n’t like reading , I suggest you start–get into Harry Potter , fantasy , science fiction , historical fiction , whatever .
Something .
Just read .
Then get some technical books .
Start with my list of essential developer books .
They ’re not as exciting as Harry Potter , but they ’re not bad either .
A lot material is online , but for high quality , authoritative prose on fundamental subjects , a good book beats all .
Reading is n’t enough , though .
You have to practice .
You have to write your own test projects .
You have to force yourself to push your boundaries .
You can start by typing in code sample , but then you need to change them in ways unique to you .
You should have personal projects and hobbies that expand your skills .
Be writing your own tools , or “ fun ” programs .
Write a game .
Do what it takes to learn new things !
The type of programs you write have a big bearing on how well you learn new material .
It has to be something that interests you , or you wo n’t keep it up .
In my case , I ’m developing software related to my LEGO hobby .
In the past , I ’ve written tools for word puzzles , system utilities , multimedia plug-ins , and more .
They all started out of a need I had , or a desire to learn something new and useful to me personally .
Another aspect of this love of learning is related to debugging software .
An effective developer is not satisfied with a problem until they understand how it works , why it happens , and the details of how to fix it .
The details matter –understanding why a bug occurs is just as important as knowing what to do to fix it .
Learn from mistakes .
I have seen programmers who make a mistake , have the correct solution pointed out to them , say , “ huh , wonder why it did n’t work for me ” , and go on their merry way , none - the - wiser .
Once their code is working “ the way it should ” they ’re done .
They do n’t care why or how–it works and that ’s enough .
It ’s not enough !
Understand the mistake , what fixed it , and why .
Good judgement comes from experience , and experience comes from bad judgement .
– Fred Brooks
Obviously , some balance has to be struck here .
You cannot learn everything –it simply is n’t possible .
Our profession is becoming increasingly specialized because there is simply too much out there .
I also think that in some respects , you need to love learning just for the sake of learning .
Detail - orientedness
Developing software with today ’s technologies is all about the details .
Maybe in 100 years , software will progress to the point where it can write itself , be fully component - pluggable , self - documenting , self - testing , and then … there wo n’t be any programmers .
But until that comes along ( if ever ) , get used to paying attention to a lot of details .
To illustrate : pick a feature of any software product , and try to think of all the work that would have to be done to change it in some way .
For anything non-trivial , you could probably come up with a list of a hundred discrete tasks : modifying the UI ( which includes graphics , text , localization , events , customization , etc. ) , unit tests , algorithms , interaction with related components , and on and on , each discrete step being broken into sub-steps .
I have always found that plans are useless , but planning is indispensable .
– Dwight Eisenhower
Here ’s a problem , though : few humans can keep every single task in their head , especially over time .
Thankfully , detail - orientedness does not necessarily mean being able to mentally track each and every detail .
It means that you develop a mental pattern to deal with them .
For example , the steps of changing a piece of software could be :
Thoroughly understand what the code is doing and why Look for any and all dependencies and interactions with this code
Have a well - thought - out mental picture of how it fits together .
Examine the consequences of changing the feature .
Update all related code that needs to ( and repeat this cycle for those components )
Update auxiliary pieces that might depend on this code ( build system , installer , tests , documentation , etc. )
Test and repeat .
An example : I find that as I ’m working on a chunk of code , I realize there are several things I need to do after I ’m finished with my immediate task .
If I do n’t do them , the software will break .
If I try to remember all of them , one will surely slip by the wayside .
I have a few choices here :
Defer until later , while trying to remember them all Do them immediately Defer until later , after writing them down
Each of these might be useful in different circumstances .
Well … maybe not # 1 .
I think that ’s doomed to failure from the start and creates bad habits .
If the secondary tasks are short , easy , and well - understood , just do them immediately and get back to your primary task .
However , if you know they ’ll require a lot of work , write them down .
I prefer a sturdy engineering notebook in nearly all cases , but text files , Outlook tasks , notes , OneNote , bug tracking systems , and other methods can all work together to enable this .
The more experience you have , the easier you ’ll be able to track the details you need to worry about .
You ’ll also analyze them quicker , but you will always need some way of keeping track of what you need to do next .
There are simply too many details .
Effective organization is a key ability of any good software engineer .
Another aspect of paying attention to details is critical thinking .
Critical thinking implies a healthy skepticism about everything you do .
It is particularly important as you examine the details of your implementation , designs , or plans .
It ’s the ability to pull out of those details what is important , what is correct , or on the other hand , what is garbage and should be thrown out .
It also guides when you should use well - known methods of development , and when you need to come up with a novel solution to a hard problem .
Adaptability
“ Enjoying success requires the ability to adapt .
Only by being open to change will you have a true opportunity to get the most from your talent . ”
– Nolan Ryan
Change happens .
Get used to it .
This is a hard one for me , to tell the truth .
I really , really like having a plan and following it , adapting it to my needs , not those of others .
The fact is , in software development , the project you end up writing will not be the one you started .
This can be frustrating if you do n’t know how to handle it .
To become adaptive first requires a change in mind set .
This mind set says that change is inevitable , it ’s ok , and you ’re ready for it .
How do you become ready for it ?
This is a whole other topic in itself , and I will probably devote a separate essay for it .
Other than the shift in mind set , start using techniques and technologies that enable easy change .
Things like unit testing , code coverage , and refactoring all enable easier modification of code .
In war as in life , it is often necessary when some cherished scheme has failed , to take up the best alternative open , and if so , it is folly not to work for it with all your might .
– Winston Churchill
For me , the first step in changing my mind set is to not get frustrated every time things change ( “ But you specifically said we were NOT going to implement the feature to work this way ! ” ) .
Passion
I think passion is up there with humility in importance .
It ’s so fundamental , that without it , the others do n’t matter .
Anyone can dabble , but once you ’ve made that commitment , your blood has that particular thing in it , and it ’s very hard for people to stop you .
– Bill Cosby
It ’s also the hardest to develop .
I ’m not sure if it ’s innate or not .
In my own case , I think my passion developed at a very early age .
It ’s been there as long as I remember , even if I had periods of not doing much with it .
I ’ve interviewed dozens of prospective developers at my current job , and this is the one thing I see consistently lacking .
So many of them are in it just for another job .
If that ’s all you want , just a job to pay the bills , so be it .
( Of course , I have to ask , if that ’s the case , why are you reading this article ? )
One person with passion is better than forty people merely interested .
– E. M. Forster
There ’s a world of difference between someone who just programs and someone who loves to program .
Someone who just programs will probably not be familiar with the latest tools , practices , techniques , or technologies making their way down the pipeline .
They wo n’t think about programming outside of business hours .
On the weekends , they do their best to forget about computers .
They have no personal projects , no favorite technologies , no blogs they like to read , and no drive to excel .
They have a hard time learning new things and can be a large burden on an effective development team .
Ok , that ’s maybe a bit of exaggeration , but by listing the counterpoints , it ’s easier to see symptoms of someone who does have passion :
Thinks and breaths technology
Reads blogs about programming
Reads books about programming
Writes a blog about programming
Has personal projects
These personal projects are more important than the boring stuff at work
Keeps up with latest technologies for their interests
Pushes for implementation of the latest technologies ( not blindly , of course )
Goes deep in technical problems .
Not content with merely coding to spec .
Needs an outlet of creativity , whether it be professional ( software design ) or personal ( music , model building , LEGO building , art , etc . )
Thinks of the world in terms of Star Trek
Just kidding on the last one …
… ( maybe )
That ’s my list .
It ’s taken a few months to write this , and I hope it ’s genuinely useful to someone , especially new , young software engineers just getting started .
This is a hard industry , but it should also be fun .
Learning these attributes , changing your mind set , and consciously deciding to become the engineer and programmer you want to be are the first steps .
And also part of every step thereafter .
Nobody is born with any of these –they are developed , practiced , and honed to perfection over a lifetime .
There is no better time to start than now .

But the act itself is so rare  1 in 10,000  that a series of drug trials cannot pick up enough cases to allow for adequate analysis .
A drug trial typically lasts weeks to months and may include , at the high end , little more than a couple of hundred patients .
In the case of the epilepsy drugs , the F.D.A. found 4 suicides among some 44,000 people taking the drug in 199 studies , and none among some 28,000 on placebo .
Doctors would have to treat about 500 patients before seeing one case of suicidal thinking or behavior that would not have occurred without the drug .
The agency is now requiring that manufacturers in their studies track suicidal symptoms .
But drug makers traditionally have had little incentive to do so ; on the contrary , in many studies scientists try to screen out suicidal patients and bury any mention of suicide attempts deep in their reports , or with vague language .
To make up for the tiny number of completed suicides , health regulators have used suicide signs , or markers .
But these are not well understood , either .
One of them is suicidal thinking , or “ suicidal ideation . ”
This is recorded in a study when a patient tells a doctor that he or she is feeling suicidal .
It hardly takes a psychiatrist to point out that the act can’t happen without the idea .
But having the idea very rarely leads to the act , as psychiatrists , psychologists and almost anyone who has been a teenager can attest .
Is the person who tells the doctor about the dark thoughts somehow more at risk ?
No one knows .
“ Every psychiatrist with a big practice will have a few suicides , and you ’re going to have people who do n’t say anything about it  and are very much at risk , ” Dr. John Davis , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago , said .
Lanny Berman , executive director of the American Association of Suicidology , said in an interview that research suggests that about a quarter of suicides are impulsive : the idea strikes and the person acts quickly .
Studies of hospitalized patients have found that many who go on to take their own lives deny to doctors any thoughts of it , he said .
“ We just do n’t know enough about the relationship ” between the thoughts and the behavior , Dr. Berman said .

There are so many things that are so very wrong with Rudy that it should be easy to articulate most of them in bite size pieces that would stick with the general or voting public .
Generally , they all focus on Rudy ’s incredible lack of good judgment and poor decision making on very important matters .
Even more important , however , is the fact that his one major perceived strength – strong on crime and " national security " – can so very easily be knocked down by highlighting his close relationship with a corrupt police chief .
The purposeful distancing from his campaign by his own children leaves the door open to really stick in the side of the fundies or other republicans who claim " moral or family values " to be very important for their vote .
there are some real good juicy tidbits of just how good a father Rudy is in this article from March :
Mr. Giuliani ’s relationship with Andrew has grown strained and distant since his very public and bitter divorce from Andrew ’s mother , Donna Hanover , and his marriage to Judith Nathan , according to Andrew and others familiar with the relationship .
---snip---
" There ’s obviously a little problem that exists between me and his wife , " the younger Mr. Giuliani said .
" And we ’re trying to figure that out .
But as of right now it ’s not working as well as we would like . "
Andrew Giuliani said he would not participate in his father ’s campaign , saying his devotion to becoming a professional golfer within three years allows no time for distraction .
---snip---
Some campaign
Web sites highlight pictures of candidates with family members , but Mr. Giuliani ’s does not mention his children , though it includes photographs and mentions of Ms. Nathan .
---snip--- Mr. Giuliani once prided himself on attending all his children ’s events and went to Andrew ’s high school football games and Caroline ’s plays .
But he stopped at some point after his marriage to Ms. Nathan in 2003 .
He missed his son ’s graduation , in 2005 , and his daughter ’s plays in the last 18 months , said people who attended those events .
Let ’s be clear here – this is not a knock on his children , nor is it anything that will drag them into the spotlight .
Frankly , it is n’t even ABOUT his children , really .
The point here is that Rudy does n’t even mention his children on his campaign website , and does n’t even attend his children ’s major life events
Now , let ’s look at Rudy and his corrupt / indicted buddy Bernard Kerik .
Well , for starters , the corrupt former Police Chief was CEO of Giuliani - Kerik LLC , an affiliate of Giuliani Partners LLC until his embarrassing nomination for Homeland Security Chief .
The key here is that either Rudy truly did not know about the depth of corruption and illegal acts by his good friend ( who he trusted as CEO of one of his companies , and nominated for the top Homeland Security position ) and is therefore unfit for President due to having such poor judgment or he DID know about the depths of Kerik ’s corruption and illegal acts , making him unfit for President based on knowingly associating himself so closely with corrupt criminals .
He was also a former driver for Giuliani and detective before becoming Rudy ’s Police Chief .
Now , say what you want about what a driver knows about his employer , but was n’t the driver of another very famous and wanted man stuck at Gitmo because of his " connections " and had his case heard by the US Supreme Court ?
And lest anyone think that even Guiliani is distancing himself from the corrupt and tax cheat Kerik , there is this little nugget from the LA Times article linked above :
Although Giuliani said last week that the two men had not talked recently , they were professionally and personally close .
The former mayor is godfather to Kerik 's daughter , and Kerik wrote in his autobiography that Giuliani had " made " him .
Press reports have indicated that before Kerik 's appointment as police commissioner , a New York City official briefed Giuliani about Kerik 's ties to a New Jersey waste disposal company that is at the heart of the federal indictment .
Giuliani has not disputed those reports , but maintains he does n't remember the briefings .
And yes , Rudy is defending Kerik , not distancing himself from him .
Once again , if Rudy does n’t remember briefings about Kerik ’s ties to a company at the heart of a federal indictment , then does n’t that cut right to the heart of his " experience and strength in law enforcement " ?
Either he did n’t remember those briefings – pretty damning briefings about one of his closest friends and professional partners – and is n’t really strong on crime and law enforcement or he DID remember those briefings and is a liar who is not strong on crime and law enforcement as he would then be covering up his knowledge of this information .
In either event , it is very telling and shows just what Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani finds important , and who he chooses to align himself closely with .
A corrupt tax cheating criminal over his own children .
What strength against crime and corruption .
And what a great dad – always being there for his children as they enter adulthood .
A great model for his kids – showing them that he cares more about his corrupt buddies than he does about them .
I also have a son at the age of 12 and he plays trumpet .
He got a trumpet this spring and played “ When The Saints Go Marchin ’ In ” “ Happy Birthday ” and “ Theme from Lupin the 3rd ” at his school event .
After that , the trumpet had been left alone , so I asked him to play something else .
He said OK and the song I brought was this :
Nini Rosso’s Il Silenzio
That was the first song I recalled about trumpet 🙂
Trumpet is a hard instrument to play , you know , but he has practiced whole summer , and this is his play today !

Future of Internet Search : Mobile version
( Followed by a previous post “ Future of Internet Search “ )
This is what I wish the internet search will be able to do with a mobile device in the NEAR future .
Touch screen , built in camera , scanner , WiFi , google map ( hopefully google earth ) , google search , image search … all in one device .
Like this way , when you can see a building through it , it gives you the image search result right on the spot .
Choose a building and touch a floor and it tells you more details of the building .
Well , it does n’t have to be a building , but it can be any object you see .
You can use it when you want to know a car model , an insect name , what kind of food is served at a restaurant and how much , who built a bridge , etc. etc .
But as a designer myself , I hope it ’s able to tell me a name of a font of the type I see , the size , color ( in RGB ) , and so on .
It ’s got a scanner built in , so you can use it this way when you want to check the meaning of a word in the newspaper , book , magazine , etc .
It would be much easier to read a real book .
You can use the dictionary , wikipedia , thesaurus and anything else available on the web .
What do you think ?

From correspondents in Baghdad
February 03 , 2008 07:06am
BAGHDAD is drowning in sewage , thirsty for water and largely powerless , an Iraqi official said today in a grim assessment of services in the capital five years after the US - led invasion .
One of three sewage treatment plants is out of commission , one is working at stuttering capacity while a pipe blockage in the third means sewage is forming a foul lake so large it can be seen " as a big black spot on Google Earth , " said Tahseen Sheikhly , civilian spokesman for the Baghdad security plan .
Mr Sheikhly said water pipes , where they exist , are so old it is not possible to pump water at a sufficient rate to meet demands - leaving many neighbourhoods parched .
A sharp deficit of 3000 megawatts of electricity adds to the woes of residents , who have to rely on neighbourhood generators to light up their lives and heat their homes .
" Sewerage , water and electricity are our three main problems , " said Mr Sheikhly .
Many of these problems date back to the Saddam Hussein regime when not enough attention was paid to basic infrastructure , he said , and insurgency , sectarian violence and vandalism since the US - led invasion in March 2003 had further ravaged services in the capital .
More positively , he said , the extensive Baghdad security plan , known as Operation Fardh al - Qanoon ( Imposing Law ) and launched on February 14 last year , was allowing services to be gradually restored .
" After the destruction , there is now the reconstruction , " Mr Sheikhly said .
" We have solved many of the security problems ; now we can focus on rebuilding . "
Education and health across Iraq had both seen improvements , according to US military commander Brigadier - General Jeffrey Dorko of the US Gulf Regional Division , which is engaged in reconstruction projects .
Brig -Gen Dorko said 76 new health clinics - 21 of them in Baghdad - had been built while 1885 new schools had been constructed countrywide and another 1604 repaired .
He said the demand for electricity was likely to outstrip supply for several years because many Iraqi power stations had been damaged or destroyed and commissioning new ones would take anything up to four years .
Demand was increasing , Brig - Gen Dorko said , because Iraqis were increasingly buying electrical appliances as the security situation improved .
Asked if it may take 10 years before Baghdad receives full power 24 hours a day , he said : " There are so many variables ... but I think it will be less than 10 years . "
Mr Sheikhly said once the annual budget is approved by parliament - possibly tomorrow - new funds would allow a faster roll - out of services in the beleaguered capital .
" Reconstruction will be our main focus in 2008 , " he said .

I first debunked this pathetic lie 11 months ago ( a few days after Bush unveiled it ) :
While President Bush was threatening Iran on Monday , he blamed the Iraqi Shiites and Iran for the insurgency .
According to the AFP , Bush said that :
â€ œTehran has been responsible for at least some of the increasing lethality of anti-coalition attacks by providing Shia militia with the capability to build improvised explosive devices in Iraq.â€ 
I know what youâ€™re thinking : President Bush is so stupid that giant mistakes like this should just be taken with a grain of salt .
Even if heâ€™s lashing out at Iran for intervening in the affairs of the Iraqi Shia , surely heâ€™s not blaming the â€œimprovised explosive devicesâ€ that are killing American soldiers and Marines in Iraq on the Shia .
â€¦ Wrong .
Thatâ€™s exactly what he was doing .
â€ œAsked about the linkage to Shiite forces , two US officials who declined to be named pointed to previously reported ties between the government of Iran and radical Iraqi Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr.â€ 
The first problem is that the next day General Pace said he had no evidence whatsoever to back up the presidentâ€™s false assertions and Secretary Rumsfeld just dissembled .
The second is that the last time al - Sadrâ€™s Mahdi Army was in violent conflict with the US was back in August of 2004 and the roadside bomb was not their tactic , those have been the tool of the home - grown Sunni insurgency which is led by the ex-Baâ€™athists and the recently under fire foreign fighter jihadist types .
Though al - Sadr has openly threatened war if America were to bomb Iran , he had been known as the leader of the least Iran- loyal faction among the Iraqi Shia , denouncing the federalism in the new constitution , and insisting on Iraqi nationalism regardless of religion and ethnicity .
Recently , his political fortunes have been said to be on the rise , and though that may be in conflict with some geniusâ€™s plan to spread the war , a leader of the Iraqi insurgency he is not .
Is it possible that Iran is supplying bomb material to the Sunnis , seeing advantage in keeping America bogged down in its fight against the insurgency and forced to allow for expanded Iranian influence in Iraq ?
Sure , as far as I know , but Iâ€™ve seen no evidence of that , and it wasnâ€™t the accusation in this case .
Professor Juan
Cole thrashes that lying , tape recording , Judy Miller - wannabe , Michael R. Gordon of the New York Times about this same garbage today :
Over all , only a fourth of US troops had been killed Baghdad ( 713 or 23.7 percent of about 3000 ) through the end of 2006 .
But US troops are n’t fighting Shiites anyplace else– Ninevah , Diyala , Salahuddin–these are all Sunni areas .
For a fourth of US troops to be being killed or wounded by Shiite EFPs , all of the Baghdad deaths would have to be at the hands of Shiites !
The US military often does not announce exactly where in Baghdad a GI is killed and so I found it impossible to do a count of Sunni versus Shiite neighborhoods .
But we know that Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki was running interference for the Mahdi Army last fall , and it seems unlikely to me that very many US troops died fighting Shiites in Baghdad .
The math of Gordon ’s article does not add up at all if this were Shiite uses of Iran - provided EFPs .
So the unnamed sources at the Pentagon are reduced to implying that Iran is giving sophisticated bombs to its sworn enemies and the very groups that are killing its Shiite Iraqi allies every day .
Get real !
Moreover , there is no evidence of Iranian intentions to kill US troops .
If Iran was giving EFPs to anyone , it was to the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq and its Badr Corps paramilitary , for future use .
SCIRI is the main US ally in Iraq aside from the Kurds .
I do n’t know of US troops killed by Badr , certainly not any time recently .
Do ya’ll think that anyone in congress besides Dr. Paul understands what any of this means ?
The Democrats ’ new head of the House Intelligence Committee does n’t even know what Hezbollah is or that al - Qaeda is made up of radical Sunnis .
Could these idiot so - called “ representatives ” of ours even assemble a coherent thought on this topic in their tiny little brains ?
Coherent enough to counter the Cheney regime on the eve of war ?
Update : MSNBC reports :
“ U.S. officials said there was no evidence of Iranian - made EFPs having fallen into the hands of Sunni insurgents who operate mainly in Anbar province in the west of Iraq , Baghdad and regions surrounding the capital . ”
to what the military officials termed â€œrogue elementsâ€ of the Mahdi Army militia of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
He is a key backer of Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
So : Iran is arming the AMERICAN - BACKED SHI ’ITE GOVERNMENT .
S0 - F%#*ing - what ?!
And how do we even know this much is true ?
“ ‘ We know more than we can show , ’ said one of the senior officials , when pressed for tangible evidence that the EFPs were made in Iran . ”
We have to trust them because they have secret information we do n’t know about .

A new civil court founded in Belgium by human rights organizations will convene for the first time Friday evening and discuss war crimes Israel had allegedly committee during the Second Lebanon War and war crimes the groups claim it is currently committing in the Gaza Strip .
Harsh Criticism EU lawmakers lambast Israel over Gaza Reuters ' Policy of isolation of the Gaza strip has failed at both the political and humanitarian level , ' European Parliament says in adopted resolution .
Livni :
Any indirect support of Hamas weakens those who are interested in reaching a peace agreement EU lawmakers lambast Israel over Gaza
Over the past year , human rights groups , in cooperation with Arab and European intellectuals , have been working on establishing the new court , which will be tasked with addressing different issues related to human rights violations and war crimes .
The first matter on the court 's agenda will be Israel 's operations in the Gaza Strip .
Human rights organizations , as well as the victims of these alleged crimes , will appear before the court .
The court has also invited Israeli representatives to attend the hearing and respond to the accusations .
' Fundamental rights violated '
The Israeli - Arab party Balad , who has also been invited to the discussions as an observer , will be represented by Knesset Member Said Naffaa .
" I intend to bring up for discussion the attorney general 's recent decision to close the case of the October 2000 riots , " said Naffaa , who is already in Brussels .
" I will also raise the subject of the demolition of Israeli - Arabs ' homes by the government .
These may not be war crimes , but they are crimes against the fundamental tights of the State 's citizens , " he added .
According to the MK , " It is too soon to judge what the outcome of these deliberations might be , but it can certainly be said that many operations that had been carried out during the Second Lebanon War , such as the launching of cluster bombs , constitute war crimes .
" Furthermore , actions that take place in the Gaza Strip every day , including the targeting of civilians and denying them proper medical care , are war crimes and should be addressed by international law . "
In the vastness of space , how far is far ?
That question has simmered in G. Fritz Benedict ’s mind since he was 8 , when a family friend took him into the backyard of his home and pointed to the constellation Orion .
“ Something in my brain went ‘ snap , ’ ” said Benedict , an astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin .
The experience set him on a lifelong quest to answer one of the most arcane questions in astronomy :
How exactly do you measure the universe ?
Advertisement
Astronomers have wrestled with the issue for millenniums , and for most of that time they have n’t even come close .
Their calculations have been painstakingly constructed into a framework known as the cosmic distance ladder .
Each rung is made up of a stellar object whose distance is roughly known and can be used to measure the distance of neighboring objects .
The problem is that over cosmic distances , minuscule inaccuracies can compound into huge miscalculations .
Advertisement
“ People say , ‘ What ’s the big deal ? ’ ” said Benedict , a youthful man of 62 with a quick smile and an inexhaustibly detailed mind .
“ I tell them , ‘ What if I handed you a yardstick and told you , ‘ I do n’t know if it ’s 32 or 42 inches long ? ’ ”
Caltech astronomer Shri Kulkarni is more blunt .
“ Astrometry is the fundamental basis of astronomy , ” he said .
“ It ’s the way you know such things as the size of the universe .
Other than that , you know nothing . ”
Benedict ’s quest has taken him on a lonely 30 - year journey filled with bureaucratic roadblocks and technical delays that made him doubt whether he would ever get the chance to make his measurements .
While most of his peers went to work on the big questions of the universe -- uniting gravity and quantum mechanics , searching for extraterrestrial life or figuring out how the universe will end -- Benedict has obsessed over one set of measurements : the distance to a type of star known as a Cepheid .
Advertisement
There ’s been little glory .
And even as the tools of cosmic surveying are reaching once - unimaginable accuracy , American astrometry is fading as students move into sexier topics .
“ There ’s a rather gloomy future , ” lamented retired Yale University astronomer William F. van Altena , the most illustrious astrometrist of his era .
“ This is really a sad state of affairs . ”
Early efforts stumbled
Surveying the universe is mostly an exercise in being wildly wrong .
Advertisement
In the 3rd century B.C. , the mathematician Aristarchus of Samos made one of the earliest attempts to calculate the distance to the sun -- the first rung in the cosmic distance ladder .
Using the apparent similarity in size between the sun and moon , he came up with 4 million miles .
That was off by 89 million .
It took more than 2,000 years for English astronomer Edmond Halley to devise a strategy for a more precise calculation .
Advertisement
Astronomers knew that observers in different parts of the world saw the sun from slightly different angles .
That angular difference , or parallax , could allow scientists to calculate a distance to the sun .
Halley ’s plan was to send scientists around the world to observe the Transit of Venus -- a rare event in which the planet passes across the face of the sun .
Venus would appear to traverse a different part of the sun depending on the observer ’s location .
Its journey would take a different amount of time depending on whether the planet passed over a wide section of the sun or a narrow one .
The elapsed time of the transit , which could vary by several minutes , would indicate the observer ’s viewing angle .
The undertaking proved so difficult that it took until the late 1800s -- almost 150 years after Halley ’s death -- before adequate observations allowed analysts to calculate the distance of about 93 million miles .
Advertisement
Modern astronomers used the parallax method to measure the distance to our nearest starry neighbors , the triple star system Alpha Centauri about four light - years away , or nearly 26 trillion miles .
Instead of observing the stars from two different spots on Earth , they took measurements at two extremes of Earth ’s orbit around the sun .
The parallax technique , however , fails as the angular difference grows too small .
In the 1990s , the European satellite Hipparcos could n’t measure distances beyond about 500 light - years .
To survey deeper parts of the universe , astronomers rely on “ standard candles ” -- objects that shine with a known luminosity , such as the rare exploding stars known as Type 1a supernovas .
Because their brightness is the same , their distance can be calculated by measuring how much the light has dimmed after passing through light - years of dust and gas .
The problem is that there are n’t enough Type 1a supernovas .
Benedict was drawn to an unusual type of pulsating objects that , unlike supernovas , are abundantly scattered through the universe .
Advertisement
“ Cepheids are the flashing ‘ Eat at Joe ’s ’ sign in a galaxy , ” Benedict said .
“ They ’re easy to spot and very satisfying . ”
Astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered in 1912 that the brighter a Cepheid glowed , the more infrequently it pulsed .
Scientists realized that if they could figure out the precise distance to one Cepheid , they could nail down the relationship between the stars ’ intrinsic brightness and period of pulses .
Then they could calculate the distance to any visible Cepheid by measuring its pulses and the dimming of its starlight as its passed through space .
Benedict envisioned them as mileposts of the universe .
Advertisement
New technology crucial
Nailing down the distance to a Cepheid is no easy task , given that the closest is more than 800 light - years away .
It would require technology that was barely imaginable when Benedict was growing up in California and the Middle East , where the family moved after his father took a job as a chemical engineer for an oil company .
They lived for a time in Saudi Arabia .
Desert life in an American compound of 1,400 could be solitary , but there was one saving grace .
He was occasionally allowed to use the town supervisor ’s 10 - inch telescope , at that time the largest in the country .
Advertisement
Benedict took his first astrometry course at the University of Michigan , taught by a tough former World War II Navy captain .
The exacting nature of the work appealed to Benedict ’s sense of order .
He got a doctorate from Northwestern University in Illinois and then found a temporary job as a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin .
His Cepheid quest began in the summer of 1977 .
He was vacationing in Ohio when he got a call from a professor at the university telling him NASA was preparing to put a telescope in orbit , soon to be named Hubble .
There were thousands of ideas for the device , but a small group realized that it would be the perfect instrument to determine the distance to a Cepheid .
Advertisement
Would he be interested in joining the quest ?
The original members of the Space Telescope Astrometry Team were a who ’s who of the field , led by Yale ’s Van Altena .
Benedict , the novice of the group , was chosen because he knew how to select guide stars -- fixed points in space used to hold a telescope in position .
Hubble ’s centerpiece was a massive 94 - inch primary mirror that allowed the 42 - foot - long telescope to bring the universe ’s exotic creatures into sharp focus .
Advertisement
Thousands of scientists were clamoring to use Hubble , but the demand was n’t enough to prevent marathon delays in getting it into space .
The launch , originally set for 1983 , was pushed back when there were problems in grinding the telescope ’s mirror to a precise curvature .
Launch had been rescheduled for late 1986 , but the shuttle fleet was grounded for almost three years after the Challenger exploded in January of that year .
Hubble was finally launched in 1990 , but then fate struck again .
After just a few weeks in space , scientists discovered that Hubble had blurry vision because its main mirror had indeed been ground to the wrong shape .
Engineers fixed it by creating a set of “ glasses ” for the telescope .
Those were installed in 1993 .
Advertisement
As the years passed , the original members of the astrometry team gradually peeled away .
Some members retired ; others took work that they found more rewarding than waiting for observation time on Hubble .
For the next decade , the team worked on perfecting techniques and tackling smaller astrometric projects as they waited to be given the thousands of hours of Hubble time needed for the Cepheid project .
Through attrition , Benedict became the leader of the team .
In 2003 -- 26 years after the astrometry team was assembled -- Benedict received an e-mail from NASA .
The Cepheid project was on .
Advertisement
And the winners are . . .
Benedict chose 10 Cepheids , all within the Milky Way .
The task of analyzing the data from Hubble fell to a former molecular biologist who spent five years studying RNA and DNA sequences in mice for cancer research .
Barbara McArthur joined the astrometric group after answering an ad for a computer analyst ; she was hired thanks to her tirelessly obsessive mind for detail .
The distance measurements relied on Hubble ’s Fine Guidance Sensors , which were designed to lock onto stars so that the telescope ’s camera would hold still .
Advertisement
Benedict selected a group of nearby “ reference stars ” in the same region of the sky as each Cepheid .
By keeping these stars in a constant relative position , the astrometrists could track the apparent motion of the Cepheid as Earth traversed its orbit .
Using Hubble ’s fine eyesight , McArthur , with the help of graduate student Jacob Bean , could calculate a parallax for each Cepheid down to a level of a few milliarcseconds -- the equivalent of measuring a few inches from 1,500 miles away .
It took two years of observations to collect the necessary data .
For every measurement , there were dozens of variables to correct for , such as the heating and cooling of Hubble and the microscopic jiggles of the telescope as it hurtled through space at roughly 17,500 mph .
Over time , each Cepheid seemed to develop its own personality .
“ Some are really ornery , ” McArthur said .
Advertisement
When the parallax measurements were complete , Benedict tackled the problem of determining each Cepheid ’s true brightness using Hubble ’s spectrometer .
Starlight dims as it passes through dust and gas in space .
To determine true brightness , the astrometrists had to figure out how much dimming occurred over that particular stretch of space .
Benedict already knew the true brightness of the reference stars , which were chosen because they were common types with known attributes .
He calculated the amount of dimming to those stars and then adjusted the apparent brightness of each Cepheid .
Benedict plotted the results on a chart that compared the luminosity and frequency of each Cepheid ’s pulses .
If they were true standard candles , the line on a logarithmic graph should shoot like an arrow .
Advertisement
“ To my intense delight , it was a straight line , ” he said .
Their work was complete .
He went the distance
Nearly 30 years had passed since Benedict joined the Cepheid project .
By now , he was the last of the original team members and , perhaps , the only one in the cosmos who could truly appreciate the end point of so much work and waiting .
Advertisement
The results were published in April in the Astrophysical Journal .
The new calculations narrow the error margin on Cepheid distances from as much as 40 % to less than 10 % .
For example , the distance to the Cepheid known as L Carina was honed from between 1,000 to 2,000 light - years away , to an estimated 1,400 to 1,600 light - years .
Wendy L. Freedman , director of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena , Calif. , said the Cepheid distances also would help refine the Hubble Constant , one of the key values in cosmology that describes the rate at which the universe is expanding .
The constant ’s 10 % error margin could be cut in half , Freedman said , bringing science closer to answering such fundamental questions as how much dark energy and matter exists in the universe .
Still , even with the improvements , the yardstick of the universe remains an imperfect tool whose minuscule error margins can amount to unimaginable distances .
Advertisement
Benedict , whose hair turned gray , then nearly white as he waited to measure the Cepheids , is unperturbed that so much work remains .
“ Science is in the details , ” he said .
He has already begun thinking about calculating the Cepheid distances to the microarcsecond , which is like measuring the thickness of a coin from the moon .

Armed police have been deployed on the streets of Islamabad
The acting head of the party of exiled former PM Nawaz Sharif was arrested , senior lawyers have been detained and the country 's chief justice sacked .
PM Shaukat Aziz said that hundreds of people had been held , and the emergency would last " as long as is necessary " .
Scheduled elections could be delayed for up to a year , he added .
But no decision had been made over the date of any election , he added , insisting the government remained committed to the democratic process .
Speaking late on Saturday , Gen Musharraf defended his decision , saying he could not allow the country to " commit suicide " .
He said Pakistan was in a crisis caused by militant violence and a judiciary which had paralysed the government .
The moves came as the Supreme Court was due to rule on the legality of Gen Musharraf 's October election victory .
Threat of force
Police and paramilitaries manned checkpoints around the parliament and presidential palace in the capital , Islamabad , on Sunday morning .
After a calm start , a few dozen people staged a brief protest near the parliament building before police moved in to break up the gathering .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The world is entering into 2008 and still we are at 1958
Nasir , Islamabad
Your views on emergency West faces new dilemma
More protests are expected throughout the rest of the day , he adds , with police appearing ready to use force against unauthorised demonstrations .
Tough new media restrictions are controlling the news available throughout Pakistan : all non-state TV stations and some radio channels , including international services such as BBC World TV , have been taken off air .
Independent newspapers have been allowed to continue publishing , but Gen Musharraf 's decree severely limits what they can report .
Local newspapers and key opposition leader Benazir Bhutto accused Gen Musharraf of bringing in martial law without formally declaring it .
But Pakistan 's attorney general said the prime minister and parliament remained in place and the civilian government would continue to function .
Opposition anger
Speaking at a news conference , Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said there had been 400 to 500 " preventative arrests " since the emergency was declared .
Before he was taken away by police in the central city of Multan , Javed Hashmi , of Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League , said Gen Musharraf would pay a price for his decision to restrict freedoms .
" Musharraf 's days are numbered .
Time has come to end the political role of the army , " he said .
EMERGENCY RESTRICTIONS
Constitutional safeguards on life and liberty curtailed Police get wide powers of arrest Suspects can be denied access to lawyers Freedom of movement restricted Private TV stations taken off air New rules curtail media coverage of suicide bombings or militant activity Chief justice replaced , others made to swear oath of loyalty Supreme Court banned from rescinding emergency order
In pictures : Emergency rule Declaration : Full text
Ms Bhutto , who recently returned to Pakistan from self - imposed exile , flew back to Karachi from a trip abroad upon hearing news of Gen Musharraf 's decision .
She confirmed that troops were not surrounding her Karachi home , contrary to some earlier reports , and laid out her demands for the holding free and fair elections .
" We the political parties are calling for the restoration of the constitution , and for the holding of the elections under an independent election commission , " she told the BBC .
There is no word yet whether she plans to enter dialogue with the president or to lead opposition to his rule .
President defiant
In a TV address on Saturday evening , Gen Musharraf explained his decision , saying the current situation had forced him into making " some very painful decisions " .
" Extremists are roaming around freely in the country , and they are not scared of law - enforcement agencies , " the president said .
" Inaction at this moment is suicide for Pakistan and I cannot allow this country to commit suicide . "
Court issue
Following the announcement of emergency rule , the country 's chief justice was replaced and the Supreme Court surrounded by troops .
Gen Musharraf moved quickly to appoint a new chief justice
The Supreme Court was to decide whether Gen Musharraf was eligible to run for re-election last month while remaining army chief .
Fears were growing in the government that the court could rule against Gen Musharraf .
Pakistani lawyers announced they would strike on Monday in protest at the president 's decision .

As is typical in Washington , the administration has solved the crisis in Iraq by redefining success .
No longer is the goal a liberal , multi-ethnic nation ready to lead the rest of the Middle East towards democracy , enlightenment , and the American Way .
Now the objective is preserving a nominal country in which the various sectarian groups minimize violence by living apart and ignoring the inefficient , ineffective , corrupt , and largely irrelevant central government .
A situation that in 2003 would have been considered a grotesque failure is now treated as victory , a product of the far - sighted " surge , " advanced by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , who is ready to initiate as many new wars as necessary to continue promoting democracy , enlightenment , and the American Way .
Bombs Away !
With the administration busy rewriting history , it is worth remembering what the neocon ivory tower warriors promised and delivered in Iraq .
Charles Ferguson , an internet entrepreneur with an interest in foreign policy produced a documentary on Iraq  essentially how the administration mismanaged virtually every decision , big and small .
No End In Sight draws from the research for the television show and is filled with interviews with people ranging from policymakers to front line soldiers .
Ferguson , who originally leaned in favor of the war , has painted a portrait of arrogance and incompetence more devastating than anything coming from the Democratic National Committee .
To read Ferguson ’s summary is to marvel at the sheer stupidity of the so - called " adults " running U.S. foreign policy .
Writes Ferguson :
" They wo n’t start any planning for the occupation at all until two months before the war , and then they ’ll start completely from scratch .
They ’ll exclude the State Department and CIA people who know the most about the country .
They wo n’t have telephones or email for months after they arrive in Iraq .
Our troops will stand by as nearly every major building in the country is looted , destroyed , and burned . "
After tossing millions of bureaucrats and soldiers onto the street , the administration was shocked to find a growing insurgency .
Yet as opposition builds , writes Ferguson , " they will deny its existence and refuse to negotiate , even when leaders of the insurgency signal a desire for compromise .
They will airlift $ 12 billion in hundred - dollar bills into the country , with no accounting controls , and three - quarters of it will remain permanently unaccounted for . "
Twenty - somethings will be vetted to write Iraqi laws based on their opposition to abortion rather than their knowledge of Arabic .
And as sectarian violence swells , the administration and its acolytes will insist that the media is ignoring all of the good news  trash being collected , harbors being dredged , cell phones being used .
Had tens of thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands , or perhaps millions , of Iraqis not been wounded , maimed , and killed because of the administration ’s misbegotten adventure , the Iraq saga would be a comedy routine .
But there is nothing funny about the catastrophe that has enveloped Iraq , courtesy the neocon war party .
Ferguson ’s comprehensive volume methodically details the idiocies that masqueraded as U.S. policy .
The war itself went well , but was merely the first installment of a lengthy conflict that the neocons never expected to have to fight .
A matter of almost religious doctrine was the belief that Washington merely had to show up to rule .
George Packer , a journalist who helped convince Ferguson to make his documentary , observed that the administration idea of installing Ahmed Chalabi as president and then cutting troop levels to 30,000 " was a ludicrous plan .
It was a plan that did n’t begin to grapple with how difficult and dangerous and complex these postwar situations are . "
But then , " Donald Rumsfeld and the officials under him decided that they were not going to be deterred by history " or the contrary experience of any prior conflict .
Ferguson ’s book well covers the many almost legendary examples of administration idiocy and hubris .
Refusing to seriously plan for the occupation .
Failing to involve anyone knowledgeable about Iraq in what little planning was done .
Allowing the country to descend into lawless chaos .
Creating a top - down occupation essentially run by College Republicans and largely excluding Iraqis .
Generating tens of thousands of recruits for the insurgency by discharging the military and barring even minor Baathists from government jobs .
Discounting the idea that a serious insurgency could develop .
Exacerbating sectarian divisions through occupation policy .
Helplessly watching the explosion in sectarian violence .
Through it all the Bush administration remained a fantasyland in which only good news was tolerated .
The knock on President George W. Bush , notes Ferguson , is not that he was disengaged , but that he was involved in the major decisions .
Alas , his involvement occurred in a different dimension , cleansed of inconvenient ideas , facts , and conclusions .
For instance , Feisal al - Istrabadi , for a time Iraq ’s ambassador to the United Nations , observed : " those of us who were saying things that were different , we were not allowed .
There was a  I was going to say a glass barrier , but there was a concrete barrier .
Our voices were silenced .
Those who were not on board the ideological , you know , the sweets - and - flowers agenda , nobody wanted to hear from us . "
Similar is the account of Barbara Bodine , a senior foreign service officer employed in Baghdad by the occupation .
She explains , " with this administration , the difference is they do n’t want to hear the inconvenient fact .
And if removing you , excluding you , from the meeting or the process or the structure is the way not to have to deal with your inconvenience , then that ’s what they ’ll do .
They prefer an echo chamber . "
Even when good advice got through , it had no apparent impact .
Larry Diamond of the Hoover Institution , who worked in the occupation authority , says that he " strongly urged the administration to make a clear , emphatic , declaratory statement that we were not seeking permanent military bases in Iraq , and would not seek them . "
But no such declaration was made because the administration in fact expected to gain permanent bases for use against any state in the region that refused to kowtow to Washington ’s demands .
Even now it is not clear that the administration has abandoned its goal of a long - term military presence in Iraq .
Unfortunately , Iraqi civilians and American service personnel were unable to enjoy the fantasies being built in the sky by administration officials .
They lived on and patrolled the bloody streets of Baghdad and other cities , towns , and villages across Iraq .
" By 2006 , killings were so numerous that most were no longer reported , and it became increasingly difficult to assess the level or the source of violence , " writes Ferguson .
Far from feeling liberated , average Iraqis complained to Ferguson that life was worse than under Saddam Hussein , that the value of life had become " trivial . "
Antagonism towards the U.S. was fueled by occupation practices .
Ferguson notes that " If one combines raids , arrests , detentions , and shootings of civilians , it seems likely that by 2007 , U.S. military conduct had directly affected , wounded , or killed over 100,000 Iraqis , and possibly well over 200,000 . "
Yet U.S. actions " seem to have been frequently indiscriminate or misguided , " with the result " that the military ’s error rate was quite high in its dealings with Iraqis , both friendly and hostile . "
But such errors should come as no surprise for an administration that never expected to have to fight a guerrilla conflict .
Over time U.S. forces got much better , but by then the insurgency , as well as al - Qaeda terrorist attacks , had burgeoned .
Increasing American force levels last year sharply reduced the levels of violence , but , like all the king ’s horses and all the king ’s men , could not put the Iraqi Humpty Dumpty back together again .
Ferguson explains :
" As of late 2007 , Iraq is a quasi - warlord society with a paralyzed central government whose individual ministries are controlled by various political parties and militias .
The country is denominated by four regional power struggles , which often approach open warfare , conducted through a combination of politics , corruption , crime , and militia violence .
…
Iraq is in a state of near civil war , which is barely contained by the American military presence .
The country suffers from an extremely high level of criminal violence and pervasive corruption .
The south and Baghdad are predominantly controlled by fundamentalist Shiite militias and their affiliated political parties .
American occupation forces have been progressively marginalized .
The recent American troop surge is generally regarded as having produced a substantial but unsustainable reduction in violence , without altering the fundamental processes under way in the country , including continuing ethnic cleansing , geographical segregation along sectarian lines , deteriorating infrastructure , and political paralysis . "
No End in Sight covers all of these problems in detail .
The discussion of casualties , both American and Iraqi , is particularly poignant .
Moreover , four to five million Iraqis have fled their homes  one - sixth or more of the population .
The equivalent number in the U.S. would be more than 50 million .
Harvard ’s Samantha Power makes the telling observation that " One of the elements that kind of unites the U.S. relationship to Iraq across time is a disregard or just a nonconsideration of the welfare of the Iraqi people . "
Indeed , one has to believe that there is a special level of Hell reserved for ivory tower social engineers who cavalierly initiate war with little concern for the likely consequences on those unwillingly providing the battlefield .
Equally important is Ferguson ’s assessment of the impact on the U.S. and the world .
The ultimate financial cost of the war to the American people is likely to exceed $ 2 trillion .
Washington has strengthened Iran , turning it into the region ’s principal Islamic power .
And the Bush administration ’s botched preventive war has exacerbated the problem of terrorism .
Jessica Stern of Harvard told Ferguson : " The United States has facilitated the next iteration of that international jihadi movement .
We have given that movement the best possible training . "
Contrary to the fantasies prevalent in Washington , the terrorists will not all stay in Iraq to be killed .
Rather , observes Stern , " This is not a kind of roach motel , where we gather the world ’s international jihadis and kill them in Iraq .
They will escape from that motel , and we ’ve already seen that in Jordan  they are now very well - trained and very angry .
And I believe we will eventually see them on Western streets . "
Moreover , the war has created more terrorists .
There is no fixed number of jihadists who must be killed .
Rather , there is a large pool of potential terrorists who are motivated in part by what the U.S. government does .
The war in Iraq has created yet another grievance .
Thus , complains Stern , " the war in Iraq has really facilitated bin Laden ’s effors to continue to spread that jihadi movement internationally . "
Perhaps the book ’s most sobering conclusion is that the so - called " surge " can not be sustained .
Iraqi observers seem to be particularly skeptical .
Violence is down , yes , but they expect it to eventually rise since little has changed about Iraqi society or governance .
Larry Diamond makes much the same point .
He contends : " unless we get a political consensus among the principal Iraqi parties on what the rules of the game and the constitutional structure are going to be on these and related realms , there is no chance of stabilizing the country .
And the most that we can do is what we are doing there now , which is basically become the police force for the country  they certainly do n’t have one  and hold up the floor . "
And we are doing this " so these different Iraqi political parties , factions , militias , incipient warlords and whatnot , can seek to corner power and resources in the uncertainty of the current situation and with the extraordinary greed that characterizes political and military actors in this situation . "
This does not warrant the sacrifice of more American lives or waste of more American treasure , he persuasively argues .
Which is the bottom line that the hawks who desire to fight to the last soldier and Marine must eventually confront .
Getting out of Iraq obviously is the most important goal of U.S. policy today .
The war was a horrible mistake based on flawed intelligence with horrendous humanitarian consequences for Iraqis .
It is bleeding precious lives from patriotic communities across the U.S. and generating a flood of red ink for an already spendthrift government .
The misbegotten conflict has weakened America , degraded American security , and wrecked America ’s international reputation .
There is an equally important longer - term objective .
Never again .
Never again a war of choice .
Never again a war based on fantasy expectations .
Never again a war without realistic planning .
Never again a war of ideology against interest .
Never again a " humanitarian " war .
Never again the public turning government over to crackpot ideologues , giving them the power to kill , bomb , and destroy .
Never again .
Mr Bernanke said the Fed would be prepared to act decisively Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke has said that the outlook for the US economy in 2008 has worsened .
His comments in Washington come after leading investment banks warned that the US was heading for a recession .
However , Mr Bernanke said the central bank was willing to act in a decisive and timely manner to ensure the economy remained on an even keel .
Analysts said this was a strong sign that the Fed would cut interest rates again when it meets later this month .
Substantive action
The bank has cut rates three times since last summer , most recently in December to 4.25 % - the lowest level in two years .
It is probably likely to solidify expectations ... that the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points
David Resler , chief economist , Nomura Securities During his speech on Thursday , Mr Bernanke said the Fed was prepared to " take substantive additional action as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks " .
David Resler , chief economist at Nomura Securities International , said Mr Bernanke 's remarks came as little surprise .
" It is probably likely to solidify expectations ... that the Fed will ( cut rates by ) 50 basis points ... now more people will think that way , " he said .
US stocks were boosted by the news as investors were buoyed by the prospect of future interest rate cuts .
The Dow Jones industrial average added 117.78 points , or 0.92 % , at 12,853.09 .
Standard & Poor 's 500 Index added 0.79 % and Nasdaq rose 0.56 % .
Housing Mr Bernanke said recent information suggested " that the baseline for real activity in 2008 has worsened and the downside risks to growth have become more pronounced " .
The US is facing the twin threats of how to tackle a slowing housing market and lower consumer spending while at the same time addressing inflation as oil and food prices rise .
The Federal Reserve is not currently forecasting a recession
Ben Bernanke , chairman , Federal Reserve
In particular , Mr Bernanke highlighted the impact the slowing housing market , and specifically the sub - prime mortgage crisis , was having on the wider economy .
With banks having to write off billions of dollars of investments linked to sub - prime debt - loans taken out by people with bad or little credit histories - this has made them reluctant to lend , limiting the availability of credit , Mr Bernanke explained .
He added that the financial situation " remains fragile , and many markets remain impaired " , saying that much uncertainty remained about the exposure of major banks to the credit crisis .
But he said that while banks had become more restrictive in their lending , it was in their best interest to find a systematic way to restructure loans .
" This is not a situation that can be dealt with one mortgage at a time , " he said .
Recession ?
As well as underlining sub - prime problems , the Fed boss cited higher oil prices , lower equity prices as factors that could further dent consumer spending .
During his speech at a Women in Housing and Finance lunch , he also said that if the labour market continued to worsen , this could further add strain to the economy .
He singled out recent poor employment data that showed only 18,000 jobs were created in December .
" Should the labour market deteriorate , the risks to consumer spending would rise , " he said .
But when asked if he was concerned about a possible recession he said : " The Federal Reserve is not currently forecasting a recession . "
Earlier this week , Merrill Lynch controversially said the US had already entered a recession , while Goldman Sachs has also suggested it is heading in that direction .
However on Thursday , the Institute of International Finance ( IIF ) said it predicted the US economy would expand by 2.3 % in 2008 , which implied that a recession " could be avoided " .
This figure exceeds both the World Bank and IMF 's maximum forecasts of 1.9 % growth for the year .

Chile has been awarded the Guinness World Record for the largest swimming pool on the planet .
The gigantic lagoon is located in the resort of San Alfonso del Mar in Algarrobo city , on the southern coast of Chile .
Guinness Book of World Records has named it the largest pool in the world .
How big is it ?
One over a kilometer long ( 3,323 feet ) , covering 20 acres and containing 250,000 cubic meters of water .
The ocean water is too cold most of the year and the pool is kept at a refreshing 79 degrees during the summer .
While there is plenty of room to swim in the pool , visitors can also cruise across the lagoon on small boats .
The pool took five years to build , cost nearly £ 1 billion and the annual maintenance bill will be £ 2 million .
It can harvest , filter and permanently recirculate ocean water by itself .
The man -made saltwater lagoon has been attracting huge crowds to the San Alfonso del Mar resort at Algarrobo since it opened last month .
Its turquoise waters are so crystal clear that you can see the bottom even in the deep end .

Software crackers crave a challenge
In some corners of cyberspace they are considered gods , but Australian researchers have found social kudos means little to software crackers .
Instead Australian National University researcher Dr Sigi Goode has discovered the challenge of cracking a software code is everything .
Goode , a business information systems expert from the College of Business and Economics , has done the first study of its kind into what motivates software crackers .
Software crackers specialise in modifying copyright software to remove protection , an illegal activity that Goode learned more about by hopping online .
Cracking differs from the more general term hacking , which can mean everything from a clever fix to a software problem to illegally gaining access to secure networks , depending on the context .
Goode contacted software crackers through advertisements on five cracking forums , which attracted people from the US and Europe .
His research included an online survey and online interviews using Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) .
Goode says in general software crackers are aged under 25 , educated and skilled .
But he was surprised to find that only 25 % of his study participants worked in IT with occupations including a cook , students , a software manager and a self - employed small business owner .
Goode says software crackers appear to be motivated by the challenge of cracking software and the harder a piece of software is to crack the more enjoyable the experience .
Celebrity status
But he found that , ironically , the crackers are not supporters of piracy and believe people should pay for software they use .
Although social status is a minor factor in their actions , well - known crackers gain celebrity status .
" Sometimes when ppl [ sic ] come in to my channels on IRC , they talk to me like I am ' god all mighty [ sic ] ' , " one participant told Goode .
While most software crackers acknowledge their actions are illegal , few feel sympathy for companies selling more expensive software products .
He says many respondents suggest companies are already earning a great deal of money and that they are doing the company a favour by introducing people to their software .
Cost of piracy
Goode says the role of the software cracker in the distribution of pirated software is critical as software cannot be pirated while copy protection is in place .
He says in 1999 the business PC application software industry accounted for worldwide revenue of US $ 21.6 billion .
That same year estimated losses due to software piracy in the business sector were US $ 12.2 billion alone , Goode says .
Now , the disclosure of the tapes and their destruction in 2005 have become just the public spectacle the agency had sought to avoid .
To the already fierce controversy over whether the Bush administration authorized torture has been added the specter of a cover-up .
The Justice Department , the C.I.A. ’s inspector general and Congress are investigating whether any official lied about the tapes or broke the law by destroying them .
Still in dispute is whether any White House official encouraged their destruction and whether the C.I.A. deliberately hid them from the national Sept. 11 commission .
But interviews with two dozen current and former officials , most of whom would speak about the classified program only on the condition of anonymity , revealed new details about why the tapes were made and then eliminated .
Their accounts show how political and legal considerations competed with intelligence concerns in the handling of the tapes .
The discussion about the tapes took place in Congressional briefings and secret deliberations among top White House lawyers , including a meeting in May 2004 just days after photographs of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq had reminded the administration of the power of such images .
The debate stretched over the tenure of two C.I.A. chiefs and became entangled in a feud between the agency ’s top lawyers and its inspector general .
The tapes documented a program so closely guarded that President Bush himself had agreed with the advice of intelligence officials that he not be told the locations of the secret C.I.A. prisons .
Had there been no political or security considerations , videotaping every interrogation and preserving the tapes would make sense , according to several intelligence officials .
“ You could n’t have more than one or two analysts in the room , ” said A. B. Krongard , the C.I.A. ’s No. 3 official at the time the interrogations were taped .
“ You want people with spectacular language skills to watch the tapes .
You want your top Al Qaeda experts to watch the tapes .
You want psychologists to watch the tapes .
You want interrogators in training to watch the tapes . ”
Signs are posted in the screening area of the airport that joking references to violent acts and terrorism are prohibited .
These are understandably not protected , as they could conceivably be analogous , legally , to shouting " fire " in a crowded theater , i.e. speech which could cause public panic .
A sticker ( a rectangle about 2 1 / 2 inches by 5 inches , plain black - and - white print and available at pdamerica.org ) reading " Impeach Bush and Cheney " could in no way be construed as a menace to public safety .
I am a member of the Northeast Impeachment Coalition , and I have been traveling through the Southwestern U.S. for about a week now wearing the sticker in public places at all times .
I have received almost overwhelmingly favorable reaction .
( see my post Report From Otero County )
My reasons for favoring impeachment are that George Bush and Dick Cheney have violated their oaths of office to " uphold , defend , and protect the Constitution " by illegally detaining American citizens indefinitely , without charges and without counsel , thus violating the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy and public trial , and by violating the Fourth Amendment protection against search without a warrant in the NSA surveillance scandal .
Not even as staunch a right - wing violator of civil liberties as John Ashcroft could stomach the breadth of the NSA 's actions when asked to sign - off from his hospital bed .
Finally , I favor the impeachment of George Bush and Dick Cheney for lying to Congress in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
In Houston last week the coffin of a soldier killed in Iraq came off our plane after we had landed .
I will not fail such an example of courage , which makes my own paltry attempts to do the right thing as American pale in comparison .
Up to and including being refused boarding , I will not remove my sticker , and will assert the rights which I am sure this soldier believed he was fighting for .
I now await the call for boarding my next flight , to Pittsburgh .
Although the majority may feel as I do , it takes but the ignorance of a few in positions of power to suppress and control the rest of us .
I ask for assistance in contacting AP to further report on this incident , and any which may be in store for me while in transit .

Shortly after I returned from Turkey , weird yellow streaks across my printed pages reminded me that I needed to replace my color ink cartridge .
Buying inkjet cartridges is rough .
Modern ink cartridges cost US $ 33 , and it seems like a shame to toss out the whole cartridge for want of a single color .
Unfortunately , printing a resume or portfolio usually requires more than two of the primary colors , so I broke down and headed to the store .
There , next to my C6578D , was an OnTel Universal Inkjet Refill Kit .
It was n't cheap , but it was $ 7 less than the price of a new cartridge , and seemed to promise more than one refill .
I decided to try it !
Inside the box were 3 bottles of ink , a bottle of cleaning solution ( solvent ) , a 2 - part syringe , and a 74 page instruction manual .
I had to assemble the two - part syringe .
I consider myself an expert at computers and printers , so I disregarded the instructions & forged ahead with refilling my red and yellow ink .
Mark helped me with the photos .
Three of these 25 ml bottles were full of uncut , pharmacy - grade ink .
They have a street value of about $ 8 each .
Mark could see my hands shaking , but anyone would be nervous with this much product sitting on their kitchen table .
We heated up the yellow ink with a common household lighter ...
... and pulled it through a cotton wad to remove any impurities .
Mark and I both tested the ink .
By the time I prepared the bleach - solution for sterilizing the syringe , Mark was passed out cold .
This was some of the highest - quality ink either of us had ever tried .
Despite an incredible feeling of calm , we had n't actually gotten any closer to refilling the cartridge .
I decided to try reading the manual .
RTFM
Of course , only one page in the manual applied to my particular print cartridge , and about four pages had general information ... the most repeated of which was " Immediately refill any empty cartridges " ... in fact , it was on almost every single page of the instruction booklet .
I find this kind of information annoying ... I mean , it is n't like you are going to buy a refill kit while your ink cartridge is still full ... it is just frustrating , like buying a book on " how to beat that DUI " , and have " do n't drink and drive " on every page ... IT IS TOO LATE !
Of course , the ink people just put those warnings there so that you do n't return the kit when the refill job does n't work .
According to the manual , the first step is to pierce the green refilling holes with a ball - point pen .
We were going to circumvent Hewlett Packard 's security measures with a cheap Bic !
The ball - point did n't work , so Mark tried a ball - pein .
The holes were open in no time .
I slowly injected about 10 milliliters of yellow and red ( Magenta ) ink into the proper holes .
I could feel some resistance as the needle went in .
There was a mysterious ink - sponge inside .
Some ink oozed out of the top , but it was n't too big of a mess .
I never liked those pants anyway .
The futuristic sponge held the ink wonderfully !
The ink would n't drip out , even when held upside - down !
I wonder if HP makes coffee cups ...
I re-installed the cartridge and began a long , frustrating series of test prints .
The only color that was working properly was yellow .
I guessed it was because the empty cartridge had been sitting around for too long .
If only I could go back in time and read the refilling manual before my ink ran out !
The instructions had some suggestions for getting the ink flowing , like flooding the ink heads with cleaner , or soaking the heads .
Some dry ink must have been clogging the ink pathways .
I syringed a little cleaning fluid onto the heads and tried blowing into the top holes , trying to encourage blue and red ink flow .
I also tried letting the print head soak in cleaning fluid .
I kept plenty of paper towels around to catch the incredibly valuable ink .
Each time I installed the ink cartridge , I held my breath , hoping the colors would start working .
After about five tries and 90 minutes , it worked !
All three colors seemed to flow evenly .
I could print anything !
I had a 100 % refilled cartridge and had saved about $ 7 .
It worked like a charm ... for two days .
When I began printing my resume and portfolio , the colors were having a hard time again , this time refusing to print the color red .
I spent almost an hour trying to soak , blow and wipe methods of ink encouragement , but they were n't working .
I did n't understand how the cartridge had died so quickly after working so well just 48 hours before hand .
I was very frustrated .
Just as I was considering returning the ink - kit , I noticed tiny cracks in the sides of the cartridge .
Was the hammer treatment too harsh ?
Had I inadvertently exposed the ink to premature dry - out ?
As a last resort , I dug up another ( even more dried - out ) ink cartridge shell from an old desk - drawer and started the process again .
Luckily there was plenty of ink left in the little bottles .
This time I was more gentle with the hammering & refilled all three colors .
Instead of just blowing into the fill - holes , I tried sucking the ink through the print - heads .
I also shook the hell out of it , and bathed the ink ports with rivers of cleaning solvent .
Each time I re-inserted the cartridge , the printer rattled off the HP DeskJet ink - test page .
Each time I was disappointed .
I was on the brink of tearing my hair out .
Finally , after about an hour of oral ink-coercion , the printouts emerged in full , vibrant color !
I printed out my portfolio and resume on the finest cotton / linen blend paper stock .
I did n't want anything to hurt my chances at this job !

Abstract
In order to easily distinguish between multiple computers , we give them names .
Experience has taught us that it is as easy to choose bad names as it is to choose good ones .
This essay presents guidelines for deciding what makes a name good or bad .
Keywords : domain name system , naming conventions , computer administration , computer network management Introduction
As soon as you deal with more than one computer , you need to distinguish between them .
For example , to tell your system administrator that your computer is busted , you might say , " Hey Ken .
Goon is down ! "
Computers also have to be able to distinguish between themselves .
Thus , when sending mail to a colleague at another computer , you might use the command " mail libes@goon " .
In both cases , " goon " refers to a particular computer .
How the name is actually dereferenced by a human or computer need not concern us here .
This essay is only concerned with choosing a " good " name .
( It is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of the domain name system as described by [ 2 ] . )
By picking a " good " name for your computer , you can avoid a number of problems that people stumble over again and again .
Here are some guidelines on what NOT to do .
Do n't overload other terms already in common use .
Using a word that has strong semantic implications in the current context will cause confusion .
This is especially true in conversation where punctuation is not obvious and grammar is often incorrect .
For example , a distributed database had been built on top of several computers .
Each one had a different name .
One machine was named " up " , as it was the only one that accepted updates .
Conversations would sound like this : " Is up down ? " and " Boot the machine up . " followed by " Which machine ? "
While it did n't take long to catch on and get used to this zaniness , it was annoying when occasionally your mind would stumble , and you would have to stop and think about each word in a sentence .
It is as if , all of a sudden , English has become a foreign language .
Do n't choose a name after a project unique to that machine .
A manufacturing project had named a machine " shop " since it was going to be used to control a number of machines on a shop floor .
A while later , a new machine was acquired to help with some of the processing .
Needless to say , it could n't be called " shop " as well .
Indeed , both machines ended up performing more specific tasks , allowing more precision in naming .
A year later , five new machines were installed and the original one was moved to an unrelated project .
It is simply impossible to choose generic names that remain appropriate for very long .
Of course , they could have called the second one " shop2 " and so on .
But then one is really only distinguishing machines by their number .
You might as well just call them " 1 " , " 2 " , and " 3 " .
The only time this kind of naming scheme is appropriate is when you have a lot of machines and there are no reasons for any human to distinguish between them .
For example , a master computer might be controlling an array of one hundred computers .
In this case , it makes sense to refer to them with the array indices .
While computers are n't quite analogous to people , their names are .
Nobody expects to learn much about a person by their name .
Just because a person is named " Don " does n't mean he is the ruler of the world ( despite what the " Choosing a Name for your Baby " books say ) .
In reality , names are just arbitrary tags .
You cannot tell what a person does for a living , what their hobbies are , and so on .
Do n't use your own name .
Even if a computer is sitting on your desktop , it is a mistake to name it after yourself .
This is another case of overloading , in which statements become ambiguous .
Does " give the disk drive to don " refer to a person or computer ?
Even using your initials ( or some other moniker ) is unsatisfactory .
What happens if I get a different machine after a year ?
Someone else gets stuck with " don " and I end up living with " jim " .
The machines can be renamed , but that is excess work and besides , a program that used a special peripheral or database on " don " would start failing when it was n't found on the " new don " .
It is especially tempting to name your first computer after yourself , but think about it .
Do you name any of your other possessions after yourself ?
No .
Your dog has its own name , as do your children .
If you are one of those who feel so inclined to name your car and other objects , you certainly do n't reuse your own name .
Otherwise you would have a great deal of trouble distinguishing between them in speech .
For the same reason , it follows that naming your computer the same thing as your car or another possession is a mistake .
Do n't use long names .
This is hard to quantify , but experience has shown that names longer than eight characters simply annoy people .
Most systems will allow prespecified abbreviations , but why not choose a name that you do n't have to abbreviate to begin with ?
This removes any chance of confusion .
Avoid alternate spellings .
Once we called a machine " czek " .
In discussion , people continually thought we were talking about a machine called " check " .
Indeed , " czek " is n't even a word ( although " Czech " is ) .
Purposely incorrect ( but cute ) spellings also tend to annoy a large subset of people .
Also , people who have learned English as a second language often question their own knowledge upon seeing a word that they know but spelled differently .
( " I guess I 've always been spelling " funxion " incorrectly .
How embarrassing ! " )
By now you may be saying to yourself , " This is all very silly ... people who have to know how to spell a name will learn it and that 's that . "
While it is true that some people will learn the spelling , it will eventually cause problems somewhere .
For example , one day a machine named " pythagoris " ( sic ) went awry and began sending a tremendous number of messages to the site administrator 's computer .
The administrator , who was n't a very good speller to begin with , had never seen this machine before ( someone else had set it up and named it ) , but he had to deal with it since it was clogging up the network as well as bogging down his own machine which was logging all the errors .
Needless to say , he had to look it up every time he needed to spell " pythagoris " .
( He suspected there was an abbreviation , but he would have had to log into yet another computer ( the local nameserver ) to find out and the network was too jammed to waste time doing that . )
Avoid domain names .
For technical reasons , domain names should be avoided .
In particular , name resolution of non-absolute hostnames is problematic .
Resolvers will check names against domains before checking them against hostnames .
But we have seen instances of mailers that refuse to treat single token names as domains .
For example , assume that you mail to " libes@rutgers " from yale .edu .
Depending upon the implementation , the mail may go to rutgers.edu or rutgers.yale.edu ( assuming both exist ) .
Avoid domain - like names .
Domain names are either organizational ( e.g. , cia.gov ) or geographical ( e.g. , dallas.tx.us ) .
Using anything like these tends to imply some connection .
For example , the name " tahiti " sounds like it means you are located there .
This is confusing if it is really somewhere else ( e.g. , " tahiti.cia.gov is located in Langley , Virginia ?
I thought it was the CIA 's Tahiti office ! " ) .
If it really is located there , the name implies that it is the only computer there .
If this is n't wrong now , it inevitably will be .
There are some organizational and geographical names that work fine .
These are exactly the ones that do not function well as domain names .
For example , amorphous names such as rivers , mythological places and other impossibilities are very suitable .
( " earth " is not yet a domain name . )
Do n't use antagonistic or otherwise embarrassing names .
Words like " moron " or " twit " are good names if no one else is going to see them .
But if you ever give someone a demo on your machine , you may find that they are distracted by seeing a nasty word on your screen .
( Maybe their spouse called them that this morning . )
Why bother taking the chance that they will be turned off by something completely irrelevant to your demo .
Do n't use digits at the beginning of the name .
Many programs accept a numerical internet address as well as a name .
Unfortunately , some programs do not correctly distinguish between the two and may be fooled , for example , by a string beginning with a decimal digit .
Names consisting entirely of hexadecimal digits , such as " beef " , are also problematic , since they can be interpreted entirely as hexadecimal numbers as well as alphabetic strings .
Do n't use non-alphanumeric characters in a name .
Your own computer may handle punctuation or control characters in a name , but most others do not .
If you ever expect to connect your computer to a heterogeneous network , you can count on a variety of interpretations of non-alphanumeric characters in names .
Network conventions on this are surprisingly nonstandard .
Do n't expect case to be preserved .
Upper and lowercase characters look the same to a great deal of internet software , often under the assumption that it is doing you a favor .
It may seem appropriate to capitalize a name the same way you might do it in English , but convention dictates that computer names appear all lowercase .
( And it saves holding down the shift key . )
Now that we 've heard what not to do , here are some suggestions on names that work well .
Use words / names that are rarely used .
While a word like " typical " or " up " ( see above ) is n't computer jargon , it is just too likely to arise in discussion and throw off one 's concentration while determining the correct referent .
Instead , use words like " lurch " or " squire " which are unlikely to cause any confusion .
You might feel it is safe to use the name " jose " just because no one is named that in your group , but you will have a problem if you should happen to hire Jose .
A name like " sphinx " will be less likely to conflict with new hires .
Use theme names .
Naming groups of machines in a common way is very popular , and enhances communality while displaying depth of knowledge as well as imagination .
A simple example is to use colors , such as " red " and " blue " .
Personality can be injected by choices such as " aqua " and " crimson " .
Certain sets are finite , such as the seven dwarfs .
When you order your first seven computers , keep in mind that you will probably get more next year .
Colors will never run out .
Some more suggestions are : mythical places ( e.g. , Midgard , Styx , Paradise ) , mythical people ( e.g. , Procne , Tereus , Zeus ) , killers ( e.g. , Cain , Burr , Boleyn ) , babies ( e.g. , colt , puppy , tadpole , elver ) , collectives ( e.g. , passel , plague , bevy , covey ) , elements ( e.g. , helium , argon , zinc ) , flowers ( e.g. , tulip , peony , lilac , arbutus ) .
Get the idea ?
Use real words .
Random strings are inappropriate for the same reason that they are so useful for passwords .
They are hard to remember .
Use real words .
Do n't worry about reusing someone else 's hostname .
Extremely well - known hostnames such as " sri-nic " and " uunet " should be avoided since they are understood in conversation as absolute addresses even without a domain .
In all other cases , the local domain is assumed to qualify single - part hostnames .
This is similar to the way phone numbers are qualified by an area code when dialed from another area .
In other words , if you have choosen a reasonable name , you do not have to worry that it has already been used in another domain .
The number of hosts in a bottom - level domain is small , so it should n't be hard to pick a name unique only to that domain .
There is always room for an exception .
I do n't think any explanation is needed here .
However , let me add that if you later decide to change a name ( to something sensible like you should have chosen in the first place ) , you are going to be amazed at the amount of pain awaiting you .
No matter how easy the manuals suggest it is to change a name , you will find that lots of obscure software has rapidly accumulated which refers to that computer using that now - ugly name .
It all has to be found and changed .
People mailing to you from other sites have to be told .
And you will have to remember that names on old backup media labels correspond to different names .
I could go on but it would be easier just to forget this guideline exists .
Conclusion
Most people do n't have the opportunity to name more than one or two computers , while site administrators name large numbers of them .
By choosing a name wisely , both user and administrator will have an easier time of remembering , discussing and typing the names of their computers .
I have tried to formalize useful guidelines for naming computers , along with plenty of examples to make my points obvious .
Having been both a user and site administrator , many of these anecdotes come from real experiences which I have no desire to relive .
Hopefully , you will avoid all of the pitfalls I have discussed by choosing your computer 's name wisely .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - The United States stressed on Thursday that it opposes Taiwan plans to hold a referendum on U.N. membership , while China urged Washington to help oppose the vote that it calls a dangerous provocation .

Speaking before regular high - level talks with China , U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte pointedly criticized the vote planned for March in which Taiwan ’s independence - leaning President Chen Shui-bian wants approval to seek U.N. membership under the name “ Taiwan ” .
China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that must accept reunification and calls the referendum a provocative bid to create formal independence for the island .
“ From the perspective of the United States , the conduct of such a referendum is a mistake , ” Negroponte told reporters , echoing comments made in December by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
“ We think it is a provocative policy on the part of the Taiwanese authorities . ”
Negroponte made the remarks ahead of two days of talks with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo that will cover Taiwan and other diplomatic hotspots , including North Korea and Iran .
China indicated that Taiwan remains its top worry and it wants Washington efforts to help stifle Chen ’s plans for the vote alongside presidential elections on the island .
Both Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi raised the referendum when meeting Negroponte on Wednesday , the Communist Party ’s official People ’s Daily said .
“ Under current circumstances , opposing secessionist activities such as the referendum more firmly is vital for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and overall China - U.S. relations , ” Yang was quoted as telling Negroponte .
SENSITIVE ISSUE
Wen told Negroponte that Washington should “ properly ” deal with sensitive issues such as Taiwan .
China has claimed sovereignty over self - ruled Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 .
It has vowed to bring the island back under mainland rule , by force if necessary .
The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 , recognizing “ one China ” , but is obliged by the Taiwan Relations
Act to help the island defend itself and is its biggest ally and arms supplier .
“ This is an issue that must be dealt with by peaceful means , ” Negroponte told reporters .
Taiwan ’s main opposition Nationalist Party ( KMT ) thrashed the ruling Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) in legislative elections on Saturday , strengthening its bid to recapture the presidency in March and heralding better relations with China .
But China remains jittery , especially with Beijing ’s Olympic Games in August drawing additional attention to its actions .
Taiwan , under its official name the Republic of China , lost its U.N. seat to China in 1971 .
Repeated attempts by Taiwan to rejoin the world body have failed .
The use of “ Taiwan ” -- rather than Republic of China -- in Chen ’s latest campaign is viewed as particularly inflammatory by Beijing , which sees it as firming up the pro-independence claims .
Taiwan is recognized by just 23 mostly small , poor countries around the world , against 171 that recognize China .
Late last year , China abruptly cancelled a U.S. naval port call to Hong Kong , possibly reflecting unhappiness over U.S. military activities around Taiwan .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said her country approved of Washington ’s opposition to the referendum .
But she also told a news conference that the United States should “ proceed with caution ” in the Taiwan Strait , where U.S. navy ships sometimes pass , calling the area “ highly sensitive ” .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Saying Barack Obama embodies political hope absent since Robert Kennedy was slain 40 years ago , three surviving members of the Grateful Dead rock band reunited on Monday for the first time in four years to back the presidential candidate .
“ Every few generations a guy like this comes along , ” drummer Mickey Hart told a news conference a day before California ’s primary , in which Obama , a senator from Illinois , faces New York Sen. Hillary Clinton .
“ It seems like desperate times and we ’re desperate people . ”
The counter - culture band , known for its loyal “ Deadhead ” fans , broke up in 1995 after the death of its leader , guitarist Jerry Garcia .
They have since played together occasionally , most recently in 2004 .
At a San Francisco concert in front of 2,400 fans , singer - guitarist Bob Weir , 60 , said the band had never before , performed on behalf of a presidential candidate , although they have often embraced liberal social causes .
“ The last time hope was in the air , it was ended by a bullet , ” Weir said , referring to Kennedy , who was assassinated on the night he won the California Democratic primary in 1968 .
“ We ’ve been reluctant to do political events all along . ”
Bassist Phil Lesh , 67 , said he met Obama , who told him he has some Grateful Dead songs on his iPod music player , last year .
The concert started with a short video from Obama , filmed on an airplane , thanking the band .
A thick cloud of marijuana smoke wafted through the air then and throughout the concert , and some fans engaged in free - style dance as though magically transported from 1968 .
Obama ’s dapper , clean - cut image contrasted with the tied - dyed shirts and long , shaggy hair of fans who lined up for hours to attend the “ Deadheads for Obama ‘ 08 ” event .
“ Long live the Dead ! ” said Ron Svetlik , 51 , who said he had attended more than 200 Grateful Dead concerts , starting in 1974 .
The home builder said he had already voted by mail for the Green Party candidate , but added : “ If I had to cast a write - in ballot , I ’d put Jerry Garcia . ”
The three band members neither promised more concerts nor ruled them out .
“ It ’s a lot like family , ” Weir said , referring to complicated relationships dating back more than 40 years .
“ What we have is thicker than blood . ”
Asteroid impacts or massive volcanic flows might have occurred around the time dinosaurs became extinct , but a new argument is that the mightiest creatures the world has ever known may have been brought down by a tiny , much less dramatic force -- biting , disease - carrying insects .
An important contributor to the demise of the dinosaurs , experts say , could have been the rise and evolution of insects , especially the slow - but - overwhelming threat posed by new disease carriers .
And the evidence for this emerging threat has been captured in almost lifelike - detail -- many types of insects preserved in amber that date to the time when dinosaurs disappeared .
" There are serious problems with the sudden impact theories of dinosaur extinction , not the least of which is that dinosaurs declined and disappeared over a period of hundreds of thousands , or even millions of years , " said George Poinar Jr. , a courtesy professor of zoology at Oregon State University .
" That time frame is just not consistent with the effects of an asteroid impact .
But competition with insects , emerging new diseases and the spread of flowering plants over very long periods of time is perfectly compatible with everything we know about dinosaur extinction . "
This concept is outlined in detail in " What Bugged the Dinosaurs ?
Insects , Disease and Death in the Cretaceous , " a book by George and Roberta Poinar , just published by Princeton University Press .
In it , the authors argue that insects provide a plausible and effective explanation for the slow , inexorable decline and eventual extinction of dinosaurs over many thousands of years .
This period is known as the famous " K - T Boundary , " or the line between the Cretaceous and Tertiary Period about 65 million years ago .
There is evidence that some catastrophic events , such as a major asteroid or lava flows , also occurred at this time -- but these provide no complete explanation for the gradual decline of dinosaur populations , and even how some dinosaurs survived for thousands of years after the K - T Boundary .
Insects and disease , on the other hand , may have been a lot slower , but ultimately finished the job .

" We do n't suggest that the appearance of biting insects and the spread of disease are the only things that relate to dinosaur extinction , " Poinar said .
" Other geologic and catastrophic events certainly played a role .
But by themselves , such events do not explain a process that in reality took a very , very long time , perhaps millions of years .
Insects and diseases do provide that explanation . "
Poinar and his wife , Roberta , have spent much of their careers studying the plant and animal life forms found preserved in amber , using them to re-create the biological ecosystems that were in place millions of years ago .
They are also authors of " The Amber Forest : A Reconstruction of a Vanished World . "
As a semi-precious gem that first begins to form as sap oozing from a tree , amber has the unique ability to trap very small animals or other materials and -- as a natural embalming agent -- display them in nearly perfect , three - dimensional form millions of years later .
This phenomenon has been invaluable in scientific and ecological research , and among other things , formed the scientific premise for the movie Jurassic Park , for the " dinosaur DNA " found in mosquitoes .
" During the late Cretaceous Period , the associations between insects , microbes and disease transmission were just emerging , " Poinar said .
" We found in the gut of one biting insect , preserved in amber from that era , the pathogen that causes leishmania -- a serious disease still today , one that can infect both reptiles and humans .
In another biting insect , we discovered organisms that cause malaria , a type that infects birds and lizards today .
" In dinosaur feces , we found nematodes , trematodes and even protozoa that could have caused dysentery and other abdominal disturbances .
The infective stages of these intestinal parasites are carried by filth - visiting insects . "
In the Late Cretaceous , Poinar said , the world was covered with warm - temperate to tropical areas that swarmed with blood - sucking insects carrying leishmania , malaria , intestinal parasites , arboviruses and other pathogens , and caused repeated epidemics that slowly - but - surely wore down dinosaur populations .
Ticks , mites , lice and biting flies would have tormented and weakened them .
advertisement
" Smaller and separated populations of dinosaurs could have been repeatedly wiped out , just like when bird malaria was introduced into Hawaii , it killed off many of the honeycreepers , " Poinar said .
" After many millions of years of evolution , mammals , birds and reptiles have evolved some resistance to these diseases .
But back in the Cretaceous , these diseases were new and invasive , and vertebrates had little or no natural or acquired immunity to them .
Massive outbreaks causing death and localized extinctions would have occurred . "
In similar fashion , the researchers suggest , insects would have played a major role in changing the nature of plant life on Earth -- the fundamental basis for all dinosaur life , whether herbivore , omnivore or carnivore .
As the dinosaurs were declining , their traditional food items such as seed ferns , cycads , gingkoes and other gymnosperms were largely being displaced by flowering plants , which insects helped spread by their pollination activities .
These plants would have spread to dominate the landscape .
Also , insects could have spread plant diseases that destroyed large tracts of vegetation , and the insects could have been major competitors for the available plant food supply .
" Insects have exerted a tremendous impact on the entire ecology of the Earth , certainly shaping the evolution and causing the extinction of terrestrial organisms , " the authors wrote in their book .
" The largest of the land animals , the dinosaurs , would have been locked in a life - or - death struggle with them for survival . "
The confluence of new insect - spread diseases , loss of traditional food sources , and competition for plants by insect pests could all have provided a lingering , debilitating condition that dinosaurs were ultimately unable to overcome , the researchers say .
And these concerns -- which might have pressured the dinosaurs for thousands of years -- may have finished the job , along with the changing environment , meteor impacts and massive lava flows .
" We can't say for certain that insects are the smoking gun , but we believe they were an extremely significant force in the decline of the dinosaurs , " Poinar said .
" Our research with amber shows that there were evolving , disease - carrying vectors in the Cretaceous , and that at least some of the pathogens they carried infected reptiles .
This clearly fills in some gaps regarding dinosaur extinctions . "
Wenn sich die “ Bild ” - Zeitung gegen die Meinung der überwältigenden Mehrheit ihrer Leser stellt , lohnt es sich fast immer , genauer hinzuschauen .
Rund 90 Prozent der Deutschen sind laut einer Umfrage von Infratest dimap für Mindestlöhne entweder in allen oder bestimmten Branchen .
In “ Bild ” stand diese oder eine ähnliche Zahl nicht .
Dafür aber seit drei Wochen Tag für Tag ein beeindruckendes publizistisches Trommelfeuer gegen den Mindestlohn im Allgemeinen und bei den Briefzustellern im Besonderen .

September :
Nein , sagen Experten !
Wirtschaftsweiser Prof. Wolfgang Franz zu BILD : “ Die Erfahrung zeigt , dass Mindestlöhne Jobs kosten , vor allem bei den Geringqualifizierten .
Ein Mitarbeiter darf ein Unternehmen nicht mehr kosten , als er der Firma einbringt . ( … ) ” Nach Berechnungen des Ifo-Instituts würde ein bundesweiter Mindestlohn von 7,50 Euro / Stunde rund 1,1 Millionen Arbeitsplätze in Deutschland vernichten .
(…) Welche Folgen hätte der Mindestlohn für die privaten Post - Firmen ?
Laut Branchenverband DVPT würden die Kosten der Betriebe dadurch deutlich steigen .

Ein Sprecher der Gewerkschaft Ver.di sagte “ Report Mainz ” , “ der Druck auf die Journalisten ” bei Springer , im Interesse des Post - Engagements des Verlages zu berichten , sei “ sehr groß ” .
Er sprach von “ Aktionärsjournalismus ” .

SAN FRANCISCO 
After announcing a sharp drop in fourth - quarter profits Tuesday , Yahoo issued a disappointing outlook for this year , suggesting that investors would have to wait until 2009 for a turnaround .
Yahoo also said that as part of its plan to revive its fortunes , it would cut 1,000 jobs by mid-February to reduce costs and narrow its focus to its most important businesses .
The company , however , said it planned to invest aggressively in some areas , like advertising technology and selected portions of its Internet portal , as it tries to capture a larger share of online ad dollars .
Since some laid - off employees could apply for new jobs at Yahoo , the net effect on the work force , which recently grew to 14,300 , was not clear .
Jerry Yang , the chief executive , warned investors of “ head winds ” this year .
Yahoo’s projections for revenue growth and profitability in 2008 were either at the low end of analysts ’ expectations or below them .

It is the rare gas giant planet that inhabits the outskirts of its solar system .
Most are like our own Jupiter and prefer to stick close to their stars , a new study suggests .
The finding , to be detailed in an upcoming issue of Astrophysical Journal , helps give astronomers a better sense of how planets are arranged in the universe at large .
" Now that we know there are n't large numbers of giant planets lurking at large distances from their stars , astronomers have a more complete picture and can better constrain [ in theory and in models ] how planets are formed , " said study leader Beth Biller of the University of Arizona .
Some planet formation theories have predicted that gas giants form far away from their stars and then migrate inward by gravitational interactions with other bodies .
" There was some idea that there might possibly be a reservoir of giant planets [ far from their stars ] that would eventually migrate in , and we do n't really find evidence for this reservoir , " Biller said in a telephone interview .
A skewed picture ?
Of the nearly 250 planets discovered so far outside our solar system , most are gas giants that orbit extremely close to their stars .
Called " hot Jupiters , " these extrasolar planets hug their parent stars tighter than Mercury does the sun .
As a result , they can zip around their stars in just a few days or hours .
The majority of extrasolar planets known were found using the radial velocity method , which involves measuring the stellar wobbles caused by planets gravitationally tugging on their stars .
Because this technique is best suited to detecting massive planets close to their stars ( large planets located close to their stars create the biggest wobbles ) , astronomers were unsure whether more gas giants could be found at a greater distance from their stars via different detection methods .
To answer this question , Biller and her colleagues conducted a three - year survey using telescopes in Arizona and Chile .
The team looked specifically for gas giants residing relatively far from their parent stars .
They surveyed 54 nearby , young stars where gas giant planets would still be forming .
Theory predicts young Jupiters are brighter and thus easier to spot than older gas giants .
The survey turned up no giant planets beyond 10 AU ( 10 times the distance from Earth to the sun ) of their host stars , leading the team to conclude that Jupiter - sized exoplanets are extremely rare in the outer parts of solar systems .
' Reassuring ' Alan Boss , a planetary formation theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington , called the results " reassuring . "
Planets are thought to form within the dusty protoplanetary disks that surround young stars .
The two leading theories about how planets form - core accretion and disk instability - have problems making gas giants out at distances beyond 20 AU .
" There just is n't enough disk mass out there unless the disk is implausibly massive , " Boss told SPACE.com .
" Any planets formed out at those distances are probably the result of orbital interactions between unstable systems , and unstable systems are expected to form rarely , if at all , " Boss added .
Boss and Biller pointed out there is another possible explanation for the survey results .
" This survey depends on assuming that young gas giants are much brighter than older gas giants and hence easier to detect , " Boss said .
Some recent studies , however , have suggested young gas giants might not be brighter than old ones as commonly thought .
If this proves to be correct , it could mean remote Jupiters do exist but are just too faint to detect .

What ’s really strange about this is , the statistics remain the same whether it ’s ten million dollars all the way down to three million .
For three million bucks , most of us would do the same horrible things we would do for ten million .
But , guess what ?
Few of us would do these things for a “ measly ” two million .
I once sent a ‘ dollar bill thank you ’ letter to a guy who sent a sincere letter back to me bitching the free $ 1 bill I sent him was wrinkled instead of crisp as I had described in the letter .

In yet another move by the global elite in hedge funding to insure victory no matter who wins , the Ford Foundation , Rockefeller Foundation , the Gates Foundation , the Macarthur Foundation , as well as others , have been providing funding to the National Council of La Raza , one of the most racist Hispanic ‘ civil rights ’ groups .
La Raza literally means ‘ The Race ’ translated from Spanish , and is well known for selling racist and xenophobic propaganda to legal as well as illegal Hispanic immigrants inside the United States .
They have a long and controversial history and have had clashes with whites and minorities of other races over immigration , employment and cultural issues .
The elites ’ cash cows have also been big donors to other left leaning illegal immigration , including MALDEF , the Center for Immigrant democracy , Casa Mexico , and the Mexican - American legal defense and education fund .
A quick google search of the philanthropic groups will reveal that they are open and proud of their investments into these immigration groups .
The Macarthur Foundation ’s own website admits proudly how they showered La Raza with $ 600,000 and a $ 350,000 grants .
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has gone ever farther , coughing up over $ 20 million to La Raza since 2002 .
And on the flip side of the immigration issue , the pro border control and anti-illegal immigration group , FAIR ( Federation for American immigration reform ) , has received over $ 1.2 million dollars from the Pioneer Fund , a group founded in 1937 on the basis of study in eugenics and ‘ race sciences . ’
Several of the the Pioneer fund ’s beneficiaries include Arthur Jenson , Richard Lynn , J Phillip Rushton , and Roger Pearson , all right leaning eugenicists and social biology advocates .
The Pioneer fund also has ties to the Council for National Policy and the Heritage foundation , two more right wing policy research organizations .
Despite funding both sides of the immigration issue and the apparent contradictions involved , that ’s not the end to the madness .
The Macarthur Foundation has also been forking over dough to several planned parenthood organizations to increase the education and use of abortion and safe sex ; tools of soft population control .
Since 1986 , the Macarthur Foundation has donated over $ 215 million to almost 1,000 groups and individuals in the field of population and reproductive health .
Whether it ’s left wing groups promoting open borders and drivers licenses for illegal aliens , or right wing groups calling for deportation and border control , the eugenics loving , big brother hugging elites have been bank rolling their way to a victorious step in moving us all closer to their vision of a new world order .

There ’s a report from Roger Simon at the Politico – someone who Joe says is a “ real ” reporter , i.e. , he does n’t just report unsubstantiated rumors – that a senior Clinton campaign official told the reporter that they are planning on trying to take Obama ’s delegates that he won in the primaries .
What does this mean ?
Take Virginia .
Obama beat Clinton 64 % to 35 % .
That gave Obama 54 delegates to Clinton ’s 29 delegates .
The Clinton campaign is reportedly going to try to convince those 54 Obama delegates not to support Obama at the convention , even though you voted for those delegates to support Obama .
We ’re not talking superdelegates – we ’re talking the delegates you voted for in the various state primaries .
We ’re talking your vote .
Clinton ’s campaign says the story is n’t true .
This means that Roger Simon needs to now give his side of the story .
Having said that , the Clinton campaign has gone increasingly negative in the past few days – accusing Obama of plagiarism ( when Hillary herself has adopted Obama ’s “ change ” theme ) , and they ’ve accused Obama of skirting debates when he ’s already done 18 of them and agreed to 2 more in the next few weeks ( it ’s not clear why the Obama campaign did n’t counter - offer a series of debates about Iraq and Iran – that would have ended the discussion ) .
That does n’t prove that this story is true , but this delegate - stealing story is the kind of news that is consistent with a campaign that is sounding increasingly worried and is resorting to increasingly nasty tactics .
And putting all that aside , how is it even possible that our rules permit this ?

Al Gore 's film An Inconvenient Truth was an unlikely box office hit
In an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK , he said he would not make a fresh bid for the White House .
Mr Gore told NRK he wanted to focus on his climate change campaigning , which won him a Nobel Peace Prize last week .
Mr Gore , the beaten Democratic candidate in the 2000 election , had repeatedly stated he had no interest in standing again for president .
But a national organisation which has campaigned for him to stand once more for the White House said traffic on its website had surged in the wake of his Nobel triumph .
' Climate crisis '
Mr Gore told NRK it was a " great honour " to be awarded the prize for his climate campaigning .
Asked how it would affect his political future , he replied : " I do n't have plans to be a candidate again so I do n't really see it in that context at all .
" I 'm involved in another kind of campaign .
It 's a global campaign to change the way people think about the climate crisis . "
On Tuesday , the Draft Gore organisation said it had gathered 200,000 signatures .
Mr Gore was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
The 59 - year - old won an Oscar for his 2006 documentary climate change film An Inconvenient Truth .

A Simple Question
A friend of mine in California asked me one of those questions which seem simple on the surface yet is anything but .
One of the “ top women in storage ” as a leading business publication had rated her , she had gone home to Ireland for the Christmas holidays .
In an email detailing how everyone was and what happened in Ireland , she concluded by asking , “ So , Mr Economist , tell me why is the US so cheap ? ”
The context of her question included the price - levels of various places she is familiar with such as the US , Western European countries , NZ , and Australia .
My own comparison of Indian and US prices adds further validity to that question since I find that the US is cheap relative to India .
Why is it so ?
It is one of those questions that if investigated sufficiently in detail , it would involve the entire discipline of economics .
You could start off with a study of Adam Smith ’s “ An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations ” ( aka “ The Wealth of Nations ” ) , published in 1776 , the same year as the American Declaration of Independence ; and end with reading the papers of such people as Stiglitz , Krugman , and Romer .
Or you could just take the quick and dirty route of figuring that it all comes down to how efficiently the US produces and distributes stuff .
A Simple Widget Economy
If you do n’t like arithmetic , skip this section .
Let ’s do some arithmetic .
Suppose 100 people with their bare hands over one year produce and distribute among themselves 100 widgets .
“ Widgets ” is economist - speak , a catchall for the generic good .
Economists are always talking about producing widgets without really going into the details of what they are good for and how they are actually produced .
Strange but that ’s how it is .
Anyway , the GDP of this 100 - person economy is 100 widgets .
The annual per capita income is therefore one widget , the same as the annual per capita production .
Let ’s underline that point : production and income are different ways of looking at the same thing .
Now imagine they suddenly ( magically ) come in possession of fancy machines that allow the same 100 people to produce 1,000 widgets in a year .
The income per capita goes up to 10 widgets per year .
Two important things have happened for that increase in productivity .
First , the machines represent a technological change .
The same amount of human effort is expended but given the machines , the output has increased 10 - fold .
Second , the machines use energy .
So the production process now involves the use of non-muscle power and machines .
But machines do n’t fall out of the sky like gentle rain upon the ground beneath .
Someone has to make them .
Say at some time , only 50 people are making widgets using machines ( total production 500 widgets ) and the other 50 are busy building the next generation of machines .
The new machines increase productivity by a factor of 20 .
So now if you want to maintain the overall production of widgets to 500 per year , you need only 25 people to produce widgets and it releases 75 people to continue to build even more sophisticated machines .
The story is simple .
The more efficient they become in producing widgets , the more people are free to innovate upon the machines .
And as the machines improve , it allows further reduction in the number of people engaged in direct production of widgets .
Note also that all this increase in production requires the use of machines which require external sources of energy .
Figuring out new energy sources and developing the technology to use them also involves people .
And people have to be trained for doing the job of inventing new machines , and the technologies for discovering and using energy .
Let ’s call that activity of training people “ education . ”
At some point we can imagine this to be the structure of the economy :
100 people economy
10 people producing widgets 10,000 widgets a year using machines
Per capita annual income : 100 widgets
20 people involved in the manufacturing of machines
30 people involved in the research and development of machine technology
40 people involved in the education of the entire population so that some can do technology R&D , some work in factories making widget - making machines , and some who make widgets on the machines
The Big Picture
If you have skipped over the previous section , here ’s what the main point is .
Economies produce stuff .
The more stuff they produce relative to the effort expended , the richer they are .
The US is more productive than other economies because they use lots of machines , lots of energy , and produce a great deal of R&D .
History and geography have been kind to the US , besides .
Somehow they got lucky and had a bunch of smart people who figured out that both economic freedoms and political freedoms are important .
Entrepreneurship flourished .
Geographically , the US is huge with lots of natural resources .
It was not always as rich as it is today .
At one point it was on average as poor as say the people of Bihar today and had as little technology available to it .
But the US developed quite well .
Cars , laptops , the world wide web , and Google came much later .
What the people of Bihar ( and India in general ) do n’t have today and which the people of the US had from the birth of that nation was the smarts to figure out a set of rules and institutions that made the people more productive , not just the land and natural resources .
The US is cheap relative to India because it takes a lot less effort to get something done in the US than in India .
The Cost of Gas
Yesterday , I ventured out to get a cylinder of cooking gas .
I had run out a couple of days ago , and after much inquiry I heard of a store that was willing to sell me a cylinder of LPG ( liquefied petroleum gas ) .
The store was about 2 kilometers away .
I could have leisurely walked that distance in 20 minutes .
But I had to drive as I had an empty gas cylinder weighing 16 kilos .
It took about an hour to drive the 2 kilometers .
Total time expended in acquiring a cylinder of gas this time : 3 hours .
Cost of the gas : Rs 550 ( or around US $ 15 . )
Over the last couple of years that I have been in Pune , I estimate that the effort in acquiring cooking gas was about Rs 1,500 and three full days of running around .
Anyone running a middle - class household in India knows that there is a shortage of cooking gas .
Demand for it at the government mandated price far exceeds the supply .
The price is around Rs 300 per cylinder but the cost to the manufacturer is around Rs 500 .
The government subsidizes the consumption of cooking gas .
Mukesh Ambani ’s household gets that subsidy , and so does any household which is not so poor as to not be able to afford the gas stove .
That subsidy is not available to the really poor as they do not have the money to pay for the capital expenditure involved in using the gas .
And besides , if you are not already a consumer listed with some gas supplier , you cannot get one as the supply is severely limited and it is not easy to become a new subscriber .
I tried but I was told that the bribe is around Rs 6,000 .
The perverse effects of controlling prices should be evident to the meanest intelligence .
Which makes one wonder whether those who make these policies do n’t even possess the meanest intelligence .
Their claim is that subsidizing cooking gas is good for the poor .
But it is n’t .
Only the comfortably middle - class and higher actually get the subsidy .
That subsidy costs the public treasury billions of dollars .
Removing those subsidies will free up funds for things that would actually help the really needy – such as say education or health care .
In the end , markets figure out the solution .
The distributors of gas cylinders price the gas cylinder to those who desperately need it and who can afford to pay for it at the market - clearing price .
I paid Rs 550 for the cylinder which the distributor is supposed to sell at Rs 300 .
In effect , he pocketed the major part of the subsidy that the government gives to the consumers of gas .
Socialism suffers from the persist illusion that by lowering the price of something below the actual cost it somehow benefits the poor .
That is arrant nonsense because a price ceiling pegged below cost of production is the best way to ensure a shortage of supply , and the limited supply can only satisfy the demand of those who have the deeper pockets , thus rationing the poor out .
Socialism hurts the poor .
Indeed , socialism creates poverty by ensuring that production suffers and thus incomes are low .
The US and the former USSR were similar in many respects such as the quality of the people ( talented , educated ) and the stock of natural resources .
The major distinction was that the US was a free - market economy while the USSR was a socialist workers ’ paradise .
The average consumer in the US faced market price , and found shelves overburdened with goodies in their supermarkets .
The average consumer in the USSR faced bare shelves of phantom goods — goods if they had been there would have been sold at affordable socialist prices .
The Road to Poverty
While sitting in creeping bumper - to - bumper traffic yesterday on my way to somehow get a cylinder of cooking gas , breathing the exhaust of diesel trucks , assaulted by incessant honking of cars , three - wheelers , and motorcycles , I wondered where it was all going .
Economics is called the dismal science .
It does not get any more dismal than when you are forced to confront the absolute stupidity that leads to waste of human potential of such gigantic proportions that the Indian economy barely produces enough to keep its body and soul together .
India is unable to feed all its children — about 50 percent of children below 5 years of age are malnourished .
India does not produce enough to be able to provide a vast segment of its people decent housing , education , sanitation , health - care , and even a clean glass of drinking water .
I do n’t wish to dwell on the obvious shortcomings of the Indian economy gratuitously .
The intent is to force attention to the basic problem , which is that we have through our own stupidity not paid attention to what it is that makes people productive .
Here ’s one line of thinking .
If people are forced to spend hours on end getting from one place to another , it leaves a lot less time to do productive work .
The roads everywhere are congested because they are too narrow .
There is a one - time cost to building wide roads or even for leaving sufficient space for building wider roads in the future .
But the saving in building narrow roads is dwarfed by the cost incurred year after year of wasting time and fuel crawling along congested roads .
It requires only a bit of foresight , only a bit of reflection to realize that so many people would need to move from this place to that and so the transportation system has to be designed such .
That brings us to an important point .
People need transportation , not cars .
Cars are a means of transporting oneself from point A to point B . Cars are not the end but only one of the many means of getting around .
Roads are one obvious solution to urban transportation needs but not the only one .
You could have light rail , for instance .
And even if you do go in for roads , you could plan for a healthy mix of private cars , taxis , public buses , bicycles , and footpaths .
The important point is that it involves planning , not just a random sequence of interventions made by ignorant policymakers .
Private firms are good at meeting the demand for private goods .
That is what the market does so effectively : provide private goods .
A car is a private good but it depends rather heavily on the availability of a complementary good : roads .
Roads are not generally a private good .
In the development where I live , Magarpatta City , they have internal roads which are wide and well maintained .
The developer of the township owns the roads and has planned them to reflect the capacity of the township .
There are no traffic jams within Magarpatta City .
But step outside the gates , and you are forced to crawl along the roads of Pune .
Unlike private goods like cars , roads are “ collective goods ” and have public goods characteristics .
The market does not provide public goods automatically in what is called “ socially optimal amounts . ”
In the case of some public goods ( such as pollution , a public “ bad ” ) , the market over supplies , and in others such as roads , it under supplies .
Correcting for such market failures is the job of what is called the government .
This does not mean that the government has to get into the business of supplying the public goods .
It only means that the government has to make such rules that will correct for the market failures and thus nudge the market to produce the socially optimal amount of the public good in question .
Tata Motors about to market an “ affordable car ” – the cheapest car in the world , we hear .
I suppose if one is only interested in owing a car and not really much bothered with the matter of whether it will take you anywhere , then it is a grand thing to have .
Because irrespective of whether you have a BMW 740i or the Tata car , sitting in traffic does not get you very far .
The existing roads of Pune will not magically expand to accommodate the additional affordable cars .
The average speed will drop further and the total cost of transportation will go up appropriately .
The total cost of transportation includes the cost of the car , the cost of the fuel , and the cost of moving along at 2 km an hour .
I do n’t think that the Tata car will be all that affordable .
Indian Cities are Expensive
The US is cheap because it is cheap to produce stuff in the US .
Try doing a business in India .
It will take months of hard work to figure out a route through the bureaucratic jungle to get the various permissions and permits required to get the business started .
Running the business will require constant approval from a large number of interested parties .
Much of this approval depends on how much you are able and willing to pay as bribes .
A lot of effort in the economy overall is expended in either extracting rents from those who produce stuff or in minimizing the amount of rents a producer has to pay .
The end result is that most of India is in what is termed the unorganized sector – a sector that suffers from low productivity because it cannot gain from the economies of scale and specialization .
The organized sector accounts for about 7 percent of India ’s labor force .
Even in the organized sector , the costs are high .
The organized sector is necessarily urban based .
The stock of urban locations is low and therefore the rents ( here we are talking of rents as what you play for a place to live and work in , and not the rents that are bribes to those who control the economic activity ) are high .
A decent apartment in a good location in Mumbai or Bangalore can be upwards of Rs 100,000 a month .
On top of that , you have to make your own arrangements for a basic utility such as electricity .
The Solution
If not the solution , at least the outlines of what should be a matter of public debate in India .
I am not minimizing the progress that India has made in the last couple of decades .
It is a matter of great personal satisfaction to me that India has moved out of its 3 percent a year “ Nehru rate of growth ” achieved by his wonderfully brilliant socialistic license - permit - control - quota raj .
But I am concerned that for India to grow at a sustained double - digit , some fundamental changes have to occur .
The first is continued liberalization of the economy .
Economic liberalization would allow the entrepreneurs of India to produce stuff .
Not just stuff , it will produce the most important ingredient of all : education .
Second , India has to plan new cities .
New cities will be cheaper to live and work in compared to stuffing even more millions in the existing cities .
The existing cities were built for a time when the population of India was a tenth of what it is today .
Furthermore , they were built for a time when practically nobody owned cars .
Third , India has to invest heavily into figuring out a way of having cheap energy .
The US and other currently developed economies had the luxury of cheap fossil fuels .
India does not have that .
Joining the struggle to get a larger share of diminishing stocks of fuel worldwide is a loser ’s game .
Investing in research and development for alternate energy sources is something that the private sector cannot fund .
It requires public policy and public funding .
The problem fundamentally boils down to why we cannot have a rational growth plan and enlightened public policy .
My conjecture is that it is due to our political setup .
I will go into that matter in the next bit .

Crime of the Century : Time for Congress to Act
By Dave Lindorff :
Unless otherwise noted , all original content and headlines are Â© BuzzFlash .
Who ’s minding the store in Washington While President George W. Bush was standing before the members of Congress on January 28 laying out his plans , such as they are , for the final year of his second term in the White House , he was also seriously and perhaps fatally undermining the authority of Congress with a new signing statement , attached to the latest National Defense Authorization
Act , in which he declared that he would simply violate or fail to comply with four provisions .
Let me say that again .
The president states in writing that he is not going to obey and will not be bound by four parts of a law duly passed by the Congress . Â
Â
Just so you know that we ’re not talking about the naming of a bridge or a new ship , the four provisions of the act which the president is going to ignore are :
the establishment of a commission to investigate contractor fraud in Afghanistan and IraqÂ Â Â Â Â
the protection for whistleblowers who report contractor fraud from harassment or official retribution Â Â Â Â Â
a requirement that U.S. intelligence agencies respond to Congressional requests for documents Â Â Â Â Â
a ban on funding for any permanent military bases in Iraq , and on any actions that would seek to give the U.S. control over Iraq ’s oil resources or oil money .
Now first of all , let ’s see what the Constitution has to say .
Article I , the first actual statement about how our government works , which comes right after the preamble about “ We the People , ” states unambiguously :
“ All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . ”
It goes on to state that :
“ Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate , shall , before it becomes a Law , be presented to the President of the United States ;
If he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his Objections , to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal , and proceed to reconsider it .
If after such Reconsideration by two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill , it shall be sent , together with the Objections , to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by two thirds of that House , it shall become a Law …
If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall have been presented to him , the Same shall be a Law , in like Manner as if he had signed it . ”
Note that there is no asterisk or footnote saying anything about the president having the power to simply ignore those legislative powers or to violate them at will .
If he does not veto the entire bill – and in this case he did not , he signed it – it becomes the Law of the Land .
Article I also defines the powers of the Congress expansively , stating that it has the power to lay and collect taxes , to regulate commerce , to coin money , to declare war , to call forth the militia , and
“ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States or in any Department or Officer thereof . ”
Article II goes on to define the powers of the president .
It states :
“ The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . ”
It goes on to explicitly define and limit the president ’s powers , specifically to being “ commander in chief ” of the armed forces ( not of the country or of the government ! ) , to the granting of reprieves and pardons ( except in the case of impeachments ) , to making treaties ( subject to Senate approval ) and appointing officers to the cabinet and the courts ( all subject to Senate approval ) .
That is it .
There are no other presidential powers in the Constitution .
Certainly there is no power granted to disobey or ignore Acts of Congress or to violate the law .
And yet here we have the president , at the start of his last year in office , announcing that he will not obey a law duly passed by the Congress that requires his administration to establish a commission to investigate the rampant corruption among private contractors operating in Afghanistan and Iraq , that he will not obey a law barring him from punishing whistleblowers who disclose such corruption , that he will not obey an order that his intelligence services must respond to requests from Congress for information ( about issues such as torture of captives , or spying on American citizens , or destroying documents ) , and that he will not obey an order banning the establishment and construction of permanent military bases in Iraq , and banning attempts to gain U.S. control over Iraqi oil .
Logically one would expect members of Congress in both parties to be up in arms over this illegal and clearly unconstitutional defiance – the more so because both houses of Congress are in the hands of the Democratic Party .
But we have heard not a peep from the “ people ’s representatives ” at this brazen abuse of power .
The reason : Congress is afraid of impeachment .
It is so afraid to confront this usurper president that , incredibly , its members , Republican and Democrat alike , seem happy to surrender not only their own power , but also the power of the institution of Congress , to avoid doing what the Constitution calls upon them to do : to impeach a criminal in the White House who has abused his powers of office , who has violated his oath to “ preserve , protect and defend ” the Constitution , and who has broken the law multiple times .
This is an appalling abrogation of responsibility on the part of our elected representatives in Washington , who also took oaths of office committing themselves to “ preserve , protect and defend ” the Constitution .
How can these hundreds of cowards and traitors in the Capitol , with straight faces , hold hand to heart and pledge allegiance , as they do at the start of every day in Congress ?
How can they with straight faces go before their constituents and pose as honorable men and women ?
The Constitution is clear .
It states that :
“ The President , Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States , shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors . ”
Please observe that the operative word is shall , not may .
Now although the evidence is overwhelming , one can nonetheless debate whether the president broke the law when he went to war in Iraq or whether he knowingly lied about the reasons for that war .
One can debate whether he broke the law by personally authorizing torture of captives .
One can even debate whether he broke the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
These are matters that require hearings in the House Judiciary Committee .
But there is no need to hold hearings to decide whether the president has abused his power by declaring his intention to ignore laws passed by the Congress .
This is an objective fact .
A High Crime has been committed and openly confessed to by the President of the United States .
Congress has only to vote on it as an impeachable act to restore its Constitutional authority , and to restore the damaged Constitution .
There is no question here of “ diverting ” Congress from its important duties .
This need not be time - consuming business .
Moreover , defending its authority from a usurper is surely the most important thing Congress can do .
Neither is there any question of this being “ divisive . ”
Every member of Congress should want to protect the Constitutional authority of the legislative branch from this fatal encroachment which , if unchallenged , renders Congress nothing but a talk shop no better than the local diner .
Nor can there be any question about whether the votes are there or not , either to vote for an Article of Impeachment , or even to convict in the Senate .
What member of Congress , of either party , would vote to approve and to sanction in perpetuity this or any president ’s right to ignore the Constitution and willfully violate laws passed by the Congress – particularly given the likelihood that the next president could be a Democrat ?
Â Â Â Â
Here then , is an issue that Congress can not ignore .
Here is an issue that renders ludicrous House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s assertion that “ impeachment is off the table . ”
Here is an issue that should inflame every American citizen .
Here is an issue that should be put to every candidate for office , including those running for the office of president :
Is President Bush , and is every future president , a dictator , who personally determines what laws are to be obeyed and what laws are to be ignored ?
Or is the president bound , like the rest of us , by the rule of law and the Constitution ?
The choice is now squarely before us all .

Up until a fairly short time ago , scarcely anyone dissented from the assessment offered with " high confidence " by the National Intelligence Estimate of 2005 that Iran was " determined to develop nuclear weapons . "
Correlatively , no one believed the protestations of the mullahs ruling Iran that their nuclear program was designed strictly for peaceful uses .
The reason for this near - universal consensus was that Iran , with its vast reserves of oil and natural gas , had no need for nuclear energy , and that in any case , the very nature of its program contradicted the protestations .
Here is how Time magazine put it as early as March 2003 - - long before , be it noted , the radical Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had replaced the putatively moderate Mohamed Khatami as president :
On a visit last month to Tehran , International Atomic Energy Agency director Mohamed ElBaradei announced he had discovered that Iran was constructing a facility to enrich uranium -- a key component of advanced nuclear weapons -- near Natanz .
But diplomatic sources tell
Time the plant is much further along than previously revealed .
The sources say work on the plant is " extremely advanced " and involves " hundreds " of gas centrifuges ready to produce enriched uranium and " the parts for a thousand others ready to be assembled . "
So , too , the Federation of American Scientists about a year later :
It is generally believed that Iran 's efforts are focused on uranium enrichment , though there are some indications of work on a parallel plutonium effort .
Iran claims it is trying to establish a complete nuclear - fuel cycle to support a civilian energy program , but this same fuel cycle would be applicable to a nuclear - weapons development program .
Iran appears to have spread their nuclear activities around a number of sites to reduce the risk of detection or attack .
And just as everyone agreed with the American intelligence community that Iran was " determined to develop nuclear weapons , " everyone also agreed with President Bush that it must not be permitted to succeed .
Here , the reasons were many and various .
ICANN is in the process of hammering out its new generic top - level domain ( gTLD ) policy , and has begun to address technical issues that could pop up once the new round of applications is open later this year .
As part of a discussion on how to manage DNS stability during this potentially huge expansion of the TLD system , an organization within ICANN has proposed a few basic rules for what can and can't be used as a domain extension .
Put simply , new domains will be able to make use of nearly any string of letters — including common file extensions such as .exe , .doc , and .pdf — but there will be a number of other restrictions .
Why is this important ?
Currently , there is no way for organizations to apply for new TLDs whenever they want , as ICANN 's Jason Keenan pointed out to us in November .
In order to get approved , domains must go through a round of ICANN applications when such a round is open ( you cannot apply for a new domain today , for example ) .
The policies for 2008 's round are being developed by ICANN 's Generic Names Supporting Organization ( GNSO ) in such a way that the process for approval will be streamlined , and the GNSO expects to see a large number of new applicants .
The GNSO acknowledges that such potentially large expansion of TLDs could impact the stability of the current DNS system ( which currently only needs to handle a handful of TLDs ) .
" The addition of gTLDs to the namespace is an expansion of the DNS on a potentially large scale , to include many more names at the top level , " wrote the GNSO in its paper last week .
" Strings must not cause any technical instability . "
As a result , the group has put together a number of recommendations for what is and is n't acceptable as a gTLD .
First , gTLDs must conform to all existing syntax rules which forbid the use of blank spaces as part of a name , specify that TLDs are not case - sensitive , and stipulate that the first character must be a letter from the Latin alphabet .
But the GNSO also recommends that ICANN prohibit gTLDs that are entirely numeric in order to avoid confusion with IP addresses , which are also numeric and separated by dots .
Extensions beginning with " 0 x " and followed by another hexadecimal character should also be prohibited , GNSO says , because they could be confused for a hex string that is usually converted to an IP address .
When it comes to certain string combos , though , the organization says that it has given considerable thought to whether certain popular file extensions should be prohibited .
GNSO points out that browsers would need to be able to identify the difference between a domain ending in , for example , .pdf and a link to a file that has the extension of .pdf , but says that this would need to be a function of the application and not the DNS system .
There 's also a much greater danger of user confusion when it comes to using common file extensions , but GNSO says that the task of determining exactly which extensions are " too popular " would be a rather large one that can't yet be addressed .
" If ICANN wished to prevent potentially significant problems in the application layer or avoid user confusion issues resulting from a string like .EXE , it would need to do so based on a defined list of extensions that were disallowed , a list maintained outside of ICANN and internationally recognized as the authoritative source for ' commonly used file extensions , ' " wrote the organization .
" Additionally , a mechanism for maintaining and updating such a list would need to be in place , because new file extensions could become prevalent at any time .
To date , staff has not been able to locate a list of common file extensions that is generally acknowledged to be authoritative . "
These guidelines are not yet set in stone , and ICANN is soliciting feedback on the proposed rules from the community .

If 2007 was the year bipartisan sentiment soured on US politics , then 2008 could be the year Americans go guerrilla .
Best - selling activism author , Heather Wokusch , says , " Americans have had enough of governmental business as usual and are looking for positive ways to take back their country . "
Wokusch 's book , The Progressives ' Handbook : Get the Facts and Make a Difference Now , Volume 1 , hit # 1 on Amazon 's political activism charts last week .
Volume 2 of the series also soared to Amazon 's top ten list for political activism .
" It 's clear that Americans are hungry for The Progressives ' Handbooks ' message of political self - empowerment , " Wokusch said .
" They sense the country is headed in the wrong direction and want effective ways to get it back on track . "
Volume 1 of The Progressives ' Handbook series details the Bush administration 's record in the areas of Women 's Issues , Education , Mainstream Media and US Weapons of Mass Destruction , while Volume 2 covers Elections & Voting , Environment and Foreign Policy .
Activism tips are featured throughout both Volumes .
One chapter , for example , details how to locate biological - weapons research facilities , how to fight the militarization of space , and how to urge US legislators to spend less on destructive technologies .
Another chapter reveals how to track which corporations sponsor what politicians and how to make sure every vote is counted .
As one reviewer summed it up , The Progressives ' Handbook series is " part encyclopedia and part self - defense manual . "
A recent Zogby poll found that both Democrats and Republicans are angry with the US political system .
A majority from both parties polled in New Hampshire said they were unhappy with Congress , while nearly half of the Republican voters said they were angry at President Bush .
" But eagerness to ' throw the bums out ' does not necessarily translate into positive action , " Wokusch says .
" Not everyone wants to attend political rallies or Town Hall meetings , and that 's why the creative activism ideas featured in The Progressives ' Handbook series have proven so popular . "
Wokusch points out that 234 years ago this week , a group of Americans took matters into their own hands and ended up changing history .
" But I do n't expect any more Boston tea parties in the near future , " she laughs .
" Entering a critical election year though , " Wokusch adds , " Americans want detailed background on the issues they care about most and creative ideas for how they can take back their country .
That 's what The Progressives ' Handbook series is all about . "

Grooverider on the decks
The DJ , whose real name is Raymond Bingham , co-presented a weekend drum & bass show on the station .
He was arrested on 23 November 2007 after being caught with 2.16 grams of cannabis at the airport .
Bingham claims the drugs were in the pocket of a pair of trousers and he had forgotten about them .
He 'll serve the minimum sentence for possession in the United Arab Emirates but his agents have told Newsbeat they hope to get him released .
A Radio 1 spokesman said : " Grooverider has paid a very high price for a serious mistake . "
In the march issue of the Atlantic magazine , sandwiched between an article about Chinese Internet technology and a review of modernist art criticism , lies a seven - page essay called “ Marry Him !
The Case for Settling . ”
Its author is Lori Gottlieb , a 40 - year - old Los Angeles writer and single mother who admits that the idea of finding Mr. Right , a notion she once harbored , was in fact a bill of goods .
Young women in search of marriage and family , she writes , should think seriously about resigning themselves to Mr. Good Enough .
“ Marriage is n’t a passion - fest , ” Gottlieb writes .
“ It ’s more like a partnership formed to run a very small , mundane and often boring nonprofit business . ”
Gottlieb ( who ’s an acquaintance of mine ) has already adapted this essay into a commentary on public radio’s “ Talk of the Nation ” and discussed it on the “ Today ” show .
It has sparked responses , in the blogosphere and elsewhere , whose collective word count surely exceeds that of her article by at least a hundred - fold .
Partly that ’s the result of the button - pushing nature of the subject , and partly it ’s because of certain shrewd ( or depending on your point of view , appalling ) rhetorical choices Gottlieb makes over the course of her article .
I wo n’t attempt to capture the tone or content of the entire treatise ( it ’s on newsstands and the Atlantic ’s website ) ; I want to quote from one passage that seems to be inflaming people the most .
“ Every woman I know -- no matter how successful and ambitious , how financially and emotionally secure -- feels panic , occasionally coupled with desperation , if she hits 30 and finds herself unmarried .
Advertisement
“ Oh , I know -- I ’m guessing there are single 30 - year - old women ... who will be writing letters to the editor to say that the women I know are n’t widely representative , that I ’ve been co-opted by the cult of the feminist backlash , and , basically , that I have no idea what I ’m talking about .
And all I can say is , if you say you ’re not worried , either you ’re in denial or you ’re lying . ”
Really ?
At 30 , I felt panic at the thought of being married .
But I ’ll leave the rebuttals on this point to others ( some thoughtful , some apoplectic , can be found via a quick Internet search ) .
Besides , I detect enough self - deprecating drollery in the essay to persuade me it ’s not the crime against humanity that many of its more vehement critics are convinced it is .
What does feel to me like a crime , however , is what “ Marry Him ! ” assumes is most women ’s relationship to motherhood -- namely that it ’s as necessary a part of adult female life as breathing .
Gottlieb , at 38 , had a baby with donated sperm .
She could have framed her argument around the problematic aura of “ empowerment ” that surrounds popular notions of single - by - choice parenting .
Instead , she echoes the conventional wisdom that women do n’t just want children , we need them .
We ’re so delirious with need , in fact , that we should make all manner of sacrifice -- including partnering with any old man -- in order to grab this biologically determined brass ring .
I do n’t really blame Gottlieb for the premise ; she ’s merely reflecting the values of her culture .
And I do n’t mean the affluent , urban , progressive culture suggested by the details she provides about her romantic quandaries .
I ’m talking about the way baby hunger has become such a consumer force in this country that some ( not all , but some ) women want a baby in the same way they want a Louis Vuitton bag , because they ’ve been told to want one .
And why not ?
In some ways , acquisition has never been easier .

Reproductive technology , a boon for countless people , has also created a strange kind of tyranny .
By extending the deadline and loosening the criteria for getting pregnant , by granting no exemptions from the unremitting pressure to procreate ( Menopausal ?
No problem !
Lesbian ?
No excuse ! ) , the ever - widening window of reproductive opportunity contributes to the notion that not only should parenthood be available to every individual or couple , it ’s a good idea for every individual or couple too .
One need n’t pay a midnight visit to the diaper aisle of Walgreen ’s to suspect that that might not actually be the case .
Most people do eventually want to become parents .
But in the 21st century , there is no good reason to see childbearing as an inevitable extension of a committed partnership or even as an ordained personal ambition .
Instead , we need to view it for what it is : a profoundly important and difficult job that should only be undertaken by those who have the will and temperament to do it .
Because we ’re biologically programmed to take on that job -- or at least fill out the application -- it ’s unlikely we ’ll run out of humans .
And by all means , if you ’re truly listening to yourself rather than buying society ’s relentless parenthood sales pitch , have a child , find a mate or both .
But when it comes to Gottlieb ’s case for “ settling ” -- for doing that at all costs -- I ca n’t help but wonder if what ’s missing from the prototypical unhappy single woman ’s life is n’t a man or a baby but an imagination .
There are infinite ways to define a fulfilling life .
Why enshrine the one whose accompanying illustration shows a marriage certificate and a baby stroller ?
Talk about settling .

Germany ( TGW ) – Oil will hit $ 200 a barrel , one of Germany ’s leading economic institutes predicted today .
" Oil supplies are becoming increasingly scarce and that will continue to drive up prices , " Claudia Kemfert , the energy expert of the DIW German Institute for Economic Research , told Berliner Zeitung newspaper .
The Institute predicted $ 150 oil in 5 years and $ 200 oil in 10 years .
Kemfert added prices will likely reach $ 105 in the coming weeks .
Few analysts see the oil market calming anytime soon .
" We find it difficult to contemplate any scenario which does n't see annual average prices going steadily higher , " said Kevin Norrish , an analyst at Barclays Capital .

My wife and I have started watching re-runs of crime shows .
We particularly enjoy Cold Case , Law & Order , and Law & Order SVU ( Special Victims Unit ) .
Last night we were watching an episode of Law and Order : Criminal Intent and it contained a really great dialog that involved a question I hear frequently “ How can you afford that ? ”
I ’m quoting from memory here , so the dialog and story line is n’t exact , but hopefully I ’ll capture the essence .
A police officer was being investigated by Detectives Robert Goren ( played by Vincent D’Onofrio ) and Detective Alexandra Eames for using the police computer systems to illegally retrieve criminal records on drug dealers and other “ rich ” criminals .
She would then kill them and steal their money , using it to to live a better than the average cop lifestyle with her mother and two children .
The relevant part of the story is when the two detectives are interviewing the officer at her home before they had any hard evidence to convict her .
Detective Detective Goren is convinced she is guilty but ca n’t prove it just yet :
Det. Goren : “ What I ca n’t figure out is how you can afford such a nice house and to send your girls to private school ? ”
Officer : “ I ’m frugal ”
Det. Goren : “ I do n’t spend a lot , and I could n’t afford this house ”
Officer : “ You are n’t frugal enough ”
Det. Goren : “ Sure I am ”
Officer : “ You dress to impress .
You are a big man and therefore finding clothes at discount stores that fit you is hard .
You use this as an excuse to purchase high - dollar name brand clothing .
You ’re single and therefore date often .
You take your dates to expensive restaurants and drive a nice car to impress them …
I buy bargain clothing , do n’t date , never go out and live very frugally .
I use my money to buy my home instead . ”
Det. Gorn : Looking stunned he says “ That ’s very good , but you still have n’t answered the question . ”
Detective Goren has a common problem that many people have : he has no clue where his money goes .
He only knows he does n’t have enough .
He thinks he ’s frugal and that he does n’t spend much , but he does .
Here are a few tips for people like Detective Goren :
Track your spending
For the first month we started getting control of our finances , I tracked every expenditure we made .
At the end of the month , we totaled up everything and were frankly pretty surprised at how much things like eating out , coffee , convenience store drinks , etc add up .
We found a number of areas where we could cut back .
Doing so was like getting an immediate raise .
Buy a cheap little pocket note book and keep it with you .
Record every expense and categorize it .
Use that to feed into the next tip and reduce your expenses .
Budget
Create a budget and manage your finances rather than your finances managing you .
Tell your money where to go .
Use the notebook from the previous tip as input into your budget process .
Find areas where you can cut back on your expenses and put a cap on them .
Currently spending $ 50 / month on Starbucks coffees ?
Create a coffee budget category and cap it at $ 10 .
Make your coffee at home instead .
This will allow you to treat yourself to a Starbucks coffee without spending more than you want .
I ’d recommend using an excel spreadsheet or You Need A Budget to track and manage your budget .
Make an effort to find the lowest price and be patient
Too many people decide they need something , say a new pair of shoes or a new sport jacket , and just run out to the local mall and get them .
Sure you get what you need , but you most likely paid way too much for it .
Instead shop around at the various stores .
Bring a small notebook and write the prices down .
Shop around online as well and see how online prices compare ( do n’t forget to factor in shipping ) .
Most importantly , be patient .
I had been wanting to purchase a couple of sport jackets for at least 6 months or so .
Everything I saw was $ 60 and up .
While $ 60 for a sport coat is n’t too bad , it was more than I wanted to spend .
While walking through Wal - Mart one evening , I saw some sport coats on the rack and thought I ’d take a look .
Turned out there were marked WAY down .
I got them for $ 19.99 each !
I saved $ 40.00 .
I bought two of them , and have been very happy with the quality and look .
Dressing to impress does n’t mean you have to buy your clothes from Brooks Brothers .
Prioritize your spending
Detective Goren was a bit jealous that he was n’t able to afford a nice home , yet continued to spend his money on expensive clothes , dates and car .
While the officer stayed at home , lived frugally ( or so it seemed ) and had a nice home .
If Detective Goren wanted a home that bad , he needed to make it a priority and set a goal .
What are your financial goals and what expenditures are keeping you from reaching those goals ?
Make a plan of how and when you are going to reach your financial goal and make that a priority when doing your budget and managing your finances .
Turns out Detective Goren was right .
The officer was in fact stealing money to support her “ above average police officer lifestyle ” , but I think the basic principles she shared with Detective Goren were dead on .
So next time you say to yourself “ How can they afford that ? “ , consider that maybe they ’ve made it a priority .
We have 6 children , and constantly get asked how in the world we afford them .
I do n’t ever really have a good answer , except that we just do .
I know my wife and I make them a priority and adjust our expenses accordingly .
I am sure that ’s a big part of it .
It ’s truely amazing how much you can stretch each dollar when you have to .
Do you budget and track your expenses ?
Do you know where your money goes ?
Do you know where your money leaks are ?
What tips can you share to help people manage their money better and live more frugally ?

Why do some people solve problems more creatively than others ?
Are people who think creatively different from those who tend to think in a more methodical fashion ?
These questions are part of a long - standing debate , with some researchers arguing that what we call “ creative thought ” and “ noncreative thought ” are not basically different .
If this is the case , then people who are thought of as creative do not really think in a fundamentally different way from those who are thought of as noncreative .
On the other side of this debate , some researchers have argued that creative thought is fundamentally different from other forms of thought .
If this is true , then those who tend to think creatively really are somehow different .
A new study led by John Kounios , professor of Psychology at Drexel University and Mark Jung - Beeman of Northwestern University answers these questions by comparing the brain activity of creative and noncreative problem solvers .
The study , published in the journal Neuropsychologia , reveals a distinct pattern of brain activity , even at rest , in people who tend to solve problems with a sudden creative insight -- an “ Aha ! Moment ” – compared to people who tend to solve problems more methodically .
At the beginning of the study , participants relaxed quietly for seven minutes while their electroencephalograms ( EEGs ) were recorded to show their brain activity .
The participants were not given any task to perform and were told they could think about whatever they wanted to think about .
Later , they were asked to solve a series of anagrams – scrambled letters that can be rearranged to form words [ MPXAELE = EXAMPLE ] .
These can be solved by deliberately and methodically trying out different letter combinations , or they can be solved with a sudden insight or “ Aha ! ” in which the solution pops into awareness .
After each successful solution , participants indicated in which way the solution had come to them .
The participants were then divided into two groups – those who reported solving the problems mostly by sudden insight , and those who reported solving the problems more methodically – and resting - state brain activity for these groups was compared .
As predicted , the two groups displayed strikingly different patterns of brain activity during the resting period at the beginning of the experiment – before they knew that they would have to solve problems or even knew what the study was about .
One difference was that the creative solvers exhibited greater activity in several regions of the right hemisphere .
Previous research has suggested that the right hemisphere of the brain plays a special role in solving problems with creative insight , likely due to right - hemisphere involvement in the processing of loose or “ remote ” associations between the elements of a problem , which is understood to be an important component of creative thought .
The current study shows that greater right - hemisphere activity occurs even during a “ resting ” state in those with a tendency to solve problems by creative insight .
This finding suggests that even the spontaneous thought of creative individuals , such as in their daydreams , contains more remote associations .

Second , creative and methodical solvers exhibited different activity in areas of the brain that process visual information .
The pattern of “ alpha ” and “ beta ” brainwaves in creative solvers was consistent with diffuse rather than focused visual attention .
This may allow creative individuals to broadly sample the environment for experiences that can trigger remote associations to produce an Aha !
Moment .
For example , a glimpse of an advertisement on a billboard or a word spoken in an overheard conversation could spark an association that leads to a solution .
In contrast , the more focused attention of methodical solvers reduces their distractibility , allowing them to effectively solve problems for which the solution strategy is already known , as would be the case for balancing a checkbook or baking a cake using a known recipe .
Thus , the new study shows that basic differences in brain activity between creative and methodical problem solvers exist and are evident even when these individuals are not working on a problem .
According to Kounios , “ Problem solving , whether creative or methodical , does n’t begin from scratch when a person starts to work on a problem .
His or her pre-existing brain - state biases a person to use a creative or a methodical strategy . ”
In addition to contributing to current knowledge about the neural basis of creativity , this study suggests the possible development of new brain imaging techniques for assessing potential for creative thought , and for assessing the effectiveness of methods for training individuals to think creatively .

A Day at UNICEF Headquarters , as I Imagined It in Third Grade
( UNICEF sits on a throne .
He is wearing a cape and holding a sceptre .
A servant enters , on his knees . )
UNICEF : Halloween is fast approaching !
Have the third graders been given their little orange boxes ?
SERVANT : Yes , your majesty !
UNICEF : Perfect .
Did you tell them what the money was for ?
SERVANT : No , sir , of course not !
We just gave them the boxes and told them to collect for UNICEF .
We said it was for “ a good cause , ” but we did n’t get any more specific than that .
UNICEF : Ha ha ha !
Those fools !
Soon I will have all the money in the world .
For I am UNICEF , evil king of Halloween !
SERVANT : Sir . . . do n’t you think you ’ve stolen enough from the children ?
Maybe you should let them keep the money this year .
UNICEF : Never !
The children shall toil forever to serve my greed !
( He tears open a little orange box full of coins and rubs them all over his fat stomach . )
UNICEF : Yes !
Oh , yes !
SERVANT : Wait !
Your majesty !
Look at this !
Our records indicate that there ’s a kid out there —
Simon — who ’s planning to keep his UNICEF money this year .
UNICEF : What ?!
But what about my evil plans ?
I was going to give that money to the Russians so they could build a bomb !
SERVANT : ( aside ) I guess there ’s still one hero left in this world .
UNICEF : No !
( He runs out of the castle , sobbing . )
SERVANT : Thank God Simon is keeping his UNICEF money .
SECOND SERVANT : Yes , it ’s good that he ’s keeping the money .
THIRD SERVANT : I agree .
Simon is doing a good thing by keeping the money from the UNICEF box .
SERVANT : Then we ’re all in agreement .
Simon should keep the money .

Writing a Book in Google Docs
Currently , my editor Brian Jepson and I are collaboratively writing the book ( tentatively titled ) Google Office Hacks by O'Reilly using Google Docs .
I wanted to outline the process we came up with , and maybe it 's helpful for you too for certain needs .
The outline
The base document we 're working on is the outline .
It 's a linked table of contents which helps us to organize the broad shape of the book , and also see the status of progress .
I 've bookmarked the outline in Firefox and added a keyword shortcut within the bookmark properties , so to open it I just need to type " gohacks " into the browser address bar .
Each document , as you can see in the screenshot , includes a title , status information , and a snippet .
( In Google Office Hacks , the different sections are called chapters , and each individual article is called a hack . )
The hack title is bold , and – provided the article behind it is written already – links to the Google document in question .
We color - coded the status information to have an easy overview : green means it 's the first draft , yellow means Brian edited this first draft , cyan means it 's in second draft , and gray is for chapters which went into production status .
These colors allow us to quickly scroll down the long outline and see where we need to spend our work that day .
To open a document from the outline , you can now simply right - click it and pick something like " Open link in new window " from the context menu ( provided you have been granted the respective editing rights ) .
Tip : I originally wrote the outline in Word , and then converted it to a Google document .
Bad idea !
This brings a lot of minor formatting quirks which the document does n't seem to get rid of over time .
To avoid these quirks , better start out fresh , or only copy plain ( non-rich text ) content into documents .
These days when working with documents , I 'm usually cleaning small text snippets I want to paste into the document by first pasting them into the browser address bar , to then copy them again ... this workaround turns the clipboard content into plain text .
The individual documents
Each document / hack uses the basic same template .
I did n't use the default Google document styling because I do n't like the overlong line lengths it creates when you use a full - window browser , so I added a < div > wrapper using the " Edit HTML " tab .
To re-use this template , I 'm always opening an existing hack , to then pick File ->
Copy document from the menu .
( It happened before that I forgot this copying and overwrote an old hack with a new one , but gratefully there 's a revision feature to undo this mishap . )
My document styling of choice is the following , but any other style can be used too , of course :
< div style = " padding : 20 px ; width : 620 px ; font - size : 14 px ; " > ... content goes here ... </div>
The document layout this creates can be seen in the screenshot :
When I insert screenshots or other images into a document , I 'm first saving them as non-color reduced PNG files in local folder , where each folder is named after the hack title .
An image format like JPEG might be a bad choice as the compression is not completely loss - free .
Once images are included in the document I 'm usually adding a 1 - pixel black border by going to the Edit HTML tab .
It would be nice to do this via the image inclusion dialog – in fact , it would be nice to have Google Docs templates so that layout preferences do n't have to be adjusted every time !
( Though in fact , one hack now in the book deals with having a bookmarklet grab the Document Object Model of the Google Docs webpage to then go through it via an XPath to add borders to images . )
I 'm using only limited formatting within the documents , like Ctrl + B for bold , or Ctrl + I for italics .
( Sometimes , oddly enough , your formatting commands are ignored though on certain text selections . )
O'Reilly handles the specifics of the book formatting – for instance , Brian wrote a script to convert the documents to the necessary format – so I do n't have to worry about this ( phew ) .
The workflow
Once a document is written , I 'm using the " Check spelling " feature Google Docs provides .
When that 's done , I 'm saving a local backup by using the " Export as HTML ( zipped ) " option ... just in case anything gets lost .
Then I switch to the Share tab to share the page with Brian .
Brian will then get an invite to the document and can take over from there .
There 's one quirk here with sharing .
I do n't want to manually type Brian 's email address all the time in the " Invite people " dialog , so I 'm just typing " Brian " and then hope for the auto - completion dialog to pop up .
Now , Brian does n't use a Gmail address as his main email so I 'm usually writing to his O'Reilly address .
This makes Google Docs wrongly assume that it's not necessary to show that Gmail address of Brian in the auto - completion dialog .
The workaround ?
From my Gmail account , I have to sent Brian a couple of bogus emails to his Gmail account every now and then to force Google Docs to " remember " his address in the auto - completion dialog .
Once Brian finished editing a document – by correcting my English , fact - checking , adjusting style , adding Google Docs comments , adding knowledge and so on – he saves and goes to the outline to change the color and status message next to the article 's title .
When I see this I can then go back to work on the document and pick the Revisions tab , comparing Brian 's latest version with my last version before Brian took over .
When you check a revision , you will see strike - throughs and different colors and so on to indicate what was changed .
Unfortunately , when you want to follow - up on a change you need to leave the Revisions tab again and switch back to the Edit tab – and next time you want to go to the revision tab , you are again asked to select which two versions you want to compare .
While it may be possible to open two windows of the document , that could also be risky as both may be auto - saving every now and then .
It would be much more neat if Google would remember the last selection of the Revisions tab , so you would be able to quickly toggle back and forth between reading a revision , and making changes in the editing tab .
Naming the files
In the case of Google Office Hacks , I 'm preceding all file names in the Google Docs file listing with " GOHacks " .
Short names are useful due to the limited screen space ( so calling it " Google Office Hacks " may push important information in the title out of view ) .
Also , I 'm dragging them all into the Google Docs " Google Office Hacks " folder for better organization .
Then , the title is extended hierarchically to read e.g. " GOHacks - Spreadsheets - Add live data to your spreadsheet " ( where " Spreadsheets " is the chapter title , and " Add live data ... " is the hack title ) .
I 'm rarely spending too much time in the Google Docs file explorer though , as the outline document serves as our base for jumping to documents .
However , the file explorer can be useful for searching .
One thing you do notice with the Google Docs explorer is that it 's quite wasteful about using screen space – too little of the files are shown , too much space is wasted on information such as the folder description ( even though Google already slightly improved this situation in a recent update ) .
Pros and cons to using , say , MS Word
Working from anywhere :
In theory , as the book is stored on the Google server farm and not your home computer , you can access and edit it from anywhere , like an internet cafe , or your friend 's computer , or a public cafe with wifi .
In practice , when writing a book you need to concentrate quite a bit .
Some authors may be able to concentrate better when hooked up to their laptop in a public cafe , while others need to go have a non-changing , quiet place – like their home desk , room doors closed .
If that 's the case , then the " work from anywhere " bonus of online applications is somewhat lost .
Nevertheless , the fact that Google Docs allows me to collaborate on the same document with my editor , who sits across the ocean , is a great benefit .

Lack of features : Google Docs has much less features than programs like Word , which have historically grown over the years .
In general I prefer a slim program to one that is so feature - cluttered , you will have a hard time finding all the options to turn off CRAP ( Configurations Rarely Applied by People ) .
However , every now and then you 'll also bump your head against the keyboard because a really basic , needed feature is n't there ... wishing Google would work faster on implementing certain stuff .
We 'll see what 2008 brings in this regard .

You need an online connection : Working with Google Docs requires an internet connection .
In my case , I need this internet connection anyway – even if I 'd be using something like Open Office – because I have to check Google 's applications all the time to write hacks for Google Office Hacks .
But let 's face it , even if you 're writing something not about the internet , it 's really great to have search engines back up your knowledge .
So to me , the prerequisite of having to have an internet connection is not a real downside ; your mileage may vary ( and who knows , Google may also release Gears - support for Google Docs in the future ) .
On the other hand , having an internet connection can also be distracting from your work , of course ... when you find yourself surrounded by all the little attention grabbers like chat , email , and social news sites !
There are many other differences between the two programs .
Google Docs is free , for instance , whereas Word is n't .
There may be smaller differences in start - up times ( Google documents could really use a speed boost in this regards ) .
One other thing I like about Google docs , or most web applications , is that I can switch to the English interface ; this makes it much easier to , for instance , communicate about the application in help groups , or search for certain things in regards to the application .
( With my locally installed Word I 'm stuck with German . )
Theoretically , with an online app you also do n't need to handle file backups yourself , because the application provider does this for you ; practically , it 's always a little risky to fully depend on the web app to never screw up , so you may be handling backups yourself anyway .
After all , it wo n't help you much to know that Google told you Google Docs is still in Beta when your data is lost .

The merits of the argument aside , Mr. Buckley irrevocably proved that his brand of candor did not lend itself to public life when an Op - Ed article he wrote for The New York Times offered a partial cure for the AIDS epidemic : “ Everyone detected with AIDS should be tattooed in the upper forearm to prevent common needle users , and on the buttocks , to prevent the victimization of homosexuals , ” he wrote .
In his last years , as honors like the Presidential Medal of Freedom came his way , Mr. Buckley gradually loosened his grip on his intellectual empire .
In 1998 , he ended his frenetic schedule of public speeches , about 70 a year over 40 years , he once estimated .
In 1999 , he stopped “ Firing Line , ” and in 2004 , he relinquished his voting stock in National Review .
He wrote his last spy novel ( the 11th in his series ) , sold his sailboat and stopped playing the harpsichord publicly .
But he began a new historical novel and kept up his columns , including one on the “ bewitching power ” of “ The Sopranos ” television series .
He commanded wide attention by criticizing the Iraq war as a failure .
On April 15 , 2007 , his wife , the former Patricia Aldyen Austin Taylor , who had carved out a formidable reputation as a socialite and philanthropist but considered her role as a homemaker , mother and wife most important , died .
Mr. and Mrs. Buckley called each other “ Ducky . ”
He is survived by his son , Christopher , of Washington ; his sisters Priscilla L. Buckley of Sharon , Conn. , Patricia Buckley Bozell of Washington , and Carol Buckley of Columbia , S.C. ; his brothers James L. , of Sharon , and F. Reid , of Camden , S.C. ; a granddaughter ; and a grandson
In the end it was Mr. Buckley ’s graceful , often self - deprecating wit that endeared him to others .
In his spy novel “ Who ’s on First , ” he described the possible impact of his National Review through his character Boris Bolgin .
“ ‘ Do you ever read the National Review , Jozsef ? ’ asks Boris Bolgin , the chief of KGB counter intelligence for Western Europe .
‘ It is edited by this young bourgeois fanatic . ’ . ”
MSNBC : Can Democratic leaders get Bill Clinton to ' pipe down ' ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday January 21 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Prominent Democrats , including Sen . Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) and Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) , recently told former President Bill Clinton he has to tone down his campaign rhetoric against Barack Obama .
Jonathan Alter , who broke that story for Newsweek , explained to the hosts of MSNBC's Morning Joe that the party leaders felt that , although it was acceptable for Clinton to say nice things about his wife , it was " inappropriate for a former president -- and the guy who is informally still the head of the Democratic Party -- to be out trashing another Democrat . "
" Bill Clinton seems every week to come up with a new story that makes people roll their eyes , " suggested host Joe Scarborough .
" In Nevada , we had the story of Bill Clinton and other people being chased by union thugs .
...
There 's a story like that every week that you know is just not the truth , and yet he keeps doing it .
Is he just out of control ? "
Alter replied that on balance , the Clinton campaign considers Bill a huge asset in raising money and drawing crowds , but that it 's true they can't control him .
He added that a current Obama advisor , who had been the leader of Clinton 's impeachment defense 10 years ago , had raised the question that " if Hillary 's campaign can't control Bill Clinton , how will Hillary 's White House be able to control Bill Clinton ?
And what will we be in for ? "
Co-host Willie Geist pointed out that Obama is now striking back at Bill Clinton himself , saying in recent remarks that he " has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that I think is pretty troubling .
He continues to make statements that are n't supported by the facts . "
Alter noted that Obama has problems in striking the right tone while defending himself against Bill Clinton , because " it 's not too helpful to be on defense against somebody who is still widely revered in the Democratic Party . "
He also agreed with co-host Mike Brzezinski that the Clintons are very deliberately " trying to force Obama off his message and to get into the trench and to respond , " but said that if Obama tries to ignore Bill Clinton 's attacks and remain above the fray , the slurs will go unanswered .
Alter concluded , however , that the " basic question in the Democratic primaries ... is restoration -- the Clintons -- versus inspiration -- everybody on both sides agrees Obama 's inspiring . "
He said the nomination will ultimately turn on one simple question : " Do we want to ... go back to those 90's ... or do we want to turn the page , as Obama says , and move on to the next chapter . "
" Good luck shutting Bill Clinton up , " were Geist 's final words .

FORT DODGE , Iowa 
There was the period last spring when Mitt Romney claimed while campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire that he had been a hunter “ pretty much all my life , ” only to have to admit later that he had seriously hunted only on two occasions .
Then there was the endorsement Mr. Romney claimed on the NBC News program “ Meet the Press ” last Sunday that he received from the National Rifle Association while running for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 , when it turned out the group had never endorsed him .
Mr. Romney ’s latest concession is that he only “ figuratively ” saw his father , George , march with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , something he claimed in his highly publicized speech about his Mormon faith this month .
Some publications have raised doubts that Mr. Romney ’s father ever marched with Dr. King .
But Mike Allen , a writer for the political Web site Politico.com , reported on Friday that he had interviewed two people who recalled seeing George Romney and Dr. King marching together in Grosse Pointe , Mich . , in 1963 .
Mr. Romney once said , in reference to misstatements by his Republican rival Rudolph W. Giuliani , “ Facts are stubborn things . ”
But does he have his own problem with blurring the truth ?

Just thinking out loud .
No tags for this post .
All this was illuminated last year in a study by a Swedish research organization , Timbro , which compared the gross domestic products of the 15 European Union members ( before the 2004 expansion ) with those of the 50 American states and the District of Columbia .
( Norway , not being a member of the union , was not included . )
After adjusting the figures for the different purchasing powers of the dollar and euro , the only European country whose economic output per person was greater than the United States average was the tiny tax haven of Luxembourg , which ranked third , just behind Delaware and slightly ahead of Connecticut .
The next European country on the list was Ireland , down at 41st place out of 66 ; Sweden was 14th from the bottom ( after Alabama ) , followed by Oklahoma , and then Britain , France , Finland , Germany and Italy .
The bottom three spots on the list went to Spain , Portugal and Greece .
Alternatively , the study found , if the E.U. was treated as a single American state , it would rank fifth from the bottom , topping only Arkansas , Montana , West Virginia and Mississippi .
In short , while Scandinavians are constantly told how much better they have it than Americans , Timbro 's statistics suggest otherwise .
So did a paper by a Swedish economics writer , Johan Norberg .
Contrasting " the American dream " with " the European daydream , " Mr. Norberg described the difference : " Economic growth in the last 25 years has been 3 percent per annum in the U.S. , compared to 2.2 percent in the E.U .
That means that the American economy has almost doubled , whereas the E.U. economy has grown by slightly more than half .
The purchasing power in the U.S. is $ 36,100 per capita , and in the E.U. $ 26,000 -- and the gap is constantly widening . "
The one detail in Timbro 's study that did n't feel right to me was the placement of Scandinavian countries near the top of the list and Spain near the bottom .
My own sense of things is that Spaniards live far better than Scandinavians .
In Norwegian pubs , for example , anyone rich or insane enough to order , say , a gin and tonic is charged about $ 15 for a few teaspoons of gin at the bottom of a glass of tonic ; in Spain , the drinks are dirt - cheap and the bartender will pour the gin up to the rim unless you say " stop . "
In late March , another study , this one from KPMG , the international accounting and consulting firm , cast light on this paradox .
It indicated that when disposable income was adjusted for cost of living , Scandinavians were the poorest people in Western Europe .
Danes had the lowest adjusted income , Norwegians the second lowest , Swedes the third .
Spain and Portugal , with two of Europe 's least regulated economies , led the list .
Once again the band began tinkering .
“ We have a song and we ’ve got lots of different ways we can try it , but we do n’t know what ’s going to work , and that ’s why it still sort of feels a bit weirdly amateur , ” Mr. Greenwood said .
“ You ’d think by now we ’d know what ’s going to work , and what ’s still frustrating , or kind of encouraging in a way , is that we do n’t know whether it ’s going to work on a laptop or whether it has to be a piano or . ... ”
He half - smiled .
“ It ’s got so twisted , ” he added .
“ What we ’ve learned is that you ca n’t repeat a method that you ’ve already used for a song when it did work . ”
The sound of “ In Rainbows ” often seems straightforward , almost like a live band ; it is Radiohead ’s most gracefully melodic album in a decade .
But Radiohead arrived at the music circuitously , and there ’s often more tucked into a track than is apparent at first .
“ Videotape , ” with lyrics about recording a happy moment in a tape to be viewed posthumously , has a tolling piano and a beat so elusive that “ we spent about a year in rehearsal on that song actually all trying to agree on where the one was , ” Mr. Selway said .
“ Each of us , over the course of a year , we ’d all lose it . ”
The “ Reckoner ” that was part of the band ’s live sets sounds nothing like the “ Reckoner ” on the album , which includes the lyrics “ in rainbows . ”
When the band returned from touring , it decided the song needed a second part , and then a third one ; eventually it discarded the original .
For “ All I Need , ” Mr. Greenwood said , he wanted to recapture the white noise generated by a band playing loudly in a room , when “ all this chaos kicks up . ”
That sound never materializes in the more analytical confines of a studio .
His solution was to have a string section , and his own overdubbed violas , sustaining every note of the scale , blanketing the frequencies .
Mr. Yorke worked on many of the songs in the Rose and Crown .
“ I sit there , on the way in , because it ’s a really nice little table , ” he said , pointing .
“ And then I get out my scraps of paper and I line them up .
I need to put them into my book because they ’re just scraps of paper , and I ’m going to lose them unless I do it .
So am I writing here ?
Probably .
I do n’t know yet .
I ’m just collating information .
This is a nice , relaxing thing to do , and it also keeps your mind tuned in to the whole thing .
And you see things you did n’t know . ”
The band and its managers are not releasing the download ’s sales figures or average price , and may never do so .
“ It ’s our linen , ” Mr. Hufford said .
“ We do n’t want to wash it in public . ”
A statement from the band rejected estimates by the online survey company ComScore that during October about three - fifths of worldwide downloaders took the album free , while the rest paid an average of $ 6 .
( Editor ’s note : We asked Amy Vernetti , an executive recruiter in Silicon Valley , to report what the high - tech executive job market is like these days , now that the economy is humming and unemployment rate is down . )
It ’s time to put the fatigues back onâ€ ¦the War for Talent is escalating .
We ’ve all watched as valuations for venture capital backed start up companies have risen over the past year .
We are now seeing the inevitable return of rising cash compensation packages , candidates with multiple offers and yesâ€ ¦the signing bonus is back !!!
The bonus was popular during the silly period of the late 1999 , but universally hated by employers and investors .
It ’s surprising to see it come back , but the good news is , we have n’t seen too many of them • yet .
Here at Taylor Winfield where all we do is recruit executives for investor led technology companies , we ’ve seen some very 1999 - like behavior from candidates and companies .
For obvious reasons , Taylor Winfield is not at liberty to discuss company names or candidate names while describing these incidents .
We think the scenarios are instructive without jeopardizing the confidentiality of either party .
Lessons Learned
â€¢ Savvy investors who understand the competitive landscape for talent are winning .
â€ ¢
It ’s critical to move candidates quickly and efficiently through the process .
â€¢ Dangling a liquidity event in front of a candidate is no longer an effecting recruiting tool .
â€¢ Candidates are far savvier this time around about equity compensation but cash is now equally important .
â€¢ Candidates know the market for talent is heating up and the best ones are n’t in the mood to negotiate ,
â€¢ Reference checking must be done discreetly and quickly
Anecdotal Evidence
This past week , a private , profitable consumer internet company on an IPO track extended its fourth offer to a candidate for an executive position .
After receiving a very respectable offer of $ 300 K base , 50 % bonus opportunity , $ 50 K signing bonus and more than 500,000 stock options , the first candidate turned the offer down for a better offer of $ 400 K base salary , 50 % bonus , restricted stock worth approximately $ 1 M on day one and a complete relocation package .
This is the crazy part :
The winning offer came from a company that had been contacted during a reference check on him , and that company decided to make an offer themselves • stealing the him away from the original client .
Another candidate turned the client down to remain in his current position because 500,000 stock options in a private company with strong prospects for a liquidity event was not enough to mitigate the risk of him leaving a $ 2B publicly traded company .
But candidates be warnedâ€ ¦the competitive landscape cuts both ways .
A sub $ 10 M telecom software company extended an offer to a Chief Financial Officer last month .
This CFO candidate had taken two companies through Initial Public Offerings , an important qualification for CFOs .
The start - up offered the CFO a $ 200 K base , 30 % bonus opportunity and 1.5 percent of the company .
This is a healthy compensation package from a company with $ 8 M in revs .
Twenty - four hours after receiving the offer , the candidate was wavering about joining the company .
The hiring CEO got wind of his wavering and promptly pulled the offer and went with another candidate .
The first CFO candidate came back a day later to accept the position but it was too late .
The CEO said , “ If he was wavering on this opportunity , this is not the guy I want in the foxhole with me . ”
During another CFO search for a private company on the path to a liquidity event , a candidate received an offer of $ 300 K base , 50 % bonus and the highest number of stock options in the company , next to the CEO .
During the 72 hours it took to negotiate this compensation package , this CFO received another offer to work with a CEO he had worked with previously .
The cash package was comparable but two things sealed the deal : the equity compensation and the expediency of the recruiting process .
This CFO was granted restricted stock that by conservative estimates was worth $ 3 M on day one .
The higher value of the restricted stock , the favorable tax treatment on restricted shares and the fact that as restricted stock vests it is owned by the individual ( versus stock options that typically must be exercised or forfeited within a tight timeframe ) made this a no- brainer for the CFO .
“ In addition to the more attractive compensation package , the management team at this company jumped through hoops to get me in front of all the decision makers over a four day period , ” said the candidate .
Yet another Silicon Valley start - up recently made an offer to a Vice President of Sales .
The base salary part of the compensation package was $ 10 k less than this candidate was making in his current position , which the company thought would be more than compensated by the stock package .
But to their surprise , the candidate was not willing to make that tradeoff .
The candidate said , “ The market being what it is , why would I accept a $ 10 K pay cut ? ”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has created a Google Earth map mashup that shows air quality across the nation .
Get started here .
There 's even a 3 - D map overlay that lets you view the level of air pollutants that are coming from specific businesses .
You can see this if you tilt your map , and it 's most useful when used with 3D map renderings , complete with business buildings and all .
The data offered for this map mashup is pretty specific , based on the data the EPA has in its database .
You can view the pollutants ' levels for carbon monoxide , sulfur dioxide , nitrogen dioxide , volatile organic compounds and particulate matter .
The EPA has noted that lead will be added to this list early next year .
The types of industries you 'll be able to look up are paper and pulp , petroleum refineries , chemical manufacturers and electricity producers .
By entering in a given area , you can see what company 's facilities are doing the most damage , in which ways .
Filter findings by state , level of pollutant , and industry .
Would n't it be interesting if something like a pollutant layer were added to virtual games like Second Life ?
Perhaps rendering this data into a virtual world game would be good for demonstrative purposes on the EPA 's behalf .
Then you could even make Erin Brockovich avatars , and save the world .

The annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) concludes today in Boston .
Unfortunately my schedule did not allow me to attend , but the press releases and news reports are flowing from Beantown .
Among the announcements were the 24 greatest scientific challenges facing humanity in the 21st century ( produced by a panel of experts put together by the National Academy of Engineering ) .
On the list was the task of reverse engineering the human brain .
( You can see the full list in this article . )
To me it seems highly likely that this is a goal we will achieve in the 21st century – 92 years seems like more than enough time .
We have already begun , in fact , to reverse engineer the brain .
If we separate this task into two broad categories – hardware and software – both have progressed very far but still have a long way to go .
By “ hardware ” I mean how the neurons and other brain cells work together to create memory , information processing , and sensory perception – how does the brain physically work .
By “ software ” I mean what information is actually in the brain and how that information and different processing areas work together to produce the net effects of mood , thought , and behavior .
Our understanding of the hardware of the brain is already highly detailed , but it is also clear that there is at least a layer of complexity that we have not yet drilled down to .
We know how neurons conduct signals , how those signals affect the firing of other neurons , how neurotransmitters work , how neuronal function is modulated by other neurons and other brain cells ( like astrocytes ) , and how the strength of neuronal connections relate to memory .
However , the more we look the more layers of complexity to all of these things we find .
And we have only begun to explore how patterns of neuronal activity relate to specific cognitive functions .
Understanding the software of the brain is a harder nut to crack , but recent progress has been accelerating , due largely to improved technology , like functional MRI scanning .
How , exactly , do our brains store the number 3 or the word “ pterodactyl ” ?
How does it process different types of information , and how do the different parts of the brain interact with each other ?
Progress on all these fronts is steady , but neuroscientists today are like astronomers who just recently turned their telescopes to the sky and are trying to make sense of all the complexity of the universe .
Already we have learned a great deal , as fMRI studies are showing which parts of the brain do what .
We are actually well on our way to reverse engineering the brain .
We are also at the relative beginning of another avenue to reverse engineering the brain , and that is using computers to model the brain .
Ray Kurzweil , author of The Singularity and an expert on artificial intelligence and future technology , who was one of the experts on the NAE panel , believes that we will succeed in creating human - level artificial intelligence by 2029 – 21 years from now .
He extrapolates from current progress that we will have both powerful enough computers and sophisticated enough software to create artificial intelligence in about two decades .
Kurzweil has clearly thought in great detail about this question – the 2029 figure is not a casual guess .
But even if we assume that his estimates are off by half , that means that we will achieve this goal by 2050 , still only halfway through the 21st century .
The hardware extrapolation seems to be the easier of the two – computer technology has been progressing at a very steady and predictable rate for decades ( a phenomenon known as Moore ’s Law ) .
Extending this for another couple of decades does not seem like much of a stretch .
Sure , we may run into unexpected technological hurdles , but so far we have been able to develop new approaches to computing technology to keep blasting through all hurdles and keep Moore ’s Law on track .
So while there is always uncertainty in predicting future technology , predicting this level of computer advancement at the least can be considered highly probable .
The software extrapolation I think is more difficult to do , as conceptual hurdles may be more difficult to solve and may stall progress for a undetermined amount of time .
So I am less confident with this prediction , but I still give it a high probability based upon the steady progress that has been made so far .
Also , I cannot think of any theoretical reason why artificial intelligence should not become a reality .
MIT researcher Tomaso Poggio ’s research is at the core of this question .
He has been engaged in two parallel lines of research – using computer software to model brain function and using our understanding of brain function to improve computer software .
At the AAAS meeting this past weekend he explained how he is now combining these two lines of research into one .
He came to this conclusion after a computer model of the human visual system he was working on was actually able to function as an artificially intelligent visual recognition system superior to previous such computer systems .
He is quoted as saying :
“ My perspective changed in a dramatic way .
It meant that we may be closer to understanding how the visual cortex recognizes objects and scenes than I ever thought possible . ”
Computers are now powerful enough that we can run virtual simulations of our current models of brain organization and function .
This is therefore a new tool to test our hypotheses about brain function .
And at the same time , as a bonus , these computer models can actually function on their own as computer systems .
This is similar to using a computer to model how a grandmaster plays chess and in so doing creating a computer program that can actually play chess .
Fast forward 21 years and ( Ray Kurzweil predicts ) we will have accurate computer models of brain structure and function that will not only simulate brain function – they will be functional artificial brains .
Reverse engineering the brain and creating human - level artificial intelligence are tasks that will progress in parallel – each playing off the other .
In fact ( as with Poggio ’s research ) these two tasks will be one and the same research program .
This is all very exciting stuff .
But so far I have only been discussing the basic science – creating the computer models .
What about the applications ?
This is a topic for another day .

project " La-Mulana "
La-Mulana
La-Mulana is a freeware free - roaming platformer game designed to look , sound , and play like a classic MSX game .
It ´s heavily influenced by the classic Konami MSX game " The Maze of Galious " and anyone who has played that title will probably recognize the similarities very quickly .
You play the whip - wielding Indiana Jones - esque archaeologist Lemeza Kosugi as he investigates the ancient ruins of La-Mulana in an attempt to find its treasure and one - up his father , who is trying to get the same treasure as well .
The game is huge , with many different areas to explore and dozens of items and weapons to find .
Each area has a large variety of puzzles and traps ( many of them quite fiendish ) and you need to solve the puzzles in each area to discover the Ankhs and Ankh Jewels , which allow you to fight the eight Guardians of the ruins .
To solve the puzzles you´ll need to be able to read the tablets scattered throughout the ruins , which will require a Hand Scanner and translation software for the portable MSX that Lemeza has brought along on the adventure .
Your Hand Scanner will also allow you to find items and search the bones of less fortunate adventurers .
La-Mulana is one of the longest freeware games I´ve played in quite some time -- my first playthrough took me 26 hours , and even if you knew exactly what to do for each puzzle in advance I´d still bet the game would take at least 10 - 12 hours to complete , not counting the bonus dungeon .

See , besides looking cool while folded into the wall , and looking amazing while folding down , those stairs are stupid .
As an architect , it 's not hard for me to see that those stairs , whether ' up ' or ' down ' are actually , in reality , folded down all the time .
Here 's what I mean ... go ahead and put your couch against that wall ... ok... now sit on it ... whoops , you forgot to bring your blanket down from upstairs .
Pull your couch out ... pull the stairs down , go up and retrieve your blanket .
You 'll do that all of 1 time until you 'll realize that , because those stairs need to occupy space at some point , you 'll need to leave that couch out away from the wall all the time .
So , you might as well just leave the stairs down and kiss the money you spent on 'em goodbye .
But hey , they look really cool folded up !

I ’ve always said you learn a lot more by piecing two articles together than you do by reading either of them separately .
With that in mind , let ’s follow up on what I just wrote about troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
First , the US arguing with NATO about troops in Afghanistan .
The United States will press its European NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan ’s violent south in response to Canada ’s call for reinforcements , but the Pentagon said it will not commit any more of its own forces there .
… U.S. defense officials have also regularly complained about the unwillingness of European allies to dedicate more combat troops and equipment to Afghanistan .
All right , take a moment to let that sink in .
Now let ’s head over to Iraq .
What ’s the problem there ?
The Bush administration is sending strong signals that U.S. troop reductions in Iraq will slow or stop altogether this summer , a move that would jeopardize hopes of relieving strain on the Army and Marine Corps and revive debate over an open - ended U.S. commitment in Iraq .
Well , at least that explains why we wo n’t be sending any troops into Afghanistan , right ?
Richmond Mayor L. Douglas
Wilder predicted riots in the streets if the Clinton campaign were to overturn an Obama lead through the use of superdelegates .
Clinton targets pledged delegates
Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign intends to go after delegates whom Barack Obama has already won in the caucuses and primaries if she needs them to win the nomination .
This strategy was confirmed to me by a high - ranking Clinton official on Monday .
And I am not talking about superdelegates , those 795 party big shots who are not pledged to anybody .
I am talking about getting pledged delegates to switch sides .
Advertisement
What ?
Is n’t that impossible ?
A pledged delegate is pledged to a particular candidate and cannot switch , right ?
Wrong .
Pledged delegates are not really pledged at all , not even on the first ballot .
This has been an open secret in the party for years , but it has never really mattered because there has almost always been a clear victor by the time the convention convened .
But not this time .
This time , one candidate may enter the convention leading by just a few pledged delegates , and those delegates may find themselves being promised the sun , moon and stars to switch sides .
“ I swear it is not happening now , but as we get closer to the convention , if it is a stalemate , everybody will be going after everybody ’s delegates , ” a senior Clinton official told me Monday afternoon .
“ All the rules will be going out the window . ”
Rules of good behavior , maybe .
But , in fact , the actual rules of the party allow for such switching .
The notion that pledged delegates must vote for a certain candidate is , according to the Democratic National Committee , a “ myth . ”
“ Delegates are NOT bound to vote for the candidate they are pledged to at the convention or on the first ballot , ” a recent DNC memo states .
“ A delegate goes to the convention with a signed pledge of support for a particular presidential candidate .
At the convention , while it is assumed that the delegate will cast their vote for the candidate they are publicly pledged to , it is not required . ”
Clinton spokesman Phil Singer told me Monday he assumes the Obama campaign is going after delegates pledged to Clinton , though a senior Obama aide told me he knew of no such strategy .
But one neutral Democratic operative said to me : “ If you are Hillary Clinton , you know you ca n’t get the nomination just with superdelegates without splitting the party .
You have to go after the pledged delegates . ”
Winning with superdelegates is potentially party - splitting because it could mean throwing out the choice of the elected delegates and substituting the choice of 795 party big shots .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has warned against it .
“ I think there is a concern when the public speaks and there is a counter - decision made to that , ” she said .
“ It would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided . ”
Donna Brazile , who was Al Gore ’s campaign manager in 2000 and is a member of the DNC , said recently : “ If 795 of my colleagues decide this election , I will quit [ the DNC ] .
I feel very strongly about this . ”
On Sunday , Doug Wilder , the mayor of Richmond and a former governor of Virginia , went even further , predicting riots in the streets if the Clinton campaign were to overturn an Obama lead through the use of superdelegates .
“ There will be chaos at the convention , ” Wilder told Bob Schieffer on “ Face the Nation . ”
“ If you think 1968 was bad , you watch : In 2008 , it will be worse . ”
But would getting pledged delegates to switch sides be any less controversial ?
Perhaps not .
They were chosen by voters , but they were chosen to back a particular candidate .
And it is unlikely that many people , including the pledged delegates themselves , know that pledged delegates actually can switch .
Nor would it be easy to get them to switch .
If , however , after the April 22 Pennsylvania primary the pledged delegate count looks very close , the Clinton official said , “ [ both ] sides will start working all delegates . ”
In other words , Clinton and Obama will have to go after every delegate who is alive and breathing .

And with those words , Maria Amelia Lopez , 95 , began her journey to cybercelebrity as one of the world 's oldest living bloggers !
" At first I thought a blog was just a type of paper notebook , " said Lopez , a great grandmother .
" When I saw my grandson using the Internet , it caught my attention .
I said to myself ' What 's this ?
You can find out about anything .
I want an Internet ! ' "
With 60,000 regular readers so far , Lopez 's homely mix of memory and chat , available at http://amis95.blogspot.com/, attracts regular readers from around the world and has put her back in touch with the younger generation in a way she had never imagined .
" No one pays any attention to old women any more .

Reader B.Stevens has a cool idea for the cheapest most versatile ring light ever ( now we have shown some ringlights before , but not that easy to make ) .
The image on the left is using this ringlight ( best viewed large ) .
The idea is quite simple :
Take a huge apple monitor .
If you can get your hands on a 24 incher , you are on the right track .
Tape some patterned paper on the monitor .
Bring your 1.8 or 2.8 lens and your 1600ISO low noise camera and you are good to go .
HEYTHEREWAITAMINUTE you said cheap .
So , let me go through this method step by step and see where you can reduce your costs .
First , let ’s take a closer look on how this method works .
First you need a big light source , big enough that you can use a big piece of black paper of cardboard on .
Sebastian used a 24 ″ Mac screen , but you can use cheaper light sources one option is to use a softbox , or a diffusion screen .
So here is your first cost reduction right here .
You can look at the diagram on the left to see how this stuff works .
You have the monitor ( or GOBOed softbox ) on the left , throwing light to the right .
Next you need to cut a pattern on a black sheet or paper .
You can go with the traditional tennis balls in a circle pattern , or try something more artistic like the pattern on the left .
This is where the “ cheap ” part comes into play .
The piece of cardboard needed to make this pattern is about 1 Dollar .
In fact a pattern like this is also referred to as GOBO .
GOBO is photographer lingo for anything that goes between the light source and your subject .
( Yes , note the slight “ typo ” the GOBO does not go botween , but … I did not make it ) .
Here is your second cost reduction : make the pattern with big holes so lots of light can go through , and use a white sheet of paper on the back of the pattern .
If you are using a softbox , this will help you save light .
( And use lower ISO and slower lens ) .
The best mod I can think about with this “ ringlight ” is to use it with a shoot through umbrella .
Tape one circle in the middle of the umbrella and wham !
Instant ringlight .
One word of warning though : if you are using your monitor for light , make sure you white balance the light well .
Those monitors give weird casts .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A “ surge ” of overused words and phrases formed a “ perfect storm ” of “ post - 9/11 ” cliches in 2007 , according to a U.S. university ’s annual list of words and phrases that deserve to be banned .
Choosing from among 2,000 submissions , the public relations department at Michigan ’s Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste.
Marie targeted 19 affronts to the English language in its well - known jab at the worlds of media , sports , advertising and politics .
The contributors gave first prize to the phrase “ a perfect storm , ” saying it was numbingly applied to virtually any notable coincidence .
“ Webinar ” made the list as a tiresome non-word combining Web and seminar that a contributor said “ belongs in the same school of non-thought that brought us e-anything and i-anything . ”
Similarly , the list - makers complained about the absurd comparisons commonly phrased “ x is the new y , ” as in “ ( age ) 70 is the new 50 ” or “ chocolate is the new sex . ”
“ Fallacy is the new truth , ” commented one contributor .
Some words and phrases sagged under the weight of overuse , contributors said , citing the application of “ organic ” to everything from computer software to dog food .
In the same vein , decorators offering to add “ pop ” with a touch of color need new words , the list - makers said .
Such phrases as “ post 9/11 ” and “ surge ” have also outlived their usefulness , they said .
Surge emerged in reference to adding U.S. troops in Iraq but has come to explain the expansion of anything .
Other contributors took umbrage at the phrase to “ give back ” as applied to charitable gestures , usually by celebrities .
“ The notion has arisen that as one ’s life progresses , one accumulates a sort of deficit balance with society which must be neutralized by charitable works or financial outlays , ” one said .
“ Back in the day ” raised hackles for being applied to recent trends rather than historical events .
Other teenage linguistic indiscretions such as the often meaningless use of “ random ” and “ sweet ” raised the ire of list - makers , as did the pointless “ it is what it is . ”
Reporters were chided for skipping out on detail by describing an event or parting as “ emotional , ” and for misapplying “ decimate ” when they mean annihilate or destroy , not the word ’s true meaning of to lose a fraction .
Sports announcers were urged to drop “ throw under the bus ” when assigning blame to a player .
“ It is a call for the media to start issuing a thesaurus to everyone in front of a camera , ” a contributor said .
And finally , any self - respecting writer would groan at being labeled a “ wordsmith ” who engages in “ wordsmithing , ” the list - makers said .
Prison + Mental Institution Incarceration Rate :
Apropos Orin 's post , and the news story it refers to , I thought I 'd remind readers about Bernard Harcourt 's guest - blogging last year on how looking at the fraction of people incarcerated in prison or mental institutions offers a useful perspective .
Here 's the key graph from Harcourt 's work :
Unless , I 'm mistaken , this graph includes prisons but not jails .
The chief of the Australian Defence Force has told a parliamentary committee it is time for Australian troops to leave Iraq .
The Federal Government has ordered Australian combat troops be withdrawn from Iraq by the middle of the year .
Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston says Iraqi forces have faced a number of challenges over the past 18 months and always come out on top without any major support from Australia .
" It 's been a very pleasing outcome , " he told a Senate estimates committee this morning .
" We have achieved our objectives in southern Iraq and frankly if you look at the two provinces , it 's time to leave . "
Air Chief Marshal Houston said Australia would still be engaged with Iraq through a broader program focused on training , including bringing members of the Iraqi forces to Australia .
" We will be providing training in Australia , " he confirmed .
" We will have places on the staff college for some of the officers from the Iraqi Security Force , and we 'll also have some other specific projects that we might pursue with them . "
Australian troops have been in Iraq since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
- Editor 's note :
This story has been amended to remove an earlier reference to " the US push to overthrow dictator Saddam Hussein " in 2003 .
What a day !
First a major storm whacks the west coast , now we have the official start of solar cycle 24 .
Solar physicists have been waiting for the appearance of a reversed - polarity sunspot to signal the start of the next solar cycle .
The signal for the start of a new cycle is sighting a particular kind of sunspot .
That wait is over .
Click for larger image
A magnetically reversed , high - latitude sunspot , dubbed as number 981 , emerged on the surface of the sun today .
Just a few months ago , an “ All Quiet Alert ” had been issued for the sun .
This reversed polarity sunspot today marks the beginning of Solar Cycle 24 and the sun ’s return back to Solar Maximum .
Solar Cycle 24 has been the subject of much speculation due to competing forecasts on whether it will be an highly active or a quiet low cycle .
If it is a low cycle , it may very well be a test of validity for some CO2 based AGW theories .
Only time will tell .
UPDATE :
There have been some questions about solar cycle length , and “ when does one cycle end and another begin or is there overlap ” ?
Thanks to Joe D’Aleo of ICECAP , please see the graph below :
This from ESA may help everyone understand the transition :
With the next solar cycle this [ sunspot magnetic ] orientation is flipped in both hemispheres , as the Sun ’s global magnetic field reverses its orientation .
As a new cycle begins , the number of sunspots with the reverse orientation will increase and the ones with the orientation of the old cycle will decrease in number .
In the transition period they can both occur on the Sun , as the two cycles have no sharp boundary and overlap .
Russ Steele has some interesting information on the current state of knowledge and predicting the next solar cycle intensity at his Dalton Minimum Returns site .

The proposal asked that the shows be allowed to use their writers and committed them to the same terms Mr. Letterman ’s company had agreed to .
The request was never formally turned down , though an executive associated with the shows said , “ We were told it was n’t looking good . ”
On Monday , guild members picketed both shows , with about 15 people outside Mr. Stewart ’s studio .
Courtney Simon , a striker who formerly worked as a script editor on “ As the World Turns , ” acknowledged some awkward feelings about protesting against Mr. Stewart , whose show she said she loved .
“ He is a member of the guild , ” she said .
“ But we are on strike against the studios .
There are certain things that have to be done , and this is one of them . ”
Most of the picket signs at both locations had messages aimed at Viacom , the parent company of Comedy Central .
The denial of the request for an interim agreement left representatives of the two programs and Comedy Central disappointed and , the executive associated with the shows said , “ confounded by the fact that the decision was so arbitrary . ”
What most upset those involved in the effort was that the union gave no special consideration to the Comedy Central shows , even though the guild regarded it as a coup when it won a contract for “ The Daily Show ” in 2006 .
The series had just won an Emmy for best writing .
Like the other hosts whose shows have been picketed by the guild , including Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien on NBC and Jimmy Kimmel on ABC , Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert had been paying the salaries of nonwriting staff members out of their own pockets .

I caught up with [ Larry ] from pauldotcom.com and got a quick walk - through of his Shmooball gun .
After several less successful attempts , this one worked pretty damn well and featured a distinctive sound that caused a notable glimmer of fear in the eyes of the speakers .
* cough *[ renderman ] * cough * .
Read on for the secrets of the Shmooball gun .
The gun is pneumatic , so pressure was supplied from a 7 - 800 psi CO2 paintball gun through this quick disconnect .
[ Larry ] needed an adapter to connect to the 1/4 ″ regulator input .
He made the small chamber , with each connection , and found that it acted as a helpful expansion chamber for the gas supply .
The lower pressure storage chamber is fed about 100 psi from the regulator .
To release the pressure to the firing chamber , he used this electric water sprinkler solenoid .
These take around 12VDC and slightly slow the pressure expansion into the firing chamber
The trigger was built using a simple safety mechanism – two momentary push buttons have to be depressed to fire the sprinkler solenoid .
The get a good seal on the Shmooball , he cut down a beer cozy to act as reusable wadding .
The wadding fits quite well around the 2.75 ″ Shmooball .
The twine keeps the wadding from going the way of the Shmooball .
A velcro mounted laser pointer provides quick aim for chasing tricky speakers .
Thanks to [ Larry ] for giving us the tour !
California is staring in the face of a $ 14.5 billion budget deficit and , lucky for us , the old Arnold Schwarzenegger is back .
I 'm kidding .
It 's 2004/05 all over again .
Our " post - partisan " governor has pushed forward a devastating , mean spirited , wholly unacceptable budget .
See , he took the Grover Norquist pledge and said " I do not believe in tax increases " .
Therefore , his solution to the deficit is to cut funding across the board .
Plus he wants to tack on a few billion more dollars on the state 's credit card that he supposedly cut up years ago .
Schwarzenegger 's budget is Norquist 's wet dream .
It would have absolutely catastrophic effects on California 's educational , health care , and parks systems , among other services .
LA Times :
Yet his vision for the state is costly -- and contradictory .
Proposing that the state more than double the borrowing voters approved 14 months ago for public works , the governor compared himself to Franklin D. Roosevelt with the New Deal .
Bewildered lawmakers and activists said that reference was inconsistent with his administration 's bid to close nearly one of every five state parks .
" I do n't think it represents the governor 's values , " Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuñez ( D - Los Angeles ) said of the proposed budget , which is intended to close a $ 14.5 - billion gap over the next 18 months .
For example , let 's take health care .
The governor has been hard at work to pass a $ 14 billion universal health care plan that is fairly similar to most of the proposals promoted by the Democratic contenders .
His budget is completely contradictory to the goals of universal , affordable , quality health care .
Health Access has the best info on the impacts of the cuts :
* MEDI -CAL BENEFITS CUT :
The proposal eliminates certain optional Medi-Cal benefits , including dental for adults , chiropractic care , incontinence creams and washes , acupuncture , audiology , optometry , opticians and optical labs , podiatry , speech therapy and psychology , for the 6.6 million Californians in Medi-Cal .
Sorry poor people , no more access to therapists , dentists or ophthalmologists .
And you can forget about your incontinence creams .
Schwarzenegger is also adopting one of the most disgusting managed care practices : drown the the poor in paperwork to save money :
* MORE PAPERWORK LEADING TO LOWER ENROLLMENT ( $ 92.2 million ) :
While the proposal does not seek to directly cut eligibility , it imposes paperwork burdens on low - income families with the purpose of having over one hundred thousand Californians fall off coverage .
These ' quarterly status reports ' are cynical attempts to reduce enrollment at a time when we want and need to increase enrollment .
And what about education ?
Schwarzenegger had already promised to make this the year of education .
You can't exactly do that when you are promising about $ 5 billion in cuts to education , including mid-year cuts .
Contracts have been signed , teachers hired , programs planned .
If this budget passed , schools would have to go back and fire teachers , cancel orders for books and other materials .
The whole point of passing Prop. 98 was to insulate schools from the ups and downs of the state budget .
California already spends way below the national everage on per pupil spending .
Here is State Superintendent Jack O'Connell on the budget :
“ Just this week , Education Week ’s comprehensive report card of public school systems nationwide gave California a grade of D + when it comes to funding our schools .
It reported that California spends $ 1,892 per pupil less than the national average .
New Jersey and New York annually spend more than $ 5,000 per pupil in excess of what our state invests in our students , even taking into consideration regional cost differences .
At the same time , California ’s student population is the most challenging in the nation with more than half our students coming from families that are struggling economically and a quarter learning the English language .
As abundant research makes clear , we simply need to invest more – not less – in preparing these students to succeed . ”
California 's budget is usually a total mess , due to structural problems with the budget itself and the rules under which the legislature operates .
Unlike most states , a budget ( or a tax increase ) needs 2 /3rds support to pass the legislature .
While the Democrats hold healthy majorities in both houses , they do n't hold a 2 /3rds majority .
The budget itself is fairly inflexible due to ballot initiatives that either limit tax revenue ( Prop. 13 : property taxes , see this LAT article ) or establish minimum funding levels ( Prop. 98 : education funding ) .
The cynical Capitol analysis is that the governor is intentionally promoting this mean - spirited budget to soften up opposition to tax increases .
Daniel Weintraub blogged the CW on this up at the SacBee ( reg req ) :
-- It ’s not real .
I know , as Schwarzenegger said in his speech the other night , “ Duh ! ” He knows and we know that there is no way the Democrats in the Legislature are going to suspend Prop. 98 and then cut $ 4 billion from the schools next year .
Nor are they going to cut a similar amount from Health and Human Services .
We ’re talking here about real year - to - year reductions , not just shaving the rate of projected growth .
It would mean teacher layoffs and larger classes in the schools , and real cuts in health and social services for the poor .
Assuming cuts of that magnitude are going to happen on the Democrats ’ watch is no more realistic than it would be to assume the Republicans are going to approve an increase in income taxes .
-- So if it is not real , what is the real plan ?
He may not have one at this point .
But I would guess he is using this document to try to force lawmakers from both parties to come up with something better .
Some of the cuts – in prisons , parks , and schools – cut deeply into things the Republicans value .
Perata even talked about restructuring the education budget to punish schools in districts represented by Republicans who vote against the budget .
So there seems to be some effort afoot to engage Republicans by showing them that they can no longer vote “ no ” and still have their priorities funded .
I 've tracked Arnold enough to know not to trust him as far as I can throw him , which is obviously not that far .
His proposals are very reminiscent of his agenda from 3 years ago , which was an unmitigated disaster .
However , Weintraub is right .
This budget is DOA and Schwarzenegger knows it .
The speculation is logical , even if it is the worst kind of politics ; power brokers making deals behind closed doors and spinning in public .
There is a silver lining to this dark cloud .
This crisis is a significant opportunity to actually pass real structural reform .
Things are so bad this year that quick fixes will not work .
The budget crisis has the potential to push the Democrats , Republicans and Schwarzenegger to actually solve the problems that got us into this mess in the first place .
The chance of that happening was aided at least slightly today by the non-partisan Legislative Analyst declared today that the state needed to look into raising revenues .
It is time to examine the 2/3rds rule and fix our tax structure .
This year , there is no third rail .
And there is no need to make Norquist happy .

All wars are about the same thing .
The new way vs. the old way .
Now in New Orleans , the city where I 'm from , we very much dig the old way .
We were the last city to raise the drinking age to 21 .
We still have second line parades which ramble through the city every weekend .
4 years ago , when Ray Nagin ran for Mayor , he was the outsider .
He was going to modernize the city .
Put things online .
Run the city like a business .
Nobody knew who he was .
He was some cable executive who had made some money and was coming back to give to his city .
He energized middle class folks like my wife and I .
We loved the city but most business was done on a " who you know " basis .
The traditions which made the city such a unique place were the same things which were holding it back .
Nagin was a breath of fresh air to some of us because though he was born , raised in and obviously loved the city , he was n't tied to any political party .
He put up his own money to run .
He loved the city that much .
All the real political people ( In both parties ) hated him .
My wife and I were some of his first volunteers .
We watched him piss off the old school democrats and the new school republicans .
I did n't agree with everything he said ( The idea of running government like a business is one of the dumbest memes to ever catch on in the history of politics .
but I digress … ) but he had a vision and understood the traditions of the city .
He won the election because he was able to get middle class folks , both black and white to join in his crusade to update the city .
Nagin received a majority of both black and white voters , an uncommon occurrence in New Orleans .
Before Katrina , Nagin would have probably won in a landslide .
He was making moves .
After Katrina , the old way thought they had a chance to get back in .
Nagin 's opponent in the runoff is a nice guy .
( I 'm a big supporter of his sister )
But he was very much tied to the old way of doing things .
He just wore a new suit .
His dad was the last white mayor of the city and he had served in the legislature for a long time .
Landreiu was qualified but , in my eyes , had been around the old way of doing things for his entire life .
Electing him would have been a step backwards to the corruption and graft which has been holding the city back for years .
I think that 's one of the reasons Nagin won .
And I 'll tell give you another reason :
During Katrina Nagin got on the radio and cursed out the federal governments response to what was happening in the city .
He call for " moratorium on press conferences " .
He did n't care about politics and the long range ramifications .
He just honestly spoke the feelings of most of the residents of the city .
Instead of sounding and thinking like a politician , he sounded and spoke like a man who had watched his city destroyed and was angry with the government 's response .
And is n't that what you want a mayor to do : represent you ?
