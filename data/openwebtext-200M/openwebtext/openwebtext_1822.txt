The IP rich list - as decided by ARIN , RIPE , et al .
Posted in Security & Hacking , Networks
Tagged with : ips , assigned , per , capita , country , ip , internet , protocol , ripe , arin Under IPv4 there are 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses - each of which may be assigned to a device or computer on the internet .
4 billion addresses equates to slightly less that two thirds of an IP address per person on the planet .
As you may imagine , the IP addresses are not distributed evenly around the world - they are assigned to individual countries by Regional Internet Registries such as ARIN and RIPE .
We take a look at how that information breaks down per person in each country .
First of all , I obtained an IP address to country lookup list , which revealed the blocks assigned to each country - from this I was able to calculate the total number of IP addresses allocated to each country .
I then divided that total figure by the country 's population , giving an indication of the number of IPs available to that country per capita ( person ) .
The map below shows this data .
Those countries with more than 1 IP per person are in green , those with 1 IP for every 10 people are in yellow , 1 IP for 100 people in orange , and so on .
The top 10 and bottom 10 countries , with the population and IP statistics , are listed in tabular form below .
Shaded Map Top 10 Countries Country Population No. of IPs IPs / capita 1 . Vatican City 783 8,191 10.5 IPs per person 2 . United States 299,161,390 1,352,246,048 4.5 IPs per person
3 . Canada 32,547,200 70,313,601 2.2 IPs per person
4 . Iceland 297,139 589,790 2.0 IPs per person 5 . Monaco 35,656 63,480 1.8 IPs per person
6 . Gibraltar 27,921 47,097 1.7 IPs per person
7 . Liechtenstein 33,987 51,217 1.51 IPs per person
8 . Sweden 9,072,269 13,573,300 1.501 IPs per person 9 . Finland 5,255,580 7,705,691 1.496 IPs per person 10 .
Australia 20,555,300 29,998,170 1.459 IPs per person
As you can see , the top 10 countries are as you may expect - western , wealthy countries with high internet penetration .
Vatican City makes it to No. 1 by virtue of being tiny , and the rest consist of the US , Nothern Europe , Japan and Australia .
Smaller principalities fare well - such as the wealthy city - state of Monaco and the small German principality of Liechenstein .
Bottom 10 Countries
And so , onto the bottom 10 countries .
Note that these are expressed in a slightly different way - rather that IPs per person , these are expressed by people per IP - the reciprocal .
Country Population No. of IPs IPs / capita 195 .
Afghanistan 29,863,000 20,476 1,458 people per IP 196 .
Madagascar 18,606,000 12,286 1,514 people per IP 197 .
Guinea - Bissau 1,586,000 1,203 1,550 people per IP 198 .
Central African Republic 4,038,000 2,047 1,972 people per IP 199 .
Burundi 7,548,000 2,302 3,278 people per IP 200 .
Myanmar 50,519,000 12,286 4,112 people per IP 201 .
Malawi 12,884,000 3,070 4,197 people per IP 202 .
Ethiopia 75,067,000 16,383 4,582 people per IP 203 .
Niger 13,957,000 255 58,139 people per IP 204 .
Democratic Republic of Congo 59,319,660 1023 58,140 people per IP
As seen in the shaded map above , it 's the African countries and disputed territories that have the highest ration of people to assigned IPs .
The least IP - dense country , the Democratic Republic of Congo , has been stricken by war during the main period of growth of the internet , and has likely suffered .
There is a clear reflection of GNP in these figures too - those countries with lower GDPs have similarly lower concentrations of IPs .
This IP shortage is the reason why the move to IPv6 is underway , which supports a markedly superior 3.4x1038 possible addresses - more than enough for everyone on the planet , and no doubt we 'll need the extra address space with the lesser economically developed countries catching up in terms of internet usage .
Once done with certifications like 70 - 299 and 350-030 , web developers find themselves much comfortable with the aspects of working with the suitable internet software .
Not only that , but they also are much more efficient in developing a user - friendly interface with exemplary web template as well .
With the right kind of internet connection , the rest of the work is really taken care of .
Same holds true for professionals with credits like HP0 - 064 working on mobile software .

No . 1 -- The Safest Way to Meet an Attack with a Spiked Staff or Long Stick when you are only Armed with an Ordinary Walking Stick .
The first photograph shows the most dangerous mode of attack with a long stick , and also the best position to adopt in order to meet such an attack with safety .
It will be seen that the figure on the right is exposing his body in order to insure his adversary attacking him there , and to be prepared with an immediate defence .
Directly the man with the alpenstock attempts to bayonette him , he diverts the blow by turning sideways , and making a circular downward cut , which hits the alpenstock and causes it to glide slightly upwards and sideways -- a guard known in sword play as " Septime envelopé . "
The moment the blow has been diverted , the man with the stick must seize the alpenstock with his left hand , and , stepping in , strike his assailant a blow across the face .
No .
2 . An Effective Way to Defend Oneself with a Hooked Stick when Attacked by a Man Armed with an Ordinary Straight Stick .
A stick with a curved handle , forming a roomy crook , although hardly so effective as a stick with a heavy knob on top for striking purposes , is a most serviceable weapon in the hands of an expert in the art of stick - play .
Having guarded a blow with a hooked stick , it is a comparatively simple matter to hook an assailant in such a way that he is easily pulled off his balance .
With a little practice it becomes easy to make sure of hooking a man firmly by the neck or leg .
Suppose , for instance , that a man carrying a crooked stick is suddenly attacked by an assailant armed with an ordinary straight stick .
Here is a very pretty way to overthrow the assailant :
In the first place , the man with the hooked stick should hold his hand and stick high up , and well on one side , so as not to run any risk of being hit on the fingers .
By doing this , he purposely exposes his head to attack .
Knowing , therefore , that his opponent is sure to strike at his head , he is prepared for a quick guard .
The attacker delivers his blow and is received upon the stick ; but before he has time to recover himself , and get into a position of defence , the other suddenly ducks and hooks him by the foot , on the outer side of the ankle , bringing him to the ground by pulling his legs apart .
The assailant is then at the mercy of the man he has attacked , who can choose any part of his body on which to administer punishment .
No .
3 . -- The Best Way to Disable a Man who Tries to Rush You , and get under your Guard , in order to Prevent You Hitting him with a Hooked Stick .
The first photograph shows the best position to adopt in order to meet a sudden spring and prevent an assailant from seizing your stick .
As a feint , you make a slightly threatening motion with your left hand , as though you intended to seize the left hand of your assailant , in order to belabor him with your stick .
The object of this feint is only to engage your adversary 's attention , and make him look at your left hand whilst you suddenly dart your right arm froward , and hook him by the neck in the crook of your stick .
Directly you have hooked him , bend your knees well so as to throw the whole weight of your body upon him , whilst you pull him with his face towards the ground .
When you have pulled him down sufficiently far to prevent him recovering his balance quickly , let go your stick , and seize him by the shoulders , as shown in photo No. 4 , being careful to keep your feet well out of reach of his hands , so as not to give him the opportunity of throwing you backwards .
Then , with a sudden jerk , pull him forwards , and simultaneously jumping close into him , strike him with your knee in the face .
It is necessary to be very careful when practising this trick , as the slightest blow with the knee in a person 's face is sufficient to break a nose and several teeth .
Of course the reader will understand that in any method of self - defence it is necessary to know how to maintain the proper distance between yourself and your assailant , in order to deliver a coup - de - grâce with effect and certainty .
This knowledge , together with the confidence , dash , and savoir - faire that are so essential , can only be acquired by practice ; but , when once gained , it is never lost .
No .
4 . -- How to Use a Walking - Stick as a Weapon in a Crowd .
It will be understood that it is quite impossible to swing a stick in a crowd , owing to want of elbow room ; and so , in order to get elbow room and free scope to hit , you proceed as follows : --
Hold your stick , more or less in a line with your hips , and proceed , as in the second photograph , to lunge to your left , holding the end of the stick in your right hand , and letting it slide through your left , in order to be able to guide it with certainty .
Lunging at the body of the nearest man on your left , you disable him , and cause him to retreat precipitously .
In doing so , he involuntarily forces back those in his immediate neighborhood .
You then turn on your heels , and bayonette the nearest man on your right , this time holding the end of your stick in your left hand , and guiding it through your right .
Directly you have bayonetted him , and caused him to force back others in his attempt to escape , you make a quarter turn on your heels , and bayonette the man behind you .
After this , seeing another man close to him with his legs slightly apart , you make a dive with your stick between his legs , and upset him .
Take one step backwards , and you should now have sufficient room to swing your stick to right and left across people 's faces and heads until they disperse .
No .
5 . -- A very Simple Way to Protect Yourself with a Hooked Walking Stick against a Boxer .
When carrying a hooked stick , here is a very simple way to protect yourself against the attack of an unarmed assailant .
Hold your stick behind you , as seen in the first photograph , so as to run no risk of the stick - arm being seized .
Bend your left arm with the inside of the left hand facing outwards in order to protect yourself from a kick at the hip , or a blow from the fist at your face or ribs .
In the photographs it will be seen that the boxer has chosen the attack at his opponent 's face .
To meet such an attack safely , you must put your head well on ones side , and bend both your knees very considerably at the moment when the boxer leads off , so as to get well under his guard .
Directly you receive the blow upon your arm , you must straighten your knees , and so throw up the boxer 's arm , and make him lose his balance , which prevents him from using his right fist upon your ribs .
You have now the opportunity , and plenty of time , to hook him by the ankle with your stick , as seen in the second photograph .
Having so hooked his foot , pull his legs apart , and bring him to the ground , when you can apply the stick where and how you please .
No .
6 . -- How to Overcome the Advantage of an Assailant who Attacks You with a Stout Stick when You are Carrying only a Light Cane .
When threatened with an attack from an assailant who is armed with a superior stick to your own , it is wise to attack him before he realises that he has you at a disadvantage .
To do so to the best effect you should lead off with aright - handed blow at your assailant 's head , thereby forcing him to guard high .
At the same moment you should jump in one movement from the position shown by the figure to the left of photo No. 2 to the position shown by the same figure in photo No. 3 -- a very simple and easy movement .
In making this spring you must be careful to keep your head down and on one side .
As soon as you are in the position shown in photo No. 3 , without making any attempt to lift your adversary in order to throw him , simply strike your knee smartly against the back of his knee ; this will have the effect of knocking his leg from beneath him .
As he reels about on his left leg trying to regain his balance , put plenty of force into your left arm , and throw him upon the back of his head .
He will immediately put out both his hands to try to break his fall , and in so doing will drop his stick .
In this way you accomplish your purpose and disarm your adversary .
You can now give him his coup - de - grâce as you please .
The surest way is to deal him a blow across his ankle or just below the knee .
I must caution anyone who attempts this trick upon a friend to be very gentle when pushing with the left arm to effect the throw , otherwise it is likely that the friend upon whom the experiment is tried will be rendered unconscious or otherwise seriously injured .
The throw described is a very strong and dangerous one if properly delivered .
No .
7 . -- Another Way , when Armed with a Light Cane , to Disarm and Overpower an Opponent who carries a Superior Stick .
Suppose once again that , when carrying only a light cane , you are attacked by an assailant armed with a stronger and more serviceable stick .
In order to rob him of his advantage you immediately proceed as described in the last example by aiming a high blow at your opponent 's head , thus causing him to guard high .
Now spring in one bound under his guard to the position shown in photo No. 2 . Passing your left hand over his right forearm , placing your right hand against his wrist , and at the same time seizing your own right wrist in your left hand , you thus firmly " lock " your adversary 's arm .
All this is done without loosening the hold upon your own stick , and without seizing your opponent 's arm in any way with your hand -- yet the lock is so powerful that the strongest man would be a child in your hands when you properly apply the leverage you may obtain from this position .
To apply the leverage correctly , you should force your opponent 's elbow towards you with your left arm , and at the same time force his right hand downwards and from you , with the " lock " formed by your left hand in holding your right wrist .
The pain and strain from this grip is so excruciating that your opponent will fall upon his back , only too thankful thus to escape the danger of a broken arm .
He is then at your mercy , and you may apply your stick or your foot , as circumstances may dictate .
This , and the preceding method of self - defense with a walking - stick , may be practised upon a swordsman armed with a sword or a dagger with absolute certainty of success .
Personally , I have tried one or other of these examples time after time against good swordsmen , and have never failed to bring the trick through successfully .
Of course , your success , or otherwise , will depend to some extent upon the quickness , dash , and power with which you execute the assault .
No .
8 . -- One of the Best Ways to Meet a Direct Attack upon the Head with a very Heavy Stick when Armed with an Ordinary Stick .
The first photograph shows a man armed with a heavy stick in the act of striking at the head of a man armed with a walking - stick .
The latter is standing in the double - handed position of guard ; and it will be noticed that in holding his weapon he places his hands so that the back of his left hand is on the side nearest his face , and the back of his right hand on the side farthest from his face ; in other words , the positions of his hands are reversed .
Directly the assailant delivers his blow , the man with the walking - stick slides his stick through his right hand until has hands meet , and then twists the stick without altering his hold in any way so that his right hand passes over his left .
In this position , with his wrists crossed , he holds the stick above his head , to receive the downward cut delivered by his adversary .
Directly he has guarded the blow , and so broken the force of it , letting go the stick with the left hand , with this hand he seizes the assailant 's staff .
Retaining hold of the stick with his right hand , the man attacked may then break his opponent 's wrist with a heavy blow , as seen in Photograph No. 3 .
Another method is to let the blow fall across the assailant 's kneecap , as seen in photograph No. 4 .
Still another way to proceed is for the man attacked to continue to use his own weapon with both hands , and to deliver a heavy blow across his adversary 's face , as shown in the last photograph .
No . 9 . -- A very Serviceable Way to Disable a Taller Man than Yourself when Opposed to Him under Unequal Conditions .
Directly you have had time to catch your opponent 's eye and judge your striking distance , you must expose your head , either by slightly lowering your guard , or by holding your hand and stick well on one side , so as to invite an attack on your head .
You must rely on your own quickness to protect your head when the blow falls .
Directly your opponent sees the opening , he will lead off at your head .
You protect yourself by receiving the blow upon your stick , as seen in the first photograph .
Then , without losing any time , drop into the next position , and bayonette your assailant over the heart .
No. 10 . -- Example of a very Pretty Guard and Counter - blow when an Assailant Directs a Blow at your Head with a Stick .
When an assailant attempts to strike you on the head with his stick , you may receive the blow upon your stick by bringing your hand right across your face , and holding it well on the left side of your head with the back of your hand outwards , facing your opponent .
Your stick should point slightly downwards to prevent your opponent 's stick sliding down yours , and striking you on the fingers .
The moment you have done this you step slightly towards your opponent 's right side with your right foot , and describe a circular right to left back - handed cut across his face , which should be sufficient to prevent him troubling you any further .
No . 11 . -- An Example of the Double - Handed Guard in Combination with Ambi-Dexterity .
In this example the man on the left in the photograph is seen taking up the double handed guard , but his assailant refuses to accept the invitation at his body , although it is exposed -- instead of this he aims a blow at the left wrist , or the left side of the head .
On this the man with the double - handed guard , in order to avoid being hit upon the fingers , lets go of the left - hand end of his stick , and swings his left hand behind him -- a movement which automatically imparts the initial movement for a right - handed blow .
This he delivers across his opponent 's wrist , which he would thus break , just as the assailant is in the act of striking .
No . 12 . -- Another Example of the Double - Handed Guard in Combination with Ambi-Dexterity .
In this example , the defender , as in No. 11 , invites an attack at his body by guarding his head in an exaggerated way , and so exposing his body .
His opponent immediately attempts to take advantage of the opening by striking at the exposed body , when the other simply draws his left foot towards his right , and so retires out of striking distance of his adversary .
Then , by releasing his hold on the stick down heavily with his left upon his assailant 's head , as seen in the lowest photograph .
Concluding Note .
With reference to the short description of walking - stick play , and the tricks described in this and the preceding number of Pearson's , I may state that the art of self - defence with a walking - stick is particularly adapted to conditions where a man is attacked by more than one person .
It can be readily acquired , either by men or women , and when once mastered would enable you to defend yourself , with absolute safety , against a knife , boxing , savate , etc .
The more dangerous methods have not been shown .
Besides being a most useful and practical accomplishment , this new art of self - defence with a walking - stick is to be recommended as a most exhilarating and graceful exercise .

Israeli planes stage mock raids over Hezbollah stronghold of south Beirut
BEIRUT ( AP )  Israeli fighter jets staged mock raids over Hezbollah strongholds in south Beirut on Tuesday in the heaviest show of air power over Lebanon since an August cease - fire ended the war between Israel and the guerillas .
The warplanes dived low over the southern suburbs at least six times before roaring back into the sky .
Lebanese security officials said eight Israeli jets had crossed the border and dispersed over southern and central Lebanon .
Concerned residents took to rooftops and balconies to watch the mock raids over south Beirut .
In south Lebanon , officials and witnesses reported Israeli planes flying low over the towns of Nabatiyeh and Tyre .
The Israeli military refused to confirm that its planes had flown over Beirut or other areas , saying it does not release details of military operations .
Tuesday 's show was the heaviest aerial incursion of Lebanon since the end of Israel 's 34 - day offensive against the Hezbollah militant group .
Lebanon , with United Nations support , has frequently protested Israeli flights over its territory .
The war , which ended in a U.N. - brokered cease - fire on Aug. 14 , killed more than 1,000 people — mostly Lebanese civilians .
The mock raids came only hours after U.N. envoy Terje Roed - Larsen told the Security Council that the Lebanese government had reported that arms were being smuggled into Lebanon from Syria .
The operation also came a few hours before Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah was scheduled to appear on a Lebanese television channel .
Nasrallah has been in hiding since the Israeli offensive began in July , appearing in public only once , on Sept. 22 , to give a speech at a Hezbollah " victory rally . "
Israeli officials have threatened to assassinate him .
South Beirut was heavily bombed during the Israeli offensive , with entire city blocks being reduced to rubble as Israeli aircraft tried to hit Hezbollah officials and destroy their offices .
Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that French troops in the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon had warned Israel that their jets may not remain immune if they continue to violate Lebanese airspace .
Israeli warplanes have flown over Lebanon for decades , gathering intelligence and making their presence known with sonic booms over Beirut .
Flights at Beirut 's international airport , which lies south of the city , were not affected Tuesday .

＠ IT の「 キミのコードが汚い理由 」 という記事を読んだ（ yasuhoの隠れ家 さん経由）。この記事には、テニスのスコアをつけるための２つの
Java コード紹介がされている。 「 幼稚なスタイル」で書かれたとされる「リスト１」と、それを「クリーン」に書き直したとされる「リスト２」である。記事の中では、これらは単なる「前フリ」程度の扱いなのだが、「
読者指向プログラミング 」ということを考える上で、おもしろい題材なので、少し細かく見てみようと思う。元記事の趣旨に対しては「重箱の隅」的な指摘になるかと思うが、それは承知の上で、別のテーマとして読んでいただきたい。まず、元のソースコードは画像で公開されているので、テキストにしたものを以下に示しておこう。yasuhoの隠れ家さんも指摘されているように、リスト１の方が分かりやすいと感じる人も多いのではないだろうか。確かに、リスト２は数式的には「整理」はされているのだが、読みやすくはないように思える。いくつか、その原因を考えてみた。空行挿入、改行位置、インデントなど、レイアウトについての配慮が甘く、全体的に、目で追いにくい書き方になっている。もっとも、これは
Web 掲載上の都合かもしれない。リスト２では、リスト１より変数が多くなっている。ここでは「優勢なプレイヤー」と「劣勢なプレイヤー」の勝ち数を明確にする意図があり、それ自体は悪いことではない。しかし、せっかく配列の内容を leaderGames、opponentGames という変数に入れ直しているのに、その後も元の配列を参照し続けているので、逆効果になっている部分がある。例えば、「gameWon[0 ] < 6 && gameWon [ 1 ] < 6」は単に「 leaderGames < 6 」でいいし、「 gamesWon [ 0 ] == gamesWon [ 1 ] 」も「 leaderGames == opponentGames」でいい。また、２人のプレイヤーを数値で区別しているのだが、「0 と 1 で区別する場合 」 と「 1 と 2 で区別する場合」が混在していて分かりにくい。そもそも、プレイヤーが２人しかいないのに、配列にする必要があるだろうか？
このあたりは、リスト１の書き方に引きずられている印象だ（比較しやすいように意図的にそうしているのかもしれないが）。更に細かいことを言えば、" set " で始まる変数名があるが、これは一見、関数（setter）のように見えるので、避けたほうがいいだろう。「幼稚なスタイル」のコードは、幼稚であるが故に読者にとって「直感的」であることも多い。逆に、コードを「整理」すると、その代償として、素直な表現が失われてしまうことがあるのだ。例えば、リスト１の if 文は処理としては冗長なのだが、条件が馬鹿正直に書かれているので、逆に分かりやすい。また、return
しているメッセージの文字列も、リスト１ではやはり馬鹿正直に書かれているため、「文」として意味を取りやすい。コード内の文字列は、往々にして、そこで何が行われているのかを伝えてくれる。いわば「コメント的な効果」を持っているのだ。リスト２のメッセージは変数で分断されている箇所が多く、この効果が薄れている。もちろん、私もリスト１のような「幼稚な」書き方が良いなどと言うつもりはない。効率や汎用性、あるいは「他の角度から見た読みやすさ」のために、こうした直感的な表現が犠牲になることは、宿命だろう。しかし、そうした表現の効果について、知っておくということは必要である。「読者指向プログラミング」のテクニックのひとつになりうるからだ（※）これは読者側の問題になるのだが、英語が苦手な読者にとって、変数名が直感的に理解できないという問題もある。個人的には、" leader " や " opponent " といった単語 が 「 優勢なプレイヤー」とその「対戦相手」であると理解するために、変数に代入している式を解読する必要があった。つまり、変数名が「a」や「b」でも同じだったわけだ。多くのプログラミング言語で、ソースコードはアルファベットと数字と記号で書くことになっている。このため、日本人向けのコードには、より多くのコメントが必要になる（漢字という「表意文字」の効果は絶大である）。しかし、リスト２の作者は日本の読者を想定していなかっただろう。こうした点を考慮しながら、リスト２を修正してみよう。といっても、全ての問題を同時に解決することはできない。全体のバランスを考えた「落とし所」を見極めることが必要だ。読みやすさという点において、いくらか良くなっていると思うが、どうだろうか。もちろん、コードの書き方に「正解」はない。私が自分でゼロから書いたとしたら、また違ったコードになるだろう。「読者指向プログラミング」について考えるには、適度な題材である。プログラマの方は、自分ならどう書くか、実際にやってみてはいかがだろうか。

A public school has become the first in the country to introduce Mandarin as a compulsory subject for three - year - olds , it emerged yesterday .
Brighton College already requires older children to learn the language in recognition of China 's importance as the world 's fastest - growing economy .
Now youngsters joining nursery at the school in September will be taught Mandarin , the country 's official language .
Education Secretary Alan Johnson announced this month that secondary schools will be allowed to drop French and German in favour of " world languages " such as Mandarin and Urdu .
However fee- paying Brighton College believes children need to start learning Mandarin from a much younger age .
The school is believed to be the first in the country to make the language compulsory for three - year - olds , a year after it announced that pupils in the senior school would be required to study it at least until 14 .
Headmaster Richard Cairns said he wanted pupils to have a strong command of Mandarin - spoken by 867 million people - by the time they leave school .
Trial lessons have already begun with the very youngest children in the school and it is hoped that in time all 200 pupils in the pre-prep years , 300 in the prep school and 700 in the college will be taught the language .
All three - year - olds joining the school in the autumn will be given three short lessons in the language a week .
Mr Cairns said : " We want to ensure that every child leaves Brighton College prepared for the realities of the 21st century , one of which is that China is certain to be the second largest economic power in the world by the time these three - year - olds leave the College in 2022 .
" I believe that it is essential that as many children as possible are well placed to take advantage of the opportunities that this presents .
" A knowledge of the language , culture and politics of China will also encourage children to be less anglocentric and more willing to engage with very different societies from our own
" It makes sense to begin this process with our very youngest pupils . "
The school is taking advantage of a British Council programme to bring specialist Mandarin teachers over from China .
Sue Wicks , headmistress of Brighton 's pre-prep school , said children found it easier to get to grips with Mandarin if they started learning it from a young age .
She said : " Young children have a thirst for knowledge and an openness of mind and ear that make them natural linguists .
They are not embarrassed by the occasional mispronunciation in a way that a teenaged pupil might be . "
Brighton College pupils will be able to go on to take GCSEs in Mandarin .
The initiative comes at a time of growing concern over the decline of languages in state schools and some independent schools .
Fewer teenagers are opting to study languages at all since ministers ' 2004 decision to make them non-compulsory for over - 14s .
Summary : Making users suffer a drop - down menu to enter state abbreviations is one of many small annoyances that add up to a less efficient , less pleasant user experience .
It 's worth fixing as many of these usability irritants as you can .
So far this year , we 've watched users shop on about 50 e-commerce sites .
All but one of the sites violated a documented guideline for checkout design : they required users to manipulate a drop - down menu to enter their state abbreviations , rather than simply let them type in the two characters .
The exception was Amazon.com , which offered the faster and more pleasant typing option .
Amazon thus confirmed that even though the average e-commerce site should not copy its overall design it continues to be the leader in complying with usability guidelines for individual design elements .
Knowing a better design exists made it painful to sit , day after day , and watch users fight with the mouse to scroll through the huge menu .
Sometimes users selected the wrong menu option and then had to waste even more time with the drop - down .
And , in this study , we mainly tested young , able - bodied users ; the situation is even worse for elderly users , who have more difficulty with extensive , fine - tuned mouse manipulations .
And it 's worse yet for users with disabilities .
We observed the same problem again earlier this month when watching Chinese users shop on international sites : users suffered a lot of needless interaction overhead when trying to select " Hong Kong " from immense drop - downs containing hundreds of countries and territories .
Sites offer drop - downs for state abbreviations under the theory that doing so prevents input errors .
But that 's not true : menus are more error prone than typing because the mouse scroll wheel often makes users inadvertently change the state field 's content after they 've moved their gaze elsewhere on the screen .
In contrast , everybody knows how to type their own state 's two letters , and it 's always faster to enter this information through the keyboard than the mouse .
( Regarding input errors : whatever the input method , sites should validate that the ZIP code / postal code corresponds to the state , province , or other locality entered by the user .
Because postal codes are more error prone , you must use validation code on the backend , regardless of whether or not you use a drop - down for the state . )
One Annoyance ?
Irritating , But Bearable
Now to the headline question :
Does it matter that most e-commerce sites annoy their customers during the checkout process ?
The drop - down menu is unpleasant , and we sometimes hear users sigh when they encounter it .
That said , they know how to beat it into submission , because other sites have similarly annoyed them before .
Therefore , it 's unlikely that many sales are lost due to this user experience degradation .
The drop - down does cost sites money : given the scroll wheel 's revenge , it 's inevitable that companies will ship packages to the wrong state or — more commonly — that they 'll have to call users to resolve state / ZIP discrepancies .
So , why go on about a design mistake if it does n't cost a company sales ?
It 's certainly an error we 'd classify as a low - priority issue in a client report .
But it 's still a usability problem , because — as nearly every test session confirmed again this year — state drop - downs annoy customers .
Many Annoyances ?
Disruptive
Annoyances matter , because they compound .
If the offending state - field drop - down were a site 's only usability violation , I 'd happily award the site a gold star for great design .
But sites invariably have a multitude of other annoyances , each of which delays users , causes small errors , or results in other unpleasant experiences .
A site that has many user - experience annoyances :
appears sloppy and unprofessional ,
and unprofessional , demands more user time to complete tasks than competing sites that are less annoying , and
to complete tasks than competing sites that are less annoying , and feels somewhat jarring and unpleasant to use , because each annoyance disrupts the user 's flow .
Even if no single annoyance stops users in their tracks or makes them leave the site , the combined negative impact of the annoyances will make users feel less satisfied .
Next time they have business to conduct , users are more likely to go to other sites that make them feel better .
In many ways , repeated annoyances are like slow response times : one slow page , and you 'll stick with a site ; many slow pages , and it 's toast .
Fixing annoyances wo n't double your business metrics the way fixing usability catastrophes will .
But , eliminating annoyances increases customer satisfaction and user loyalty , and thus improves the long - term business value of the site .
Pelosi called Cheney 's words " beneath the dignity of the debate we 're engaged in and a disservice to our men and women in uniform , whom we all support . "
But Cheney is holding firm on his original comments .
" I am not sure what part of it that Nancy disagreed with , " Cheney told ABC News during an interview today in Sydney , Australia .
" She accused me of questioning her patriotism .
I did n't question her patriotism , I questioned her judgment . "
Cheney said : " The point I made , and I 'll make it again , is that al Qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will .
That 's their fundamental underlying strategy , that if they can kill enough Americans or cause enough havoc , create enough chaos in Iraq , then we 'll quit and go home . "
It was the United States that was breaking the will of al Qaida .
Vice President Dick
Cheney is discovering the hard way that you can't run away from your problems by taking trips overseas that probably should be handled , in any case , by the State Department .
Or , at the very minimum , by someone with credibility ( 63 % of Americans no longer trust Bush — or Cheney , for that matter — on intelligence issues ) .
The jury for the Scooter Libby trial is still deliberating and could conceivably refuse to convict Scooter Libby of perjury and obstruction of justice despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
Money can buy favorable legal results in this country .
We 've seen that many times now in the last fifteen years .
There 's speculation that Scooter Libby might have won his case during jury selection , with the help of an expensive gimmick used by some lawyers who employ jury experts who know how to get a jury that has good odds of reaching a not guilty verdict , or , at the very least , a hung decision .
That 's not justice at work .
It 's good old fashioned money at work .
We do n't know yet if the gimmick will work or not , but the longer the jury deliberates , the better it is for the defense .
The problem for Dick Cheney is that nobody is fooled : he 's a liar , a political manipulator and an incompetent .
Dick Cheney used Scooter Libby to out covert CIA operative Valerie Plame and we know it .
Washington is not a comfortable place for Dick Cheney these days .
Too many of his fiascos are coming out .
But his belligerence and arrogance continues as we hear in this story from ABC News If Dick Cheney knows so much about al Qaida , then where was the Bush Administration in the months before 9/11 ?
Where was Dick Cheney when the outgoing Clinton Administration warned officials of the incoming Bush Administration ?
Where was Dick Cheney when it was obvious there was no significant al Qaida connection when we invaded Iraq in 2003 ?
Cheney 's blunders and deceptions are endless but let 's look again at a critical assertion he made in the quote above and that he has made before and think about it carefully .
In the above statement , Cheney says : " ... al Qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will . "
Stop the presses .
Think a moment .
In late 2001 , we had al Qaida on the ropes .
It was the United States that was breaking the will of al Qaida .
Let 's not slip over that point .
I 'll repeat it again : in late 2001 , we had al Qaida on the ropes .
And then Bush , Cheney and Rumsfeld got bored with Afghanistan .
It was n't a big enough war for them .
They were obsessed with Iraq and were flummoxed when they could n't make a credible case for war .
So they made something up , inserted those sixteen words , and fixed the evidence around a reckless policy and left the war in Afghanistan behind on the back burner .
Five years of blunders , incompetence and arrogance on the part of Cheney , Bush and Rumsfeld put us at risk of pulling defeat from the jaws of victory .
And Cheney wants to compound the error by starting a war with Iran , or tricking Iran into starting that war , or whatever nonsense he has in mind that he has n't bothered to tell us .
What the Bush Administration should be doing is working on a regional settlement that can only come if we talk with all the neighbors , including Syria and Iran .
Democrats have repeatedly called for finishing the job in Afghanistan .
Several Republicans Bush and Cheney have chosen to ignore have also called for properly finishing the job in Afghanistan .
Various foreign policy experts have warned that putting al Qaida on the back burner was a serious strategic mistake .
Well , this is where we are : Dick Cheney has no credibililty .
George W. Bush has no credibility .
You will not gain the needed credibility by attacking your critics who have done little more than point out world class strategic blunders that can not go on unaddressed .
Whatever imperial games , or neoconservative games , or oil games that the Bush inner circle has been engaging in for the past few years no longer have any credible chance of reaching a reasonable result that will do most Americans any good .
From now on , rebuilding our foreign policy , reestablishing our credibility , repairing our military , winding down in Iraq while we do what we can to stabilize the region with talks and political settlements , and finishing the job in Afghanistan are the only goals the Bush Administration should be pursuing .
And it is the obligation of Congress , a co-equal branch of government , to keep the Bush inner circle from dragging us into any further adventures .
Bush 's presidency is over .
And Dick Cheney should do the decent thing and resign .

The leaking by the Israeli military that Israel was developing plans for an attack on Iran using small - grade , limited tactical nuclear weapons .
Though the leak was done in such a way as to create plausible deniability as to its significance -- the leak was to a discredited newspaper and leaks that a country has " planned " for a certain type of attack are commonplace and do not mean they are actually going to attack -- the leak was nonetheless deliberate and caused the phrases " Israeli nuclear attack " and " Iran " to be placed into the public dialogue , at exactly the time that tensions have been deliberately heightened between the U.S. / Israel and Iran -- the purpose of which is almost certainly not a planned nuclear attack by Israel on Iran , but a ratchering up of the war rhetoric ;
Increasingly explicit advocacy by neoconservatives in the U.S. for a war with Iran , as reflected by the recent Washington Post Op - Ed by Joe Lieberman in which he really did declare that the U.S. is already at war with Iran ( " While we are naturally focused on Iraq , a larger war is emerging .

UPDATE :
US forces have stormed an Iranian consulate in the northern Iraqi town of Irbil and seized six members of staff .
The troops raided the building at about 0300 ( 0001GMT ) , taking away computers and papers , according to Kurdish media and senior local officials .
The US military would only confirm the detention of six people around Irbil .
The raid comes amid high Iran - US tension .
The US accuses Iran of helping to fuel violence in Iraq and seeking nuclear arms .
Iran denies both charges .
Tehran counters that US military involvement in the Middle East endangers the whole region .
. . .
One Iranian news agency with a correspondent in Irbil says five US helicopters were used to land troops on the roof of the Iranian consulate .
It reports that a number of vehicles cordoned off the streets around the building , while US soldiers warned the occupants in three different languages that they should surrender or be killed .
UPDATE II
Iraq continues to receive the overwhelming bulk of attention in the media and among political analysts .
But the fate of Iraq , tragically , is all but sealed -- the President will send more troops and order them to be increasingly brutal and indiscriminate , and they will stay through at least the end of his presidency .
That is just a fact .
The far more attention - demanding issue now is what the President 's intentions are with regard to Iran .
As Think Progress notes , the White House took multiple steps yesterday to elevatethe threat rhetoric against Iran .
Bush included what described as “ some of his sharpest words of warning to Iran ” yet .
But those words could really be described more accurately not as “ threats ” but as a declaration of war .
He accused the Iranian government of “ providing material support for attacks on American troops ” and vowed to “ seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies . ”
But those networks are located , which means that search and destroy missions on such networks would necessarily include some incursion into Iranian territory , whether by air or ground .
Hours before the speech , the White House released a Powerpoint presentation with details about the president ’s new policy .
“ Increase operations against Iranian actors ” was listed in the “ Key Tactical Shifts ” section .
Asreported : “ One senior administration official said this evening that the omission of the usual wording about seeking a diplomatic solution [ to the Iranian nuclear stand - off ] ‘ was not accidental .
’” But these were merely the latest in a series of plainly significant events over the last several weeks that , taken alone , are each noteworthy themselves , but when viewed as a whole unmistakably signal a deliberate escalation of tensions with Iran by both the U.S. and Israel : I think there is a tendency to dismiss the possibility of some type of war with Iran because it is so transparently destructive and detached from reality that it seems unfathomable .
But if there is one lesson that everyone should have learned over the last six years , it is that there is no action too extreme or detached from reality to be placed off limits to this administration .
The President is a True Believer and the moral imperative of his crusade trumps the constraints of reality .
The AEI // Fox Newsneonconservative warmongers are mocked because of how extremist and deranged their endless war desires are , but the President is , more or less , .
He thinks the way they think .
The war in Iraq has collapsed and the last election made unmistakably clear that Americans have turned against the war , and the President 's response , like , was to .
How much more proof do we need of how extremist and unconstrained by public opinion and basic reality he is ?
For anyone with ongoing doubts , here is how the President thinks , as expressed in an October , 2006 interview with his with his ideological soulmate , Fox 's Sean Hannity : Bush means all of that .
That 's really what he believes .
And he is n't constrained by the things that constrain rational people because his mission , in his mind , transcends all of those mundane limitations .
Is there anyone who still doubts that ?
More importantly , a war with Iran can happen in many waysby some grand announcement by the President that he wants to start a war , followed by a debate in Congress as to whether such a war should be authorized .
That is theway for such a confrontation to occur .
We have 140,000 troops ( soon to be 20,000 more ) sitting in a country that borders Iran and where , with an announced military build - up in the Persian Gulf imminent , increased war rhetoric from all sides , the beginning of actual skirmishes already , a reduction ( if not elimination ) on the existing constraints with which our military operates in Iraq , and a declaration by the President that Iran is our enemy in thewar .
That makes unplanned -- or seemingly unplanned -- confrontations highly likely , whether through miscalculation , miscommunication , misperception , or affirmative deceit .
Whatever else is true , given the stakes involved -- the unimaginable , impossible - to - overstate stakes -- and the fact that we are unquestionably moving forward on this confrontational path quite deliberately , this issue is receiving nowhere near the attention in our political discussions and media reports that it so urgently demands .
For all the pious talk about the need to be " seriously concerned " and give " thoughtful consideration " to what will happen if weIraq , there is a very compelling -- and neglected -- need to ponder what will happen if we stay and if we escalate .
And the need for " serious concern " and " thoughtful consideration " extends to consequences not just in Iraq but beyond .
For those who think that the threat of military confrontation with Iran is n't a serious one , here is a BBC report from this morning :
This is the most serious action yet .
Is n't it a definitive act of war for one country to storm the consulate of another , threaten to kill them if they do not surrender , and then detain six consulate officers ? : Balloon - Juice 's

Nuh-uh .
Do n't think so .
Seems like you should be able to copy that show — or any other — from your media center PC or TiVo right to your iPod .
Advertisement
You can , and it 's easier than you might think .
( Easier , even , than copying DVDs . )
In fact , TiVo users have it embarrassingly simple :
The free TiVoToGo software for Windows and Mac will automatically fetch recorded shows and encode them for iPod .
No fuss , no muss .
Advertisement
Owners of Windows Media Center PCs ( by which I mean those running Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 or Windows Vista Premium / Ultimate ) have to jump through an extra hoop or two , but it 's still a fairly easy operation .
Well worth it , too , as TV just seems like a better fit for the iPod 's diminutive screen than movies .
Let 's get copying .
Boob tube to go
The hitch in copying Media Center recordings to an iPod is the file format : DVR - MS .
Although it 's really just Microsoft 's proprietary version of MPEG - 2 , many video - conversion programs choke on it .
Fortunately , a few good ones can handle it .
Advertisement
If you 're willing to throw a few bucks at this endeavor , I can think of no better solution than Roxio's MyTV ToGo .
It works inside the Media Center interface ( meaning you can operate it from the couch ) and lets you select shows to convert with just a few presses of the remote .
Even better , its ReadySync feature will automatically transcode selected shows right after they 're recorded , so they 're all queued up and ready for copying to your iPod .
Advertisement
MyTV ToGo also supports Pocket PCs , Sony PSPs and select smartphones , and it can even transcode TiVoToGo files .
The program costs $ 29.99 , not a bad price for this level of ease and automation .
Of course , here at Lifehacker we 're all about the free , so allow me to steer you to a pair of products that cost $ 29.99 less than MyTV ToGo : DVRMSToolbox and iPodifier .
The former does the heavy lifting , while the latter provides a fashionable , easy - to - use front end .
( Better still , it supports not only Windows Media Center , but also Beyond TV , SageTV and TiVo .
If you decide to use it with any of those three DVRs , you wo n't need DVRMSToolbox . )
Advertisement
For the record , my first inclination was to use Videora iPod Converter , which played a prominent role in my DVD - conversion feature , but that program has trouble keeping DVR - MS audio in sync with the video .
Same goes for 3GP_Converter and Any Video Converter .
( Like I said , lots of programs have trouble with the DVR - MS format . )
Even the much - revered SUPER choked on DVR - MS files .
Advertisement
Freebies save the day
Nearly ready to pitch this feature altogether , I stumbled upon DVRMSToolbox and iPodifier , which together managed to get the job done .
It 's not a perfect solution ( iPodifier does n't let you pick and choose individual shows to convert , only a specified number of episodes of each recorded show ) , but it works .
Advertisement
I should note that this procedure requires a Windows Media Center Edition 2005 system .
A Vista -compatible version of DVRMSToolbox is currently in development , but it's not freely available ( unless you send the author a donation ) .
Here 's how to turn those pesky DVR - MS files into iPod-ready MPEG - 4 files :
Install DVRMSToolbox .
You may want to include the optional components , like ShowAnalyzer and Commercial Skip ( which can automatically remove commercials from your recorded shows — neat ! ) , but they 're not necessary for our purposes .
Install iPodifier .
The first time you run it , a setup wizard will walk you through basic configuration options , like selecting an output folder for transcoded videos .
From there you 'll run through the video - source wizard .
iPodifier lets you configure any number of sources , but for now we 'll simply create one called " TV Shows . "
Advertisement
Next , select the type of video for this source ( TV shows , natch ) and the DVR software you 're using ( Windows Media Center Edition ) .
Now you need to tell iPodifier where to find recorded TV shows .
On most systems this is c:\documents and settings \all users \documents \recorded tv , though it may reside in your Shared Documents folder .
If you 're not sure , run a search for DVR - MS files on your PC and see where the bulk of them reside .
Complete the wizard 's remaining few steps , all of which are self - explanatory .
( One option is to let iPodifier queue converted videos in iTunes and copy them straight to your iPod , making for an extremely automated solution ) .
Advertisement
When the wizard is done , click the " iPod video management " bar and check the box marked " Enable iPod video management . "
You 'll see a list of all the recorded shows iPodifier detected in the folder you chose during setup .
By default , the program wo n't transcode anything .
Double - click any show , then enable the " keep all " checkbox or choose a maximum number of shows for iPodifier to convert ( " keep at most " ) .
I recommend the " keep all " option , but configuring iPodifier not to automatically copy shows to your iPod .
That way everything gets transcoded , but you still get to pick and choose what gets copied .
Advertisement
Repeat this step for all your shows .
Click the " Transcoding queue " bar .
You should see a list of queued shows in the center pane .
( Click the thumbnail for a full - size look at the window . )
Now click the " Enable transcoding " button and go brew a cup of tea .
iPodifier will tap DVRMSToolbox for preprocessing , then transcode the shows to the chosen iPod format .
In my experience , it takes about 15 minutes to transcode a 30 - minute recording , 30 minutes for a one - hour show and so on .
Fire up iTunes .
Click File >
Add Folder to Library and navigate to the newly created folder .
You should see all your transcoded videos .
Sync your iPod and you 're ready for some on - the - go TV goodness !

The Secular Right
We all know the basic alternatives that form the familiar " spectrum " of American politics and culture .
If a young person is turned off by religion or attracted by the achievements of science , and he wants to embrace a secular outlook , he is told -- by both sides of the debate -- that his place is with the collectivists and social subjectivists of the left .
On the other hand , if he admires the free market and wants America to have a bold , independent national defense , then he is told - - again , by both sides -- that his natural home is with the religious right .
But what if all of this is terribly wrong ?
What if it 's possible to hold some of the key convictions associated with the right , being pro-free - market and supporting the war , and even to do so more strongly and consistently than most on the right -- but still to be secular ?
What if it 's possible to reject the socialism subjectivism of the left and believe in the importance of morality , but without believing in God ?
That question has been raised , most recently , in a courageous article by Heather Mac Donald .
In a symposium on the nature of the right , she argued on behalf of " skeptical conservatives " who " ground their ideas in rational thinking and ( nonreligious ) moral argument . "
For the past two weeks , this has touched off a debate on National Review Online ( catalogued here ) , at the religious conservative magazine First Things , and elsewhere .
This is not the first time the right has had to search its soul on this issue -- and it 's high time they did so again , because now , more than ever , we need to discover what it would mean to have a secular right .
Mac Donald makes some terrific points in criticizing religion as a foundation for the right , but she is wrong to describe the secular right as " skeptical conservatives . "
A truly secular right should not be based on " skepticism , " not in any fundamental sense .
Philosophically speaking , skepticism does not mean merely doubting the truth of one particular claim or idea .
It means doubting all truths and all ideas , so that every fact or theory is just someone 's opinion .
It means doubting the power of reason as such .
Skepticism is the natural ally of subjectivism -- and it is , in actual fact , the guiding philosophy of the left .
One of the great myths spread by religious conservatives is the idea that the political left is founded on an overweening confidence in the power of reason .
But any notions about a hyper-rational left can be refuted by ten minutes ' conversation with an actual leftist .
It can also be refuted by an examination of the ideas of the left .
Sure , the left used to cloak their views in the economic jargon of " scientific socialism . "
But beneath its pseudo - scientific veneer , the old Marxist left was contemptuous of the individual mind , regarding men's ideas and values and mere by - products of collective , materialist forces .
They viewed man , not as a rational animal , but as a mindless brute -- think of the muscle - bound , thick - browed workers portrayed in Soviet propaganda posters -- and they embraced , or at best apologized for , the methods of the brute .
Comrade Stalin did n't rule by reason ; he ruled by force and terror .
It is no wonder that the charade of " scientific socialism " collapsed forty years ago with the emergence of the New Left " counterculture , " whose symbol is the drugged - out , addle - brained hippie .
And as for the high - brow academic left , today 's philosophical trends on the left are Postmodernism and Multiculturalism -- extreme forms of skepticism and subjectivism which deny that there is any rationally provable truth and tell us that all cultures are equally valid .
Some on today 's left even follow Multiculturalism to its logical conclusion , finding sympathy for Muslims who feel " oppressed " by our lack of " respect " for their religious strictures -- a kind of unholy alliance between secular subjectivism and religious dogmatism .
There is more affinity between these two ends of the political and cultural spectrum that the adherents of either would care to admit .
Heather Mac Donald notes that " The presumption of religious belief - - not to mention the contradictory thinking that so often accompanies it -- does damage to conservatism by resting its claims on revealed truth .
But on such truth there can be no agreement without faith . "
In a long and rambling reply to Mac Donald , Catholic conservative Michael Novak keeps promising an answer to the question , " how can you actually prove that Christianity is true ? " -- and he can produce nothing better than , " it answers something deep in the human spirit . "
Which means : " because it makes me feel good . "
So what exactly is the difference , in practice , between faith and feelings , between religion and subjectivism ?
This gives the lie to the central promise of the religious conservatives : that they will provide a solid foundation for morality .
Subjectivism , they point out , unleashes men to commit any atrocity , while religion offers men the safety of unquestionable moral rules .
But what protection is really offered by moral rules backed by faith -- rules on which men cannot ever agree ?
History offers the answer , recent history most particularly .
The headline of a brilliantly conceived satire from The Onion captures it nicely : " War - Torn Middle East Seeks Solace in Religion . "
The Middle East , and especially the Muslim world , is famous for the intensity of its religious belief -- and also infamous for the intensity of its bloodshed and suffering .
Religious conservatives warn that a morality based on reason and observation is not sufficient , because men will not all agree on what reason and the evidence proves .
But when have men ever agreed on religion ?
And without reason and evidence to settle the argument , they usually resort to force .
The real alternative to secular subjectivism is not religious faith , but observation of the natural world -- the world that can be seen and understood through reason .
Despite a confused dismissal of " natural law , " Heather Mac Donald is correct when she suggests that " reason and a commitment to evidence provide ample grounds for leading a moral , responsible life . "
But she seems to have something of pragmatist view of morality , arguing , for example , that marriage should be encouraged because sociological studies say that children are better off with two parents .
But to derive a secular morality , we need more than narrow conclusions drawn from sociological studies .
We need broad philosophical principles drawn from the grand lessons of history .
For example , we can observe , in the rise of West since the Renaissance and in the corresponding decline of the Islamic world , what happens when men embrace reason , unfettered scientific inquiry , and technological progress -- versus what happens when they cling to religious dogmatism and disparage secular learning .
Or , alternatively , we can observe in the history of the Cold War what happens when one bloc of societies recognizes the individual rights of their citizens , allowing them to act on their own initiative in the pursuit of profit-- versus what happens when another bloc imposes a totalitarian dictatorship , expunging private property and private profits and forcibly imposing central economic planning .
The lessons of history reveal the basic requirements set by man 's nature for his survival , success , and happiness here on earth .
That is the secular foundation for morality .
Today 's academic philosophers -- steeped in the subjectivist dogmas of the left -- have not been up to the job of grasping and explaining these lessons .
But astute readers may recognize which philosopher I think was up to the job .
My own defense of the secular right is based on the ideas of Ayn Rand , the novelist , philosopher , and famous defender of capitalism who originated a secular philosophy she called Objectivism .
Ayn Rand 's ideas are hardly a secret -- her novels still sell briskly , fifty years on -- and the strangest part of the current debate about secularism and the right is that no one has yet seen fit to mention her .
The right needs to have a long , open , honest debate about the role of religion .
We need it now more than ever because we are in the middle of a war with an enemy that is defined by his religious fervor and by his attempt to make his religion dominate the " public square , " to borrow a catchphrase from the religious right .
If we do n't understand the real nature and value of Western , Enlightenment secularism , then we can't fully understand what is at stake in this clash of civilizations , and in the long run , we wo n't know how to win it .

AT THE end of the 19th century , an intrepid social scientist visited Stockwell , in south London .
He was involved in an ambitious project , led by the shipping magnate Charles Booth , to colour - code every street in the capital according to its social make - up .
In general , the area struck him as comfortable .
But just east of Stockwell Road he found a pocket of filth and squalor , with rowdy residents and broken windows .
It was , he believed , “ far the worst place in the division ” .
Since then , the area has been transformed .
Dismal two - storey cottages have been swept away and replaced by grass and the apartment blocks of the Stockwell Park Estate .
But the appearance of the neighbourhood has changed more than its character .
Julie Fawcett , who lives in one of the blocks , characterises her neighbours as “ the mad , the bad and the sad ” .
Unemployment is more than double the borough average .
Next to the very street that appalled the Victorian social scientist is one nicknamed Heroin Alley .
In many ways , London has changed dramatically in the past century .
It has sprawled far beyond its 1898 boundaries .
The network of underground transport has expanded , and cars have appeared .
The city has been bombed in two world wars .
The middle classes fled , then returned .
Yet when Booth 's maps are updated using data from the last census , the changes are less striking than what has stayed the same .
Not only do the broad patterns found in the 19th century hold — the East End is still poor , the West End still rich — but so do many local ones .
Booth 's method of judging streets was necessarily impressionistic .
Researchers peered through windows and into back gardens in search of clues .
A torn waistcoat on a clothes line in Kentish Town , north London , “ told clearly of working - class occupants ” .
Police officers were asked their opinions .
Of the residents of one street in the south London neighbourhood of Battersea , the local copper asserted : “ People have improved their houses but not their manners . ”
That road was coded black , for “ vicious , semi- criminal ” — the lowest of seven categories .
Sadly , the 2001 census does not measure viciousness .
But it does measure people 's socio-economic status .
By collapsing its eight categories , and Booth 's seven , into four , it is possible to see how a neighbourhood has changed ( or not changed ) over a century . *
The map on this page shows the results for one area that has altered more than most : north Chelsea .
In 1898 , Chelsea was socially mixed , and neither especially rich nor especially poor .
Booth 's researchers found some well - to - do residents in the Georgian terraces and on the main roads ; before the advent of cars , busy roads were often smart .
Dodgier folk crowded into the squalid courts and alleys .
Worst was a now - demolished street southeast of the Fulham Road , the neighbourhood 's main drag , which featured “ evil looking drink sodden old Irish women ” .
Chelsea is now one of the toniest parts of London .
Had they walked the same streets a century later , Booth 's researchers would no doubt have noticed designer clothes shops and a high concentration of Porsches and BMWs .
Managerial and professional workers are now the dominant group in the area .
Many streets that were middling in Booth 's day are now wealthy , and some pockets of deep poverty have disappeared .
But poverty has not been altogether banished from this part of Chelsea , nor has it moved much .
Most of the poorest areas in 2001 were also poor in 1898 , and in almost exactly the same places .
The reason is that the worst Victorian slums have been knocked down and replaced with tracts of social housing .
Some of this housing was built by charitable trusts in the early 20th century ; a nastier , post - war edifice just north of Draycott Avenue is the responsibility of the council .
When Chelsea 's mean streets escaped the wrecking ball , they invariably went up - market .
The houses of Caroline Place were “ poor and rather rough ” , with “ some Irish ” inhabitants , in 1898 .
Two - and three - bedroom houses in the street , since renamed Donne Place , now sell for £ 1.5 m ( $ 2.8 m ) , according to Nick Boden , a local estate agent .
( He describes the neighbourhood as “ prime , prime , prime ” . )
The same trend can be seen in many parts of the capital .
Dubious areas that kept their housing stock have often improved .
The terraced streets of Islington , which were patchy in Booth 's day and later became patchier still ( in 1971 , fewer households had exclusive use of a bathroom than anywhere else in London ) , are now notoriously middle - class .
But where vertical social housing replaced slums , poverty has been fossilised .
So has some of the viciousness that Booth found .
Scott Orford of Cardiff University says that London 's social housing has become “ residualised ” in the past few decades .
The better council properties , and those in areas where most homes are privately owned , have often been sold to their residents under the “ right to buy ” scheme introduced by the last Conservative government .
Flats on high - rise estates have proved less popular , and are more likely to have stayed in the hands of local authorities .
The public housing that remains in London thus contrasts more sharply with its surroundings .
The social geography of London may change even less in the next 108 years than it has done since 1898 .
There are , after all , fewer poor neighbourhoods with pretty housing , of the kind that may be colonised by middle - class pioneers .
The supply was beginning to dry up even in the mid-1960s , when the hero of Michael Frayn 's novel “ Towards the End of the Morning ” tries to find one .
Following a frustrating search , he admitted defeat : “ There was no shortage of slums ; but they were not Georgian or Regency slums . ”

WSIS Tunis
It ’s been four years since the issue of how the internet should be run , and by whom , became an official United Nations topic .
And yet despite hundreds of hours of talks , three preparatory meetings and a world summit , there is only one thing that the world ’s governments can agree on : Masood Khan , Pakistan ’s ambassador .
If a certain US senator and a certain EU commissioner are to be believed , the internet is five days away from total collapse as governments are finally forced into a corner and told to agree on a framework for future Internet governance .
Both are wrong , but there is a very real risk that an enormous political argument resulting in lifelong ill - will centred around the internet could developed unchecked at the WSIS Summit .
The fact that it has n’t already is effectively down to one man : Mr Khan .
He was chosen as chair of Sub - Committee A during the WSIS process , and his remit includes all the most difficult and contentious elements - not just internet governance but also how the world will deal with issues such as spam and cybercrime .
Even though press attention has focussed on the undecided question of control of the internet , at the start of the process there were widely varying views on just about every aspect of the internet .
And yet through a mixture of careful , respectful and open dialogue , occasional prodding and a dry sense of humour , Masood Khan has turned what could easily have become a bar - room brawl into a gradual formation of agreement .
Respect
Such is the level of respect and trust he has built up with all parties that at the first restart of the sub - committee this Sunday , every speaker without exception ( and that includes countries as diverse as China , Iran , Brazil , Ghana , Argentina , the US and UK ) went out of their way to stress how useful Mr Khan ’s contribution as chairman was .
In an extraordinary statement , the UK / EU then deferred its entire contribution to the net governance debate to Mr Khan 's stewardship .
" We will co-operate in any way you choose , " the representative told Mr Khan .
This was the same UK / EU team that stunned the self - same room in September by producing a radical blueprint for a new form of internet control .
It may seem incredible that something of such importance rest on the careful judgements made by one man , but as it became clear that different governments were going to be unable to find a solution among themselves , each in turn has ceded more control to Mr Khan .
Having chaired dozens of meetings as a careful and unthreatening facilitator , Mr Khan saw his chance and went for it .
" I would encourage you all not to focus on general themes of internet governance but instead go to the heart of the matter , ” were his opening words .
And then he listed them .
“ The question of a future mechanism , the question of oversight , and the paradigm of co-operation amongst all stakeholders . "
But government representatives only really feel comfortable when talking in gross generalisations or disagreeing with other delegations .
Mr Khan summarised the positions and threw them back at delegates .
" We have been discussing this issue for four years and people will want some sort of result .
We wo n’t have any voting here , we will work by consensus .
If there is a split , it will not make the final agreement .
Where there is no agreement , the effort will have to be to convince each other . "
Criticism
He criticised those reiterating the same points and the same broad principles , outlined the problems , pushed what he saw as the emerging trends and opened it out to the floor .
It ’s a measure of his standing that the room did not collapse under the eternal nay - saying that has come to represent Net governance discussions .
When the countries failed to heed his instructions , he then told all the main arguing delegates to sit in a room that afternoon and come up with a list of points where they agreed .
Four hours later they came back to the official meetings with nothing .
Khan suspended the meeting and told them to go back and do it again .
Sitting in a boiling hot and cramped drafting room , the early discussions suffered from the self - same problem of woolly jargon .
But when they finished at 10 pm , three of ten points had finally hit upon the hundred - pound gorillas in the room that everyone was ignoring .
This morning , with the list in front of delegates , Mr Khan again pushed the agenda .
The way such meetings work is that each delegation raises their token , is added to the list of speakers and in turn called upon to speak .
It is a non-combative approach proven to help governments gradually reach consensus but it is painfully slow .
Mr Khan upped the pace .
In response to one delegation ’s comments , he ignored the pretence where the country being referred to is not named , and asked that country outright to respond .
And he did it time and time again , until , eventually , the real points at the heart of the internet governance started forming .
" Would reform of the GAC [ the governmental advisory council , part of ICANN ] answer your points ? " he asked Brazil .
The Brazilian delegation demured .
" You did not answer the question , " Mr Khan came back .
It was n’t just the Brazilians .
The US was n’t allowed to hide either .
Would the US please say whether the word “ oversight ” is ever going to be acceptable to them ?
Could the US answer the assertion that other countries do not have adequate control over their own domain ?
Tricks
It required some very fast and not entirely persuasive thinking on the part of delegates to avoid making mistakes .
Twice , governments tried to stall the whole approach by asking what official standing the document they were creating would have - an age - old diplomatic trick .
Mr Khan brushed it aside : " Just wait . "
When a letter from ICANN chairman Vint Cerf was mentioned and argued over , Mr Khan found a copy and read the whole thing out .
When one delegation suggested a useful compromise or pulled back the diplomatic curtains to produce straightforward language , he signalled his approval .
If it got too heated , he made a joke and left the issue alone for the time being .
In such a way , Ambassador Khan has expertly moved a room full of governments that have been unable to get past the same topic for four years onto a path that now even the most pessimistic can see drawing ahead of them .
It is far from over but when the agreed text on how the internet should be run and by whom appears in front of the World Summit and is approved on Friday , it most certainly wo n’t be perfect but it will be in no short measure thanks to remarkable abilities of the unassuming ambassador from Pakistan . ®
Beim Blick auf die gegenwärtige politische und Parteienkonstellation zeigt sich : Das garantierte Grundeinkommen hat realpolitisch kaum Anknüpfungspunkte .
Unser Autor hält nichts davon , diese Situation zu überspielen , indem normative Forderungen aufgebaut und hochgradig moralisiert werden .
Für ihn kommt es eher auf die Stärkung der sozialwissenschaftlichen Argumente an .
Diese müssen weit verbreitete Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen , den Wandel der sozialpolitischen Institutionen und die Veränderungen der Arbeits - und Einkommensstrategien einbeziehen .
Seit etwa zwei Jahren lässt sich im deutschen Sprachraum ein bemerkenswertes Revival der Grundeinkommensdebatte beobachten .
International verlief die wissenschaftliche und politiknahe Debatte um ein Grundeinkommen kontinuierlicher – nicht zuletzt durch ihre institutionelle Stabilisierung im Basic Income European Network ( BIEN ) mit seinen alle zwei Jahre stattfindenden Großkongressen .
In der Bundesrepublik brach die Grundeinkommensdiskussion in der zweiten Hälfte der Achtzigerjahre weitgehend in sich zusammen .
Die Wiedervereinigung absorbierte offensichtlich die gesamte sozialwissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit .
Erst in der jüngsten Vergangenheit findet das Thema wieder sozialwissenschaftliche , publizistische und politische Aufmerksamkeit .
( vgl. www.netzwerk-grundeinkommen.de mit diversen Links ) .
Diese Konstellation legt vergleichende Fragestellungen nahe :
In welcher Weise hat sich die Grundeinkommensdiskussion gewandelt ( oder auch nicht ) ?
Wie wurde die Forderung nach einem Grundeinkommen früher begründet , wie heute ?
Welche Verschiebungen von Schwerpunkten lassen sich beobachten ?
Welche Begründungsmuster halten sich und was folgt daraus ?
Bald nach dem Erscheinen der ersten einflussreichen Publikationen zum Thema ( vgl. Schmid 1984 ; Büchele , Wohlgenannt 1985 ) kam es zu der wenig überraschenden Entdeckung , dass Idee , Forderung und Diskussion auch damals schon keineswegs neu waren .
In der Tat finden sich Vorläufer und Wurzeln der heutigen Debatte in den klassischen Utopien , in den heterodoxen sozialistischen Publikationen des 19 .
Jahrhunderts und in diversen Spielarten des Anarchismus .
Ebenso fanden sich deutliche Überschneidungen mit liberal - ökonomischen , radikal bürokratiekritischen und sozialstaatskritischen Positionen quer durch das 20 .
Jahrhundert ( vgl. Vobruba 1989 ) .
Die Vielfalt der Ansätze wurde von Wolfram Engels ( 1985 : 95 ) mit der griffigen Formel erfasst , beim garantierten Grundeinkommen handele es sich um einen » schwarz - rot - grünen Reformvorschlag « .
Dies traf den Kern hinsichtlich der ideengeschichtlichen Wurzeln , nicht jedoch hinsichtlich der aktuellen politischen Durchsetzungschancen des Konzepts .
Für diese Phase der Diskussion sind vor allem zwei Eigenschaften charakteristisch : Erstens gab es eine große weltanschauliche Bandbreite , und zweitens eine große Vielfalt an Begründungen ( vgl. Opielka , Vobruba 1986 ; van Parijs 1992 ) .
Ich skizziere die wichtigsten Argumente für ein garantiertes Grundeinkommen und sortiere sie in drei Gruppen .
1. Gesellschaftspolitische Argumente
– Das Autonomieargument .
Dieses repräsentiert ohne Zweifel die älteste Begründungstradition für ein Grundeinkommen .
Explizit oder implizit wurde an die klassischen Utopien , Randfiguren der sozialistischen Bewegung ( en ) und an die anarchistische Tradition angeknüpft .
Die Forderung nach einem garantierten Grundeinkommen richtet sich gegen den Zwang zur und die Fremdbestimmung von Arbeit .
Ihre Rechtfertigung findet sie in einem nicht weiter explizierten » Menschenrecht « , ihre Realisierbarkeit in Vorstellungen immenser säkularer Produktivitätssteigerungen der kapitalistischen Ökonomie .
– Das Ökologieargument .
Dieses Argument ist dem Autonomieargument insofern verwandt , als das Grundeinkommen die materiell unterfütterte Möglichkeit zur Verweigerung von ökologisch ( oder friedenspolitisch ) problematischer abhängiger Erwerbstätigkeit einführt .
In diesem Aspekt partizipierte die Forderung nach dem Grundeinkommen an der als selbstverständlich vorausgesetzten Rechtfertigung ihres Effekts : Bei einem Instrument , das die ökologie - und friedenspolitische Handlungsfähigkeit stützt , erübrigte sich die Frage seiner Rechtfertigung .
– Das frauenpolitische Argument .
Auch dieses Argument kann man als eine Art Derivat des Autonomiearguments begreifen .
Ein Grundeinkommen wurde begründet als materielle Fundierung zum Ausstieg aus ungewünschten / unzumutbaren Lebenssituationen .
Diese Begründung freilich blieb keineswegs unbestritten .
Das Gegenargument lautete , dass ein Grundeinkommen die Verdrängung der Frauen aus dem Arbeitsmarkt erleichtere .
Offensichtlich steht hinter dieser Diskurskonstellation die – wenn ich recht sehe – bis heute unaufgelöste Kontroverse um die Einschätzung von abhängiger Erwerbstätigkeit als emanzipationsfördernd oder - behindernd .
2. Ökonomische Argumente
– Das Argument alternativer Arbeit .
Wichtig , und mit dem Ökologieargument verbunden , war das Argument , ein Grundeinkommen könne als Grundlage selbstbestimmter Tätigkeiten fungieren .
Weniger prominent war die Variante , es könne als Subvention für Unternehmensgründungen genützt werden .
Weit populärer war die Vorstellung , mit einem Grundeinkommen ökonomisch nicht ( oder nicht ganz ) tragfähige Tätigkeiten in der Alternativökonomie zu flankieren .
– Das Kaufkraftargument .
Dieses Argument funktioniert in Verlängerung der konventionellen » buildt in stability « der Arbeitslosenversicherung .
Der Sozialtransfer stabilisiert die Kaufkraft , und zwar insbesondere in wirtschaftlichen Abschwüngen , sichert so ausreichende Gewinne und Beschäftigung .
Wie alle kreislauftheoretischen Argumente läuft dieses auf die Rechtfertigung des Grundeinkommens als im Interesse aller – Konsumenten , Investoren und Arbeitskräfte – hinaus .
– Das Arbeitslosigkeitsargument .
Das war die Forderung nach einem Grundeinkommen als Reaktion auf die offensichtliche Unmöglichkeit , Vollbeschäftigung im Sinne der Sechziger - und frühen Siebzigerjahre des 20 .
Jahrhunderts wieder herzustellen .
Dieses Argument war rasch dem Einwand ausgesetzt , die Forderung nach einem Grundeinkommen sei das Eingeständnis eines Versagens – womit die Debatte auf die Ebene der gesellschaftspolitischen Argumente wechselte .
Das Argument war also umstritten und damals keineswegs dominant .
3. Sozialpolitische Argumente
– Das Armutsargument .
Es war dem Arbeitslosigkeitsargument ähnlich , aber prominenter .
Seine Grundlage war der Nachweis , dass das gegebene System sozialer Sicherung angesichts rascher Wandlungsprozesse auf dem Arbeitsmarkt seine Sicherungsfunktion immer weniger erfüllen kann .
Dem Grundeinkommen als Instrument zur Absicherung der Gesellschaft nach unten ( » Abschaffung der Armut « ) wurde entgegengehalten , dass dieses Ziel auch im Rahmen der gegebenen Institutionen des Sozialstaats , durch » Sockelungen « erzielbar ist ; also ohne das Risiko eines sozialpolitischen Systemwechsels .
– Das Bürokratieargument .
Dieses Argument machte eben diesen Systemwechsel zum Kern des Anliegens .
Das Grundeinkommen wurde nicht als Ergänzung , sondern als Ersatz für die bestehenden Systeme sozialer Sicherung angesehen .
Durch die Standardisierung der Transferzahlungen und den Wegfall diverser Einzelfallprüfungen wurden Möglichkeiten eines radikalen ( Sozial - ) Bürokratieabbaus gesehen .
Eine problemlose Rechtfertigung ergab dies nur im Rahmen eines liberalen , allenfalls ökolibertären Weltbildes .
– Das Armutsfallenargument .
Das Argument beruhte auf der weit verbreiteten Überzeugung , dass an der Schnittstelle von Sozialhilfe und Arbeitsmarkt eine fehlerhafte Anreizstruktur besteht : Die ( so gut wie ) vollständige Anrechnung von Erwerbseinkommen auf den Sozialtransfer belastet Umsteiger von Sozialhilfe in Erwerbsarbeit mit einem unzumutbar hohen De- facto - Steuersatz – je nach Freibetrag von etwa 80 bis 100 Prozent .
Rationalen Einkommenskalkülen folgend verharren darum potenziell Beschäftigte im Sozialhilfebezug und bringen sich damit um die längerfristigen Möglichkeiten materiellen Aufstiegs .
(1) Darum : » Armutsfalle « .
Dem sollte durch ein Grundeinkommen in der technischen Ausgestaltung einer negativen Einkommenssteuer , welche fließende Übergänge von Sozialtransferbezug in Erwerbseinkommen ermöglicht , entgegengewirkt werden .
Das Grundeinkommen ( in Form der negativen Einkommensteuer ) wird hier gerechtfertigt als Instrument zur Beseitigung einer Anreizkonstellation , welche selbstschädigendes Verhalten nahe legt .
Wo bleibt die Überzeugungswirkung ?
Man sieht : Die Argumente in der älteren Grundeinkommensdiskussion waren vielfältig .
Entsprechend gab es relativ reichlich Gelegenheit zur ( sozial -) wissenschaftlichen Ausarbeitung einzelner Argumente und Diskursstränge .
Die neueste Grundeinkommensdiskussion ( 2 ) – soweit ich sie überblicke – unterscheidet sich davon in zwei markanten Aspekten :
Erstens .
Die ältere Diskussion war im Kern eine akademische Veranstaltung , mit umfangreichem wissenschaftlich - publizistischem Output ( zusammenfassend Wolf 1991 ) .
Die neueste Diskussion trägt dagegen viel stärker kampagnenartige Züge .
In den letzten beiden Jahren ist es zu einer intensiven Vernetzung unterschiedlicher Initiativen gekommen , die in öffentlichen Diskussionen , im Internet , durch Plakataktionen , Zeitschriftenbeiträge für ein Grundeinkommen werben .
Obwohl » autonome Politik « eher in den Achtzigerjahren als heute angesagt war , vermitteln diese Initiativen derzeit deutlich mehr als damals den Eindruck einer autonomen Bewegung für ein Grundeinkommen .
Zweitens .
Das Repertoire an Argumenten für ein Grundeinkommen in der neuesten Debatte hat sich gegenüber früher deutlich verengt .
Zwar listet die Homepage des » netzwerk - grundeinkommen « zahlreiche Argumentationsmöglichkeiten für ein Grundeinkommen auf .
» Aber es ist das Scheitern aller bisherigen Versuche der Lösung des Problems der Massenarbeitslosigkeit , welches in den letzten Dekaden dazu geführt hat , dass die Grundeinkommensidee quer durch Europa und die Welt von einer wachsenden Zahl von BürgerInnen , WissenschaftlerInnen und Organisationen ernst genommen wird . « ( Ebd . )
Von den Argumentationslinien , die sich in der älteren Grundeinkommensdiskussion gefunden haben , sind also im Wesentlichen zwei übrig geblieben : Das Arbeitslosigkeitsargument und , da es eng damit verbunden ist , das Armutsargument .
Dagegen gibt es keine Differenz zwischen älterer und neuester Diskussion in der grundlegenden Argumentationsweise :
In der gesamten Grundeinkommensdiskussion , alter und neuer , geht es in erster Linie um vielfältige Versuche den Nachweis zu führen , ein Grundeinkommen sei wünschenswert , erforderlich , notwendig , » unabdingbar « .
Die Frage der Bedingungen der Realisierbarkeit der Forderung , die Analyse politischer Konstellationen , von Interessenpositionen , Einstellungen und Werthaltungen , die sich für oder gegen ein Grundeinkommen richten , führt in der gesamten Diskussion ein Schattendasein .
Dies ist ein doppeltes Defizit :
Zum einen verzichtet die Grundeinkommensdebatte auf die Untersuchung der vielfältigen Durchsetzungsbedingungen ihrer Vorschläge .
Und insbesondere bringt sie sich um jede Möglichkeit der Reflexion darüber , in welcher Weise sich mit den Rahmenbedingung für die Transfer - und Verteilungspolitik seit der Mitte der Achtzigerjahre auch die Voraussetzungen für die Realisierbarkeit eines garantierten Grundeinkommens verändert haben .
( 3 )
Und zum anderen verbaut sich die Diskussion damit jeden systematischen Bezug zur empirischen Gerechtigkeitsforschung .
Stattdessen werden in der Regel die eigenen Gerechtigkeitsüberzeugungen engagierter Autoren mit empirischen Akzeptanzbedingungen in der Gesellschaft verwechselt .
Auf Letztere aber kommt es an .
Man kann das Problem , das der Mainstream der Grundeinkommensdiskussion seit längerer Zeit umgeht , auch so formulieren : Die Vielzahl der Begründungen eines garantierten Grundeinkommens ist so eindrucksvoll , und zahlreiche Argumentationen sind so überzeugend , dass sich die Frage stellt , wieso sie nicht breite Überzeugungswirkungen entfaltet haben und ein Grundeinkommen nicht längst realisiert ist .
Offensichtlich reichen gute Gründe nicht .
Es gibt zwei Möglichkeiten , dieses Problem zu diskutieren :
– Eine Möglichkeit ist die Auseinandersetzung mit dem philosophischen Anspruch , dass sich mit wissenschaftlichen Mitteln normative Positionen mit höherem Verbindlichkeitsanspruch begründen lassen , als den normativen Überzeugungen der Leute zugebilligt werden – und dass diese Überlegenheit als Quelle für praktisch wirksame Rechtfertigungen verwendet werden kann .
Tatsächlich werden häufig konsistente normative Begründungen für die Wünschbarkeit eines garantierten Grundeinkommens entwickelt und es wird versucht , diese Begründungen mit Geltung auszustatten , indem man sie in der moralphilosophischen professionellen Diskussion verankert .
Aber die Moralisierung eines gesellschaftlichen Anliegens ist ein deutliches Zeichen dafür , dass es politisch nicht durchsetzbar ist ( vgl. Luhmann 1990 ) .
Politischer Moralinterventionismus ( Vobruba 1997 : 113 ff. ) trägt zur politischen Realisierbarkeit eines garantierten Grundeinkommens nichts bei .
Die Diskussion um ein garantiertes Grundeinkommen sollte sich darum nicht in » die schöne Welt des Normativen « ( Dux 2004 . 297 f. ) flüchten und weniger Energie für Rechtfertigungsentwürfe verwenden , die ja doch nur Beiträge zu einem Selbstverständigungsdiskurs sein können , in dem ohnehin schon alle überzeugt sind .
Ich habe in einigen Beiträgen ( Vobruba 1997 ; 2003 ) – insbesondere im Anschluss an Dux ( 2001 ; 2004 ) und Sutter ( 2003 ) – zu zeigen versucht , dass das moralphilosophische Projekt in der Moderne hoffnungslos geworden ist , darum werde ich diese Argumentationsstrategie hier nicht weiter verfolgen .
– Die sozialwissenschaftlich ertragreichere und politisch sinnvollere Möglichkeit besteht darin ,
1. die Idee eines garantierten Grundeinkommens mit Ergebnissen der empirischen Gerechtigkeitsforschung abzugleichen , um daraus Schlussfolgerungen für die Akzeptanz der Idee zu ziehen .
2. den Wandel der sozialpolitischen Institutionen einerseits und die tatsächliche Entwicklung der Arbeits - und Einkommensstrategien der Leute andererseits zu beobachten und zu analysieren , um Anknüpfungspunkte für ein garantiertes Grundeinkommen zu finden .
Die Plausibilitäts - Frage
Im Folgenden geht es also nicht darum , die in der wissenschaftlichen Publizistik vorgetragenen Begründungsversuche aufzunehmen und – aus welcher Perspektive auch immer – als » wahr « oder wenigstens » überzeugend « auszuzeichnen .
Vielmehr sehe ich , um mit diesem Problem voranzukommen , keine andere sozialwissenschaftliche Strategie , als nach den empirisch vorfindbaren normativen Überzeugungen in der Gesellschaft zu fragen .
Es geht also um eine Frage an die soziologische empirische Gerechtigkeitsforschung : Welche empirischen Anhaltspunkte gibt es dafür , dass Begründungen für ein garantiertes Grundeinkommen den sozialen Akteuren in der Gesellschaft selbst plausibel erscheinen ?
Ich sehe drei Möglichkeiten , sich dieser Frage anzunähern .
Erstens kann man versuchen , aus der empirischen Forschung , die allgemein nach Akzeptanz und Akzeptanzbedingungen des Wohlfahrtsstaats fragt , einzelne Aspekte auf die Begründung eines Grundeinkommens zu beziehen .
Generell zeigen die Untersuchungen zum Wohlfahrtsstaat der Bundesrepublik ein hohes Maß an Zustimmung zum Wohlfahrtsstaat im Allgemeinen und eine überraschend hohe Umverteilungstoleranz ( vgl. Roller 1992 ; Ullrich 2000 ; auch Pioch , Vobruba 1995 ) .
Daraus ließe sich schließen , dass die mit einem Grundeinkommen verbundene Umverteilung jedenfalls nicht auf prinzipielle Vorbehalte stoßen würde .
Diese Schlussfolgerung ist voreilig .
Denn die Akzeptanz von Umverteilungseffekten betrifft Sozialtransfers für spezifische , wohldefinierte sozialpolitische Zwecke , zum Beispiel Heilungskosten oder Armut .
Konstitutiv für die Idee eines garantierten Grundeinkommens dagegen ist , dass eine solche Zweckbindung fehlt .
Darum hat ein Grundeinkommen die viel anspruchsvollere Voraussetzung einer generalisierten Umverteilungsbereitschaft .
Zweitens kann man direkt nach Akzeptanzbedingungen eines Grundeinkommens fragen .
Dazu ist mir nur eine Untersuchung ( Liebig , Mau 2002 ) bekannt .
Sie kommt zu dem Ergebnis , dass die Idee einer generellen Abdichtung der Gesellschaft gegen Armut in der Gesellschaft samt der damit verbundenen Umverteilung breite Zustimmung findet .
Damit ist aber nicht eine einheitliche Transferzahlung gemeint , sondern die als gerecht empfundene Höhe der Unterstützung variiert – etwa mit dem Familienstand oder der Arbeitsbereitschaft potenzieller Empfänger ( Liebig , Mau 2002 : 124 ) .
Die empirische Erhebung zeigt also , dass die Zustimmung zur Idee einer Mindestsicherung mit Differenzierungen verbunden ist , wie sie ähnlich auch im sozialpolitischen Status quo stattfinden , dass die generalisierte Umverteilungsbereitschaft also kaum gegeben ist .
Die beiden bisher skizzierten Varianten von Akzeptanzuntersuchungen haben freilich das Argument gegen sich , dass es in politischer Perspektive auf die Einstellungen der Bevölkerungen nicht wirklich ankommt .
Es werden , so könnte ein ebenso schlichtes wie plausibles Gegenargument lauten , andere Maßnahmen zum Umbau des Wohlfahrtsstaats ja auch ohne Rücksicht auf die Interessen , Einstellungen und das Gerechtigkeitsempfinden der Bevölkerungen realisiert .
Drittens lässt sich also die Frage stellen :
Wie steht es um die Einstellungen der politischen Akteure im engeren Sinn , der Politikerinnen und Politiker , zu einem garantierten Grundeinkommen ?
Im Vergleich der Einstellungen deutscher und niederländischer (4 ) Spitzenpolitiker lässt sich zeigen ( vgl. Pioch 2000 ) , dass die Breite des Spektrums ihrer Vorstellungen von sozialpolitischen Reformmöglichkeiten stark vom jeweiligen Status quo des jeweiligen Systems sozialer Sicherung abhängt :
Je rigider die gegebene sozialpolitische Regulierung , umso enger der Horizont sozialpolitischer Veränderungsvorstellungen .
Und umgekehrt :
Je universalistischer das System , umso eher ist ein Umbau in Richtung auf ein garantiertes Grundeinkommen im Bereich des politisch Vorstellbaren .
Zu beobachten ist also das Wirken einer starken normativen Kraft des Faktischen .
Die in die sozialpolitischen Institutionen eingebauten Gerechtigkeitsprinzipien ( für die Bundesrepublik vgl .
Nullmeier , Vobruba 1995 ) prägen die Vorstellungen von sozialpolitisch Möglichem , Wünschenswertem und Akzeptablem ; und zwar sowohl bei den politischen Akteuren als auch in den Bevölkerungen .
Aus den Wechselwirkungen von institutionalisierten Gerechtigkeitsprinzipien und empirischen Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen ergibt sich für die Institutionen der Systeme sozialer Sicherung ein hohes Potenzial an Selbstlegitimation : Der sozialpolitische Status quo generiert bei Politik und Publikum sozialpolitische Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen , die affirmativ auf ihn zurückwirken .
Die sich daraus ergebende Pfadabhängigkeit wäre nur zu durchbrechen , wenn sich politische Akteure finden , die in Antizipation der selbstlegitimierenden Wirkung realisierter Umbaumaßnahmen Schritte in Richtung Grundeinkommen machen .
Dass dies passiert , ist unwahrscheinlich .
Prozesse des Wandels
Ich komme damit zum letzten Punkt , zur Untersuchung des Wandels sozialpolitischer Institutionen und der Entwicklung der Arbeits - und Einkommensstrategien der Leute .
Welche Entwicklungen lassen sich erkennen , die in Richtung Grundeinkommen gehen und in diesem Sinne forciert werden könnten ?
Tatsächlich ist die gegenwärtige Entwicklung mehrdeutig : Einerseits gibt es zurzeit einen breiten öffentlichen Diskurs , der Niveauabsenkungen und Verschärfungen der Zugangsbedingungen zu Sozialtransfers als zwingend erforderlich darstellt , ( 5 ) und eine Politik , die diesem Diskurs im Bereich arbeitsmarktnaher Sozialleistungen – bisher allerdings nur zögerlich – gefolgt ist ( vgl. Huber , Stephens 2001 ; Palier 2001 ) .
Andererseits finden sich Ansätze des Ausbaus der sozialpolitischen Unterstützung arbeitsmarktferner Lebenslagen ( vgl. Bleses , Seeleib - Kaiser 2004 ) .
Es wäre sinnvoll , an die Analysen dieser uneindeutigen sozialpolitischen Entwicklung anzuknüpfen , um weiterführende Fragemöglichkeiten im Hinblick auf ein garantiertes Grundeinkommen zu erschließen .
Die international vergleichende Sozialpolitikforschung liefert eine Fülle an Informationen über die Wirkungen sozialer Kräfteverhältnisse und institutioneller Konstellationen für Abbau oder Stabilität von Sozialleistungen .
Insbesondere besteht ein deutlicher Zusammenhang zwischen der Höhe der Arbeitslosigkeit und dem Ausmaß des Sozialabbaus ( vgl. Huber , Stephens 2001 ) .
Dagegen ist der Zusammenhang zwischen Globalisierungsgrad und sozialpolitischer Entwicklung keineswegs empirisch eindeutig und theoretisch bisher nur unzureichend geklärt .
–
Was lässt sich daraus für die Frage nach Realisierungschancen eines Grundeinkommens lernen ?
Sind jene Konstellationen , welche für die bemerkenswerte Krisenfestigkeit ( zumindest ) einiger Bereiche der Sozialpolitik verantwortlich sind , potenzielle Anknüpfungspunkte für ein Grundeinkommen ?
Lassen sich die selektiven sozialpolitischen Ausbaumaßnahmen einiger arbeitsmarktferner Sozialleistungen ( Familientransfers ) als Vorboten eines Grundeinkommens interpretieren , oder sind sie diesbezüglich Sackgassen ?
In ähnlicher Weise kann die Grundeinkommensdiskussion an Forschungen über vorfindbare Arbeits - und Einkommensstrategien der Leute anschließen .
Hier geht es um Fragen , wie :
In welcher Weise werden die tatsächlich verfügbaren Ressourcen – Arbeitsgelegenheiten , Sozialtransfers , soziale Netzwerke – von den Leuten genützt , um aus zunehmend diskontinuierlichen Arbeitsbiographien einigermaßen kontinuierliche Einkommensbiographien zu machen ?
Das Wissen um Möglichkeiten des Rückgriffs auf staatliche Sozialtransfers stellt – wenn auch von Land zu Land in unterschiedlichem Maße – eine Hintergrundgewissheit und stabile Handlungsressource dar ( vgl. Steinert , Pilgram 2003 ) .
Empirische Forschungen zu Strategien der Normalisierung atypischer Erwerbsverläufe zeigen , dass sich die Leute keineswegs nur als Opfer der Transformation des Arbeitsmarktes sehen .
Was also wissen wir über Strategien der Leute , Arbeitseinkommen , Kapitaleinkünfte und Sozialtransfers zu kombinieren ( vgl. Vobruba 2000 ) , und über die derart erzielbare Lebensqualität ?
Mit anderen Worten : Will man Aufschluss über Anknüpfungspunkte für eine Grundeinkommenspolitik an die Lebensentwürfe und - strategien der Leute , muss man diese erst genau kennen lernen und verstehen .
Es geht also darum , diese Phänomene entlang der Frage zu durchforsten , ob hier einzelne Aspekte eines Grundeinkommens ansatzweise vorweggenommen werden .
Insgesamt bedeutet dies einen Realitätsschwenk der Grundeinkommensdiskussion .
Es geht darum
– Institutionen zu beobachten und zu fragen , ob der Wandel der sozialpolitischen Institutionen Ergebnisse hervorbringt , die sinnvoll als Vorformen eines Grundeinkommens verstanden und genützt werden können .
– Arbeits - und Einkommensstrategien der Leute zu beobachten und zu fragen , in welcher Weise sie damit praktisch Ziele verfolgen , welche in der Grundeinkommensdiskussion normativ hochgehalten werden .
Dass dies alles ein reichlich akademisches Programm sei , könnte man nun entgegenhalten .
Aber der Einwand zieht nicht wirklich .
Denn die Grundeinkommensdiskussion war immer eine weitgehend akademische Angelegenheit .
Schon in den Achtzigerjahren gab es nur vereinzelte Übersprünge in die parlamentarische Arbeit ( der Grünen ) .
Wenn die Diskussion damals überhaupt einen politischen Effekt gehabt hat , dann den : Sozialdemokratie und Gewerkschaften , die bis dahin auf eine strikte Anbindung von Sozialleistungen an abhängige Erwerbstätigkeit festgelegt waren , öffneten sich angesichts solcher viel weiter gehender Vorschläge zumindest der Idee eines Einbaus von Grundsicherungselementen in die bestehenden Sicherungssysteme .
Gegenwärtig findet das Grundeinkommen Anschluss an die konventionelle Politik allenfalls via PDS / Die Linke .
Es könnte zwar gut sein , dass Bündnis90 / Die Grünen die Grundeinkommensidee als Oppositionskonzept wieder entdecken .
Damit aber könnte die folgende Blockadesituation entstehen : Einerseits finden die Grünen das Thema von der PDS / Die Linke besetzt vor , andererseits aber ist es nicht einmal in der PDS / Die Linke selbst durchsetzbar .
Der von der » sozialistischen Arbeitsgesellschaft « ( Nissen 1992 ) geprägten Mentalität ihrer Stammwähler entspricht die Forderung » Arbeit für alle« ( Wahlprogramm ) viel besser .
Music industry tries to hijack serious crime legislation in Europe
When the UK Presidency suggested to the EU that telecoms service providers and ISPs should be forced to retain information about the telephone calls you make and the sites you visit , they stated that it was an essential “ balance ” struck between liberty and security : a grave compromise necessitated by the threat of terrorism and serious crime .
We do n’t remember them mentioning “ and might help the recording industry fish for file - sharing networks , DRM workarounds , and spurious patent infringers ” .
The newly - formed Creative and Media Business Alliance ( CMBA ) , made up of companies such as Sony BMG , Disney , EMI , IFPI , MPA and Universal Music International , this week expressed an interest in communications traffic data so that they can more easily prosecute “ intellectual property infringements ” .
Thanks to a combination of two fast - tracked EU directives , they may just get their wish : and allow a UK plan to limit civil liberties to turn into a privacy - invading free - for - all by the entertainment lobby .
Data Retention to Fight Piracy ?
This week , the CMBA emailed all MEPs ( Word doc ) , calling for the data retention legislation currently under discussion in Europe to be widened far beyond its original scope .
The CMBA want data retention legislation to be an “ effective instrument in the fight against piracy ” , and believes that “ the conditions set out in the proposal are too restrictive and would create obstacles to law enforcement in a number of situations .
Moreover , many amendments submitted , including to the Industry Committee , seek to further reduce the scope of the Commission proposal . ”
You can read and cross-reference the amendments that the CBMA object to here , and here .
These amendments are some of the few that try to rein in already bad legislation which may well violate the European Convention on Human Rights .
For these companies , however , industry interests trump democracy , human rights and civil liberties .
The CMBA demands :
1 . The scope of the proposal should include all criminal offences The Directive , as proposed , is limited to “ the prevention , investigation , detection and prosecution of serious criminal offences such as terrorism and organized crime ” ( Article 1.1 ) .
The position of the CMBA is that the scope of the proposal should be extended to all criminal offences .
Limiting the proposal to “ serious ” offences would hamper the effectiveness of the Directive and the enforcement activities for other forms of criminal offences .
Liberal Democrat MEP
Bill Newton Dunn has already helped the industry out here , by requesting that the word ‘ serious ’ be removed from the legislation :
Original version : “ … data is available for … prevention , investigation , detection and prosecution of serious criminal offences , such as terrorism and organised crime . ”
Dunn version : “… data is available for … investigation , detection and prosecution of criminal offences . ”
Remember that under current EU law , copyright criminals include not just large - scale commercial infringement operations , but thanks to the EUCD , also anyone who sells or “ distributes … as to affect prejudicially the copyright owner ” circumvention devices or components .
In other words , if you put the DeCSS code on a web page – six months of phone calls and sites visited may be used against you .
Or if you reveal that putting tape on a CD will circumvent Sony rootkits .
Furthermore , the CMBA demands :
3 . The access and use of data for law enforcement purposes must not be limited .
If the proposed directive is limited , in particular in its scope , it must be clear that it does not preclude the possibilities to obtain data for the enforcement of rights under EU or national legislation , in compliance with Data Protection rules .
The possibility for law enforcement authorities to use data in other cases , to be determined by national law or other EU instruments , is essential , otherwise there will be no way to prosecute the infringements that are not covered by this proposal .
Whether or not you agree with the need to retain traffic data for fighting terrorism and serious crime , there can be no benefit to national security from allowing the creative industries to use this information for prosecuting simple “ infringement ” cases .
Copyright Criminals
Now tie this in with IPRED2 , another nasty bit of legislation which criminalises all “ intellectual property ” infringement on a commercial scale and “ aiding and abetting such infringement ” , with very thin definitions of what “ commercial scale ” or “ intellectual property ” means .
The two directives together become even more alarming .
IPRED2 mandates that the police work with rightsholders to pursue suspected cases of IP infringement – including patent infringements – or merely vocal encouragement of infringement .
And the Data Retention directive provides them with reams of data they can mine for evidence against these suspected infringers .
At the latest IPRED2 hearing , that ’s exactly what the CBMA ’s parent organisation , the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , demanded .
This opens up a very ugly can of worms where entire industries can get unparalleled powers of investigation , provided at the taxpayer ’s expense .
Moreover , if the CMBA get their way , the number of data retention enquiries that the telcos and ISPs will have to process will be far higher than if restricted to terrorism and serious crime .
This will put far more pressure on the telcos and ISPs who will not only have to bear the cost of storing the data , but also of providing access to the information to the authorities .
So , why is this important right now , this minute ?
Both Data Retention and IPRED2 are being frogmarched through the European Parliament at an alarming speed .
Votes are being held by three committees over the next few days on Data Retention , with secret meetings going on in the background between the Council , the Commission and the Parliament , with the aim of reaching a tacit agreement on what this legislation should look like .
On 13 December 2005 , the Parliament votes on the Data Retention directive .
Usually , they get two stabs at it , with the Council having a say in between .
This time , they get just one vote .
This time , MEPs will have just a few days between being presented with the proposed legislation as drawn up in the secret meetings and being expected to come to an informed , considered decision on whether it should become law .
Word has it that there are some MEPs who do not even realise that this is a single reading process – they are expecting the normal two reading process instead .
Most MEPs have probably not been following the debate around Data Retention in detail , and giving them just a few days to absorb , understand , and analyse the proposals will ensure that , by the time they must cast their vote , they will through no fault of their own still not be in a position to make a reasoned decision .
This is not democracy .
What can you do ?
Email your MEP now .
Tell him or her that you oppose Data Retention , and that you are concerned about the way it is being rushed through the European Parliament .
Read this pamphlet ( sent to all MEPs by EDRI ) for talking points to discuss .
Read up about IPRED2 .
With all the work going on with software patents and data retention , IPRED2 has not had the coverage it deserves .
The FFII ( the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure ) has been doing a fine job tracking it , but it needs more exposure .
Blog about your concerns and encourage your readers to contact their MEP and particularly the Green Party , who may yet play a vital role in protecting your civil liberties by tabling a rejection of the Data Retention proposal .
The recording industry and the UK presidency are determined to get their way through stealth , not debate .
We ca n’t let the European Parliament sleep - walk their way into these statutes .
Between Sept. 11 , 2001 , and his State of the Union Address in 2002 , George W. Bush had America in the palm of his hand .
But in that speech , Bush blew it .
Singling out Iran , Iraq , and North Korea as state sponsors of terror seeking weapons of mass destruction , Bush yoked them together in an “ axis of evil ” and issued this ultimatum : “ I will not wait on events , while dangers gather .
I will not stand by , as peril draws closer and closer .
The United States of America will not permit the world ’s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world ’s most destructive weapons . ”
Neoconservatives celebrated this bellicosity as neo-Churchillian .
Yet all it accomplished was to fracture the U.S. and foreign coalitions that had united behind Bush .
As some of us wrote at the time , to call Iran and Iraq , mortal enemies in the eight - year war of the ’ 80s that took a million lives , an “ axis ” was absurd .
Bush ’s speech was a blunder of the first magnitude .
First , he had no authority to attack any of those nations , as Congress had not authorized war .
Second , he had neither the plans nor forces in place to do so .
Yet he had put all three on notice this was what he had in mind .
When the United States invaded Iraq , North Korea and Iran got the message .
Both accelerated their nuclear programs .
By issuing public ultimatums , Bush left these regimes no way out .
Even tiny Serbia felt its national honor required it to fight rather than submit to a U.S. ultimatum to let NATO march through the country to occupy Kosovo .
Now Kim Jong - Il , though his July 4 test of the Taepodong - 2 missile seems to have Roman - candled and his plutonium bomb may have misfired , has openly defied the Bush Doctrine .
Arguably the world ’s worst regime has acquired the world ’s worst weapon .
Bush ’s response ?
He went to the United Nations to plead for sanctions .
Will the sanctions work ?
Why should they ?
As columnist Tony Blankley has argued , this is a regime that , to ensure its isolation and ideological purity , allowed millions of its people to starve to death .
The cruelties the Hermit Kingdom has imposed upon its own to guarantee that America will not be tempted to attack are astounding .
This is not a crowd that will give up its atom bomb for BMWs .
Because of the bluster - and - bluff of President Bush , the United States is today eyeball - to - eyeball with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs , and neither of these regimes appears ready to blink .
Are we headed down the road again , as we were in the Balkans and Iraq , toward wars that will be even bigger and bloodier ?
It need not happen , for the most basic of reasons .
Neither Iran nor North Korea could survive all - out war with the United States , and neither has crossed any red line to start such a war .
What do these nations want , and can America accommodate them , without imperiling our security or accepting an intolerable loss of strategic credibility ?
What North Korea wants is what President Nixon gave Mao Zedong in the 1970s .
Recognition , security guarantees , aid , admission into the international community , and an end to the U.S. policy of regime change .
What does America want from North Korea ?
No more atomic tests , the return of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors into all of North Korea ’s nuclear facilities , and no export of nuclear materials to hostile states or non-state actors that could use nuclear devices as instruments of terror , mass murder , or nuclear blackmail .
The six - party talks have failed .
North Korea has rejected U.S. offers and resisted U.S. demands , and South Korea and China have balked at using their leverage to back us up .
If Beijing and Seoul wish to play a separate hand with Pyongyang , we should play one , too .
We should engage in direct negotiations with the North , warning them that any export of a nuclear device to a hostile regime risks an attack by the United States and any nuclear weapon used against Americans , anywhere , traceable to North Korea will bring certain and massive nuclear retaliation .
However , in return for ironclad assurances they have opened up all nuclear programs to inspection and given up further development of nuclear weapons , we should offer the North Koreans diplomatic ties , economic aid , and a security pact sealed with a U.S. withdrawal of forces from the Korean peninsula .
Great though its crimes , Kim ’s regime will never equal in evil those of Josef Stalin or Mao , both of whom had nuclear arsenals greater than Kim can ever achieve  and America never went to war with either .
Meanwhile , put the bellicose bluster on the shelf .
It has done less than nothing to advance America ’s security .
If you just want to watch music videos online , you can visit Web sites like music.aol.com or mtv.com .
But when it comes to downloading and owning videos , the iTunes Music Store became Music Video Central almost overnight ; it offers over 2,000 videos that can be downloaded for $ 2 apiece and viewed on the new video - capable iPod .
How does this format , invented decades ago for standard - size televisions , play on a a 2.5 - inch screen ?
The answer is good , bad and otherwise .
Herewith , a somewhat representative sampling .
' Vertigo ' ( U2 )
Many music - video directors have struggled to make a video of the band playing that does n't look just like every other video of the band playing .
In " Vertigo , " the directors Alex Courtes and Martin Fougerol shot the band on a crazy , undulating , concentric - circle computer - generated landscape , and added what looks like thick black digital smoke pouring off each band member .
It 's a lively and irresistible effect ; the fans went crazy , and " Vertigo " won the 2004 Grammy for best short - form music video .
It wo n't win for best video on the iPod , though .
The problem is the film 's widescreen format .
Two - thirds of the iPod 's TV - square screen is wasted by black letterbox bars ; worse , the remaining image is shrunken down to play in the middle third .
There 's just not enough detail left for satisfying viewing .

WASHINGTON -- Below is the text of President Bush 's State of the Union address with links to key points :
Economy
Education
Health care
Immigration
Energy / Alternative fuel
War on terror
Iraq
AIDS / Africa
Thank you very much .
And tonight , I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own , as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words : " Madam Speaker . "
In his day , the late congressman , Thomas d'Alessandro Jr. , from Baltimore , Maryland , saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum .
But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter , Nancy , presiding tonight as speaker of the House of Representatives
Congratulations , Madam Speaker .
Two members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight , and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood .
Madam Speaker , Vice President Cheney , members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens :
This rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour -- when decisions are hard and courage is needed .
We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway , and others that are ours to begin .
In all of this , much is asked of us .
We must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies -- and the wisdom to face them together .
Some in this chamber are new to the House and Senate -- and I congratulate the Democratic majority .
Congress has changed , but not our responsibilities .
Each of us is guided by our own convictions -- and to these we must stay faithful .
Yet we are all held to the same standards , and called to serve the same good purposes :
To extend this nation 's prosperity ... to spend the people 's money wisely ... to solve problems , not leave them to future generations ... to guard America against all evil , and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us .
We are not the first to come here with government divided and uncertainty in the air .
Like many before us , we can work through our differences , and achieve big things for the American people .
Our citizens do n't much care which side of the aisle we sit on -- as long as we are willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done .
Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans , and help them to build a future of hope and opportunity -- and this is the business before us tonight .
A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy -- and that is what we have .
We are now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth -- in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs ... so far .
Unemployment is low , inflation is low , and wages are rising .
This economy is on the move -- and our job is to keep it that way , not with more government but with more enterprise .
( Watch the president discuss the economy )
Economy
Next week , I will deliver a full report on the state of our economy .
Tonight , I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress .
First , we must balance the federal budget .
We can do so without raising taxes .
What we need to do is impose spending discipline in Washington , D.C.
We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 -- and met that goal three years ahead of schedule .
Now let us take the next step .
In the coming weeks , I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years .
I ask you to make the same commitment .
Together , we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government , and balance the federal budget .
Next , there is the matter of earmarks .
These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour -- when not even C - SPAN is watching .
In 2005 alone , the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $ 18 billion .
Even worse , over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate -- they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk .
You did not vote them into law .
I did not sign them into law .
Yet they are treated as if they have the force of law .
The time has come to end this practice .
So let us work together to reform the budget process ... expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress ... and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session .
Finally , to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements .
Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience -- and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound .
Yet we are failing in that duty -- and this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options : huge tax increases , huge deficits , or huge and immediate cuts in benefits .
Everyone in this chamber knows this to be true -- yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act .
So let us work together and do it now .
With enough good sense and good will , you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid -- and save Social Security .
Education
Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life .
Five years ago , we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act -- preserving local control , raising standards in public schools , and holding those schools accountable for results .
And because we acted , students are performing better in reading and math , and minority students are closing the achievement gap .
( Watch Bush discuss education )
Now the task is to build on this success , without watering down standards , without taking control from local communities and without backsliding and calling it reform .
We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose something better .
We must increase funds for students who struggle -- and make sure these children get the special help they need .
And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future , and our country is more competitive , by strengthening math and science skills .
The No Child Left Behind
Act has worked for America 's children -- and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law .
Health care
A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care .
When it comes to health care , government has an obligation to care for the elderly , the disabled , and poor children .
We will meet those responsibilities .
For all other Americans , private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs .
But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy .
Tonight , I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance .
First , I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents .
Families with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $ 15,000 of their income .
Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $ 7,500 of their income .
With this reform , more than 100 million men , women , and children who are now covered by employer - provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills .
( Watch Bush propose health care initiatives )
At the same time , this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job .
For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own , my proposal would mean a substantial tax savings -- $ 4,500 for a family of four making $ 60,000 a year .
And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all , this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach .
Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans .
My second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured .
States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick .
I have asked the secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create " Affordable Choices " grants .
These grants would give our nation 's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need .
There are many other ways that Congress can help .
We need to expand Health Savings Accounts , help small businesses through Association Health Plans , reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology , encourage price transparency and protect good doctors from junk lawsuits by passing medical liability reform .
And in all we do , we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by government and insurance companies , but by patients and their doctors .
Immigration
Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America -- with laws that are fair and borders that are secure .
When laws and borders are routinely violated , this harms the interests of our country .
To secure our border , we are doubling the size of the Border Patrol -- and funding new infrastructure and technology .
( Watch Bush detail immigration initiative )
Yet even with all these steps , we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border -- and that requires a temporary worker program .
We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis .
As a result , they wo n't have to try to sneak in -- and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers , and criminals , and terrorists .
We will enforce our immigration laws at the work site , and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers -- so there is no excuse left for violating the law .
We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals .
And we need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country -- without animosity and without amnesty .
Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration .
Let us have a serious , civil , and conclusive debate -- so that you can pass , and I can sign , comprehensive immigration reform into law .
Energy / Alternative fuel
Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America 's economy running and America 's environment clean .
For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil .
And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes , and to terrorists -- who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments , raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy .
( Watch Bush call for reducing gasoline usage )
It is in our vital interest to diversify America 's energy supply -- and the way forward is through technology .
We must continue changing the way America generates electric power -- by even greater use of clean coal technology ... solar and wind energy ... and clean , safe nuclear power .
We need to press on with battery research for plug - in and hybrid vehicles , and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel .
We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol -- using everything from wood chips , to grasses , to agricultural wastes .
We have made a lot of progress , thanks to good policies in Washington and the strong response of the market .
Now even more dramatic advances are within reach .
Tonight , I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal .
Let us build on the work we have done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next ten years -- thereby cutting our total imports by the equivalent of three - quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East .
To reach this goal , we must increase the supply of alternative fuels , by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 -- this is nearly five times the current target .
At the same time , we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks -- and conserve up to eight and a half billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017 .
Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil , but will not eliminate it .
So as we continue to diversify our fuel supply , we must also step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways .
And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply , I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil .
These technologies will help us become better stewards of the environment -- and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change .
A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair , impartial system of justice .
The lives of citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts .
And we have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings .
As president , I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench .
And the United States Senate has a duty as well -- to give those nominees a fair hearing , and a prompt up - or - down vote on the Senate floor .
War on terror
For all of us in this room , there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger .
Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that terrorists can cause .
We have had time to take stock of our situation .
We have added many critical protections to guard the homeland .
We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us -- unless we stop them .
( Watch Bush discuss the ongoing war on terror )
With the distance of time , we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed .
Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions .
Yet one question has surely been settled -- that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy .
From the start , America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense .
The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary , easy movement , steady financing , and free flowing communications are long over .
For the terrorists , life since 9/11 has never been the same .
Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen .
We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented -- but here is some of what we do know :
We stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the West Coast .
We broke up a Southeast Asian terrorist cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States .
We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America .
And just last August , British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean .
For each life saved , we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them .
Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy .
The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world .
And so long as that is the case , America is still a nation at war .
In the minds of the terrorists , this war began well before September 11th , and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled .
And these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy .
Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists , possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology .
Take almost any principle of civilization , and their goal is the opposite .
They preach with threats ... instruct with bullets and bombs ... and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent .
Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions .
They want to overthrow moderate governments , and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country .
By killing and terrorizing Americans , they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty .
They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology .
Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi : " We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams , and what is coming is even worse . "
And Osama bin Laden declared : " Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us . "
These men are not given to idle words , and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement .
In recent times , it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile to America , and are also determined to dominate the Middle East .
Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran , which is funding and arming terrorists like Hezbollah -- a group second only to al Qaeda in the American lives it has taken .
The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat .
But whatever slogans they chant , when they slaughter the innocent , they have the same wicked purposes .
They want to kill Americans , kill democracy in the Middle East and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale .
In the sixth year since our nation was attacked , I wish I could report to you that the dangers have ended .
They have not .
And so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence , diplomacy , law enforcement , and military action to do our duty , to find these enemies , and to protect the American people .
This war is more than a clash of arms -- it is a decisive ideological struggle , and the security of our nation is in the balance .
To prevail , we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred , and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and come to kill us .
What every terrorist fears most is human freedom -- societies where men and women make their own choices , answer to their own conscience , and live by their hopes instead of their resentments .
Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies -- and most will choose a better way when they are given a chance .
So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates , reformers , and brave voices for democracy .
The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity .
And I say , for the sake of our own security -- we must .
In the last two years , we have seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East -- and we have been sobered by the enemy 's fierce reaction .
In 2005 , the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution , drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections .
In 2005 , the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature .
And in 2005 , the Iraqi people held three national elections -- choosing a transitional government , adopting the most progressive , democratic constitution in the Arab world and then electing a government under that constitution .
Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst , nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity we should never forget .
A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes , adjusted their tactics , and in 2006 they struck back .
In Lebanon , assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel , a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution .
And Hezbollah terrorists , with support from Syria and Iran , sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon 's legitimately elected government .
In Afghanistan , Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces .
In Iraq , al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shia Islam -- the Golden Mosque of Samarra .
This atrocity , directed at a Muslim house of prayer , was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia -- and it succeeded .
Radical Shia elements , some of whom receive support from Iran , formed death squads .
The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day .
This is not the fight we entered in Iraq , but it is the fight we are in .
Every one of us wishes that this war were over and won .
Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept , our friends abandoned , and our own security at risk .
Ladies and gentlemen :
On this day , at this hour , it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle .
So let us find our resolve , and turn events toward victory .
Iraq
We are carrying out a new strategy in Iraq -- a plan that demands more from Iraq 's elected government , and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission .
Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law , respects the rights of its people , provides them security , and is an ally in the war on terror .
( Watch the president talk about the ongoing struggle in Iraq )
In order to make progress toward this goal , the Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital .
But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own .
So we are deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq .
The vast majority will go to Baghdad , where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods , and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units .
With Iraqis in the lead , our forces will help secure the city by chasing down terrorists , insurgents , and roaming death squads .
And in Anbar province -- where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them -- we are sending an additional 4,000 United States Marines , with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out .
We did not drive al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq .
The people of Iraq want to live in peace , and now is the time for their government to act .
Iraq 's leaders know that our commitment is not open ended .
They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad -- and they must do so .
They have pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party .
They need to follow through , and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and Coalition forces , so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad .
Iraq 's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks to achieve reconciliation -- to share oil revenues among all of Iraq 's citizens ... to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq ... to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation 's civic life ... to hold local elections ... and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province .
But for all of this to happen , Baghdad must be secured .
And our plan will help the Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments .
My fellow citizens , our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options .
We discussed every possible approach .
In the end , I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance of success .
Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq -- because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far reaching .
If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure , the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides .
We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran , and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime .
A contagion of violence could spill out across the country -- and in time the entire region could be drawn into the conflict .
For America , this is a nightmare scenario .
For the enemy , this is the objective .
Chaos is their greatest ally in this struggle .
And out of chaos in Iraq , would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens ... new recruits ... new resources ... and an even greater determination to harm America .
To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September 11th and invite tragedy .
And ladies and gentlemen , nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East ... to succeed in Iraq ... and to spare the American people from this danger .
This is where matters stand tonight , in the here and now .
I have spoken with many of you in person .
I respect you and the arguments you have made .
We went into this largely united -- in our assumptions , and in our convictions .
And whatever you voted for , you did not vote for failure .
Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq -- and I ask you to give it a chance to work .
And I ask you to support our troops in the field -- and those on their way .
The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others .
That is why it is important to work together so our Nation can see this great effort through .
Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation .
And this is why I propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror , made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties .
We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us .
And we will show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory .
One of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military -- so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead .
Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next five years .
A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps .
Such a corps would function much like our military reserve .
It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them .
And it would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time .
Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle -- because we are not in this struggle alone .
We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism .
In Iraq , multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations -- and we are working with Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and the Gulf states to increase support for Iraq 's government .
The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran , and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons .
With the other members of the Quartet -- the UN , the European Union , and Russia -- we are pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land , and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side - by - side with Israel in peace and security .
In Afghanistan , NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive -- the first time the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area .
Together with our partners in China , Japan , Russia , and South Korea , we are pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons .
And we will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba , Belarus , and Burma -- and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur .
AIDS / Africa
American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy .
Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth :
To whom much is given , much is required .
We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger , poverty , and disease -- and that is precisely what America is doing .
We must continue to fight HIV / AIDS , especially on the continent of Africa -- and because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , the number of people receiving life - saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years .
I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV / AIDS .
I ask you to provide $ 1.2 billion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries .
I ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account , so that American aid reaches the people who need it , in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat .
And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty .
When America serves others in this way , we show the strength and generosity of our country .
These deeds reflect the character of our people .
The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness , courage , and self sacrifice of the American people .
You see this spirit often if you know where to look -- and tonight we need only look above to the gallery .
Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa , amid great poverty and disease .
He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine -- but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea .
Dikembe became a star in the NBA , and a citizen of the United States .
But he never forgot the land of his birth -- or the duty to share his blessings with others .
He has built a brand new hospital in his hometown .
A friend has said of this good hearted man : " Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things . "
And we are proud to call this son of the Congo our fellow American .
After her daughter was born , Julie Aigner - Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child .
So she borrowed some equipment , and began filming children 's videos in her basement .
The Baby Einstein Company was born -- and in just five years her business grew to more than $ 20 million in sales .
In November 2001 , Julie sold Baby Einstein to the Walt Disney Company , and with her help Baby Einstein has grown into a $ 200 million business .
Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America .
And she is using her success to help others -- producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
Julie says of her new project : " I believe it 's the most important thing that I 've ever done .
I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe . "
So tonight , we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur -- Julie Aigner - Clark .
Three weeks ago , Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two little girls , when he saw a man fall into the path of a train .
With seconds to act , Wesley jumped onto the tracks ... pulled the man into a space between the rails ... and held him as the train passed right above their heads .
He insists he 's not a hero .
Wesley says : " We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms .
We got to show each other some love . "
There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like Wesley Autrey .
Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence , Kentucky , when he enlisted in the United States Army .
In December 2003 , he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire .
From his Humvee , Sgt. Rieman returned fire -- and used his body as a shield to protect his gunner .
He was shot in the chest and arm , and received shrapnel wounds to his legs -- yet he refused medical attention , and stayed in the fight .
He helped to repel a second attack , firing grenades at the enemy 's position .
For his exceptional courage , Sgt. Rieman was awarded the Silver Star .
And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us , he has earned the respect and gratitude of our whole country .
In such courage and compassion , ladies and gentlemen , we see the spirit and character of America -- and these qualities are not in short supply .
This is a decent and honorable country -- and resilient , too .
We have been through a lot together .
We have met challenges and faced dangers , and we know that more lie ahead .
Yet we can go forward with confidence -- because the State of our Union is strong ... our cause in the world is right ... and tonight that cause goes on .
God Bless .

When we first saw these two photos of the Volkswagen 's storage facility in Wolfsburg , Germany , we thought this was an artist 's rendition for some sort of science fiction movie .
It 's not .
This is an actual 20 - story car tower that takes up just 20 % of the space of a conventional parking garage handling the same number of vehicles .
Volkswagen uses the facility in a showy delivery process for its new - car customers :
" In a fully automated procedure , your new car is brought down to you from one of the 20 - story Car Towers .
Large signboards in the Customer Center show you when your turn has come .
Then , you 're handed the keys , your picture is taken , the glass doors open and your brand - new car appears .
You 're all set to go . "

Not only does it save space , but the storage facility 's automated elevator system is able to retrieve cars much quicker than a potentially - careless human parking lot attendant .

March 1 , 2006 - Disclaimer : Since a lot of people seem to me misunderstanding this article .
It is n't about OOP vs. Procedural programming styles .
I happen to lean more towards procedural , but could easily have gone more OOP .
I simplified the code a bit for brevity , but have added a light OO layer back in the model now .
Not that it makes a difference .
What I was hoping to get across here is a simple example of how you can use PHP as - is , without additional complex external layers , to apply an MVC approach with clean and simple views and still have all the goodness of fancy Web 2.0 features .
If you think I am out to personally offend you and your favourite framework , then you have the wrong idea .
I just happen find most of them too complex for my needs and this is a proposed alternative .
If you have found a framework that works for you , great .
So you want to build the next fancy Web 2.0 site ?
You 'll need some gear .
Most likely in the form of a big complex MVC framework with plenty of layers that abstracts away your database , your HTML , your Javascript and in the end your application itself .
If it is a really good framework it will provide a dozen things you 'll never need .
I am obviously not a fan of such frameworks .
I like stuff I can understand in an instant .
Both because it lets me be productive right away and because 6 months from now when I come back to fix something , again I will only need an instant to figure out what is going on .
So , here is my current approach to building rich web applications .
The main pieces are :
MVC ?
I do n't have much of a problem with MVC itself .
It 's the framework baggage that usually comes along with it that I avoid .
Parts of frameworks can be useful as long as you can separate the parts out that you need .
As for MVC , if you use it carefully , it can be useful in a web application .
Just make sure you avoid the temptation of creating a single monolithic controller .
A web application by its very nature is a series of small discrete requests .
If you send all of your requests through a single controller on a single machine you have just defeated this very important architecture .
Discreteness gives you scalability and modularity .
You can break large problems up into a series of very small and modular solutions and you can deploy these across as many servers as you like .
You need to tie them together to some extent most likely through some backend datastore , but keep them as separate as possible .
This means you want your views and controllers very close to each other and you want to keep your controllers as small as possible .
Goals for this approach
Clean and simple design
HTML should look like HTML
Keep the PHP code in the views extremely simple : function calls , simple loops and variable substitutions should be all you need
Secure
Input validation using pecl / filter as a data firewall
When possible , avoid layers and other complexities to make code easier to audit
Fast
Avoid include_once and require_once
Use APC and apc_store / apc_fetch for caching data that rarely changes
Stay with procedural style unless something is truly an object
Avoid locks at all costs
Example Application
It is a form entry page with a bit of Javascript magic along with an sqlite backend .
Click around a bit .
Try to add an entry , then modify it .
You will see the server -> client JSON traffic displayed at the bottom for debug purposes .
The Code
This is the code layout .
It uses AJAX ( with JSON instead of XML over the wire ) for data validation .
It also uses a couple of components from the Yahoo !
user interface library and PHP's PDO mechanism in the model .
The presentation layer is above the line and the business logic below .
In this simple example I have just one view , represented by the add.html file .
It is actually called add .php on the live server , but I was too lazy to update the diagram and it really does n't matter .
The controller for that view is called add_c.inc .
I tend to name files that the user loads directly as something .
html or something .
php and included files as something .inc .
The rest of the files in the presentation layer are common files that all views in my application would share .
ui.inc has the common user interface components , common.js contains Javascript helper functions that mostly call into the presentation platform libraries , and styles.css provides the stylesheet .
A common db.inc file implements the model .
I tend to use separate include files for each table in my database .
In this case there is a just single table called " items " , so I have a single items.inc file .
Input Filtering
You will notice a distinct lack of input filtering yet if you try to inject any sort of XSS it wo n't work .
This is because I am using the pecl / filter extension to automagically sanitize all user data for me .
View - add.html
Let 's start with the View in add.html :
The main thing to note here is that the majority of this file is very basic HTML .
No styles , or javascript and no complicated PHP .
It contains only simple presentation - level PHP logic .
A modulus operation toggles the colours for the rows of items , and a loop around a heredoc ( \ < \ < \<) block performs variable substitutions .
head ( ) and foot ( ) function calls add the common template headers and footers .
If you wanted to make it even cleaner you could use an auto_prepend_file configuration setting which tells PHP to always include a certain file at the top of your script .
Then you could take out the include calls and the initial head ( ) function call .
I tend to prefer less magic and to control my template dependencies right in my templates with a very clean and simple include structure .
Try to avoid using include_once and require_once if possible .
You are much better off using a straight include or require call , because the * _once ( ) calls are very slow under an opcode cache .
Sometimes there is no way around using these calls , but recognize that each one costs you an extra open ( ) syscall and hash look up .
ui.inc
Here is the UI helper code from ui.inc :
This file just contains the head ( ) and foot ( ) functions that contain mostly plain HTML .
I tend to drop out of PHP mode if I have big blocks of HTML with minimal variable substitutions .
You could also use heredoc blocks here , as we saw in add.html .
Controller - add_c.inc
Our Controller is in add_c.inc :
Our controller is going to manipulate the model , so it first includes the model files .
The controller then determines whether the request is a POST request , which means a backend request to deal with .
( You could do further checks to allow an empty POST to work like a GET , but I am trying to keep the example simple . )
The controller also sets the Content - Type to application / json before sending back JSON data .
Although this mime - type is not yet official so you might want to use application / x- json instead .
As far as the browser is concerned , it does n't care either way .
The controller then performs the appropriate action in the model according to the specified command .
A load_item , for example , ends up calling the load ( ) method in the data model for the items table and sends back a JSON - encoded response to the browser .
The important piece here is that the controller is specific to a particular view .
In some cases you may have a controller that can handle multiple very similar views .
Often the controller for a view is only a couple of lines and can easily be placed directly at the top of the view file itself .
common.js
Next I need to catch these JSON replies , which I do in common.js :
The postForm ( ) and postData ( ) functions demonstrate the genius of the Yahoo user interface libraries : they provide us with single - line functions to do our backend requests .
The fN function in the callback object does the bulk of the work , taking the JSON replies generated by our controller and manipulating the DOM in the browser in some way .
There are also fade ( ) and unfade ( ) functions that are called on status messages , and on validate errors to produce flashing red field effects .
Note the bottom half of this file where fancyItems ( ) and fancyForm ( ) implement all the client - side magic to animate the forms by attaching handlers to various events .
Often you will see server - side business logic nicely separated from the templates , but then there are big blocks of complicated client - side Javascript mixed into the template which in my opinion defeats the clean separation goal .
By going through and attaching appropriate mouseover , mouseout , focus , blur and click handlers after the fact I can keep my templates extremely clean and still get a very dynamic experience .
Here I am using the event library from the Yahoo ! user interface libraries to add the handlers .
Model - db.inc
Now for the model .
First the generic db.inc which applies to all our model components :
I am using sqlite via PDO for this example , so the connect ( ) function is quite simple .
The example also uses a fatal error function that provides a helpful backtrace for any fatal database error .
The backtrace includes all the arguments passed to the functions along the trace .
The load_list ( ) function uses an interesting trick : it uses APC 's apc_fetch ( ) function to fetch an array containing the list of item categories .
If the list is n't in shared memory , I read the file from disk and generate the array .
I have made it generic by using a variable variable .
If you call it with load_list ( ' categories ' ) , it automatically loads categories .
txt from the disk and creates a global array called $ categories .
Model - items.inc
Finally , I have the model code for the items table , items.inc :
At the top of each model file , I like to use a comment to record the schema of any associated tables .
I then provide a simple class with a couple of methods to manipulate the table : in this case , insert ( ) , modify ( ) and load ( ) .
Each function checks the database handle property to avoid reconnecting in case I have multiple calls on each request .
You could also handle this directly in your connect ( ) method .
To avoid an extra time syscall , I use $ _SERVER [ " REQUEST_TIME " ] to retrieve the request time .
I am also using PDO 's named parameters mechanism , which is cleaner than trying to use question mark placeholders .
Conclusion
Clean separation of your views , controller logic and backend model logic is easy to do with PHP .
Using these ideas , you should be able to build a clean framework aimed specifically at your requirements instead of trying to refactor a much larger and more complex external framework .
Many frameworks may look very appealing at first glance because they seem to reduce web application development to a couple of trivial steps leading to some code generation and often automatic schema detection , but these same shortcuts are likely to be your bottlenecks as well since they achieve this simplicity by sacrifizing flexibility and performance .
Nothing is going to build your application for you , no matter what it promises .
You are going to have to build it yourself .
Instead of starting by fixing the mistakes in some foreign framework and refactoring all the things that do n't apply to your environment spend your time building a lean and reusable pattern that fits your requirements directly .
In the end I think you will find that your homegrown small framework has saved you time and aggravation and you end up with a better product .
Barack Obama is dissing the baby boomers .
But he ’s doing it tactfully .
So he ’s got a wide range of people talking about generational issues in politics , and I ’m eagerly anticipating spillover into the workplace , which also needs this frank discussion .
One of the companies I founded was an online marketplace for city governments .
My business partner was a fiftysomething guy who had been dealing with city governments forever .
Our investors in the first round were all his friends , most were over 50 , and some assumed I was dating my partner because why else would he start a company with someone so young .
Investors treated me like it was an impossibility that I could have learned things fast enough to get into a room with them .
And one investor asked me to leave a meeting at such an inappropriate moment that even my partner was shocked .
Then , about a year later , when I was looking for a job , the guy I interviewed with said , “ Kids now think they can learn on the job and they do n’t need an MBA .
What do you think of that ? ”
I could n’t believe it :
He was calling me a kid in my job interview , even though I had already launched two companies .
He did this because he thinks it ’s culturally acceptable to treat someone like they do n’t know anything just because they ’re young .
I ’ve been holding off writing about Obama because the first ( and last ) time I took a leap into politics with my column was when I campaigned for Howard Dean , the week before he imploded .
I told myself I learned my lesson : Politics is too volatile for a workplace writer to forge a path through .
But here I am again .
Writing about politics .
Writing about Obama and hoping he does n’t implode next week .
I have to write about him because while this is not an official endorsement , when he talks about leading a new generation I get giddy over the idea that we could be wrestling ourselves out from under the clutch of the baby boomers .
Obama talks about teamwork and community and the end of the me - me - me in - fighting that has characterized the recent history of baby boomer politics .
A report in Newsday says :
“ Obama represents the transition from the Baby Boom to Generation X … He spoke of a post - boomer sensibility , of moving beyond the divisions exacerbated by undue self - focus . ”
I have this conversation with my ( baby boomer ) agent , and she says , “ Everything to you is about generations . ”
And okay , there ’s truth to that , but there ’s also some hot air , because the baby - boomer generation is so huge that everything has been about them by default .
I am from a generation that had very limited power to do anything , anywhere , except live in the wake of the boomers .
Even when it came to the Internet revolution in the 90’s , most of the people who got rich were the baby boomers who invested in companies that Gen - Xers operated .
This is why I get excited about Generation Y .
It ’s amazing to see this group , with all their demographic power , open up the world to change .
For the most part , I focus on change in the workplace .
There were a lot of things that my generation wanted at work — for example , flexible hours , personal growth and the abandonment of competitive , ego - focused hierarchy in favor of team work .
But we had trouble pushing through these workplace values because there were too few of us .
The baby boomers could always just say no .
But generation Y wants so many of those gen-X things , and generation Y has the demographic power to make it real .
It excites me to see this happen at work .
Obama is the political corollary .
Finally there are enough voters , maybe , to vote for someone who is not a baby boomer .
I do n’t know if it will happen .
But just that we ’re talking about it is exciting .
Because once we talk about baby boomers giving up control of politics , the talk of baby boomers giving up control of corporate life cannot be far behind .
But there ’s a workplace lesson from Obama as well .
He ’s very tactful as he disses the boomers .
He makes it clear that he is a bridge builder .
That he is respectful of the fact that everyone has a place in history .
And he is , above all , someone who has empathy for diverse backgrounds .
These are all the same kinds of skills we need in the workplace today .
We are all engaging in a generational discussion at work , even if it is not as overt as an interviewer calling you a kid .
We all come to the table with preconceptions and biases , but we all have to work together .
So , in the near future , at lest , it ’s the people who are best at building generational bridges who will succeed .
This is something I personally work on every day , and Obama is a great role model .
Gen Pinochet celebrated his 91st birthday last month
Gen Pinochet 's life
Gen Pinochet took power in a 1973 coup , and more than 3,000 people were killed or " disappeared " in his 17 - year rule .
He was accused of dozens of human rights abuses as well as fraud but poor health meant he never faced trial .
No state funeral or national mourning has been authorised .
He will be buried with military honours on Tuesday .
" The government has authorised flags to fly at half - mast at army facilities , " government spokesman Ricardo Lagos Weber said .
Thousands of anti-Pinochet protesters took to the streets in the centre of the capital , Santiago , with tear gas and water cannon used to disperse crowds .
Cheering opponents of Gen Pinochet attempted to reach the presidential palace , but found police barring their way .
Sporadic clashes broke out , with Chilean TV showing images of fires burning along one of the city 's main avenues .
What saddens me is that this criminal has died without having been sentenced
Hugo Gutierrez
Human rights lawyer
Reactions to death
Santiago 's military hospital said Gen Pinochet passed away at 1415 local time ( 1715GMT ) .
Hospital spokesman Dr Juan Ignacio Vergara said that shortly beforehand , he " suffered grave and unexpected setbacks " requiring him to be moved into intensive care unit .
" We administered all the possible procedures but were not able to resuscitate the general , " Dr Vergara said .
" He died surrounded by his family . "
After last week 's acute heart attack , the general underwent a procedure to unblock an artery , and received the last rites from a Catholic priest .
HAVE YOUR SAY I hope my country can find peace after his death .
Reconciliation is the key

Chilean newspaper La Tercera de la Hora
Online says dozens of supporters who had been keeping a vigil outside the hospital were weeping and praying following the general 's death .
It is expected they will be joined by other supporters as the news spreads .
' Loved by many '
Opponents have expressed anger that Gen Pinochet died without justice being done over the charges that had been brought .
Despite his human rights record , the general had staunch supporters
" What saddens me is that this criminal has died without having been sentenced and I believe the responsibility the state bears in this has to be considered " , human rights lawyer Hugo Gutierrez told La Tercera Online .
Despite his human rights record , many Chileans loved him and said he saved the country from Marxism .
But even many loyal supporters abandoned him after it became clear in 2004 that he had stolen about $ 27 m in secret offshore bank accounts that were under investigation at the time of his death , the BBC's Daniel Schweimler says .
There were also allegations that Gen Pinochet and his son Marco Antonio Pinochet made money from cocaine smuggling , charges which the family denied .
' Political responsibility '
In September 1973 , Gen Pinochet led the armed forces in a dramatic coup against the democratically elected Marxist government of Salvador Allende .
Close to the end of my days , I want to make clear that I hold no rancour towards anybody , that I love my country above all else
Recent Pinochet statement
The violence of the uprising and the oppression that followed shook the world .
He went on to become one of South America 's best - known military rulers of the 1970s and 80s .
Earlier in November , Gen Pinochet was placed under house arrest over the abduction of two people in 1973 .
The charges - the latest in a series - related to the Caravan of Death , a military operation to remove opponents of his rule .
In a statement read by his wife on his 91st birthday , Gen Pinochet said he accepted " political responsibility " for acts committed during his rule .
" Today , close to the end of my days , I want to make clear that I hold no rancour towards anybody , that I love my country above all else , " his statement said .
Še vedno mislimo , da se to nam ne more zgoditi ?
Da se to dogaja le za okvirji TV zaslonov ali nam ostaja na rokah le kot črn made ž od tiska jutranjih tiskovin , kjer prebiramo tragične zgodbe in odkimavamo z glavami , medtem ko se nam ježi koža ?
Ne morem pozabiti zgodbe , ki sem jo slišala nekaj dni nazaj .
Pretresla me je v dno .
Želim to deliti z vami .
Zgodi se namreč lahko prav čisto vsakemu izmed nas – kjerkoli in kadarkoli .
Mlad slovenski par nakupuje v okoliških trgovinicah kitajske četrti v Trstu .
Dekle ogleduje izdelke in izbira kaj bo nesla s seboj v garderobo .
Fant ji malo naveličan potoži , da se mu ne da postavati po trgovini z njo , ter da jo počaka zunaj .
Vse lepo in prav .
Mine že nekaj časa , čaka in čaka , nato fant že naveličan stopi v trgovino po svoje dekle .
Ni je .
Nikjer .
Sprašuje prodajalce , kam je šla njegova punca , vsi odkimavajo z glavo in skomigajo z rameni .
Nihče nič ne ve .
Kot , da se ni nič zgodilo .
Kot , da je nikdar ni bilo tam .
Fant zbegan .
Išče , sprašuje in prestrašen ne odneha … “ Kje je moja punca ? ! ” .
Preišče trgovino , a za njegovo punco nobene sledi .
Pokliče policijo in ta tudi pride na kraj dogodka .
Preiščejo trgovino , nakar po nekem času v kletnem prostoru pod garderobo , kjer se pomerjajo oblačila le odkrijejo punco – zvezano in z zalepljenim usti .
Če bi fanta zamotili le za trenutek , bi bila deklica lahko danes sam bog ve kje – če bi sploh še Bila .
Scenarij bi lahko bil bolj črn od črnega .
Lahko bi bi bila žrtev prisilnega dela , suženjstva , prostitucije , trgovine z organi , tkivi , krvjo ali še kaj drugega , kar si težko zamislimo in kar nam predstavlja nepredstavljivo grozo , ko v vlogo žrtve postavimo sebe ali svoje najbližje .
Jaz sem isti trenutek podoživela vse garderobe omenjene četrti v katerih sem ničkolikokrat bila in vest mi ne da miru , da tega ne sporočim naprej .
Če bo en sam samcat posameznik zato bolj pazljiv ali morda celo preprečil tragično zgodbo , sem storila več kot si sploh lahko predstavljam .
Vse kar počnem je sporočanje , da sami lahko veliko naredimo za svojo varnost , ter za varnost svojih najbližjih .
Da smo še pred zapletom lahko velikokrat sami največji varuh svojega Dostojanstva in Človeške nedotakljivosti .
Trgovina z ljudmi pa je sicer splošno zapleten in obsežen pojav
V Centru za boj proti trgovini z ljudmi – KLJUČ ( spletna stran je vidim še v pripravi ) so že leta 2003 ( vsaj od takrat ga imam jaz ) pripravili gradivo z namenom ozave ščanja ljudi , saj se v Sloveniji o tem občutno premalo govori .
Prepričana sem , da velika večina mladih deklet ali fantov v kritičnem trenutku nebi vedela , kam se v paniki obrniti po pomoč .
Naj podam vsaj kak šno informacijo ali dve iz omenjenega gradiva
– avtor Jurij Popov in Društvo Ključ ;
Splošne značilnosti pojava trgovine z ljudmi
trgovina z ljudmi je globalen pojav , ki dobiva vedno večje razsežnosti
seksualna industrija se je razmahnila do te mere , do so vse pogostejši predlogi , naj bi jo spoznali ( in priznali ) kot pomembo gospodarsko panogo mnogih državnih ekonomij ; v nekaterih državah ( Tajska ) so namreč skupne pošiljke denarja prisilnih prostitutk kot pomoč družinam večje kot proračunska sredstva državnih razvojnih skladov
globalizacija je olajšala gibanje ljudi , kapitala in poslov prek državnih meja ; postalo je enostavnejše in hitrejše
gospodarske in politične spremembe znotraj posameznih držav in na mednarodni ravni so zaostrile razlike med bogatimi in revnimi , na primer v Srednji in Vzhodni Evropi
globalna feminizacija revščine je vplivala na feminizacijo migracij
s trgovino z belim blagom ( ljudmi ) se ukvarja skoraj izključno mednarodno organiziran kriminal
Post Scriptum I
V gradivu prevladuje pozornost najbolj vulgarni manifestaciji trgovine z ljudmi – trgovini z dekleti in ženskami za ponujanje spolnih storitev .
Gre namreč za prevladujočo obliko izrabljanja žrtev trgovine z belim blagom , saj je po neuradnih ocenah več kot 90 % žrtev tovrstne trgovine namenjenih hitro naraščajoči seksualni industriji .
Čeprav je trgovanje z ljudmi z namenom spolnega izkoriščanja prevladujoče , drugih oblik izkoriščanja žrtev trgovine z belim blagom ne smemo zanemariti .
Sem sodita tudi trgovina z otroki ter trgovina s člove škimi organi in krvjo .
Prisilna dela otrok in odraslih kot hišnih pomočnic in pomočnikov , dela na poljih , plantažah , v rudnih , ter podjetjih kjer njihove razmere komaj omogočajo preživetje .
Izpostavljeni so nasilju , plačil ni ali pa so mizerna .
Razširjenost
Trgovina z ljudmi je danes svetovni problem , ki je iz leta v leto hujši .
Na sto tisoče ljudi je ugrabljenih , zavedenih , ogoljufanih , prodanih , trpinčenih in spravljenih v suženjsko ali temu podobno izkoriščevalsko stanje .
Pojav uhaja nadzoru .
Organi pregona so vse bolj nemočni , saj ugotavljajo , da razbitje ene kriminalne združbe prodajalcev in preprodajalcev porodi deset novih .
Po podatkih Organizacije združenih narodov , Mednarodne organizacije za migracije in mnogih neodvisnih raziskovalnih ustanov se armada trgovine z ljudmi poveča vsako leto za približno 4 milijone ljudi .
Od teh je vsako leto v Zahodno Evropo prepeljanih petsto tisoč ljudi .
Največ sodobnih suženj in sužnjev dela v spolni industriji ( 90 - 95 % ) .
Uporabljajo jih tudi za beračenje , za lažne poroke , za delo v tekstilni industriji , rudnikih , gospodinjstvih in kmetijstvu , ter kot žrtve trgovanja s člove škimi organi in krvjo .
Slovenija se v mednarodni trgovini z ljudmi v vseh treh oblikah , kar pomeni kot :
država izvora – je za približno sto mladih Slovenk ( ’03 ) , ki služijo predvsem na trgih s spolnostjo nekaterih zahodnoevropskih držav ( Nemčija , Belgija , Španija , Nizozemska , … ) .
Dekleta so bila zvečine spravljena v suženjsko razmerje v času , ko so bile še mladoletne in so polnoletnost doživele na zahodnoevropskih ulicah strasti .
država tranzita – za približno tisoč petsto do dvatisoč petsto deklet predvsem iz Jugozahodne Evrope in balkanskih držav , ki prek naše države potujejo na zahodne trge s spolnostjo .
V suženjsko razmerje so bile spravljene še pred zakonitim , večinoma pa nezakonitem prestopu naših meja .
V takih primerih gre za tihotapljenje deklet , ki v večini primerov ne vedo , da so namenjene prostituciji .
končna destinacija – za približno tistoč petsto deklet predvsem iz Jugozahodne Evrope in balkana , pa tudi za ženske in dekleta iz Jugovzhodne Azije .
V Sloveniji je namreč več kot sedemdeset nočnih lokalov v katerih delajo predvsem dekleta iz Ukrajine , Moldavije , Romunije , Bolgarije , …
Vsi , ki boste to , ali kak šno podobno gradivo prebrali – priporočite ga še drugim .
V Centru Ključ in podobnih ustanovah se trudijo , da bi ljudje sploh vedeli , kaj trgovina z belim blagom pomeni , kako si lahko pomagamo , kako naj ukrepamo , če pride do kritične situacije , kakšne so naše pravice in kakšne so oblike pomoči žrtvam .
土木工事の現場や水害などの自然災害の被災地の時に欠かせないのが、土をいれた袋の「土のう」。
先日、そ の「土のう」を作る道具があるというのを初めて知った。しかも、「土のう製作器」が作られたのは1997年とつい最近のことなのである。21世紀になろうというのに今まで人力だけで作っていたというから驚きだ。これは、話を聞かねばなるまいとさっそく製造元のビー・ビー・ダブリュー（本社：島根県）に話を聞いてみることにした。
「 『土のう』は普通二人一組になって一人が袋の口を開いて持って、もう一人がスコップで土を入れて作るんですけど、結構キツイ作業です。国交省の資料でも土のう作りの単価は一日二人で100個とかでと計算されていて、そんなに一度にたくさん作れるものではないんです。でも、当社の製作器、「ビー・ビー・ワーカー」を使えば一人で一日7時間の作業で640個作れます。私が実際に作業をして出した数字なのでこれは間違いはありません」
と営業部長の本田さん。
「 ビー・ビー・ワーカー」のしくみを簡単に説明すると、土を入れる袋を口を広げたまま置けるように底の抜けた四角い筒と枠を組みあせたもので、袋を固定して土砂を投入、枠を引き上げれば土砂の詰まった袋が出来上がるとういうもの。後は袋の口を紐で縛れば完成だ。なーんだ、ただの枠じゃない、と思われる方もいるかもしれないが、こういったものが今まで全く考えられてこなかったというのが、不思議といえば不思議だ。
「そうなんですよ。単純なだけに作る道具は考えられてこなかったようです。土のうは日本だけでなく世界各国で使われていますが、よその国でも土のう作りの苦労は同じようです。昨年の6月にドイツで行われた防災用品の見本市でも各国に注目されました。みなさん『ブラボー !
』とか『ズーバー! 』とか言って拍手喝采してくれました。特に近年ヨーロッパでは水害が多く、災害の記憶が新しいだけに大変高い評価を受けました」
と本田さんは言う 。
「 自治体などでも使って頂いています。実は土のうは作り置きができないんです。土のうは大量に使うものなので、コスト面を考えて袋に使うビニールも比較的劣化しやすいものが多いんですよ。だから、使う直前に短期間に一斉に作らなければいけないんです」
「 口で説明するよりも、実際に作っているところを見ていただいた方が分かりやすいので、防災訓練などで実演もさせていただいていますし、HP上でも動画でご覧いただけます。土のう作りは成人の男性だけの仕事のように思われますが、これがあれば、女性やお子さんでも簡単にできます」
と本田さん。イベントで土のう作り競争をやったところ、これが結構盛り上がったとか。こんな風に楽しみながらでも土のう作りを体験しておけば、防災意識も高まりそうだ。
実は本田さん自身、200個の土のうをビー・ビー・ワーカーを使って、一時間37分で作ったという記録を持っていて、名刺には「世界最速
土のう製作士」の肩書きを持っている。本田さん、結構お茶目です。
ちなみに、土のう袋には土砂は80%だけ入れる。こうすると、袋がフレキシブルに変形してどんな場所にも収まるのだそうだ。単純なものほど、使い道が多い、ということでしょうか。（こや）

One of the reasons the network neutrality debate is so murky is that relatively few people understand the mechanics of traffic discrimination .
I think that in reasoning about net neutrality it helps to understand how discrimination would actually be put into practice .
That ’s what I want to explain today .
Do n’t worry , the details are n’t very complicated .
Think of the Internet as a set of routers ( think : metal boxes with electronics inside ) connected by links ( think : long wires ) .
Packets of data get passed from one router to another , via links .
A packet is forwarded from router to router , until it arrives at its destination .
Focus now on a single router .
It has several incoming links on which packets arrive , and several outgoing links on which it can send packets .
When a packet shows up on an incoming link , the router will figure out ( by methods I wo n’t describe here ) on which outgoing link the packet should be forwarded .
If that outgoing link is free , the packet can be sent out on it immediately .
But if the outgoing link is busy transmitting another packet , the newly arrived packet will have to wait – it will be “ buffered ” in the router ’s memory , waiting its turn until the outgoing link is free .
Buffering lets the router deal with temporary surges in traffic .
But if packets keep showing up faster than they can be sent out on some outgoing link , the number of buffered packets will grow and grow , and eventually the router will run out of buffer memory .
At that point , if one more packet shows up , the router has no choice but to discard a packet .
It can discard the newly arriving packet , or it can make room for the new packet by discarding something else .
But something has to be discarded .
( This is one illustration of the “ best effort ” principle , which is one of the clever engineering decisions that made the Internet feasible .
The Internet will do its best to deliver each packet promptly , but it does n’t make any guarantees .
It ’s up to software that uses the Internet Protocol to detect dropped packets and recover .
The software you ’re using to retrieve these words can , and probably often does , recover from dropped packets . )
When a router is forced to discard a packet , it can discard any packet it likes .
One possibility is that it assigns priorities to the packets , and always discards the packet with lowest priority .
The technology does n’t constrain how packets are prioritized , as long as there is some quick way to find the lowest - priority packet when it becomes necessary to discard something .
This mechanism defines one type of network discrimination , which prioritizes packets and discards low - priority packets first , but only discards packets when that is absolutely necessary .
I ’ll call it minimal discrimination , because it only discriminates when it ca n’t serve everybody .
With minimal discrimination , if the network is not crowded , lots of low - priority packets can get through .
Only when there is an unavoidable conflict with high - priority packets is a low - priority packet inconvenienced .
Contrast this with another , more drastic form of discrimination , which discards some low - priority packets even when it is possible to forward or deliver every packet .
A network might , for example , limit low - priority packets to 20 % of the network ’s capacity , even if part of the other 80 % is idle .
I ’ll call this non-minimal discrimination .
One of the basic questions to ask about any network discrimination regime is whether it is minimal in this sense .
And one of the basic questions to ask about any rule limiting discrimination is how it applies to minimal versus non-minimal discrimination .
We can imagine a rule , for example , that allows minimal discrimination but limits or bans non-minimal discrimination .
This distinction matters , I think , because minimal and non-minimal discrimination are supported by different arguments .
Minimal discrimination may be an engineering necessity .
But non-minimal discrimination is not technologically necessary – it makes service worse for low - priority packets , but does n’t help high - priority packets – so it could only be justified by a more complicated economic argument , for example that non-minimal discrimination allows forms of price discrimination that increase social welfare .
Vague arguments that you have to reserve some fraction of capacity for some purpose wo n’t cut it .
[ Postscript for networking geeks :
You might complain that it matters not only which packets are dropped but also which packets are forwarded first , and so on .
True enough .
I simplified things a bit to fit within a blog post ; but it should be fairly obvious how to expand the principle I ’m describing here to deal with the issues you ’re raising . ]
Protesters across the country sent a message to the new U.S. Congress today :
The people want the war to end .
Here are photos from the San Francisco protest and march :

The ability to drill under the surface is a " must have "
It aims to send a single robot rover to the Martian surface along with another , stationary , science package .
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) had also been considering a mission concept from the British team behind Beagle 2 , but this is no longer on the table .
However , the Beagle team could yet see their science instruments , or ones derived from them , carried on the 580 - million - euro mobile laboratory .
A three - day meeting next week at the space agency 's European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk , the Netherlands , will discuss what experiments the craft should take to Mars , and the UK team has submitted its own ideas and proposals .
Two - pronged mission
Their BeagleNet concept for the mission - which envisaged dropping two small rovers on the planet - has fallen out of the running and Esa has opted instead for the single rover concept loosely referred to as ExoMars .
The Mars lander is part of Esa 's Aurora programme , a long - term plan for robotic and - potentially - human exploration of the Solar System , with Mars , the Moon and the asteroids as likely targets .
Esa is no longer entertaining the BeagleNet concept
" The fixed station and / or the rover may contain elements of a Beagle 2 - type payload .
Whether it does or not is very much dependent on the discussions next week . "
A primary objective of the mission is to search for signs of past or present life ; it will leave Earth in June 2011 and arrive at Mars in June 2013 .
Vital tools
Esa is currently aiming at a mass of 120kg for the rover and 8 - 14kg for the science payload , said Dr Sims .
" Must haves " for the rover payload include a drill or " mole " for burrowing beneath the Martian soil and an experiment for detecting past or present life , in addition to the other instruments .
EUROPE'S MISSION TO MARS
To leave Kourou , French Guiana , spaceport in 2011 Will launch on Russian - built Soyuz - Fregat vehicle Planetary positions account for long journey time Landing date will avoid worst of duststorm season US may be asked to provide orbital relay of data Could employ parachutes , airbags and retro-rockets
The European agency is looking at using US spacecraft in orbit around Mars to relay data from the lander to Earth .
In return , US instruments could be placed on the mission 's science payload .
It had also planned to seek American hardware for the lander 's entry , descent and landing systems .
But this has fallen foul of US budget limitations and a legal regime there known as Itar ( International Traffic in Arms Regulations ) .
The Itar export regulations are designed to protect sensitive military technology falling into the wrong hands .
But they also apply to satellite technology , including entry , descent and landing systems .
Collaboration talks
Despite Esa 's decision to go with the ExoMars concept , there may yet be hope for BeagleNet .
Professor Colin Pillinger , lead scientist on the Beagle 2 mission , is still convinced of the merits of a small twin rover mission .
He and colleagues have started informal discussions with other space agencies about the possibility of a joint collaboration based on just such a concept .
Dr Sims said there could be openings in Nasa 's robotic exploration programme for such a project , in particular a low - cost " scout " mission opportunity scheduled for launch in 2011 .
However , this would be in open competition with US teams .
The outcome of discussions next week on the science package for Europe 's Martian rover mission will go to the Aurora programme board and other Esa bodies for approval .
The agency 's member states will then have to sign off the mission .
Ministers will have their say when the Esa Council meets on 5 and 6 December .
A recent trip to the U.S. turned into a harrowing experience for a Lakehead University student , who claims he was detained for more than 12 hours and interrogated like a suspected terrorist .
And because his computer laptop was also seized , which had most of his school material and assignments on it , the incident might have cost him his school semester and future career .
“ I felt insulted .
I felt frightened .
I felt very , very weak , ” said 22 - year - old Mahmoud Zeitoun .
“ That depression was the highest amount of depression of my life . ”
The Lebanese - born man , who always held Canadian citizenship through his parents , was headed to Denver with local dentist Jennifer Lee and an assistant on Thursday .
Zeitoun was supposed to act as Lee ’s patient while she performed an exam to practise in her field in the U.S .
While enroute at Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport at 8:30 in the morning , Zeitoun says they were initially questioned normally as to why they were entering the U.S. and about Zeitoun ’s planned return on Tuesday .
But Zeitoun claims U.S. officials told him he could only enter the U.S. on the condition that he departs the U.S. through major ports between 7:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. — a restriction which conflicted with his planned return time on Tuesday .
He asked to speak with a supervisor , and after a deeper look into his case , was apparently told that he needed a visa to enter the country .
Canadians travelling to the U.S. are not normally required to possess visas , unless they are visiting for work purposes .
Lee and the other companion left on their next flight , and it is not known if the dentist found a replacement patient for her exam .
But instead of letting Zeitoun , who holds a Canadian passport , return to Canada , they apparently detained him for a 12 1/2 - hour ordeal that felt to him like “ straight torture . ”
Zeitoun , a Muslim , was made to sit in an interrogation room all day , facing questions about whether he has ties to the Lebanese group Hezbollah , or knows anyone who has hatred towards the U.S .
“ ‘ What do you think of suicide bombers ? ’ ” Zeitoun said , recalling the interrogators ’ questions .
“ ‘ You think it ’s right , right ?
If you tell us anything , we ’ll let you in . ’
“ I ’m like , ‘ Please .
I am a citizen here in Canada .
Then you are coming to talk to me about people I do n’t know , ’ ” Zeitoun recalled .
He claims the officials at the airport also checked his luggage and seized his $ 3,000 laptop with no guarantee of its return .
It had everything he needed to complete his semester courses in science and engineering at Lakehead University this semester .
“ This will bring me to an F , ” said Zeitoun , who is also the president the Lakehead University Muslim Student Association , which has about 40 members .
He claims U.S. interrogators also asked him to show his Hotmail e-mail account , and allegedly made threats that they would put him in a “ cell , ” Zeitoun said .
Zeitoun says two years ago he was held for about five hours at the U.S. border crossing at Sault Ste.
Marie , which he claims was due to nothing more than his Lebanese birthplace .
He claims he told the border agents there that he really wanted to turn around rather then enter , changing his mind mid-way because he realized it would take longer to drive through to Thunder Bay .
But they detained him anyways , and later apologized for the “ inconvenience . ”
Zeitoun says they marked him as rejected from entering the U.S. — a detail he only learned of during his detention in Minneapolis .
Zeitoun says he was not given food in Minneapolis until much later in the afternoon , and says he was allowed to call his brother Adnan in Windsor early in the evening .
The brother contacted LU sociology professor Walid Chahal .
Chahal contacted a Canadian national security investigator , who after a short call to a “ friend ” in the U.S. , called back to Chahal to tell him Zeitoun would be released by 9 p.m. on Thursday .
Zeitoun and Chahal suspect the Canadian investigator , who they did not identify but both claim to know , helped speed up Zeitoun ’s release .
Chahal once taught Zeitoun at Lakehead University and says he is a “ good person ” who “ likes to help . ”
He said Zeitoun is a victim of racial profiling .
“( The U.S. border agents ) did n’t find anything on ( Zeitoun ) the first time or the second time , ” Chahal said .
He blames Zeitoun ’s alleged ordeal on U.S. border security policies , which he claims leads “ innocent civilians ” into the kind of treatment Zeitoun says he received .
Chahal claims people are susceptible of being treated as if they are “ guilty without being tried ” at U.S. border crossings if their name or appearance stereotypically resembles an Arab or Muslim .
“ So this is a problem , with racial profiling , anyone can be a target , ” he said .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in Minneapolis were contacted by The Chronicle - Journal on Saturday , and were told by “ Officer Jackson ” to call back Monday to speak to press representatives .
Jackson said he “ ca n’t speak on behalf of this case . ”
He said detentions of Canadians lasting as long as Zeitoun ’s are “ not normal . ”
Top 10 Free Linux Games
Date : September 19 , 2006
Author(s ) : Rob Williams
If you think that there are no great games for Linux , think again !
We are taking a look at 10 of some of the most popular Linux games … that just so happen to be completely free !
Introduction
If you use Linux as your primary OS , then you already understand why it is so great .
But , do you game on it ?
Ever try to convert your Windows friends to Linux ?
More times than not , the dreaded first question is , “ Can I game on it ? ”
For some reason , there is a constant mindset that there are not many games for Linux when in fact there are many .
I do n’t mean the small ones that are included with GNOME or KDE , but full blown projects that deliver captivating and deep game play experiences .
There are even a few good commercial games out there for Linux , but that ’s not the topic of today ’s article .
Instead , we have put together a top 10 list of free games you should have installed .
With the help of the Gentoo and Ubuntu forums , we have thrown together what I believe to be a solid list of 10 .
Shouts out also to Michael of Phoronix and Susan of Tuxmachines for their help also !
So how does a game make this top 10 list ?
Well , from 10 – 1 , they have all been listed according to how many votes the game received .
Though there were around 50 games total that were brought up in forum posts , most only had a single vote .
Even our # 10 had only four votes , so it ’s obvious that the top games are there for a reason .
In order to qualify for the list , the game had to meet these requirements :
Has to be 100 % free … no strings attached .
Cannot require wine to run .
Open Source not a requirement .
Installation must be painless .
Cannot be an add - on to a commercial game .
We can learn a lot from this simple top 10 .
First , a game does n’t have to have incredible graphics in order to be fun .
That ’s well known by many already , and proven by this list .
Puzzle games are some of the easiest to get into , so they prove quite popular .
For a more immersive experience , FPS games are a top genre , especially for online multi-player fun .
Actually , FPS games proved so popular , that 4/10 of the games listed today are just that .
One thing that really stood out to me here was the fact that 8 out of all 10 of these games , are also available for Windows and other platforms .
That says a lot .
Most of the games were first developed for Linux then ported over to Windows / Mac OS X .
It would be great to see the opposite effect happen though .
Even with the large amount of games available for Linux , the total count would be scary to look at when compared to Windows .
You may wonder about the lack of images on this page … that ’s because this is a top 10 list and I did n’t want to spoil any ‘ surprise ’ that could possibly come from this list .
So , without further ado , let ’s check out # 10 and # 9 .
Also … do n’t check out the drop down menu unless you want all of the titles revealed to you early :)
# 10 KMahjongg , # 9 America ’s Army
# 10 KMahjongg
To start things off , we have a classic Chinese puzzle game at number 10 .
Classic in the sense that it ’s well over 100 years old !
After creation , the game quickly spread out of China and become popular the world over .
Like Solitaire , it can be played by yourself , which is a huge draw .
KMahjongg is one of the many games that are bundled with KDE base , so if you have KDE you will likely already have it .
It can be played through other desktop environments in addition though .
The game is not pretty to look at … very circa 1997 , but it has the core elements you ’ve come to expect with the game of Mahjongg in general .
If you personally have not lost hours upon hours to this game , the idea is simple .
All of the tiles are arranged according to some preset template , which are many .
You progress by matching a tile with another .
However , both of the tiles must be exposed on the left or right side .
That is to say , that the tile does not have another tile blocking both sides .
As an example , you can check out the first shot below .
On the Eastern and Western side of the board is a piece with seven small bamboo sticks on it .
Since both pieces have an exposed side , these can be removed from the board .
Each game is timed , although that ’s more for personal records .
The goal is to complete the board as fast as you can , really .
Though you do n’t have to … it ’s up to you whether you want a relaxing game or a frantic one .
There is an assortment of various layouts and tilesets here , but they are limited .
Overall , this is a core version of Mahjongg .
If you wish for better graphics , there are other variants available .
In the end , KMahjongg proves to be a winner .
It ’s a small game , and simple , but can be enjoyed by anyone .
Setting personal goals of trying to beat a round as fast as you can , can make you feel smarter .
I know I ’ve stared at the board for five minutes when a move was clearly there .
I am not a quick responder :-)
So if you like Mahjongg or tile games in general , make sure this is installed !
Game Information Title : KMahjongg
Genre : Tile Game
Open Source : Yes

# 9 Americas Army
It ’s not too often you can say you are playing a game put out by the United States Government , but Americas Army is just that .
This began not only as a game , but a tool to train future army recruits .
The US Army probably did n’t expect the game to quickly explode into a popular online stature though .
The game follows a rather serious theme due to its original and current goals , but it ’s also a blast for players who have no desire to join the army .
Other similar games on the market cost money while AA is free .
But there ’s a catch .
As of version 2.5 , AA was discontinued for Linux and Mac OS X , although it does n’t seem to affect the training missions or playing with other 2.5 clients .
So , this makes it great for a Linux AA clan , or a LAN party .
The game is based on the Unreal 2.5 engine , so you can expect some great graphics and sound .
If you have played Counter - Strike , then you already have a good feel of what AA is all about .
It ’s you , against the terrorist .
There is no deathmatch mode , as that is not exactly the goal of the game ;-)
Of course , moreso than Counter - Strike , there is a lot of strategy you must execute to be successful .
The game is based off what could happen in real life , so it ’s not going to be easy .
Splinter Cell could be a name brought up , as the stealth in that game would prove useful here .
As you can guess , the game is focused around realism , and so you cannot jump in and expect a Counter - Strike or Unreal Tournament gameplay .
You must shoot accurately if you want to kill … spray and pray does n’t really work well here .
This is a great game , no two ways about it .
It ’s just too bad the developers decided to halt Linux and OS X support .

# 8 Armagetron Advanced , # 7 Cube
Who does n’t love Tron ?
Admit it , you do .
Tron is a prime example of killer gameplay that does n’t need superb graphics to be fun .
Armagetron Advanced does nothing amazing to the Tron - like style games , but what it does do , it does well .
The game does n’t have good graphics , although they are very clean in high resolutions .
The sound is nothing major either , but works well with the Tron theme .
You may think I am bashing the game , but far from it .
The game focuses on simplicity , and fun .
It does both well .
For those unaware of what Tron is .. it ’s a game that takes place on a massive grid , with all characters on speed bikes that leave behind light trails .
The trails left are solid so it ’s effectively a wall .
The goal is to get the opposing player to run into the wall created , by caving them in .
Simple idea , but it can get hectic once the room starts filling up and you are left with little space to move around in .
Armagetron Advanced includes local play , LAN play and even online play .
I joined a server within half a minute and was playing a few seconds later .
There was no lag to speak of at all , and of course I was the first one to lose .
There are a few different modes of play including Deathmatch , Team DM , Fortress and Sumo .
So , there is some actual depth here , despite the simple look .
There ’s just no sense in getting too in - depth describing this game , because I ’d have to start making things up .
Though simple , this is a great game and should be in your menu for quick access ;-)

# 7 Cube 2 ( Sauerbraten )
One thing you will notice with this top 10 list , is that four of the games are FPS .
It goes to show that these are some of the most favored out there , and it ’s no surprise given the graphic and online capabilities .
Cube is one of these , for multiple reasons .
First , it ’s a game that ’s incredibly quick and easy to get into .
After running the start script , you are literally standing in the game ready to go , within seconds .
For whatever reason though , you are begun with a low resolution , but that ’s easily changeable .
In addition , sound will work right off the bat ( hopefully ) with little or no configuration .
I have not run into a single problem with running this game in the past , and that ’s almost a rarity in Linux gaming .
One thing to note though , is that Cube is actually the game engine , but has a game strapped to it .
Or so it seems .
If you enjoy what you see here and are a game developer , you can grab the engine and create something with it .
It ’s a rather solid engine also… reminiscent of the Quake 1 engine , but more feature - rich .
As you can see by these screenshots , the graphics are gorgeous , and runs extremely smooth .
Sauerbraten is for the most part , an online deathmatch style FPS , but has a single player experience in the works .
So when you first enter , you can join an online DM session , or play the SP mode which is denoted with a ( WIP ) label .
So , it ’s directly meant for deathmatch at this point in time .
In progress also is a Cube 2 based RPG game , which is sure to have great potential .
It will be a single player experience , and by the screenshots thus far , it could prove to be a winner .
What I enjoy most about Sauerbraten , is that while low on actual SP content and the like , it ’s a well put together package .
The graphics are great and so is the sound , although some of the effects are somewhat bizarre .
Aside from that , there is some tight gameplay here .
I compare this game more to Quake 1 than I would with Nexuiz because of its smooth , fast and accurate gameplay .
However , I discovered quite soon after jumping into the online arenas that I suck .
So … maybe you will have better luck than I ;-)

# 6 Pingus , # 5 Neverball
Puzzle games have proven to be one of the most popular genres around , so it ’s no surprise that the market is littered with such games .
Not only that , but some of the true classics , we have seen recreated and updated time and time again .
Not only by the official companies , but by fans also .
Pingus , if you cannot already tell , is based off the ultra-popular Lemmings game .
When it originally came out in the early 90’s , I am sure the developers did not expect it to catch on so rapidly !
Pingus is a true recreation and retains all of the core elements .
It has pretty graphics and great sound … it ’s a well put together package .
Of course lemmings wo n’t do in a Linux game , so we have mindless penguins to deal with !
You have a bunch of penguins on the loose that really do n’t know how to think for themselves .
So , they run into walls , walk off cliffs , et cetera .
You must tell them what to do , whether it be dig or float .
The goal is to safely guide all of your penguins into the exit , which just so happens to be an igloo .
Sounds simple , but it gets challenging quick .
In order to succeed , you must use strategy and actually ponder your moves .
You cannot just jump in and randomly click , or you will lose .
The game looks great , it really does .
It has a fixed resolution of 800*600 though , which I found to be way to small for this game .
I found myself having to mouse around the entire screen often , and it just became a chore .
1024*768 would have been a lot better .
If you get bored with the ~ 20 included levels , there is an included level editor to allow you to create your own , and to share .
Many levels can be downloaded from this unofficial resource .
So , it ’s no doubt this game has some longevity .
Many of the downloadable levels use new graphics and textures to keep things interesting .
If you are a fan of Lemmings or any strategic puzzle game , you will want to check Pingus out .

# 5 Neverball & Neverputt
If you enjoy playing with balls , then Neverball should be right up your alley .
The game is quite similar to Super Monkey Ball for the Nintendo Gamecube , so if you ’ve played that , then you know what to expect here .
The game premise is simple … you have a ball and are required to move it around the level collecting a set amount of coins .
Once done , you must make it safely to the finishing portal .
It sounds simple , because for the most part … it is .
The game is divided into three difficulties , the first being the easiest .
It really is … because you can storm through all twenty levels there in good time .
Once finishing that difficulty , you are left with the “ Hmm this game is not so hard . ” mindset .
Of course , that ’s until you begin the next difficulty , then you suddenly realize that this is a game that tests your coordination , and patience .
Each level has a time limit , so you ca n’t just dilly dally around and watch the level beat itself .
The game is entirely controlled by the mouse as you can imagine , and the camera view is constantly close to the ball .
I hoped to have an option of zooming out a tad , but there was none .
You are however , able to edit the configuration file to your liking .
It would have been nice to have this accomplished through in - game options though .
You are also able to save and replay your runs , for personal reasons or for a clear way to brag to your friends .
As you can likely tell by the screenshots , the game has incredibly clean graphics , full of eye candy .
So , you will need a decent video card and CPU if you wish to play the game at its smoothest .
Neverball is almost like two games in one though , because Neverputt is also included .
It runs on the same engine , but is a mini - golf game .
It supports two players , so it ’s some great fun with a friend .
Overall , Neverball is a classic that ’s quick to get into whenever you need a quick break .

# 4 Nexuiz , # 3 Enemy Territory
Nexuiz proves to be one of the most popular open source FPS games on Linux , and for good reason .
The game engine used is DarkPlaces , which is a heavily modified Quake 1 engine .
That ’s evident in the graphics .
If you ’ve ever played Quake 1 deathmatch , then you are aware that it was one of the pioneers in what it did .
Jump in , have some quick fun and log oback out .
Personally , it was the first game that I played online quite often .
Nexuiz tries to go back to those roots , and delivers for the most part .
The first thing you will notice about the game is that it ’s gorgeous … the graphics are amazing , considering the engine it ’s based on .
It includes a lot of eye candy … even HDR !
So , this is one game that will actually take full use of your high - end graphics card if you have one .
The premise of the game is simple .
Jump in , kick some ass .
Rinse and repeat .
There is a large array of levels included , even some low - grav specific ones .
The game actually reminds me quite a bit of Quake III … with the level design and weapon selection .
All of the weapons look different than most of what you ’ve seen before , but all act relatively similar .
For instance , you will start off with a standard blast gun , but can also pick up a shotgun , rocket launchers and even a rail gun… which does a LOT of damage .
Though the game is deathmatch based , you do n’t have to play online if you do n’t want to .
There is a single player campaign , though it lacks a story mode of any sort .
As you progress through the SP levels , they get increasingly more difficult .
The first few you will not have to repeat , but once you make it up a little ways you may need to replay the level a handful of times before beating it .
Although you have to unlock the levels in SP to play them , all of the levels are available online at any given time .
Nexuiz is a game that grabbed my attention for a few weeks …
I had a blast .
However , it ca n’t be compared to Quake or Unreal Tournament in terms of gameplay , because there are modes missing and the control is not near as ‘ tight ’ .
However , Nexuiz is a prime example of what great open source software is all about .
The game is packed with deathmatch action and will keep you going for a while .
Heck , it may even take you an hour to just deal with the graphic settings ;-)

# 3 Enemy Territory
When Return to Castle Wolfenstein was first released , it was hailed quickly by online gamers .
It was a blast to play and had great graphics and sound to boot .
Shortly after this , Enemy Territory , originally slated as a commercial expansion pack , was released entirely for free .
In early 2004 , the source code was released making it easier for modders and those working on total conversions to get things done .
While there are many online FPS games for Linux , this is by far one of the most in - depth and realistic .
This is a standard Axis and Allies fare , with five different classes to choose from .
The game includes six official maps , but there are far more than that available online provided by the modding community .
This game , in a sense , is like Day of Defeat for Windows , and also Counter - Strike .
It ’s like DoD because of the standard gameplay , but CS in the sense that once you die , you stay dead until the round is over or until the timer hit its mark .
Since RTCW was released in late 2001 , you can expect graphic capabilities from that time period .
Though five years old , the game looks great at high resolution with all the eye candy enabled .
The sound , from what I remember is great to match .
Now , I was unable to give this game a good test on my rig , because the sound ceased to function for whatever reason .
I did n’t look too deeply into it , but it seems to be a semi-common problem .
ET has a sequel on the way , Quake Wars , which will be a commercial game and obviously not be free .
It should reflect a lot of what made ET so popular , but improve on all gaming elements .
The screenshots from the game look like it will be completely revamped in every way .
It will be based on the Quake IV / Doom III engine , and will likely be available for Linux at the time of launch .
So , if you are craving some good Axis / Ally online action , ET will fill your stomach with all of its tasty goodness .

# 2 Frozen Bubble , # 1 Battle for Wesnoth
If there ever were a popular puzzle game for Linux , Frozen Bubble would be it .
Based off what we have seen with Bust a Move , Frozen Bubble is a rather simplistic puzzle that that requires some sort of strategy to succeed .
The game board is filled with multiple colored balls , and it ’s your goal to match three or more of the same color to get rid of them .
Sometimes the game board begins with more than three coupled together , but they do n’t just go away on their own .
What color ball comes next is completely random , so you must use some strategy to make sure that you are not going to get caught in a dead end .
If you do take too long for a move , it will tell you to hurry up .
After so many throws of a ball , the mechanism on the top will push all of the balls down a notch , making things more difficult .
As far as I can tell , once you make it to a certain level within a game , you can continue trying it over and over again until you finally do beat it .
Or , if it becomes too much of a challenge , you can just quit .
When you finally do quit , you will be placed in the high scores list , showing you which level you made it to , along with how long it took .
I have to say that this is one addictive game .
I started it up , and an hour flew by before I knew it .
It ’s amazing how addictive some very simple games can be , really .
I am impressed with the game as a whole , but wish that you could adjust your resolution .
It ’s set to 640*480 , so it does n’t look at that sharp .
My only real complaint would be the lack of mouse support .
Personally , I would find it much easier to control the dial at the bottom with the mouse , but the keyboard is the only option .
In addition to the single player game , you are also able to play against a friend on the same PC .
If you happen to get bored of the included 100 levels , you can easily create your own , or even edit the ones that are default .
Frozen Bubble is meant to be a quick jump in and go type of game , so there is no real depth .
There are only 7 different colors also , and none are added in later levels .
So , it does lack some things I ’d like to see , but it ’s still quite a fun game overall .
It successfully sucked an hour out of my day , so that speaks for itself ;-)

# 1 Battle for Wesnoth
Here is a game that was constantly being noted as a great game , but I have never even heard of it until recently .
Wesnoth is a fantasy turn based strategy game that is truly cross platform .
It ’s not only available for Linux but also Windows , BeOS , Mac OS X , FreeBSD and others .
David
White , the creator of the game , based it off a few Sega Genesis classics .
He wanted the game to be rather simple to play , yet have strong AI .
He strongly believes in the “ Keep it Simple , Stupid ” analogy , so you ca n’t expect deep gameplay that will drag you away from real life for hours at a time .
You can start off the game with a tutorial , which is rather well done .
Your ‘ master ’ teaches you how to do things , and within minutes you are off killing .
In the end , you can build a huge army of different fighters throughout different classes .
Each of your units have various stats that build up as they level .
You can go into each panel and view their weakness , and even see how their defensive abilities differ depending on which type of terrain they are on .
The game is based around factions … six in total .
Depending on which you choose , the races vary .
If you choose Knalgan Alliance for instance , you will be dealing with Dwarves , which are powerful but slow .
As you would also expect , there are campaign missions to be had , each with three levels of difficulty .
You can even download more through the game , most of which are user - created .
Like some other strategy games , Wesnoth is build on a hexgrid board , so your character can move in one of six ways .
The graphics in Wesnoth are nothing incredible , but they are crisp and colorful .
The primary sound in the game is the overbearing music , which I found myself turning off pretty quickly .
Not because it was bad , but because the bass was making the rest of the household angry ;-)
I am not a huge RTS or TBS fan , so I did n’t play Wesnoth for any significant amount of time .
However , it has a very active development team and a huge fanbase , so you can expect this one to continue on for quite a while .
It must be good to hit # 1 in our list !
So do yourself a favor and give it a go .

Hackers break into Sony's PSP to install their own " homebrew " apps
Sony sells its PSP with built - in software , known as firmware , which controls how the console operates .
The firmware locks many of the PSP 's capabilities , preventing enthusiasts from writing their own programs , known as homebrew , and running them on the machine .
It also limits its ability to play some films which are not bought on special Sony PSP disks .
But last month three hacker teams - Noobz , Team C+D , and a group led by PSP hacker Dark Alex - co-ordinating their efforts over the internet , found a flaw in the most recently released version of the firmware - version 3.03 .
Unlocking PSPs
Using this flaw they devised a way to unlock all PSPs , regardless of their age or the firmware running on it .
This development has been a cause for celebration in the PSP homebrew community , but caused alarm at Sony because unlocked PSPs can be used to play pirated PSP games .
" The problem experienced here is not with homebrew applications , but with hackers who pirate commercial titles , " a Sony spokesperson said .
Sony have never been in touch with me , so I am confident that what we are doing is legal
Fanjita ( David Court )
PSP Hacker
" Piracy is illegal and we strongly oppose any acts which either aide or profit from it . "
But the hackers say piracy is not what motivates their teams to unlock the PSP .
" My aim is to enable as many people as possible to run homebrew programs , " said Fanjita , a member of the Noobz team .
He added : " Everyone has the right to do what they want with their own hardware .
Piracy does upset me , and because what we are doing opens the way to piracy it 's harder to justify it morally .
" But our stance on piracy is clear , and we hope to be role models .
Sony have never been in touch with me , so I am confident that what we are doing is legal . "
Hackers unveiled
Fanjita - real name David Court - is very different from the popular hacker stereotype of the socially inept teenaged geek working all night in his bedroom .
A married man of 34 , he is an accomplished professional programmer who writes server software for large telecommunications companies for a living .
He spends an hour or two a night hacking PSP software in his Edinburgh home , and is also a martial arts enthusiast .
Dark
Alex fits much more comfortably into the hacker mould .
A student from Spain , his hacker moniker derives from his real name , Alejandro , and a liking for all things gothic , he says .
His interests are Japanese Manga comics and cats , but PSP hacking is his main hobby .
I think it is up to users to make the correct decisions about how to use my software
Dark Alex
PSP Hacker
" It takes up a good part of my spare time , more or less what some other people may spend watching TV , " he said .
" I mainly do it because it is fun to research the internals of the operating system of a machine made by a big company .
I am also against DRM ( digital rights management - a type of electronic copy protection ) in any of its forms , and against restrictions that make a device unable to show its true potential . "
Not just pirates
Dark
Alex said that although his work makes piracy easier because it enabled PSP owners to play copied games , this was not his responsibility .
" I think it is up to users to make the correct decisions about how to use my software , " he said .
" I believe in the presumption of innocence , unlike the media companies . "
There were many quite legitimate reasons why you might want to copy a game you own from its original disk , Dark Alex said .
" You can transport a number of games on a single memory stick , which is very convenient , and the games actually load faster .
And most important for me , these games can actually be modified , allowing users to customise their games , " he said .
" I 've seen great things done in this area , like people changing the music of games , or making full translations into their own language . "
Breaking the code
Whenever Sony releases a new version of its PSP firmware , the three hacker teams compete to see who can decode and examine it first .
They then collaborate to see if they can find any way of unlocking it .
This task has been made harder in recent months as Sony has introduced a new and more secure motherboard in the latest PSPs , and because Sony 's firmware has become increasingly sophisticated in response to the hackers ' efforts .
" When each new version of the PSP firmware comes out we can see that Sony are putting in countermeasures against the things we have been doing , " Court said .
In this case it turned out that a well known mistake in the way a PSP game called Grand Theft Auto : Liberty City Stories was written provided the hackers with a suitable " exploit " .
By loading the game it was possible to get access to a restricted part of the firmware called the kernel , and an oversight on the part of Sony 's firmware writers then allowed the hackers to run a special program of their own devising .
An upgraded ' downgrade '
This " downgraded " the PSP to an earlier version of the firmware which allows homebrew to be used .
PSP FIRMWARE HISTORY 2.00 Added a web browser , 4:3 video playback , MP4 / AAC playback , and photo transfer support 2.50 Added Locationfree streaming , copyright - protected video playback , and WPA wi-fi security 2.60 Added RSS support and WMA playback 2.70 Added support for Adobe Flash in the web browser 3.00 Added Playstation network / Playstation 3 support and camera support
Return to top
The drawback of this early firmware is that it wo n't run the latest games , but this problem was quickly overcome by Dark Alex , who wrote his own firmware , called Dark Alex 's Open Edition , with the help of a fellow hacker known as Booster .
With this firmware installed , the PSP is completely unlocked , but also has all the features of the latest firmware .
Within days of the release of the Noobz team 's downgrader and Dark Alex 's Open Edition firmware , Sony updated its firmware , fixing the flaw which makes unlocking possible .
Anyone buying a new PSP with this firmware installed will be therefore be unable to unlock their console - at least until Noobz , Team C+D and Dark Alex and his crew find another exploit and the whole cat - and - mouse game played by Sony and the hacker teams repeats itself .
Isaf forces have found marijuana forests in Kandahar Province
Thickets three metres ( 10 ft ) high readily absorb heat , making them hard to penetrate with thermal devices , said Gen Rick Hillier in a speech in Ottawa .
" You really have to be careful the Taleban do n't dodge in and out of those marijuana forests , " he added .
Burning them is not an option as they are laden with water , the general said .
He was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency that the crew of at least one armoured car had responded by camouflaging their vehicle with marijuana .
Canada 's armed forces have more than 2,300 personnel deployed in Afghanistan as part of the Isaf international force and have suffered at least 40 fatalities since 2002 .
Smoke scare
" We tried burning [ the marijuana forests ] with white phosphorous - it did n't work , " said Gen Hillier .
" We tried burning them with diesel - it did n't work .
The plants are so full of water right now ... that we simply could n't burn them . "
He noted that a couple of brown plants on the edges of some of the forests had caught fire but this had posed yet another problem .
" A section of soldiers that was downwind from that had some ill effects and decided that was probably not the right course of action , " he said , speaking dryly , according to Reuters .
One soldier had told him :
" Sir , three years ago before I joined the army , I never thought I 'd say ' That damn marijuana ' . "
Marijuana , an illegal drug in most parts of the world , grows wild across Central Asia , where it is commonly regarded as a weed .
With illicit marijuana production on the rise in Canada itself , police there recently identified fighting the drug as their " biggest issue " .
Your comments
I have seen marijuana growing right outside of my house when I was growing up by the Afghanistan border in Pakistan and am totally against eradicating the plant without providing an alternate both to the farmers and the land .
Besides being a part of the farmers livelihood , marijuana is probably the only plant which can easily be grown to keep the area green and protect it from erosion .
On the other hand , it helps retain water and protect other plants and trees around them .
Johar Ali , Vancouver , Canada
In 2003 working for the UN in the South - East we encountered two types of marijuana plant production .
The first was grown for ' export ' as part of the drug trade and is a smaller plant with long head which contains a concentration of THC - the active substance in marijuana .
The second and most common was the marijuana forest which is grown for its hemp and for feeding cattle .
From the photos and description I believe it is this latter type that the troops encountered .
Burning or otherwise destroying it would require some fore - thought as it probably is part of some poor farmer 's livelihood .

September 27 marks the anniversary of the publication of the first of the Antifederalist Papers in 1789 .
The Antifederalists were opponents of ratifying the US Constitution .
They feared that it would create an overbearing central government , while the Constitution 's proponents promised that this would not happen .
As the losers in that debate , they are largely overlooked today .
But that does not mean they were wrong or that we are not indebted to them .
In many ways , the group has been misnamed .
Federalism refers to the system of decentralized government .
This group defended states rights — the very essence of federalism — against the Federalists , who would have been more accurately described as Nationalists .
Nonetheless , what the so - called Antifederalists predicted would be the results of the Constitution turned out to be true in most every respect .
The Antifederalists warned us that the cost Americans would bear in both liberty and resources for the government that would evolve under the Constitution would rise sharply .
That is why their objections led to the Bill of Rights , to limit that tendency ( though with far too little success that has survived to the present ) .
Antifederalists opposed the Constitution on the grounds that its checks on federal power would be undermined by expansive interpretations of promoting the " general welfare " ( which would be claimed for every law ) and the " all laws necessary and proper " clause ( which would be used to override limits on delegated federal powers ) , creating a federal government with unwarranted and undelegated powers that were bound to be abused .
One could quibble with the mechanisms the Antifederalists predicted would lead to constitutional tyranny .
For instance , they did not foresee that the Commerce Clause would come to be called " the everything clause " in law schools , used by centralizers to justify almost any conceivable federal intervention .
The 20th - century distortion of the clause 's original meaning was so great even the vigilant Antifederalists could never have imagined the government getting away with it .
And they could not have foreseen how the Fourteenth Amendment and its interpretation would extend federal domination over the states after the Civil War .
But it is very difficult to argue with their conclusions from the current reach of our government , not just to forcibly intrude upon , but often to overwhelm Americans today .
Therefore , it merits remembering the Antifederalists ' prescient arguments and how unfortunate is the virtual absence of modern Americans who share their concerns .
One of the most insightful of the Antifederalists was Robert Yates , a New York judge who , as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention , withdrew because the convention was exceeding its instructions .
Yates wrote as Brutus in the debates over the Constitution .
Given his experience as a judge , his claim that the Supreme Court would become a source of almost unlimited federal over - reaching was particularly insightful .
Brutus asserted that the Supreme Court envisioned under the Constitution would become a source of massive abuse because they were beyond the control " both of the people and the legislature , " and not subject to being " corrected by any power above them . "
As a result , he objected to the fact that its provisions justifying the removal of judges did n't include making rulings that went beyond their constitutional authority , which would lead to judicial tyranny .
Brutus argued that when constitutional grounds for making rulings were absent , the Court would create grounds " by their own decisions . "
He thought that the power it would command would be so irresistible that the judiciary would use it to make law , manipulating the meanings of arguably vague clauses to justify it .
The Supreme Court would interpret the Constitution according to its alleged " spirit " , rather than being restricted to just the " letter " of its written words ( as the doctrine of enumerated rights , spelled out in the Tenth Amendment , would require ) .
Further , rulings derived from whatever the court decided its spirit was would effectively " have the force of law , " due to the absence of constitutional means to " control their adjudications " and " correct their errors " .
This constitutional failing would compound over time in a " silent and imperceptible manner " , through precedents that built on one another .
Expanded judicial power would empower justices to shape the federal government however they desired , because the Supreme Court 's constitutional interpretations would control the effective power vested in government and its different branches .
That would hand the Supreme Court ever - increasing power , in direct contradiction to Alexander Hamilton 's argument in Federalist 78 that the Supreme Court would be " the least dangerous branch . "
Brutus predicted that the Supreme Court would adopt " very liberal " principles of interpreting the Constitution .
He argued that there had never in history been a court with such power and with so few checks upon it , giving the Supreme Court " immense powers " that were not only unprecedented , but perilous for a nation founded on the principle of consent of the governed .
Given the extent to which citizens ' power to effectively withhold their consent from federal actions has been eviscerated , it is hard to argue with Brutus 's conclusion .
He further warned that the new government would not be restricted in its taxing power , and that the legislatures war power was highly dangerous : " the power in the federal legislative , to raise and support armies at pleasure , as well in peace as in war , and their controul over the militia , tend , not only to a consolidation of the government , but the destruction of liberty . "
He also objected to the very notion that a republican form of government can work well over such a vast territory , even the relatively small terrority as compared with today 's US :
History furnishes no example of a free republic , anything like the extent of the United States .
The Grecian republics were of small extent ; so also was that of the Romans .
Both of these , it is true , in process of time , extended their conquests over large territories of country ; and the consequence was , that their governments were changed from that of free governments to those of the most tyrannical that ever existed in the world .
Brutus accurately described both the cause ( the absence of sufficient enforceable restraints on the size and scope of the federal government ) and the consequences ( expanding burdens and increasing invasions of liberty ) of what would become the expansive federal powers we now see all around us .
But today , Brutus would conclude that he had been far too optimistic .
The federal government has grown orders of magnitudes larger than he could ever have imagined ( in part because he was writing when only indirect taxes and the small federal government they could finance were possible , before the 16th Amendment opened the way for a federal income tax in 1913 ) , far exceeding its constitutionally enumerated powers , despite the constraints of the Bill of Rights .
The result burdens citizens beyond his worst nightmare .
The judicial tyranny that was accurately and unambiguously predicted by Brutus and other Antifederalists shows that in essential ways , they were right and that modern Americans still have a lot to learn from them .
We need to understand their arguments and take them seriously now , if there is to be any hope of restraining the federal government to the limited powers it was actually granted in the Constitution , or even anything close to them , given its current tendency to accelerate its growth beyond them .
The Mythology Of Cuban Medical Care
For those who support or sympathize with Fidel Castro and his dictatorship of Cuba , no argument comes up more frequently than the supposedly marvelous health - care system that Castro has created for the Cubans .
They routinely credit him with managing to deliver world - class facilities and treatment , equally for all Cubans , far surpassing even the United States in egalitarianism and effectiveness .
For some people , that level of medical care outweighs Castro 's oppression , which would be ludicrous even if they were right about the medical system they espouse .
Unfortunately , that system is a myth , as Val Prieto points out in Babalublog .
Val points out a March 6th article in Gentunio , translated partially here , which has a number of pictures of Cl�nico Quir�rgico in Havana .
Here 's what Fidel Castro said about Cl�nico Quir�rgico in 1989 :
" Now , the old hospital has turned into one of the most modern and best ones in the capital .
I should explain that this hospital provided services to a large number of people who live at the other side of the Almendares River . " ... " Not only did the number of beds increase , with blocks and civil construction spreading throughout almost 30,000 square meters of construction , but the power unit is totally new - boilers , electric power generators , etc . [ " ]
Reporters from Gentiuno managed to get into the actual hospital with a camera , and they found a much different situation .
For example , this is what they found in the emergency room :
Yes , those are cockroaches , at least the Darwin Award winners that got caught under the feet of patients , doctors , and staff .
Lord knows how many smarter ones have managed to stay alive .
They may come from the restrooms for the emergency room :
If one manages to survive surgical treatment in the emergency room , then they have plenty of time for infection , er , reflection in the recovery room .
Take a look at that area and tell me if you 'd feel healed by resting a while in here , first the ceiling and then the floor :
Remember the new power system that Castro had installed in 1989 ?
It looks like he skipped a few items on the checklist .
Either that , or the hospital wants to drum up more business through electrocution of patients and staff :
When leftists tell you that Castro may have his faults but he provides for the Cuban people with his marvelous health system , try to remember these pictures .
I would n't send a stray dog to a facility like this to get put to sleep , let alone receive treatment .
And this is what Castro considers a jewel in the crown of the Cuban HMO program .
Be sure to read Val 's entire post , and if you read Spanish , check out Gentiuno 's article for more details .

Introduction
Analysts cover everything .
They are quoted in stories about the PS3 launch date , the impending death of the iPod Shuffle , and the earnings of search behemoth Google , but reading quote after quote from faceless " analysts " does little to answer the burning question : who are these people , and what do they do all day ?
To find out , we had a chat with Jason Kraft and Chris Kwak , two research analysts from Susquehanna Financial Group who specialize in video games ( and who we 've quoted before at Ars ) .
If covering video games sounds like all play and no work , think again .
Analysts produce guidance that is used by large institutional investors to make decisions about where to put their money , and their knowledge of videogames has to be matched by their knowledge of business .
Getting it wrong can cost clients a good deal of money ( and analysts their jobs ) .
So what do these people do all day ?
Read on to find out .
The interview
Ars Technica :
How would you describe the job of a software analyst to someone without an MBA ( and without using the terms " value - added " or " actualize " ) ?
Jason Kraft and Chris Kwak :
That 's metaphysically impossible .
We ( Jason Kraft and Chris Kwak ) are equity research analysts generally , and enterprise and consumer software analysts specifically .
As equity analysts , we look at equities ( stocks ) .
Our principal job is to assess a company 's fundamentals and their impact on financials , and ultimately to make recommendations on stocks .
Our job is to help our clients ( institutional investors ) make more informed investment decisions .
You guys write extensively about video games , but I 'm guessing that office life consists of far more than playing Guitar Hero all day and reading rumors about the PS3 launch date .
What does an average work day look like ?
Actually , we do n't play games at work ( unless we steal five minutes to play an arcade classic ) .
Games are for evenings and weekends .
While we like playing as much as the next person , we try to focus on our task — helping our clients make more informed decisions .
Whenever an important game hits shelves , we get it and play it .
Since our job is to help our clients make more informed investment decisions , we look closely at the gaming companies and the industry .
We write quite a bit .
We try to model everything .
And we talk to our clients .
Everything we do is geared toward helping our clients get greater conviction about a stock .
Our day revolves around figuring out what 's important to the industry and companies , and driving toward answers .
For example , THQI , the stock , is being valued this year in large measure by Cars , the Pixar movie .
How big is Cars the videogame going to be ?
In our most recent issue of the Video Game Journal [ their research newsletter ] , we looked at what the market ( in this case , the Hollywood Stock Exchange ) was pricing Cars .
Based on analysis we had done in fall 2005 , we determined that expectations for Cars the movie was low .
Does writing and researching games make you more or less interested in playing them when you get home at night ?
Well , we kinda have to play the games .
But putting Call of Duty 2 aside , we do n't play a lot of games for long .
We may play a new game for a week , but we have to move on .
A lot of our time playing games is aimed at trying to predict if the game is going to sell well .
If we feel we can make that determination after an hour , that 's enough for us .
If we need a week , we 'll take a week .
In our " Episodic Gaming in the Age of Digital Distribution " issue of our Journal , we wrote that for many , we are approaching an era of staccato gaming an intermittent gaming life where fragments of game experiences cohere to fulfill a story .
These game experiences can be sporadic and disconnected even .
In other words , these game experiences become episodic , often not as a function of a game 's story arc and structure , but what frees and steals our time .
We like being able to play a game for 15 minutes , if we want .
Is the gaming business unique , or does it turn out to be just like any other business ?
Gaming is definitely more fun .
Gaming is a lot like other cyclical industries .
There is an ebb and flow to the industry .
It is also a secular growth story — that is to say , if one were to line up the gaming cycles , the slope is up and to the right .
So even though video games ( as we know them today ) have been around for as long as the personal computer , there is a sense the gaming market is still relatively young and trying to understand what it wants to be when it grows up .
It seems like there 's a lot of responsibility that comes with issuing research reports for a well - respected firm ; your words , after all , may have a direct effect on a company 's share price .
Does this ever make it difficult to say negative things about companies who deserve them ?
We believe truth will have its day .
Saying negative things is probably different in our professions .
For a game reviewer , saying Madden '09 is boring may be construed as negative .
If we were to say Madden '09 is boring , it would be somewhat laughable .
Now , if we were to say we expect Madden '09 will sell only one unit next year , that would certainly be negative .
Investors expect us to put a number or a range to things .
You tell us what 's negative : GUN is a terrible game ?
Or , GUN may miss expectations ?
The first question may have something to do with the second .
But the second question is ultimately what matters .
Just look at the front pages of our VGJ issues .
We say some pretty honest things .
Some call them negative ; others have called them mean .
We think they 're true .
In your experience of covering the software industry , what is the single biggest business blunder you 've ever seen a company make ?
This is like asking a kid to pick only one kind of candy in a candy store .
What 's the most exasperating thing about your job ?
When readers jump on us because we say something unflattering about Nintendo .
It 's difficult for many readers to understand that we are writing principally for investors .
There are lots of purists out there who want games to be about challenging the norm , aesthetic models , and theory .
That 's not what the business of games is about , and that 's not really our concern .
EA is not a nonprofit organization or the NEA .
There are shareholders out there who have put billions of dollars of your money to get a return on their investment .
And we can measure this .
EA and its brethren had better invest to grow and to generate returns for shareholders .
We saw a survey recently that had the following upcoming games ( among others ) in order of interest : Black , The Godfather , Madden , Spore , and Cars .
The least interest in Cars !
We had a good chuckle .
There is n't a publisher out there who would n't kill to have Madden .
Put your aesthetic sensibilities aside .
Madden is a great business .
And the returns on that business ( among others ) allow things like Spore to be made at all .
Spore is not a cheap endeavor .
People point to Geometry Wars and how successful that 's been .
And they point to Katamari .
If you were an alien and you read the gaming press , you 'd think Katamari is the biggest game around , driving huge sales and contributing significant margin to a publisher .
Katamari is an afterthought to an Activision or THQ .
They may be darlings to many readers , but few investors care about Katamari .
If analysts and their research reports all disappeared tomorrow , what would be the effect on the industries that you cover ?
If Leonardo da Vinci had had four arms , what would the Renaissance have looked like ?
It 's an interesting thought .
But wherever there are financial instruments , there will always be analysts , whether we like them or not .
They may take on a different look ( Web only , for example ) , but someone will be looking for opportunities in stocks .
Conclusion
Those last words are good to keep in mind , because they highlight the basic difference between an analyst and a reviewer .
While analysts are often quoted in news reports because of their detailed industry knowledge , their concern is on whether a given company or product will make money for a company .
As Chris and Jason point out above , " quality , " " social importance , " and " value for the consumer " are only relevent to an analyst insofar as those things translate into a higher stock price .
" Making money for the company " and " making sense for you " are two different categories , though , so keep an analyst 's perspective in mind when you see a quote in the newspaper .
That said , analysts are paid to know their industry top to bottom , and they 're often willing to speak on the record in a way that corporate insiders can't or wo n't .
Even if they spouted the hottest of hot air , we 'd still love them for keeping the tech rumor mill grinding away .
The fact that they 're so often right is gravy .
The most interesting object for the photographer is probably a man .
Five photographers will take a picture of the same person quite differently .
There are no trifles in a work of portrait photographer .
Pose of a model , background , light , makeup - depends on the quality of the photoportrait .
However more important factor is the mood of the model , its internal condition and emancipation .
It reveals some unexpected skills needed for Portrait photographer .
He must be a psychologist , have a good sense of humor , ability to create atmosphere and mood of the model .
You will see the the works of outstanding portrait photographers of our time , and learn the lessons of portrait photography .
Portrait photography - this is what every photographer has to face .
Portraits is not as easy to do as many people think .
It is insufficient to simply ask the person to smile and wait for " birdie " , no - portrait photo is much more complicated .
If you are going to do such images on order , you should find a couple of minutes to read this article .
So , what should you pay attention , going to make close up photography ?
The carnivorous Venus flytrap plant can snap its clamshell leaves around an insect in less than a second .
But how ?
Unlike animals , plants have no muscles or brains .
And plants are not known for their ability to move quickly , as a team of scientists and engineers point out in the Jan. 27 issue of the journal Nature .
The secret has been revealed :
The flytrap 's leaves snap from convex to concave the same way that a contact lens can flip inside out , the scientists say .
(( ImgTag||right|null|null|null|false ) )
A leaf closes in 0.04 seconds .
Colors indicate changing curvature .
Credit : Nature
The team cut up leaves to study their natural curls , and also painted fluorescent dots on intact leaves to track their insect - devouring action with high - speed cameras .
Like most lenses , Venus flytrap leaves are doubly curved , that is , curved in two directions , which allows the leaves to store elastic energy .
With a contact lens , the two directions are perpendicular to one another .
With a Venus flytrap leaf , they are not .
That property creates an especially rapid elasticity that causes the leaf to snap even more quickly from convex to concave .
Tennis ball science
Bending and stretching are inseparable for doubly curved objects .
" Think of a cut - open tennis ball , " said L. Mahadevan of Harvard University , who is part of the team that came with the new explanation of the Venus flytrap 's snapping .
" If you try to bend it , you end up stretching it as well . "
Large , highly curved leaves snap more rapidly than smaller , weakly curved leaves .
Overall , this action is called snap buckling .
The question of what initiates the snap buckling remains unanswered .
It starts when stiff hairs on the leaves ' edges are touched .
Mahadevan and others suspect some high - pressure movement of water through the leaves makes them start to curl in a way that initiates the snap buckling .
Mahadevan 's colleague Yoel Forterre of the University of Provence in France is working on that problem .
A vegetarian 's delight
Mahadevan says his interest in Venus flytrap snapping became especially piqued when a colleague gave him one of the carnivorous plants as a gift .
" I thought it would be fun to study it , " he told LiveScience .
" Besides , as a vegetarian , it is nice to think about plants that eat animals rather than the other way around ! "
Venus flytraps , which live only in bogs in North and South Carolina and have become endangered , can gather nutrients from gases in the air and the soil , but they prefer poor soil and are healthier if they consume a meaty housefly or two every month .
Once an insect is captured , the plant closes its trap tightly around the meal and bathes it in digestive juices that dissolve the insect 's soft , inner parts .
Digestion takes five to 12 days , after which the trap reopens .
The insect 's exoskeleton blows away in the wind or is washed away by rain .
Venus flytraps exhibit one of the fastest movements in the plant kingdom , competing in speed tests with the exploding fruits of flowering plants .
In these plants , ovaries mature around fertilized eggs to form fruits that protect the developing embryos inside .
In certain case , as with impatiens , squirting cucumbers , and trigger plants , the fruits explode on contact , an adaptation that favors the dispersal of seeds over their protection .
The White House has been very busy these past few days as they continue to ratchet up the rhetoric against Iran .
It began this weekend , when anonymous officials in Baghdad trotted out various weapons to show that , " Iran is a significant contributor to attacks on coalition forces " in Iraq .
And on Monday , during the White House press briefing :
Is the U.S. administration confident that there is conclusive evidence that Iran is providing these weapons to Iraq ?
MR .
SNOW : Yes .
Of course , given this administration 's track record on intelligence , skepticism was high , and when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff apparently missed the memo and said of the evidence :
That does not translate that the Iranian government per se , for sure , is directly involved in doing this .
... it was time for George Bush to hold a press conference .
And what did we learn ?
We learned that Bush knows :
... that the Quds force was instrumental in providing these deadly IEDs to networks inside of Iraq .
We know that .
And we also know that the Quds force is a part of the Iranian government .
That 's a known .
He knows , he can say with certainty , he is confident .
Just as he knew with confident certainty that :
Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin , mustard and VX nerve agent .
... had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents .
... had several mobile biological weapons labs .
... recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa .
... has attempted to purchase high - strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production .
Bush knew all that for a fact in January , 2003 , and four years and 3,127 U.S. deaths later , everything that Bush knew has been proven wrong .
But today he knows that Iran is supplying weapons that have killed 170 U.S. troops in Iraq .
Except he does n't .
What we do n't know is whether or not the head leaders of Iran ordered the Quds force to do what they did .
What ?
After repeatedly claiming that Iran was supplying these weapons , we do n't really know that ?
Said Bush :
But here 's my point :
Either they knew or did n't know , and what matters is , is that they 're there .
What 's worse , that the government knew or that the government did n't know ? [...] ... what 's worse -- them ordering it and it happening , or them not ordering it and it happening ?
And so we will continue to protect our troops .
First ignoring that blathering idiocy , and leaving aside the 2,957 U.S. troops that were n't killed by the weaponry that may or may not have been provided by Iran , what really is the point ?
... our strategy is comprehensive in order to resolve problems that will affect our own peace and the peace in the world .
And the biggest problem I see is the Iranians ' desire to have a nuclear weapon .
And finally , that is the point .
The Iranian branch of the axis of evil must be dealt with .
With anonymous briefings , accusations , shifting claims and aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf , the case for war is being built under the guise of " protecting the troops . "
Or how Bush characterizes it :
... making sure that this weapon is dealt with , the program is dealt with in a constructive , peaceful way .
Because after all , " we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud . "
Again .
Scientists tend to be analytical
Professor Simon Baron - Cohen , of the University of Cambridge , said the phenomenon might help explain the recent rise in diagnoses .
He believes the genes which make some analytical may also impair their social and communication skills .
A weakness in these areas is the key characteristic of autism .
It is thought that around one child in every 100 has a form of autism - the vast majority of those affected are boys .
The number of diagnoses seems to be on the increase , but some argue this is simply because of a greater awareness of the condition .
In a paper published in the journal Archives of Disease of Childhood , Professor Baron - Cohen labels people such as scientists , mathematicians and engineers as " systemizers " .
They are skilled at analysing systems - whether it be a vehicle , or a maths equation - to figure out how they work .
But they also tend to be less interested in the social side of life , and can exhibit behaviour such as an obsession with detail - classic traits associated with autism .
Body of evidence
Professor Baron - Cohen argues that systemizers are often attracted to each other - and thus more likely to pass " autism " genes to their offspring .
He cited a survey of 1,000 members of the National Autistic Society which found fathers and grandfathers of children with autistic spectrum conditions are twice as likely to work in a systemizing profession .
In addition , students in the natural sciences have a higher number of relatives with autism than do students in the humanities , and mathematicians have a higher rate of autistic spectrum conditions compared with the general population .
Other research has found both mothers and fathers of children with autism score highly on a questionnaire measuring autistic traits .
Brain scan studies have also shown that mothers of autistic children often show patterns of brain activity more associated with men .
Professor Baron - Cohen said the rise in autism might be linked to the fact that it had become easier for systemizers to meet each other , with the advent of international conferences , greater job opportunities and more women working in these fields .
Richard Mills , of the National Autistic Society , said : " The society welcomes all new research , particularly that which helps us understand the nature and possible causes of autism and which may inform the support that we give to individuals .
" Over half a million people in the UK have a form of autism .
It is a lifelong developmental disorder which requires specialist support . "
Come 2007 , the key ingredient to look out for in your skincare product is Coffeeberry extract which is to become the unrivalled source of polyphenols with antioxidant benefits .
In case you do not know , polyhenols are one of the most wanted ingredients in the cosmetic industry today .
They are a group of chemical substances found in many plants and foods , and have been proven to contain high levels of antioxidants that are believed to prevent cellular damage in skin when applied externally and to boost the immune system when ingested .
Currently pomegranate and green tea are the two with high amounts of polyphenols and therefore the leading antioxidants in skincare .
Another example is polyphenols contained in grape seeds , and this explains why the Grape Seed Clarifying Crystals I ’m using from butyshop is so popular , especially in Taiwan .
And now , Allure magazine reveals that Coffeeberry extract ’s antioxidant content is five times higher than the most powerful pomegranate ’s and three times greater than that of the highest - quality green tea .
Compared with a potent green tea , Coffeeberry extract was twice as capable of protecting the skin from UVA damage .
It was also better at inhibiting UV - induced inflammation and enzymes associated with melanoma .
In tests done at an independent lab , women , ages 35 to 60 , with wrinkles , dry skin , and discoloration , applied the cream twice a day for three weeks .
The texture and tone of the skin treated with Coffeeberry extract showed 46 percent improvement in fine lines and wrinkles , 64 percent in overall skin smoothness , and 79 percent in skin hydration .
In fact , Coffeeberry extract has been available only as a powder that could be incorporated into food products and dietary supplements .
However , Allure has said in a statement that a new face cream tentatively called Revale Skin containing the extract will be unveiled next year February at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology .
So beauty junkies out there , it ’s Coffeeberry extract .
Repeat after me and learn it by heart .

Pre-Independence - During the period before Israeli independence was declared , two armies of Arab irregular volunteers , let by Haj Amin El Husseini in the Jerusalem area , and by Fawzi El Kaukji in the Galilee , placed their fighters in Arab towns and conducted various aggressive operations against the Jewish towns and village under the eyes of the British .
Kaukji and his irregulars were allowed into Palestine from Syria by the British , with the agreement that he would not engage in military actions , but he soon broke the agreement and attacked across the Galilee .
The Arab irregulars were met by the Zionist underground army , the Haganah , and by the underground groups of the " dissident " factions , Irgun and Lehi .
In Jerusalem , Arab riots broke out on November 30 and December 1 1947 .
Palestinian irregulars cut off the supply of food , water and fuel to Jerusalem during a long siege that began in late 1947 .
Fighting and violence broke out immediately throughout the country , including ambushes of transportation , the Jerusalem blockade , riots such as the Haifa refinery riots , and massacres that took place at Gush Etzion ( by Palestinians ) and in Deir Yassin ( by Jews ) .
Arab Palestinians began leaving their towns and villages to escape the fighting .
Notably , most of the Arab population of Haifa left in March and April of 1948 , despite pleas by both Jewish and British officials to stay .
The British did little to stop the fighting , but the scale of hostilities was limited by lack of arms and trained soldiers on both sides .
Initially , the Palestinians had a clear advantage , and a Haganah intelligence report of March , 1948 indicated that the situation was critical , especially in the Jerusalem area .
It is generally agreed that April 1948 marked a turning point in the fighting before the invasion by Arab armies , in favor of the initially outnumbered and outgunned Jewish forces .
To break the siege of Jerusalem , the Haganah prematurely activated " Plan Dalet " - a plan prepared for general defense that was supposed to have been implemented when the British had left .
It required use of regular armed forces and army tactics , fighting in the open , rather than as an underground .
It also envisioned the " temporary " evacuation of Arab civilians from towns in certain strategic areas , such as the Jerusalem corridor .
This provision has been cited as evidence that the Zionists planned for the exodus and expulsion of Arab civilians in advance .
The Haganah mounted its first full scale operation , Operation Nahshon , using 1,500 troops .
It attacked the Arab villages of Qoloniyah and Qastel , occupied by Arab irregular forces after the villagers had fled , on the road to Jerusalem and temporarily broke the siege , allowing convoys of supplies to reach the city .
Qastel fell on April 8 , and the key Palestinian military commander , Abdel Khader Al - Husseini was killed there .
Qoloniyeh fell on April 11 .
In the north , Fawzi El - Kaukji's " Salvation Army " was beaten back at the battle of Mishmar Haemeq on April 12 , 1948 .
These successes helped convince US President Truman that the Jews would not be overrun by Arab forces , and he abandoned the trusteeship proposal that the US had put before the UN earlier .
Following attacks by Arab irregulars , the Irgun attacked the Arab town of Jaffa , just south of Tel Aviv .
Palestinians fled en masse despite the pleas of the British to remain .
The Arab Invasion -
The governments of neighboring Arab states were more reluctant than is generally assumed to enter the war against Israel , despite bellicose declarations .
However , fear of popular pressure combined with fear that other Arab states would gain an advantage over them by fighting in Palestine , helped sway Syria , Jordan and Egypt to go to war .
While officially they were fighting according to one plan , in fact there was little coordination between them .
On May 14 , 1948 , the Jews proclaimed the independent State of Israel , and the British withdrew from Palestine .
In the following days and weeks , neighboring Arab nations invaded Palestine and Israel ( click here for map ) .
The fighting was conducted in several brief periods , punctuated by cease fire agreements ( truces were declared June 11 to July 8 , 1948 and July 19 - October 15 , 1948 ) .
In the initial stage , notable successes were scored by the Egyptian and Syrian armies .
In particular , the Egyptians , backed by tanks , artillery , armor and aircraft , which Israel did not have , were able to cut off the entire Negev and to occupy parts of the land that had been allocated to the Jewish state .
In his book , " In the Fields of Phillistia , " Israeli peace activist Uri Avnery recounts how the Egyptian army attempted a massed armored strike against Tel Aviv .
Palestinian attempts to set up a real state were blocked by Egypt and Jordan .
Jordan kept to its agreement not to invade areas allocated to the Jewish state , but Syria and Egypt did not .
The strike was turned back by a few recently arrived Messerchmitt aircraft , bought from Czechoslovakia .
The Syrians made some advances into the territory that had been allotted to the Palestinian state .
While Jordan did not invade Jewish territory , the Arab Legion blocked convoys to besieged Jewish Jerusalem from its fortified positions in Latroun .
Jerusalem was to have been internationalized according to UN General Assembly Resolution 181 and UN General Assembly Resolution 303 .
The Jordanian positions at Latroun ( or Latrun ) could not be overcome despite several bloody attacks .
To get around it , the Israelis ultimately built a " Burma Road ' that was completed in June of 1948 and broke the siege of Jerusalem .
The first cease fire and the Altalena - A cease fire in June gave all sides time to regroup and reorganize .
This marked a critical stage in the fighting .
The Arab side made a crucial error in accepting the truce .
The Israelis took advantage of the cease fire to reorganize and recruit and train soldiers .
They were now able to bring in large shiploads of arms , despite the treaty terms , and to train and organize a real fighting force of 60,000 troops , giving them a real advantage in troops and armament for the first time .
The truce probably saved Jerusalem , which had been on the brink of starvation .
During the long truce , the underground armies of the Haganah , Palmah , Irgun and Lehi were amalgamated into a single national fighting force , the Israel Defense Force ( IDF ) .
The revisionist Irgun movement attempted to bring a shipload of arms into Israel on a ship called the Altalena , in order to maintain a separate fighting force .
Israeli PM
Ben Gurion ordered the IDF to sink the Altalena when Irgun leader Menahem Begin refused to give up its cargo of arms .
The Palestinians and Arabs did not use the time well .
A large shipment of arms intended for the Palestinians was blocked by the IDF / Haganah and never reached Syria .
Arab states were reluctant to commit more men to the struggle or to spend more money .
The Sinai Campaign - Following the overthrow of King Farouk of Egypt by the free officers headed by Naguib and Nasser , Egypt made some moves toward peace with Israel .
However , in 1954 , an Israeli spy ring was caught trying to blow up the US Information agency and other foreign institutions in Egypt .
The goal was to create tension between the US and Egypt and prevent rapprochement .
In Israel , both Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon and Prime Minister David Ben Gurion disclaimed responsibility for the action , and blamed each other .
This incident came to be known variously as " the Lavon affair " and " the shameful business . " ( click here for details ) .
Egypt became suspicious of Israeli intentions , and began negotiating to purchase large quantities of arms .
When they were turned down by the West , the Egyptians turned to the Eastern bloc countries and concluded a deal with Czechoslovakia .
Egyptian President Gamal Nasser also closed the straits of Tiran and Suez Canal to Israeli shipping .
Israeli strategists believed that Egypt would go to war or force a diplomatic showdown as soon the weapons had been integrated , and began looking for a source of arms as well .
Israel concluded an arms deal with France .
A series of border incursions by Palestinians and by Egyptians from Gaza evoked increasingly severe Israeli reprisals , triggering larger raids .
The assessment of Israeli " activists " like Moshe Dayan was that Israel should wage preventive war before Egypt had fully integrated the new weapons .
In the summer of 1956 , Israel , France and Britain colluded in a plan to reverse the nationalization of the Suez canal .
Israel would invade the Sinai and land paratroopers near the Mitla pass .
Britain and France would issue an ultimatum , and then land troops ostensibly to separate the sides .
The plan was carried out beginning October 29 , 1956 .
Israel swiftly conquered Sinai .
The US was furious at Israel , Britain and France .
UN General Assembly Resolution 997 called for immediate withdrawal .
Israeli troops remained in Sinai for many months .
Israel subsequently withdrew under pressure from the UN and in particular the United States .
Israel obtained guarantees that international waterways would remain open to Israeli shipping from the US , and a UN force was stationed in Sinai .
Sinai Campaign - Map
The beginning of the Fatah - Yasser Arafat , an Egyptian Palestinian who grew up in the Gaza strip and had been a member of the Ikhwan ( Muslim Brothers ) and the Futuwwah or Futtuwah ( officially called " Nazi Scouts " according to Benny Morris , Righteous Victims , 1999 , page 124 , Palestinian armed faction of Grand Mufti Hajj Amin El Husseini ) was recruited by Egyptian intelligence while studying in Cairo in 1955 , and founded the General Union of Palestinian Students ( GUPS ) .
In 1957 he moved to Kuwait and together with Khalil Al Wazir ( Abu Jihad ) Farouq Qadumi , Khalid al Hassan , Mahmoud Abass and others founded the Palestine Liberation Committee , later renamed the Fatah ( reverse acronym for Harakat Tahrir Filastin - the Palestine Liberation Movement ) modeled on the Algerian FLN .
The 1967 6 - Day War - Tension began developing between Israel and Arab countries in the 1960s .
Israel began to implement its National Water Carrier plan , which pumps water from the Sea of Galilee to irrigate south and central Israel .
The project was in accordance with a plan proposed by US envoy Eric Johnston in 1955 , and agreed to by Arab engineers .
Arab governments refused to participate however , because of the implied recognition of Israel .
In secret meetings , Israel and Jordan agreed to abide by the water quotas set by the plan .
The newly formed Palestinian Fatah movement seized on the Israeli diversion as an " imperialist event " that would catalyze their revolution , and Yasser Arafat began calling for war to eliminate Israel .
In the Fatah newspaper , Filastinunah , ( " our Palestine " ) Arafat ridiculed Egyptian President Nasser and other Arab leaders for their impotence , and called for effective action against Israel .
Nasser decided to found the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) as a " tame " alternative to the Fatah , and placed Ahmed Shukhairy , an ineffective and bombastic diplomat at its head .
The Syrians , who had broken with Nasser 's pan-Arabism , countered by supporting Fatah and attempted to take over the Fatah group .
Syrian army intelligence recruited terrorists for actions against Israel , giving credit for the operations to Fatah .
The first of these actions was announced on December 31 , 1964 , an attack on the Israel water carrier at Beit Netopha , but in fact no attack had taken place .
A second attempt was made on January 2 , 1965 , but the explosives charge was disarmed .
However , successful attacks soon followed on January 14 and February 28 .
These minor terrorist activities received great publicity in the Arab world , and were contrasted with the lack of action and bombastic talk of Gamal Nasser , challenging Nasser 's leadership .
This ferment is considered the catalyst of the events that brought about the 6 - day war .
It is a moot point whether it is to be attributed to Syrian rivalry with Nasser , or as Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians claim , to the Fatah movement .
Faced with the " heroic " deeds of the Palestinians under Syrian tutelage , Nasser was pushed to an increasingly bellicose stance .
In several summit conferences beginning in 1964 , Arab leaders ratified the establishment of the PLO , declared their resolve to destroy Israel , and decided to divert the sources of the Jordan river that feed the Sea of Galilee , to prevent Israel from implementing the water carrier plan .
The Syrians and Lebanese began to implement the diversions .
Israel responded by firing on the tractors and equipment doing the work in Syria , using increasingly accurate and longer range guns as the Syrians moved the equipment from the border .
This was followed by Israeli attempts to cultivate the demilitarized zones ( DMZ ) as provided in the armistice agreements .
Israel was within its rights according to the armistice agreements , but Moshe Dayan claimed many years later that 80 % of the incidents were deliberately provoked .
The Syrians responded by firing in the DMZs ( Click here for a map of the demilitarized zones ) .
When Israelis responded in force , Syria began shelling Israeli towns in the north , and the conflict escalated into air strikes .
The USSR was intent on protecting the new Ba'athist pro-Soviet government of Syria , and represented to the Syrians and Egyptians that Israel was preparing to attack Syria .
As tension rose , Syria appealed to Egypt , believing the claim of the USSR that Israel was massing troops on the Syrian border .
The claim was false and was denied by the UN .
Against this background , in Mid-May , 1967 , Egyptian President Gamal Nasser began making bellicose statements .
On May 16 , 1967 , a Radio Cairo broadcast stated : " The existence of Israel has continued too long .
We welcome the Israeli aggression .
We welcome the battle we have long awaited .
The peak hour has come .
The battle has come in which we shall destroy Israel . "
On the same day , Egypt asked for the withdrawal of the UN Emergency Force ( UNEF ) from Sinai and the Gaza Strip .
UN Secretary General U
Thant agreed to remove the troops on May 18 .
Formally , the troops could only be stationed in Egypt with Egyptian agreement .
However , for a long time it was believed that Nasser had really hoped U
Thant would not remove the troops , and that he could use the presence of the UN troops as an excuse to do nothing .
On May 23 , Nasser closed the straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping .
The United States failed to live up to its guarantees of freedom of the waterways to Israel .
A torrent of rhetoric issued from Arab capitals and in the UN .
At the UN , PLO Chairman Ahmed Shukhairy announced that " if it will be our privilege to strike the first blow " the PLO would expel from Palestine all Zionists who had arrived after 1917 and eliminate the state of Israel .
In a speech to Arab Trade Unionists on May 26 , 1967 , Nasser justified the dismissal of the UNEF , and made it clear that Egypt was prepared to fight Israel for Palestinian rights .
He also attacked the Jordanians as tools of the imperialists , stepping up the constant pressure on Jordan 's King Hussein .
Despite the bellicose rhetoric , analysts such as Avi Shlaim ( The Iron Wall ) and others believe that each country was dragged into the conflict by inter-Arab rivalry and did not contemplate a war .
Nasser never intended to attack Israel according to Shlaim .
He had been dragged into the conflict by Soviet maneuvers and Syrian fears and his need to claim leadership of the Arab world according to them .
Be that as it may , according to Michael Oren , recently declassified documents reveal that the Egyptians in fact planned to attack Israel on May 28 , 1967 .
The plan , codenamed operation Dawn , was discovered by Israel .
The Israelis told the Americans .
US President Johnson told Soviet Premier Kosygin , and Kosygin wrote to Nasser .
Nasser understood that he had lost the element of surprise and called off the attack .
Nonetheless , on May 29 , 1967 , Nasser was still speaking of confrontation with Israel .
He told members of the Egyptian National Assembly , " God will surely help and urge us to restore the situation to what it was in 1948 . "
IDF officers began pressuring the civilian establishment to declare war , because it was considered that an Arab attack might be imminent , and because Israel 's ability to maintain its army fully mobilized is limited , but Prime Minister Eshkol was reluctant to take action , and Foreign Minister Abba Eban opposed unilateral action , which he believed would be against the wishes of the United States .
Ariel Sharon now admits that he and others , including Yitzhak Rabin , had discussed the possibility of a sort of coup , in which government officials were to be locked in a room , while the army started the war , but the idea never got passed the stage of thinking out loud .
On May 30 , Jordan signed a defense pact with Egypt , readying itself for war .
Nasser stated : " The armies of Egypt , Jordan , Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel ... to face the challenge , while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq , Algeria , Kuwait , Sudan and the whole Arab nation .
This act will astound the world .
Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle , the critical hour has arrived .
We have reached the stage of serious action and not declarations . "
On June 4 , Iraq likewise joined a military alliance with Egypt and committed itself to war .
On May 31 , the Iraqi President Rahman Aref announced , " This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since 1948 .
Our goal is clear - - to wipe Israel off the map . "
US and Israeli assessments were that Israel would win any war handily , despite the huge superiority in armor , aircraft , and troops favoring the combined forces of the Arab countries .
Prior to 1967 , Israel had gotten almost no military aid from the United States .
Egypt and Syria were equipped with large quantities of the latest Soviet military equipment .
Israel 's main arms supplier was France .
On paper , Israel had almost as many aircraft as the Egyptians , but the Israeli aircraft were mostly old , and even the Super - Mirages were no match for the Mig - 21 fighters acquired by Egypt from the USSR .
On paper , the IDF had a large number of " tanks " matching or almost matching the arms of the Arab countries .
However , while Syrians and Egyptians were equipped with late model Soviet heavy tanks , many of the Israeli " tanks " were in fact tiny French AMX anti-tank vehicles , and the heavy tanks were refurbished WWII Sherman tanks fitted with diesel engines .
Israel had also been allowed to purchase about 250 M - 48 Patton tanks from Germany in 1965 .
Most of these tanks were being refitted with Diesel engines in 1967 , and the US refused an Israeli request for 100 Pattons to replace the ones that were out of service .
The Israeli and Jewish public , and some in the government , believed that there was a mortal threat to Israel .
Ten thousand graves were dug in Tel Aviv public parks in anticipation of the heavy casualties .
The Israeli government probably did not want war , and some at least were fearful of war .
Ben Gurion berated Chief of Staff Itzhak Rabin for making aggressive statements that had , according to him , escalated the conflict and gotten Israel into trouble .
Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol appeared hesitant , and stuttered in a dramatic radio speech to the nation .
Under great public pressure from opposition parties , a unity government was formed .
Foreign Minister Abba Eban tried in vain to obtain from the US a guarantee that they would reopen the straights of Tiran .
At first , President Johnson promised an international flotilla , and warned Israel not to attack on its own .
However , the US was unable to initiate any international action , and reversed its position , hinting broadly that Israel would have to handle the problem itself .
Israel could not maintain total mobilization indefinitely .
When it became apparent that Egypt would not stand down , Israel attacked the Egyptians beginning on June 5 , 1967 .
In the first hours of the war , Israel destroyed over 400 enemy aircraft to achieve total air superiority .
Israeli troops quickly conquered the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza .
Jordanian artillery began firing at Jerusalem on the first day of the war , despite a warning by Israeli PM Levi Eshkol to stay out of the war , and then the Jordan Legion advanced and took over the headquarters of the UN ( Governor 's house - Armon Hanatziv ) in Jerusalem .
After warning King Hussein repeatedly to cease fire and withdraw , Israel conquered the West Bank and Jerusalem .
During the first days of the war , Syrian artillery based in the Golan Heights pounded civilian targets in northern Israel .
After dealing with Egypt , Israel decided to conquer the Golan heights , despite opposition and doubts of some in the government , including Moshe Dayan , who had been appointed defense minister .
( see map of territories occupied in 1967 ) and despite the fact that the UN had already called for a cease fire .
Israel agreed to a cease fire on June 10 , 1967 after conquering the Golan Heights .
UN Resolution 242 called for negotiations of a permanent peace between the parties , and for Israeli withdrawal from lands occupied in 1967 .

The aftermath of the war - The 1967 6 - Day war changed the perceived balance of power in the Middle East and created a new reality .
Israel had acquired extensive territories - the Sinai desert , the Golan heights and the West Bank , that were several times larger than the 1948 borders .
( Click here to view a map of Israeli borders after the 6 day war ) .
Nasser had been able to attribute the Egyptian defeat in 1956 to British and French support of the Israelis .
Though he tried to blame the 1967 defeat on support supposedly given by the US Sixth fleet , this was clearly untrue .
According to analysts such as Fouad Ajami , the disastrous defeat of the Arabs spelled the end of the Pan - Arab approach advocated by Gamal Abdul Nasser and contributed to the rise of Islamic fundamentalism .
It should be remembered however , that Nasser and the pan-Arabists always viewed themselves as heads of the Islamic world as well as the Arab world .
While Israel had acquired territories and a military victory , it also marked a new day for Palestinian aspirations .
The defeat brought about a million Palestinian Arabs under Israeli rule .
After the war , the fate of the Palestinians came to play a large role in the Arab - Israeli struggle .
The Fatah organization ( The Movement for Liberation of Palestine ) was founded about 1957 ( though it was formalized much later ) , and the PLO ( Palestine Liberation Organization ) was founded in 1964 .
Both had the declared aim of destroying Israel .
After the 6 - day war , Ahmad Shukairy , who had headed the PLO , was replaced as chairman by Yasser Arafat who headed the Fatah .
Fatah and the PLO now had freedom of action , without the restraints of the discredited Arab regimes .
Since all parts of Palestine were now under Israeli control , Fatah actions did not directly threaten Arab governments .
In time , the Palestine Liberation Organization became recognized by all the Arab states and eventually by the UN as the representative of the Palestinian people .
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat addressed a session of the UN General Assembly in 1974 .
Israel strongly opposed the PLO because of its terrorist acts against Jews and because of its charter aims of destroying the state of Israel and expelling Jews who had arrived after 1917 .
Map of Israel - Arab Cease Fire Lines 1967
The Israeli government was undecided concerning its plans for the territories .
The United States pressured Israel to make a statement calling for withdrawal from the conquered territories in return for peace .
On June 19 , 1967 , the government decided to offer Egypt and Syria return of the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights for a peace settlement to be negotiated directly .
The offer apparently did not include the Gaza strip , and called for demilitarization of Sinai .
In the Golan , Israel offered to withdraw to the international border rather than the 1949 armistice lines , not including the territory conquered by Syria in 1948 .
J ordan and the West Bank were not mentioned .
The offer was transmitted in secret through the United States , but was turned down .
Egypt and Syria refused to negotiate with Israel .
At the request of Jordan 's King Hussein , Ya'akov Herzog met with him in the offices of his physician in London , on the evening of July 2 , 1967 .
According to Herzog 's notes of the meeting , Hussein discussed the reasons why he had been forced to go to war at length .
He said that if there were to be peace , there would have to be peace with honor , however he did not ask for peace .
He did not reply when Herzog asked him if he was offering peace , but said he would reply in time .
Israel did not have a concrete peace proposal for Jordan .
Herzog offered his private view , that there should be an economic confederation .
( This meeting is documented in Segev , Tom , Israel in 1967 ( 1967 : Veharetz shinta et paneiha - in Hebrew only ) , 2005 , pp 530-536 ) .
Religious and nationalist groups began agitating for annexation and settlement of areas in the West Bank and Golan heights .
Some government ministers including Pinchas Sapir , Zalman Aran of the Labor party and the NRP's Yaakov Shimshon Shapira feared the demographic problems that would arise from conquering all those Arabs .
Shapira also pointed out that annexing the West Bank would lend credence to claims that Israel was a colonialist enterprise .
Menachem Begin and Yigal Alon favored annexation .
Moshe Dayan proposed that the Arabs of the West Bank should be given autonomy , but Menachem Begin , who was later to favor the plan , objected .
He believed large numbers of Jews could now be brought to Israel to settle the territories , and the Arabs would be given a choice between becoming citizens or leaving .
The Mossad had proposed a Palestinian state under Israeli protection in a report dated June 14 , 1967 ( Segev , 1967 , pp 537-538 ) , but this was not accepted .
According to some sources , in the summer of 1967 , Moshe Dayan received a delegation of notables who proposed self - rule for the West Bank , but he rejected the offer .
By July 1967 , Yigal Alon had submitted his " Alon Plan " which called for Israeli retention of large parts of the West Bank in any peace settlement for strategic reasons .
An increasing number of settlements were established as it became evident that Arab states would not negotiate with Israel .
A decisive turning point was the Khartoum Arab summit , in August and September of 1967 , which seemed to shut the door on the possibility of negotiations with Israel or recognition of Israel in any form .
The Khartoum resolutions may not have been an insurmountable barrier to peace .
In 1970 , King Hussein of Jordan supposedly offered to make peace in return for Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and return of the holy places , but the offer was politely turned down .
A second landmark was the " Zionism is Racism " resolution passed by the United Nations in 1975 , which gave credibility in Israel to claims of Israeli extremists that opposition to settlements was opposition to Israel , and that Israel was essentially alone in a hostile world and could expect no justice .
The resolution was repealed in 1991 , but similar sentiments surfaced at a UN conference in Durban in 2001 .
Likewise in November 1975 , US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Harold H Saunders , told a US House Committee that the US now recognized the importance of the Palestinian national issue in the conflict , and hinted broadly that the US would be willing to facilitate a solution that took account of Palestinian rights , if the PLO would recognize the relevant UN resolutions , including Israel 's right to exist , and would be amenable to a reasonable compromise .
This policy was to bear fruit eventually in the Oslo Peace Process , after PLO Chairman Arafat announced PLO acceptance of UN Resolution 242 in 1988 .
Meanwhile however , settlement expansion became official Israeli policy after the opposition revisionist Likud party came to power in 1977 , and continued during the Oslo accords .
As of 2003 , about 220,000 Israelis had settled in areas of the West Bank and Gaza , and an additional 200,000 were settled in areas of Jerusalem and environs conquered in 1967 .
About 15,000 Jews were settled in the Golan heights taken from Syria .

The War of Attrition - After the 6 - Day war , Egyptian president Nasser launched the war of attrition on the Suez canal , breaking the cease fire .
In Israel , Prime Minister Levi Eshkol had died and was replaced by the hawkish Golda Meir .
The sides fought to a standstill in increasingly bloody exchanges that included participation by Soviet pilots on the Egyptian side .
Under US pressure , a second cease fire was signed in August 1970 , with both sides declaring officially their acceptance of UN Resolution 242 .
Nasser died shortly thereafter , and was replaced by Anwar Sadat .
Sadat tried repeatedly to interest Israel in partial peace deals in return for partial Israeli withdrawal , and the US and UN tried to mediate peace through the offices of Gunnar Jarring .
Nothing came of these peace efforts , partly owing to the stubborn attitude of Israeli PM Golda Meir , who insisted that Israeli troops would not budge until there was a peace agreement in place .
Sadat continued to alternate peace plans with threats of war , but he was not taken seriously in Israel .
Israeli army intelligence as well as the government were convinced that Israel had absolute military superiority and that Egypt would not dare to attack until it had rebuilt its army .
Therefore , the best course seemed to be to wait until the Arab countries met Israel 's terms .
The October War ( Yom Kippur War ) - In October 1973 , Egypt and Syria launched another war against Israel , after the Israeli government headed by Golda Meir rebuffed Egyptian President Anwar Sadat 's offers to negotiate a settlement .
The Egyptians crossed the Suez Canal on the afternoon of October 6 , Yom Kippur , the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar .
The Israeli government had ignored repeated intelligence warnings .
They were convinced that Israeli arms were a sufficient deterrent to any aggressor .
Sadat had twice announced his intention to go to war , but nothing had happened .
When the intelligence reports were finally believed , on the morning of the attack , PM Meir and Defense Minister Moshe Dayan decided not to mobilize reserves .
The Israelis were caught by surprise in more ways than one .
Egyptians poured huge numbers of troops across the canal unopposed and began setting up a beachhead .
The Israel Army had neglected basic maintenance tasks and drill .
As troops mustered , it became apparent that equipment was missing and tanks were out of commission .
The line of outposts built as watch posts along the Suez canal - the Bar Lev line , was used instead as a line of fortifications intended to hold off the Egyptians as long as possible .
A tiny number of soldiers faced the Egyptian onslaught and were wiped out after stubborn resistance .
The Soviets had sold the Egyptians new technology - better surface to air missiles ( SAM ) and hand held Sager anti-tank weapons .
Israel had counted on air power to tip the balance on the battlefield , and had neglected artillery .
But the air - force was initially neutralized because of the effectiveness of SAM missiles , until Israel could destroy the radar stations controlling them .
Futile counterattacks continued in Sinai for several days as Israeli divisions coped with traffic jams that prevented concentration of forces , and with effective Egyptian resistance .
Meanwhile , less than 200 Israeli tanks were left guarding the Golan heights against far superior numbers .
Syrians made serious and at first unopposed inroads in the Golan as Egyptians crossed the Suez canal and retook a strip of the Sinai peninsula .
After suffering heavily losses , Israel reconquered the Golan .

In Sinai , Israel troops crossed the canal .
General Ariel Sharon , disobeying the orders of cautious superiors , tried to run ahead of logistics and support to develop the bridgehead on the Egyptian side of the Suez canal .
This small force was reinforced after bridges were put across the canal , and the Israelis cut off the entire Egyptian third army .
( Click for map of Egyptian front )
Cease - fires ended most of the fighting within a month .
About 2,700 Israeli soldiers and 8,500 Arab soldiers died in the war As a result of the war , the Golda Meir was forced to resign as Prime Minister of Israel , making way for Yitzhak Rabin , who had been Israeli ambassador to the US and previously Chief of staff of the IDF .

Oil Embargo -
In the aftermath of the Yom Kippur war , Arab states led by Saudi Arabia declared an oil embargo , targeting the United States and the Netherlands in particular for their support for Israel .
Oil production was reduced by 340 million barrels from October to December of 1973 .
Prices soared from $ 3 to over $ 11 a barrel , due to panic stockpiling as well as actual shortages .
Oil sold to European countries eventually made its way to the United States and the Netherlands in any case , but there were nonetheless long lines for gasoline and overnight price increases .
The embargo continued until March of 1974 .
The embargo heightened the perception that Arab countries could exercise political leverage by controlling the oil supply .
It probably helped motivate European diplomatic moves that were conciliatory to the Arabs , and played a part in the invitation of Yasser Arafat to address the UN General Assembly , granting of a permanent observer status at the UN to the PLO and passage of the Zionism is Racism resolution in 1975 .
Peace With Egypt - Subsequent shuttle diplomacy by US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger resulted in partial Israeli withdrawals from the Sinai peninsula , under much less favorable terms than could have been obtained before the war .
Right - wing opposition leader Menahem Begin was adamant in his opposition to any withdrawals .
However , in 1978 , Egypt led by Anwar Sadat , and Israel , now led by Menahem Begin , signed the Camp David framework agreements , leading to a Peace treaty in 1979 .
Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula in 1982 .
The PLO in Lebanon and the Lebanese Civil War - Lebanon became increasingly unstable as Maronite Christians found their once -- dominant position threatened by demographic changes which gave Muslims an increasingly large majority .
Tensions between different religious groups were exacerbated by clan rivalry .
Lebanon also has a relatively large population of Palestinian refugees , who incurred the animosity of native Lebanese , especially the Christians .
A revolt by the PLO against the Jordanian government led to the expulsion of the PLO from Jordan in 1970 .
PLO fighters streamed into Lebanon , incited tension between Muslims and Christians and turned Lebanon into a base for attacks on Israel .
In 1975 , an attack by Christian Phalangist militias on a bus carrying Palestinians ignited the civil war .
the Christian Phalangists and Muslim militias massacred at least 600 Muslims and Christians at checkpoints , beginning the 1975 - 1976 civil war .
Full - scale civil war broke out , with the Palestinians joining the Muslim forces , controlling an increasingly lawless West Beirut .
Lebanese political and social life descended into chaos , characterized by a grim routine of car bombs , assassinations and harassment and killing of civilians at roadblocks set up by warring militias .
On January 20 , 1976 , PLO fighters , possibly reinforced by a Syrian PLO contingent that had entered Lebanon in 1975 , destroyed the Christian towns of Jiyeh and Damour , massacring about 500 people .
In March , Major Saad Haddad formed the Southern Lebanese Army ( SLA ) , a militia intended to protect Christian residents of southern Lebanon , which was allied with Israel In June , 1976 , with the Maronites on the verge of defeat , President Elias Sarkis called for Syrian intervention .
With the agreement of the Americans and the Israelis , the Syrians entered Lebanon ostensibly to protect the Christians and the fragile Lebanese multi-ethnic multi-religious constitution , but also to further long - standing Baathist ambitions to make Lebanon as part of Greater Syria .
On August 13 , 1976 , under the protection and with the probable active participation of the Syrian army , the Christian Phalangist militia attacked the Tel al - Za'atar refugee camp and killed as many as 3,000 civilians .
After an attack on a bus on the Haifa - Tel - Aviv road , in which about thirty people were killed , Israel invaded Lebanon in March 1978 .
It occupied most of the area south of the Litani River in Operation Litani .
In response , UN Security Council resolution 425 called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces and the creation of an UN Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) , charged with maintaining peace .
Israeli forces turned over positions inside Lebanon along the border to the SLA .
The SLA and Israel set up a 12 - mile wide security zone to protect Israeli territory from attacks across the border , and to protect local residents from the PLO , which had been occupying their villages and using them as bases for shelling Israel .
This southern area became an " open border " area separated by the " good fence , " allowing Lebanese residents to find work in Israel .
Attacks and counter attacks along the northern border of Israel continued .
In July of 1981 a cease - fire between Israel and the PLO was brokered by the US .
It was generally honored by both sides .
Nonetheless , the PLO continued to gather strength and dig in in southern Lebanon .
The 1982 War in Lebanon ( Peace for the Galilee ) - On June 3 1982 , terrorists of the Abu Nidal faction , not controlled by the PLO , shot Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov in the head in London .
In response , Israel invaded Lebanon in force .
Most analysts believe that the shooting of Argov served only as an excuse for an operation planned by defense Minister Ariel Sharon with the tacit approval of the US administration .
The Iranian Islamist regime sent its Pasdaran revolutionary guards , who had previously organized the takeover of the US embassy in Teheran , into Lebanon , and began organizing a resistance movement , The Hizb Allah ( party of Allah ) or Hizbolla .
The Israel invasion resulted in expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon to Tunis in August .
The war aroused furor in Israel as the army exceeded the official war aims .
On September 14 , 1982 , the Lebanese President - elect , Bashir Gemayel , an Israeli ally , was killed by a large bomb that was apparently planted by Syrian intelligence .
Ostensibly to maintain order , the Israeli government decided to move into West Beirut .
They allowed or sent their Lebanese Phalangist Christian allies into the Sabra and Shatilla Palestinian refugee camps .
The Phalangists committed a massacre in Sabra and Shatilla , killing about 700 people and exciting the wrath of the international community as well as the Israeli public .
An Israeli commission of inquiry led by judge Kahan indirectly implicated Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and several others in the massacres , noting that they could have foreseen the possibility of the violence and acted to prevent it .
The Kahan report resulted in the resignation of Sharon as defense minister .
Israel subsequently extricated itself slowly from Lebanon .
As Israel withdrew , Lebanon became increasingly lawless .
Beirut life came to be characterized by gunfire , kidnappings and bombings .
Attempts by the US to restore order failed owing to large scale suicide bombings of a marine barracks and the US embassy .
The US withdrew and Lebanon , especially Beirut , deteriorated into chaos .
Order was restored only after Lebanon became essentially a satellite of Syria .
Israel continued to maintain a presence in south Lebanon until 2000 , when the last Israeli troops were withdrawn by PM Ehud Barak .
The Pollard Affair - In November 1985 , Jonathan Pollard , a Jewish - American employee of the US Naval Anti-Terrorist Alert Center was arrested for spying for Israel .
He pleaded guilty in a plea bargain deal , but the US government apparently reneged on the deal and Pollard was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987 , an exceptional sentence relative to similar cases .
The affair was a severe embarrassment to US - Israeli relations and raised the specter of " double loyalty " accusations for American Jews .
At the same time , Pollard became a cause celebre of the Zionist right , who pointed out that he had been used and abandoned by the Israeli government , which did little to secure his freedom .
The First Intifada -
While the fortunes of the PLO waned , Palestinians in the occupied territories took their fate into their own hands .
Beginning in 1987 , a revolt called the Intifadeh began in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank .
The revolt was initiated by local residents and involved mostly low - level violence such as rock throwing , winning sympathy for the struggle of the Palestinians against the Israeli occupiers .
By 1991 the Intifadeh had all but ended , but massive Israeli repression in this period laid the seeds for future violence ( see First Intifada ) .

Since LtU members are so knowledgable on programming languages , why do n't we design the ( ultimate ) programming language ?
let 's all post our suggestions here to make a lean - and - mean programming language .
It would be a experiment filled with fun .
I can make the compiler , if a ' standard ' comes out of this .
I apologise if this has been proposed before ( and obviously failed , since there is nothing out ) .
My initial suggestions are two :
1 ) put as less as possible into the compiler .
Make the language so versatile that all high - level concepts can be easily done with the core constructs .
2 ) the lowest level of the language should map directly to the hardware , i.e. must be some kind of assembly , in order to allow for very low - level programming .
But the language should be versatile enough as to provide the means for doing layers upon layers of abstraction , so one chooses the appropriate level of abstraction for each particular type of application .
How Well Can One Know Another ?
Even Oneself ?
One reason why government planning and control so often fail is that much of the economy is hidden from view .
Castrato singers such as Farinelli were adored by female fans ( Picture courtesy of the Royal College of Music )
Scholars in the northern Italian city of Bologna will measure his skull and bones and perform DNA tests .
Farinelli was among thousands of boys castrated to preserve their high - pitched voices as they grew up .
Castrati singers were popular in Europe from the 16th Century until 1870 when the operation was banned .
The castrato 's voice was prized for its combination of pitch and power - an unbroken male voice able to reach the highest notes , delivered by the powerful lungs of a fully - grown man .
In 17th and 18th Century Italy , up to 4,000 boys a year , often from poor families , were castrated from the age of eight upwards .
They became opera singers and soloists in church choirs and royal palaces .
Very few actually went on to achieve success , but those who did became the pop stars of their day , and they behaved as such .
Training schedule
Farinelli , born Carlo Broschi in 1705 , was the most famous castrato of all .
Notoriously temperamental , he was buried in Bologna in 1782 dressed as a knight from the days of chivalry .
His remains will be examined at Bologna University by scholars who will try to find out more about his vocal mechanism , and the effects of his intensive musical training schedule on the shape of his body .
The team of scientists includes an acoustics expert , who is expected to study remains of vocal cords and larynx to discover what gave castrati such vocal range and power .
DNA tests will be conducted to try to determine what he ate and what diseases he had .
The project has been organised by the Farinelli Study Centre in Bologna , a group of scholars hoping to raise awareness of the singer 's achievements .
They tend to make their changes as small surgical changes that affect the component as little as possible .
And the more these surgical changes add up , the more fragile the code gets .
As these changes build up , the code in the component starts to resemble a piece of conglomerate rock .
The more people add onto the base , the more blobs of other rocks get added to the conglomerate .
When I work on the code like this , it sometimes feels like I ’m an archaeologist digging through the layers of an ancient city – if you pay really close attention , you can see which developers wrote which portions of the code .

サンフランシスコ発-- Googleの幹 部Marissa Mayer氏は米国時間11月9日、当地で開催中のWeb 2.0 Summitで 、Google Videoが成功を収められなかった分野でYouTubeが成功した理由について、ユーザーが自分の投稿したビデオをすぐに見ることができたからだ、と語った。
検索プロダクト＆ユーザーエクスペリエンス担当バイスプレジデントであるMayer氏は短い講演のなかで「YouTubeでは自分のビデオをすぐに見られる。成功の理由はそこだった」と語った。
これとは対照的に 、Google Videoに投稿したビデオは、審査を行って一般公開されるまでに2〜4日かかっていたと、Mayer氏は語っている。
Googleは 、YouTubeを16億5000万ドルの株式交換で買収することを10月に発表している。
Mayer氏は 、Googleが検索に関するユーザーアンケート調査を行い、デフォルトで何件の検索結果が表示されるとうれしいかを尋ねたときの失敗談を披露した。アンケートでは、多くの人が検索結果は多ければ多いほど良いと回答したという。そこで同社は、一部の検索に対し、結果を30件表示する実験を行った。しかし、検索結果を10件表示していたときより、30件表示するときの方が、応答時間が平均0.5秒長くなってしまった。結果、待ち時間に耐えられなくなったユーザーは検索を控えるようになってしまったという。
Mayer氏は、 「 これは非常に残念な結果だった。表示する検索結果を変えてはいけないことは明らかだった」と語っている。
同氏は 、Googleはこの経験を自社のすべての製品開発に活かしたと述べる。「われわれがGmailでAJAX（Asynchronous JavaScript and XML）を用いることにした最大の理由は、スピードだった」（Mayer氏）。AJAXは、インタラクティブなウェブアプリケーションを開発するための手法。
Googleはあるとき 、Google Mapsのページが100キロバイト以上にまで膨れ上がっていることに気づいたという。「そこでGoogle Mapsのスリム化を図り、容量を20〜30％にまで圧縮した」と同氏は述べ、変更に対するユーザーの反応は好意的だったと述べた。
インターネットユーザーは、すぐに結果を得られないサイトから去っていくと、同氏はいう。Web 2.0アプリケーションの成功の鍵を握るのは、スピードであるというのが同氏の結論だ。
Mayer氏はまた、モバイル分野での改良が必要であると述べる。モバイル端末のデータ転送速度は遅く、データの入力や、ウェブアプリケーションからの応答には時間がかかると同氏はいう。
「 Google Maps for Mobileのようなアプリケーションは優れたプログラムだが、動きが鈍すぎる。スピードを高めるための改良が必要だ」（Mayer氏）

( CNN ) -- Despite politicians ' complaints about judges having too much power , two - thirds of Americans do not believe elected officials should have more control over federal judges , according to a new CNN poll released Saturday .
Sixty - seven percent of 1,013 people surveyed by Opinion Research Corp. on behalf of CNN said federal judges -- and the decisions they make -- should not be subject to more control .
Only 30 percent said they should .
( See the poll results )
Both a current and former Supreme Court justice told CNN they are not unaware of the criticism aimed at them , but they said such criticism is an integral part of life in a democracy .
" As I went through the last few years of service here at the court , I saw increasing indicator of unhappiness with judges , " said retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor .
But that unhappiness is a consequence of an independent judiciary , said Justice Stephen Breyer .
" It comes from the necessity that someone have the last word .
And since for 200 years , people have thought in this country that the best guarantee that minorities will not be oppressed , that the Constitution will be lived up to , is to give the very last word to a group of judges who are independent , " he said .
" Not because they are wiser -- they make mistakes -- but because , by giving them the last word , there is a better guarantee of that neutrality , insulated from politics , that can help those whom the Constitution wanted to help , that minority that might be oppressed . "
Forty - one percent of poll respondents said federal judges were " about right " in their decisions .
Thirty - four percent said they are too liberal , and 20 percent said they are too conservative .
The sampling error for the poll questions was 3 percentage points .
" The fact is , once I 'm appointed , I 'm not a judge for one group or another group , " Breyer told CNN .
" And when I write a dissent or when I write a majority [ opinion ] , the people that disagree with me the most , I 'm their justice , too .
I have to remember that .
I can't write in a way that will please [ everybody ] .
I know I can't .
It 's a big country . "
But , Breyer said , America 's strength comes in part because of our ability to follow even the most hotly contested rulings .
" We 've learned as a nation to follow decisions even when we think they 're wrong , " he said .
" And in a country of 300 million people and ... 900 million points of view , that is a national treasure . "

Are you one of those people who never forgets a face ?
New research from Vanderbilt University suggests that we can remember more faces than other objects and that faces " stick " the best in our short - term memory .
The reason may be that our expertise in remembering faces allows us to package them better for memory .
" Our results show that we can store more faces than other objects in our visual short - term memory , " Gauthier , associate professor of psychology and the study 's co-author , says .
" We believe this happens because of the special way in which faces are encoded . "
Kim Curby , the study 's primary author and a post - doctoral researcher at Yale University , likens such encoding to packing a suitcase .
" How much you can fit in a bag depends on how well you pack it , " she says .
" In the same way , our expertise in ' packaging ' faces means that we can remember more of them . "
The findings , part of Curby 's dissertation at Vanderbilt , are currently in press at the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review .
Curby and Gauthier 's research has practical implications for the way we use visual short - term memory or VSTM .
" Being able to store more faces in VSTM may be very useful in complex social situations , " Gauthier says .
" This opens up the possibility of training people to develop similarly superior VSTM for other categories of objects , " Curby adds .
Short - term memory is crucial to our impression of a continuous world , serving as temporary storage for information that we are currently using .
For example , in order to understand this sentence , your short - term memory will remember the words in the beginning while you read through to the end .
VSTM is a component of short - term memory that helps us process and briefly remember images and objects , rather than words and sounds .
VSTM allows us to remember objects for a few seconds , but its capacity is limited .
Curby 's and Gauthier 's new research focuses on whether we can store more faces than other objects in VSTM , and the possible mechanisms underlying this advantage .
Participants studied up to five faces on a screen for varying lengths of time ( up to four seconds ) .
A single face was later presented and participants decided if this was a face that was part of the original display .
For a comparison , the process was repeated with other objects , like watches or cars .
Curby and Gauthier found that when participants studied the displays for only a brief amount of time ( half a second ) , they could store fewer faces than objects in VSTM .
They believe this is because faces are more complex than watches or cars and require more time to be encoded .
Surprisingly , when participants were given more time to encode the images ( four seconds ) , an advantage for faces over objects emerged .
The researchers believe that our experience with faces explains this advantage .
This theory is supported by the fact that the advantage was only obtained for faces encoded in the upright orientation , with which we are most familiar .
Faces that were encoded upside - down showed no advantage over other objects .
" Our work is the first to show an advantage in capacity for faces over other objects , " Gauthier explained .
" Our results suggest that because experience leads you to encode upright faces in a different manner ( not only using the parts , but using the whole configuration ) you can store more faces in VSTM . "
" What 's striking about this is that some of the most prominent , current theories suggest that the capacity of VSTM is set in stone , unalterable by experience , " Curby said .
" However , our results clearly show that expert learning impacts VSTM capacity . "
Curby and Gauthier plan to continue their research on VSTM processes .
Their next step will focus on comparing VSTM capacity in people who are experts for other categories of complex objects , such as cars .
Later , they will utilize brain imaging to pinpoint the mechanisms in the brain by which faces are encoded more efficiently than other objects .

The unofficial wikipedia blog entry The Future of Open Source Five Years Ago makes some fascinating comparisons between the adoption rate of Linux and the adoption rate of Wikipedia .
Server - side Linux is still a powerful force , but what happened to the desktop utopia that was supposed to unseat Windows ?
And will the same developed - world disenchantment hit Wikipedia as it grows ?
While in principle anyone can contribute to an open source project , Linux 's barriers to entry are higher than Wikipedia's .
Even correcting minor Linux bugs is well beyond my expertise , but my grandmother could edit Wikipedia .
All you need is an internet connection and literacy ( mid - level literacy , at that ; other people will fix your grammar and spelling ) .
Wikipedia can draw on half a billion potential contributors ; only about 100,000 people can code Linux .
It 's hard to overstate this difference .
To illustrate this point , it 's accompanied by an amusing graph .
I 've resized the graph to a more manageable size .
Click through to see it full size .
The writing on the bars is hard to make out .
On the left , it 's ..
Number of programmers who can contribute to Linux , including minor bugfixes .
And on the right ?
Number of people in the world who speak English well enough to edit Wikipedia and who have access to the internet .
( This includes non-native speakers .
It omits potential contributors to non English - language wikipedias only because this bar is already absurdly tall .
( Okay , and because wikipedias of seperate languages are , to some degree , islands , and do n't function as a cohesive whole . ) )
It 's probably not fair to compare programming and writing in this manner , but I am reminded again of Joel Spolsky 's classic advice for computer science college students :
The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know , and it's not whether they prefer Python or Java .
It 's whether they can communicate their ideas .
By persuading other people , they get leverage .
By writing clear comments and technical specs , they let other programmers understand their code , which means other programmers can use and work with their code instead of rewriting it .
Absent this , their code is worthless .
By writing clear technical documentation for end users , they allow people to figure out what their code is supposed to do , which is the only way those users can see the value in their code .
There 's a lot of wonderful , useful code buried on sourceforge somewhere that nobody uses because it was created by programmers who do n't write very well ( or do n't write at all ) , and so nobody knows what they 've done and their brilliant code languishes .
Programming , like all writing , is just another form of communication .
Writing code that the compiler understands is easy .
Writing code that other people understand is far more difficult .
And that 's assuming you 're persuasive enough to convince other people that your code , in a world positively overflowing with free code , is worth looking at in the first place .
Good luck .
You 're gonna need it .
Over the next few years , Wikipedia ( and some of its Wikimedia sister sites ) will become comparable to Linux in economic and social significance .
Maybe Linux will catch up again a few decades later , if schools start teaching as many kids to program as they teach to write .
This quote was originally written in August 2005 .
I 'd argue that Wikipedia was already more significant to the average internet user than Linux at that time .
Now there 's no question .
Technical programming skills are certainly important .
But general writing and communication skills are far , far more important .
Even if you 're merely a humble programmer .
RSS and Atom
People who generate syndication feeds have a choice of feed formats .
As of mid-2005 , the two most likely candidates will be RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 .
The purpose of this page is to summarize , as clearly and simply as possible , the differences between the RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 syndication languages .
Contents
Major / Qualitative Differences
Deployment
2005/07/21 : RSS 2.0 is widely deployed and Atom 1.0 only by a few early adopters , see KnownAtomFeeds and KnownAtomConsumers .
2006/01/22 : Atom 1.0 in basic form is widely supported .
Many aggregators fail on feeds that do not resemble the structure of an RSS 2.0 feed closely .
However , several have accepted bug reports , and a few have even released fixes .
See ConformanceTests for current status .
2006/05/21 : Atom 1.0 is widely supported in major consumer feed - reading applications , the notable exception being Bloglines .
2006/06/20 : Bloglines rolled out its new Atom 1.0 parser , so now Atom 1.0 is widely supported in all major consumer feed - reading applications .
Specifications
The RSS 2.0 specification is copyrighted by Harvard University and is frozen .
No significant changes can be made ( although the specification is under a Creative Commons licence ) and it is intended that future work be done under a different name ;
Atom is one example of such work .
Atom 1.0 is specified in RFC 4287 ( HTML Version ) ; it represents the consensus of the Atompub Working Group within the IETF , as reviewed and approved by the IETF community and the Internet Engineering Steering Group .
The specification is structured in such a way that the IETF could conceivably issue further versions or revisions of this specification without breaking existing deployments , although there is no commitment , nor currently expressed interest , in doing so .
See the Extensibility section below for how each can be extended without changing the underlying specifications .
Publishing Protocols
There are two popular protocols widely used with RSS , MetaWeblog and Blogger .
There are frequent reports of problems with interoperability and feature shortcomings .
The Atompub working group is in the late stages of developing the Atom Publishing Protocol , which is closely integrated with the Atom feed format and is based on the experience with the existing protocols .
Required Content
RSS 2.0 requires feed - level title , link , and description .
RSS 2.0 does not require that any of the fields of individual items in a feed be present .
Atom 1.0 requires that both feeds and entries include a title ( which may be empty ) , a unique identifier , and a last - updated timestamp .
Payload
RSS 2.0 may contain either plain text or escaped HTML , with no way to indicate which of the two is provided .
Escaped HTML is ugly ( for example , the string “ AT&T ” would be expressed as AT&amp ; T ) and has been a source of difficulty for implementors .
The content model for titles is underspecified ; titles containing angle brackets or ampersands will be misinterpreted by a significant fraction of readers regardless of how they are represented .
The RSS 2.0 content model does not permit actual well - formed XML markup , which reduces the re-usability of content .
Atom has a carefully - designed payload container .
Content must be explicitly labeled as one of :
plain text , with no markup ( the default )
escaped HTML , as commonly used with RSS 2.0
well - formed XHTML markup
some other XML vocabulary
base64 - encoded binary content
a pointer to Web content not included in the feed
There is no guarantee that the recipient will be able to do anything useful with arbitrary XML or binary content .
However , it is guaranteed that recipients will not inappropriately attempt to process content they cannot .
Full or Partial Content
RSS 2.0 has a < description > element which is commonly used to contain either the full text of an entry or just a synopsis ( sometimes in the same feed ) , and which sometimes is absent .
There is no built - in way to signal whether the contents are complete .
Atom has separate < summary > and < content > elements .
The summary is encouraged for accessibility reasons if the content is non-textual ( e.g. audio ) or non-local ( i.e. identified by pointer ) .
Autodiscovery
RSS autodiscovery has been implemented several times in different ways , often relies on unregistered ( thus invalid ) application / rss+xml MIME type , and has never been standardized .
This is a common source of difficulty for non-technical users .
Atom standardizes autodiscovery .
The application / atom+xml MIME
Type is registered with IANA .
Additionally , Atom feeds contain a “ self ” pointer , so a newsreader can auto - subscribe given only the contents of the feed , based on Web - standard dispatching techniques .
Extraction and Aggregation
The only recognized form of RSS 2.0 is an < rss > document .
Atom 1.0 allows standalone Atom Entry documents ; these could be transferred using any network protocol , for example XMPP .
Atom also has support for aggregated feeds , allowing entries to point back to the feed they came from when they are included into other feeds .
Differences of Degree
Extensibility
RSS 2.0 is not in an XML namespace but may contain elements from other XML namespaces .
There is no central place where one can find out about many popular extensions , such as dc:creator and content : encoded .
Atom 1.0 is in an XML namespace and may contain elements or attributes from other XML namespaces .
There are specific guidelines on how to interpret extension elements .
Additionally , there will be an IANA managed directory of < link rel= " " > values .
Finally , Atom 1.0 provides recommended extension points and guidance on how to interpret simple extensions .
URIs
RSS 2.0 does not specify the handling of relative URI references .
Different feed readers implement differing heuristics for their interpretation .
There is no interoperability .
In practice , relative URI references cannot be used in RSS feeds .
Atom 1.0 specifies use of the XML 's built - in xml : base attribute for allowing the use of relative references .
Software Libraries ( Parsing , Generating )
Both RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 feeds can be accessed via standard HTTP client libraries .
Standard caching techniques work well and are encouraged .
Template - driven creation of both formats is quite practical .
Libraries for processing RSS 2.0 :
Libraries for processing Atom 1.0 :
Language Tagging
For identification of the language used in feeds , RSS 2.0 has its own < language > element , while Atom uses XML 's built - in xml:lang attribute .
Digital Signature / Encryption
RSS 2.0 can be encrypted or signed like any other web content , if treated as a bag of bits .
Rules for applying standard XML Encryption and XML Digital Signature on entries are included in Atom 1.0 .
Alternatively , the feed can be encrypted or signed , like RSS 2.0 , as a bag of bits .
Authors
RSS 2.0 provides the ability to specify email addresses for a feed ’s < managing Editor > and < webMaster > , and for an item ’s < author > .
Some publishers prefer not to share email addresses , and use < dc:creator > from the dublin core extension instead .
Atom 1.0 provides < author > and < contributor > elements at both the feed and entry level .
These elements must contain a name , and also have optional email and URI sub-elements .
Categories
RSS 2.0 categories have two parts : label and domain .
Atom 1.0 categories have three , with the addition of optional human - readable title .
Schema
The RSS 2.0 specification includes no schema .
Atom 1.0 includes a ( non-normative ) ISO - Standard RelaxNG schema , to support those who want to check the validity of data advertised as Atom 1.0 .
Other schema formats can be generated from the RelaxNG schema .

But what about this :
What if trees in addition to taking in Co2 also emit a greenhouse gas of their own ?
That scenario is sketched in a new study by European scientists , which , if confirmed , would be one of the biggest upheavals in climate science for years .
It would also inflict a serious blow to Kyoto , one of whose key pillars is the faith in " sinks , " as forests are called in the treaty 's jargon .
Until now , the mainstream belief is that atmospheric methane chiefly comes from bugs : from bacteria working in wet , oxygen - less conditions , such as swamps and rice paddies .
But in a study published in Nature , a team led by Frank Keppler of the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg , Germany , found that living plants , as well as dried leaves and grass , emitted methane in the presence of air .
Nor is this gas just a piffling amount .
The researchers roughly estimate the world 's living vegetation emits between 62 million and 236 million tonnes of methane a year , and plant litter adds one to seven million tonnes .
This would be equivalent to between 10 and 30 per cent of all annual global emissions of methane .
The evidence comes from a series of carefully controlled experiments in the lab and in the field , in which gas chromatography and sensors to monitor carbon - 13 isotopes detected and measured methane flows from the vegetation .
The ambient atmosphere was first stripped of background methane before being pumped into enclosed tanks surrounding the plants and leaves in order to get a better chance of spotting the vegetal gas emissions .
Levels of methane were " very temperature sensitive , " with concentrations approximately doubling with every 10 degrees centigrade rise in temperature in a range between 30 degrees centigrade and 70 degrees centigrade , a phenomenon that suggests that breakdown by enzymes is not the cause .
In a review of the study , New Zealand atmospheric scientist David Lowe said the findings were a surprise but in fact could explain a nagging puzzle .
Between 1990 and 2000 , satellite monitors had detected a slowing of methane flows to the atmosphere by around 20 million tonnes a year .
The cause for this may have been the dramatic rate of deforestation during the same period , Lowe suggested .
From 1990 - 2000 , more than 12 per cent of the world 's tropical forests were hacked down .
Added to this is the anecdotal data from satellite sensors , which have occasionally spotted inexplicably large plumes of methane over old tropical forests , said Lowe .
The study does not seek to explain exactly how the methane is emitted , nor suggest which plant species may emit more than others .
Nor does it challenge scientific opinion on global warming , which has become rock - hard over the past five years and is now questioned only by a small minority .
The consensus is that the global warming is a fact and may already be affecting Earth 's climate , and the big culprit is the billions of tonnes of Co2 spewed out by burning oil , gas and coal .
The paper 's earliest impact could be political , for it attacks one of Kyoto 's conceptual cores .
Under the protocol 's notoriously complex rulebook , industrialised signatories that plant forests can offset the supposed benefit against their national quotas of Co2 .
The " sink " mechanism hobbled efforts to complete Kyoto in 2001 as Russia , Japan and Canada demanded concessions for their forest industries .
Ironically , " sinks " were initially demanded by the United States under the Clinton administration in order to save costs for the oil - dependent US economy .
President George W Bush then abandoned Kyoto in March 2001 , in one of his first acts in office .
Scientists have frequently shaken their heads at the perceived benefits of forests in the global warming equation .
Previous research has already suggested that Co2 storage goes into reverse when a forest matures and its older trees die and rot , surrendering their carbon to the air .
Now doubts over " sinks " have been strengthened , which could mean the extraordinarily bedevilling issue could be opened up again .
Negotiations on Kyoto 's commitments , after 2012 , are due to start by May and are expected to last several years .
" We now have the spectre that new forests might increase greenhouse warming through methane emissions rather than decrease it by being sinks for Co2 , " Lowe said ruefully .

Kenneth Catania , of the School of Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee , has discovered a previously unknown behaviour that enables two species of mammals to use their sense of smell underwater .
The star - nosed mole and the water shrew are semi-aquatic mammals ; they are primarily terrestrial , but spend a great deal of time underwater foraging for food .
Semi-aquatic mammals were believed to be unable to smell underwater , because their sense organs are adapted for land .
Catania first laid down underwater scent trails which led to food .
The animals were then filmed with high - speed cameras as they followed the scent trails .
It was found that both species exhale small bubbles of air onto objects or a scent trails they encounter while foraging underwater .
The bubbles are then drawn back into the nose , so that odorant molecules in the air contained within the bubbles are wafted over the olfactory receptors .
When an earthworm scent was laid down , the five moles and two shrews tested followed it accurately 85 % of the time .
Fish scents were followed to a similar degree of accuracy .
The bubbles exhaled by the mole and the shrew were 0.06 - 0.1 milliltres in volume .
Both species exhaled and inhaled between 8 and 12 bubbles every second .
( Watch a film clip of a water shrew doing the same thing here )
The nose of the star - nosed mole is one of the most sensitive organs in the animal kingdom , and is used like an ultra-sensitive hand , to feel objects and obtain tactile information about them .
When a fine mesh was used to prevent the mole ’s exhaled bubbles from coming into contact with the scent trails , the accuracy with which the animals followed the scents dropped to about 50 % , confirming that the mole can indeed smell by blowing bubbles , and suggesting that it has to come into contact with , or at least come into close proximity to , a scent trail in order to smell it while underwater .
These findings show that the assumtion that olfaction is useless underwater is incorrect , and raise the possibilty that other aquatic mammals also have the ability to smell underwater .
Fertility specialists revealed new evidence yesterday that male fertility declines with age as they warned that men's lack of awareness of their own biology may be playing a part in low birthrates .
The warning comes as a Guardian / ICM poll highlights a shift in attitudes towards childbearing in Britain , in which low birthrates are blamed by many couples on a desire to further their careers and live comfortably .
The poll revealed that while the vast majority of people understood the importance of a woman's age in achieving a successful pregnancy , many couples started trying for a family later in life regardless .
In the latest research , IVF experts studied the often neglected question of whether a man's age affects the chances of a couple having children .
They concluded that while the age of 35 should be considered the " amber light " in a woman 's reproductive life , men reach a similar milestone at 40 .
The researchers , from fertility clinics across France , examined rates of successful pregnancies in 1,938 couples from 59 clinics .
The study showed that a woman younger than 30 was 25 % less likely to conceive if her male partner was 40 or older than if he was of similar age .
And if the woman was 35 to 37 , she was twice as likely not to conceive as to have a successful pregnancy if her partner was 40 or older .
Writing in the journal Fertility and Sterility , Elise de La Rochebrochard , who led the study at the French National Institute for Demographic Studies , said : " Our results provide , for the first time , strong evidence for a paternal age effect on failure to conceive that is linked only to biological male ageing . "
She added : " In reproduction , age must no longer be considered as the concern of the woman , but as that of the couple .
Similar to maternal age over 35 years , paternal age over 40 years is a key risk factor for reproduction . "
Allan Pacey , the secretary of the British Fertility Society and senior lecturer at Sheffield University , said the evidence for male fertility dropping with age was beginning to stack up .
A previous study had revealed a greater risk of Down 's syndrome in children born to older fathers .
" Women seem to be more attuned to their biological clocks , " he said .
" With men the clock seems to tick more slowly , but often I do n't think they hear it at all . "
Dr Pacey said the government should tackle the problem by broadening sexual education to include advice on starting families .
" What we 're very good at in schools is getting the message across about sexually transmitted diseases and early pregnancy , but what we 're not so good at is explaining when is the best time to have family . "

The cache of weapons was stolen two weeks ago
The occupation was carried out by 1,500 troops with support from helicopters and tanks but failed to recover any of the weapons .
The army says it will continue to mount further operations to find the weapons .
The occupation led to daily shootouts with armed drug gangs which left several people injured .
The troops withdrew from the slums they had occupied , in some places to the explosion of fireworks set off by members of drugs gangs .
Over the last nine days there have been frequent exchanges of automatic weapons fire between the two with at least four people injured .
Despite the massive operations the soldiers did not find the 10 assault rifles stolen from a military base that they were looking for .
Critical report
The army says it will continue to mount more targeted raids and search in co-ordination with the police until the weapons are recovered .
This is not the first time Rio's police has come in for criticism
Amnesty International and other groups have released a highly critical report about the military style tactics used by Rio's police .
In particular , the report criticises the use of special armoured vehicles which , it says , killed 11 people in just five months last year .
The vehicles are painted black and have a picture of a skull impaled on a sword .
Amnesty says they go into slums shooting at random and using loudspeakers to intimidate the population .
Human rights groups want the police to switch tactics towards community policing to try to reduce the high levels of violence in the deeply divided city .
I attended a lecture by Larry Lessig on Creative Commons on Friday afternoon .
Many of you have probably seen Larry 's stump speech and the remixes in it are simply amazing .
So I woke up this morning with an urge to remix something myself .
And the perfect tool is a new service called JamGlue .
JamGlue is in closed beta , but I saw the company at the Ycombinator event in Boston in August and they gave me access to it .
Jamglue is like the CCmixter service that Creative Commons developed , but I think its easier to use and has the potential to be a lot more popular .
Here 's my remix .

Eliteuniversitäten sind Ausdruck der gesellschaftlichen Spaltung Peter Nowak
Ein Gespräch mit dem Soziologen und Eliteforscher Michael Hartmann
Professor Dr. Michael Hartmann lehrt Soziologie an der Technischen Universität Darmstadt .
Von ihm erschien 2004 bei Campus das Buch Elitesoziologie .
Die Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft hat drei Spitzenuniversitäten im süddeutschen Raum gekürt .
Sind das erste Spuren einer konservativen Bildungspolitik ?
Michael Hartmann : Nein , das hat mit parteipolitischen Erwägungen nichts zu tun .
Die Auszeichnung ist eine nahtlose Fortsetzung der rot-grünen Bildungspolitik .
Es geht letztlich darum , im deutschen Hochschulwesen zwei Lager zu bilden : Ca. 25 Prozent der Universitäten sollen vor allem Forschung betreiben und besonders ausgestattet werden .
Der große Rest von 75 Prozent soll kaum noch forschen , sondern die in den nächsten Jahren drastisch zunehmenden Massen an Studierenden möglichst schnell durchschleusen .
Was bedeutet das für die Studienbedingungen bei dieser Mehrheit der Hochschulen ?
Michael Hartmann : Sie geraten in eine Abwärtsspirale .
Das kann man jetzt schon in Zeitungsmeldungen sehen , wo von einer Bundesliga für Universitäten gesprochen wird .
Diejenigen , die in der ersten Liga spielen , sollen dann deutlich mehr Geld bekommen .
Der Rektor der Uni München spricht von einer Mrd. Euro für die zwei bis drei besten .
Der große Rest dagegen soll sich mit noch weniger Mitteln als schon heute begnügen .
Stecken hinter dieser Politik ökonomische Notwendigkeiten ?
Michael Hartmann : Nur zum Teil .
Durch die Finanzpolitik , wie z.B. die Steuergeschenke für große Unternehmen , sind die Einnahmen des Staates in den letzten Jahren spürbar gesunken .
Der daraus resultierende Zwang zum Sparen ist für die Forschung auf Dauer aber untragbar .
Mit der Aufspaltung in wenige Forschungsuniversitäten und den Rest versucht man , die Forschung im Kern zu retten , ohne nennenswert mehr Geld auszugeben .
Dabei muss betont werden , dass es sich bei den leeren Kassen nicht um einen ökonomischen Sachzwang , sondern um die Folgen einer bestimmten Politik handelt .
Gerade in Deutschland war durch die 68er - Bewegung der Elitebegriff verpönt .
Wann kam der Umschwung ?
Michael Hartmann : Die Zäsur setzte Ende der 80er Jahre ein und war den veränderten Kräfteverhältnis zwischen Kapital und Arbeit geschuldet .
Die gesellschaftlichen Kreise , die schon immer für eine Elite waren , haben das dann auch wieder öffentlich vertreten .
Das wurde dann von den Medien verstärkt , die auf das Thema ansprangen .
Hinzu kam nach 1989 ein bestimmter Elitebegriff aus der ehemaligen DDR .
Dort gab es beispielsweise Elite - Sportschulen .
Die existierten dort zwar unter anderen gesellschaftlichen Bedingungen .
Doch dadurch setzte auch eine Enttabuisierung des Begriffes ein .
Ich habe das Gefühl , dass dadurch auch in der ehemaligen DDR eine Akzeptanz für Elite - Hochschulen vorhanden ist .
Ist es mehr als ein zeitlicher Zufall , dass parallel zur Förderung der Elite - Hochschulen eine verstärkte Diskussion um die Unterklassen begonnen hat ?
Michael Hartmann : Durchaus nicht .
Die Spaltung im Hochschulwesen ist Ausdruck einer gesamtgesellschaftlichen Entwicklung und hat auch gesamtgesellschaftliche Auswirkungen .
Das fängt bei Schulen an , wo die Diskussion über die Einführung von Rankings schon begonnen hat .
Die Spaltung der Gesellschaft produziert im unteren
Teil ein immer größeres Segment von Menschen , die total ausgeschlossen sind .
Hier gibt es Ansätze einer Ghetto- und Slumbildung , wie wir sie auch aus den USA oder Frankreich kennen .
Wenn jetzt führende SPD - Politiker warnen , diese Begrifflichkeiten würden die dort lebenden Menschen stigmatisieren , ist das Heuchelei .
Nicht die Begriffe , sondern die Lebensrealitäten stigmatisieren die Menschen .
Gibt es daneben auch Gegenmodelle zu dieser Entwicklung ?
Michael Hartmann : Insgesamt gibt es da sehr wenige Gegenmodelle .
Was die Hochschulen angeht , so veröffentlicht die bildungspolitische Sprecherin der Linkspartei , Insgesamt gibt es da sehr wenige Gegenmodelle .
Was die Hochschulen angeht , so veröffentlicht die bildungspolitische Sprecherin der Linkspartei , Nele Hirsch , gelegentlich gute Stellungsnahmen .
Aber das ist es dann im Wesentlichen auch .
Bei den Gewerkschaften sieht es nicht besser aus .
Eine große Enttäuschung ist der fehlende Widerstand von Seiten der Hochschullehrer an jenen Universitäten , die zu den Verlierern des Wettbewerbs gehören .
Die lassen das bisher alles so über sich ergehen .
Dabei könnte gerade ihr Protest gesellschaftlich nicht überhört werden .
Studierendenverteter der Freien Universität Berlin haben das Ausscheiden ihrer Hochschule aus dem Elite - Wettbewerb gefeiert .
Gibt es hier Widerstand ?
Michael Hartmann : Bei den Studierendenprotesten der letzten Monate stand natürlich der Kampf gegen die Studiengebühren im Vordergrund und nicht das Thema Eliteuniversität .
Allerdings ist der Zusammenhang zwischen der Einführung von Bachelor - und Masterstudiengängen sowie Studiengebühren und der Aufspaltung der Hochschullandschaft in Elite und den großen Rest mehr als deutlich .
Das wurde von Teilen der Studierenden auch thematisiert .
Es fehlt also eine neue 68er - Bewegung ?
Michael Hartmann : Die wird es so nicht mehr geben , weil sich die Rahmenbedingungen völlig verändert haben .
Was fehlt , ist eine soziale Bewegung , die sämtliche Bereiche der Gesellschaft umfasst und die Widersprüche bündelt .
Sie müsste eine Antwort auf die generelle Spaltung der Gesellschaft finden , die in der Exzellenzinitiative nur zum Ausdruck kommt .

GOP SENATORS SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT
Bill Eliminates Government ’s Burden to Prove Damage in Prosecuting Whistleblowers
Alexandria , VA --- Senators Rick Santorum , R - PA , and Conrad Burns , R - MT , support implementation of Official Secret ’s Act , S.3774 , introduced yesterday by Senator Christopher Bond , R- MO , to criminalize the unauthorized disclosure of classified information .
Bond 's bill seeks to enable the Executive Branch in prosecuting individuals engaged in disclosure of government secrets .
According to the release issued by Senator Bond ’s office , the legislation seeks to unify current law and ease the government 's burden in prosecuting and punishing leakers by eliminating the need to prove that damage to the national security has or will result from a disclosure .
According to the new release by Secrecy News reports , the new Bond bill is identical to the controversial anti-leak legislation sponsored by Senator Richard Shelby in the FY 2001 Intelligence Authorization
Act that was vetoed by President Clinton in November 2000 .
The bill was called the “ Official Secrets Act , ” after the U.K. ’s repressive criminal secrecy statutes .
The United States has never had a statute generally criminalizing leaks or the publication of sensitive information .
Despite consideration at a number of moments in our history , concern for the First Amendment and the principle that the press acts as an important check on government abuse has thwarted all previous efforts to pass such legislation .
According to Professor William Weaver , NSWBC Senior Advisor , “ Such legislation is subject to a double standard in its application .
For example , much information is leaked to the press with the approval of administrators .
These sorts of leaks are an unofficial channel for shoring up administration positions and to influence public opinion .
On the other hand , unauthorized leaks would be prosecuted when they undermine administration positions or embarrass the executive branch or reveal illegal agency activity .
So whether or not a person is prosecuted depends on whether or not the leak is popular or unpopular with the administration in power at the time of the leak .
If the statute were to be applied evenhandedly , the jails would be full of administrators and presidential advisors . ”
Rather than a genuine effort to enhance national security , this legislation is designed to deter legitimate whistleblowing .
The result is that the statute would create an " Official Secrets Act " similar to that found in Great Britain .
But , obviously , Great Britain does not have a First Amendment and we do .
The government has consistently failed in its burden to prove that recent leaks of national security information somehow harmed the United States .
Rather , these disclosures have encouraged public discussion on issues of executive abuses that this administration has tried very hard to cover up .
Justice Brandeis wrote : " those who won our independence believed . . . that public discussion is a political duty ; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government . "
Current law already protects against disclosure of specific types of sensitive information , like the design of a nuclear warhead or a covert agent ’s identities .
Legislation that places the First Amendment entirely in the hands of the Executive Branch , such as Bond ’s Bill , is unconstitutional on its face .
The Nation ’s Founders chose not to implement an Official Secret ’s
Act on our public servants and there is no need for such a law now .
GAP Legal Director , Tom Devine , stated : “ This is a bill to protect the bureaucracy , not America 's security .
It is about covering up government abuses of power that only can be sustained through secrecy .
It is about canceling freedom of speech when it counts , by criminalizing whistleblowers who make unclassified disclosures .
Most whistleblowers who would be targeted are those exposing cover-ups of the government 's own security breaches . ”
On June 29 , 2006 , The National Security Whistleblowers Coalition ( NSWBC ) , issued its list of Twelve Senators and Representatives , its Whistleblowers ’ Dirty Dozen , who by their action or inaction , have stood against real investigations , hearings , and legislation dealing with government whistleblowers who have exposed waste , fraud , abuse , and or criminal activities within government agencies .
Senator Rick Santorum , R - PA , made the list .
“ Senator Santorum is on our list due to being very consistent in his stand against whistleblowers ’ protection and his strong support for unchecked and excessive government secrecy .
His strong support of this new repressive bill , which takes away congress ’ right to know in order to exercise its oversight authority , goes a long way to demonstrate why he is an incumbent candidate unfit to represent our people and their interest and rights guaranteed under the constitution .
Mr. Santorum acts as an extension of the executive branch that seeks to override the Separation of Powers and expand its power ; not as an elected senator who has been vested with authority and a position to serve his constituents , ” stated Sibel Edmonds , NSWBC Founder and Director .
National Security Whistleblowers Coalition , founded in August 2004 , is an independent and nonpartisan alliance of whistleblowers who have come forward to address our nation ’s security weaknesses ; to inform authorities of security vulnerabilities in our intelligence agencies , at nuclear power plants and weapon facilities , in airports , and at our nation ’s borders and ports ; to uncover government waste , fraud , abuse , and in some cases criminal conduct .
The NSWBC is dedicated to aiding national security whistleblowers through a variety of methods , including advocacy of governmental and legal reform , educating the public concerning whistleblowing activity , provision of comfort and fellowship to national security whistleblowers suffering retaliation and other harms , and working with other public interest organizations to affect goals defined in the NSWBC mission statement .

A blog entry titled 9 Ways for Newspapers to Improve Their Websites has been making the rounds lately .
I do n’t write about the online news industry on this site as much as I used to , but this article inspired me to collect my current thinking on what newspaper sites need to do .
Here , I present my opinion of one fundamental change that needs to happen .
For background : I have a journalism degree , for what it ’s worth , and I ’ve worked for newspaper Web sites since 1998 ( including the college paper and internships ) .
The sites : themaneater.com ( now a pale shadow of its former self ) at the University of Missouri , SuburbanChicagoNews.com , ajc.com in Atlanta , LJWorld.com / Lawrence.com in Lawrence , Kansas , and , for the last year , washingtonpost.com .
Most of the points made in the “ 9 Ways ” entry are OK , if a little overly specific ( “ make your content work on cell phones and PDAs ” ) and trendy ( tagging ! ) .
There ’s nothing wrong with that — the online newspaper industry needs all the advice it can get .
But more fundamental shifts need to happen for newspaper companies to remain essential sources of information for their communities .
One of those important shifts is : Newspapers need to stop the story - centric worldview .
Conditioned by decades of an established style of journalism , newspaper journalists tend to see their primary role thusly :
Collect information Write a newspaper story
The problem here is that , for many types of news and information , newspaper stories do n’t cut it anymore .
So much of what local journalists collect day - to - day is structured information : the type of information that can be sliced - and - diced , in an automated fashion , by computers .
Yet the information gets distilled into a big blob of text — a newspaper story — that has no chance of being repurposed .
“ Repurposed ” ?
Let me clarify .
I do n’t mean “ Display a newspaper story on a cell phone . ”
I do n’t mean “ Display a newspaper story in RSS . ”
I do n’t mean “ Display a newspaper story on my PDA . ”
Those are fine goals , but they ’re examples of changing the format , not the information itself .
Repurposing and aggregating information is a different story , and it requires the information to be stored atomically — and in machine - readable format .
For example , say a newspaper has written a story about a local fire .
Being able to read that story on a cell phone is fine and dandy .
Hooray , technology !
But what I really want to be able to do is explore the raw facts of that story , one by one , with layers of attribution , and an infrastructure for comparing the details of the fire — date , time , place , victims , fire station number , distance from fire department , names and years experience of firemen on the scene , time it took for firemen to arrive — with the details of previous fires .
And subsequent fires , whenever they happen .
That ’s what I mean by structured data : information with attributes that are consistent across a domain .
Every fire has those attributes , just as every reported crime has many attributes , just as every college basketball game has many attributes .
Those three examples are obvious candidates for structure , mostly due to ubiquity .
People have been slicing and dicing sports stats for years .
People have been analyzing crime for years .
But it does n’t stop at those obvious examples .
If you take some time to examine what sort of information newspaper journalists collect , the amount of structure will jump at you .
If I may take the liberty of giving examples from Web sites I ’ve worked for :
See the theme here ?
A lot of the information that newspaper organizations collect is relentlessly structured .
It just takes somebody to realize the structure ( the easy part ) , and it just takes somebody to start storing it in a structured format ( the hard part ) .
Now , I can understand why newspapers are slow to accept this sort of thinking .
Journalists are n’t the most tech - savvy bunch , they ’re not the most innovative bunch , and they ’re ( just a tad ) resistant to change .
One barrier to this thinking is a sort of journalistic arrogance : “ How is this journalism ?
We ’re journalists , and we ’ve been trained to explain complex information to people in ways that they can understand .
Displaying raw data does not help people ; writing a news article does help people , because it ’s plain English . ”
I ’ve presented these concepts ( “ journalism via computer programming , ” the importance of machine - readable data , etc. ) at a number of journalism - industry events , and inevitably somebody asks these questions .
Well , I have a couple of answers .
First , the question of “ How is this journalism ? ” is academic .
Journalists should have less of a concern of what is and is n’t “ journalism , ” and more of a concern for important , focused information that is useful to people ’s lives and helps them understand the world .
A newspaper ought to be that : a fair look at current , important information for a readership .
Second , it ’s important to note I ’m not making an all - or - nothing proposition ; I ’m not saying newspapers should turn completely to vast collections of data , completely abandoning the format of a news article .
News articles are great for telling stories , analyzing complex issues and all sorts of other things .
An article — a “ big blob of text ” — is often the best way to explain concepts .
The nuances of the English language do not map neatly to machine - manipulatable data sources .
( This very entry , which you ’re reading right now , is a prime example of something that could not be replaced with a database . )
When I say “ newspapers need to stop the story - centric worldview , ” I do n’t mean “ newspapers need to abolish stories . ”
The two forms of information dissemination can coexist and complement each other .
But beyond the journalistic arrogance , another problem is that newspaper companies ’ current software and organizational setup overwhelmingly discourages any sort of “ information special - casing . ”
Just about every newspaper
Web site content - management system I ’ve ever seen is unabashedly story - centric .
Want to post event calendar information into your news - site CMS ?
Post it as a “ news article ” object .
Want to publish listings of recent crimes in your town ?
It goes in as a “ news article . ”
There ’s not much Joe Reporter , or even Jane Online Editor , can do about this , because Oh We ’ve Invested So Much Into This CMS , and / or Our Newspaper Web Site Does n’t Employ Any Computer Programmers .
( The latter of which makes as much sense as a film director refusing to employ cameramen or video editors . )
When I worked at LJWorld.com , we wrote a CMS from the ground up to be able to handle all these distinct types of information .
( And we created the Web framework Django to let us handle new types of information rapidly . )
But , before that , we had an old CMS , and our night producers , whose job it was to copy - and - paste everything from the print newspaper into the Web system , would routinely publish all the newspaper ’s little special features as “ news articles . ”
The “ photo of the day ” newspaper feature would get posted as a story with no text — just a photo .
The Onion - style “ On the Street ” feature would get posted as a “ news article ” object containing a question , four photos , and four responses .
Each recurring newspaper feature was posted as a “ news article , ” regardless of whether it actually was a news article — simply because that ’s all the content - management system knew how to do .
This is a subtle problem , and therein lies the rub .
In my experience , when I ’ve tried to explain the error of storing everything as a news article , journalists do n’t immediately understand why it is bad .
To them , a publishing system is just a means to an end : getting information out to the public .
They want it to be as fast and streamlined as possible to take information batch X and put it on Web site Y .
The goal is n’t to have clean data — it ’s to publish data quickly , with bonus points for a nice user interface .
But the goal for me , a data person focused more on the long term , is to store information in the most valuable format possible .
The problem is particularly frustrating to explain because it ’s not necessarily obvious ; if you store everything on your Web site as a news article , the Web site is not necessarily hard to use .
Rather , it ’s a problem of lost opportunity .
If all of your information is stored in the same “ news article ” bucket , you ca n’t easily pull out just the crimes and plot them on a map of the city .
You ca n’t easily grab the events to create an event calendar .
You end up settling on the least common denominator : a Web site that knows how to display one type of content , a big blob of text .
That Web site cannot do the cool things that readers are beginning to expect .
Then there ’s the serendipity advantage .
When I worked for LJWorld.com , we worked with the local weathermen to create a weather site that displayed the weathermen ’s forecast for the next few days .
I made them a Web interface that let them enter the predicted high temperature , low temperature and sky conditions — all in separate database fields .
There really was n’t any reason to use separate fields for these values other than the fact that the site ’s design called for presenting the temperatures in a different color than the conditions , and we did n’t want the weathermen to have to remember to insert the HTML coloring codes in the right place .
But it was n’t until several months later that we reaped some real benefits of databasing the information , when we were putting together Game , an exhaustive database of local little - league teams and games .
( Yes , you read that right . )
We created a page for every little - league team and every little - league game , and when it came time to create the game pages , one of us said , “ You know , these games tend to rain out a lot .
It ’d be really cool if we could somehow display the weather forecast for each game . ”
And , boom !
One of us realized that we already had weather forecast data , in nice , sliceable - and - diceable format , thanks to our database populated by the weathermen .
Ten minutes later , our little - league pages displayed weather forecasts .
Serendipity .
Finally , I ’ll note that some newspaper
Web sites are actively looking to improve their understanding of these issues , and a number of Web editors have contacted me to ask if I know of anybody — please , Adrian , anybody ! — who has tech skills and would be interested in applying his / her knowledge to a newspaper Web site .
If you have these skills , please contact me , and I ’ll put you in touch .
The industry needs you .
UPDATE , several years later :
This essay inspired the creation of the fantastic PolitiFact , which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2009 and is a great example of treating news data with respect .
When Ayn Rand finished writing " Atlas Shrugged " 50 years ago this month , she set off an intellectual shock wave that is still felt today .
It 's credited for helping to halt the communist tide and ushering in the currents of capitalism .
Many readers say it transformed their lives .
A 1991 poll rated it the second - most influential book ( after the Bible ) for Americans .
At one level , " Atlas Shrugged " is a steamy soap opera fused into a page - turning political thriller .
At nearly 1,200 pages , it has to be .
But the epic account of capitalist heroes versus collectivist villains is merely the vehicle for Ms. Rand 's philosophical ideal : " man as a heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute . "
In addition to founding her own philosophical system , objectivism , Rand is honored as the modern fountainhead of laissez - faire capitalism , and as an impassioned , uncompromising , and unapologetic proponent of reason , liberty , individualism , and rational self - interest .
There is much to commend , and much to condemn , in " Atlas Shrugged . "
Its object – to restore man to his rightful place in a free society – is wholesome .
But its ethical basis – an inversion of the Christian values that predicate authentic capitalism – poisons its teachings .
Mixed lessons from Rand 's heroes
Rand articulates like no other writer the evils of totalitarianism , interventionism , corporate welfarism , and the socialist mindset .
" Atlas Shrugged " describes in wretched detail how collective " we " thinking and middle - of - the - road interventionism leads a nation down a road to serfdom .
No one has written more persuasively about property rights , honest money ( a gold - backed dollar ) , and the right of an individual to safeguard his wealth and property from the agents of coercion ( " taxation is theft " ) .
And long before Gordon Gekko , icon of the movie " Wall Street , " she made greed seem good .
I applaud her effort to counter the negative image of big business as robber barons .
Her entrepreneurs are high - minded , principled achievers who relish the competitive edge and have the creative genius to invent exciting new products , manage businesses efficiently , and produce great symphonies without cutting corners .
Such actions are often highly risky and financially dangerous and are often met with derision at first .
Rand rightly points out that these enterprising leaders are a major cause of economic progress .
History is full of examples of " men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision . "
In the novel , protagonist Hank Reardon defends his philosophy before a court : " I refuse to apologize for my ability – I refuse to apologize for my success – I refuse to apologize for my money . "
But there 's a dark side to Rand 's teachings .
Her defense of greed and selfishness , her diatribes against religion and charitable sacrificing for others who are less fortunate , and her criticism of the Judeo - Christian virtues under the guise of rational Objectivism have tarnished her advocacy of unfettered capitalism .
Still , Rand 's extreme canard is a brilliant invention that serves as an essential counterpoint in the battle of ideas .
The Atlas characters are exceptionally memorable .
They are the unabashed " immovable movers " of the world who think of nothing but their own business and making money .
" ... I want to be prepared to claim the greatest virtue of them all – that I was a man who made money , " says copper titan Francisco d'Anconia .
But these men are regarded as ruthless , greedy , single - minded individualists .
They are men ( except for Dagny Taggart , who could be confused for a man ) who always talk shop and give scant attention to their family .
In fact , no children appear in Rand 's magnum opus .
Her chief protagonist , John Galt , is an uncompromising superman .
He is the proverbial Atlas who holds the world on his shoulders .
He has invented a fantastic motor , yet is so frustrated with state authority that he withdraws his talents – hence the title , " Atlas Shrugged " – and spends the next dozen years working as a manual laborer for Taggart International .
Mr. Galt somehow succeeds in getting the world 's top capitalists to go on strike and , in many cases , strike back at an increasingly oppressive collectivist government .
Rand 's plot violates a key tenet of business existence , which is to constantly work within the system to find ways to make money .
Real - world entrepreneurs are compromisers and dealmakers , not true believers .
They would n't give a hoot for Galt .
Rand , of course , knows this .
And that 's OK , because " Atlas Shrugged " is about philosophy , not business .
In her world , there are two kinds of people : those who serve and satisfy themselves only and those who believe that they should strive to serve and satisfy others .
She calls the latter " altruists . "
Rand is truly revolutionary because she makes the first serious attempt to protest against altruism .
She rejects the heart over the mind and faith beyond reason .
Indeed , she denies the existence of any god or higher being , or any other authority over one 's own mind .
For her , the highest form of happiness is fulfilling one 's own dreams , not someone else 's – or the public's .
Galt crystallizes the Randian motto : " I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine . "
No sacrifice , no altruism , no feelings , just pure egotistical selfishness , which Rand declares to be supreme logic and reason .
This philosophy transcends politics and economics into romance .
The novel 's sex scenes are narcissistic , mechanical , and violent .
Are the lessons of her book any way to run a marriage , a family , a business , a charity , or a community ?
To be sure , Rand makes a key point about altruism .
A philosophy of sacrificing for others can lead to a political system that mandates sacrificing for others .
That , Rand shows with frightening clarity , leads to a dysfunctional society of deadbeats and bleeding - heart do - gooders ( Rand calls them " looters " ) who are corrupted by benefits and unearned income , and constantly tax the productive citizens to pay for their pet philanthropic missions .
According to Rand , they are " anti-life . "
But is the only alternative to embrace the opposite , Rand 's philosophy of extreme self - centeredness ?
Must we accept her materialist metaphysics in which , as Whittaker Chambers wrote in 1957 , " Randian Man , like Marxian Man , is made the center of a godless world " ?
No , there is another choice .
If society is to survive and prosper , citizens must find a balance between the two extremes of self - interest and public interest .
Adam Smith , the founder of modern economics , may have found that Aristotelian mean in his " system of natural liberty . "
Mr. Smith and Rand agree on the universal benefits of a free , capitalistic society .
But Smith rejects Rand 's vision of selfish independence .
He asserts two driving forces behind man 's actions .
In " The Theory of Moral Sentiments , " he identifies the first as " sympathy " or " benevolence " toward others in society .
In his later work , " The Wealth of Nations , " he focuses on the second – self - interest – which he defines as the right to pursue one 's own business .
Both , he argues , are essential to achieve " universal opulence . "
Smith 's self - interest never reaches the Randian selfishness that ignores the interest of others .
In Smith 's mind , an individual 's goals cannot be fully achieved in business unless he appeals to the needs of others .
This insight was beautifully stated two centuries later by free - market champion Ludwig von Mises .
In his book , " The Anti-Capitalist Mentality , " he writes : " Wealth can be acquired only by serving the consumers . "
Golden rule anchors true capitalism
Smith 's theme echoes his Christian heritage , particularly the Golden rule , " Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them " ( Matt. 7:12 ) .
Perhaps a true capitalist spirit can best be summed up in the commandment , " Love thy neighbour as thyself " ( Lev. 19:18 ; Matt. 22:39 ) .
Smith and Mr. von Mises would undoubtedly agree with this creed , but the heroes of " Atlas Shrugged " – and their creator – would agree with only half .
Today 's most successful libertarian CEOs , such as John Mackey of Whole Foods Markets and Charles Koch of Koch Industries , have adopted the authentic spirit of capitalism that is more in keeping with Smith than Rand .
Theirs is a " stakeholder " philosophy that works within the system to fulfill the needs of customers , employees , shareholders , the community , and themselves .
Their balanced business model of self - interest and public interest shows how the marketplace can grow globally in harmony with the interests of workers , capitalists , and the community – and can even displace bad government .
The golden rule is the correct solution in business and life .
But would we have recognized this Aristotelian mean without sampling Rand 's anthem , or for that matter , the other extreme of Marxism - Leninism ?
As Benjamin Franklin said , " By the collision of different sentiments , sparks of truth are struck out , and political light is obtained . "
John Galt – it 's time to come home and go to work .
• Mark Skousen has taught economics at Columbia University and is the author of the new book , " The Big Three in Economics . "
China is prepared to use nuclear weapons against the US if it is attacked by Washington during a confrontation over Taiwan , a Chinese general said on Thursday .
“ If the Americans draw their missiles and position - guided ammunition on to the target zone on China 's territory , I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons , ” said General Zhu Chenghu .
Gen Zhu was speaking at a function for foreign journalists organised , in part , by the Chinese government .
He added that China 's definition of its territory included warships and aircraft .
“ If the Americans are determined to interfere [ then ] we will be determined to respond , ” said Gen Zhu , who is also a professor at China 's National Defence University .
“ We …will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all of the cities east of Xian .
Of course the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds … of cities will be destroyed by the Chinese . ”
Gen Zhu is a self - acknowledged “ hawk ” who has warned that China could strike the US with long - range missiles .
But his threat to use nuclear weapons in a conflict over Taiwan is the most specific by a senior Chinese official in nearly a decade .
However , some US - based China experts cautioned that Gen Zhu probably did not represent the mainstream People 's Liberation Army view .
“ He is running way beyond his brief on what China might do in relation to the US if push comes to shove , ” said one expert with knowledge of Gen Zhu .
“ Nobody who is cleared for information on Chinese war scenarios is going to talk like this , ” he added .
Gen Zhu's comments come as the Pentagon prepares to brief Congress next Monday on its annual report on the Chinese military , which is expected to take a harder line than previous years .
They are also likely to fuel the mounting anti-China sentiment on Capitol Hill .
In recent months , a string of US officials , including Donald Rumsfeld , defence secretary , have raised concerns about China 's military rise .
The Pentagon on Thursday declined to comment on “ hypothetical scenarios ” .
Rick Fisher , a former senior US congressional official and an authority on the Chinese military , said the specific nature of the threat “ is a new addition to China 's public discourse ” .
China 's official doctrine has called for no first use of nuclear weapons since its first atomic test in 1964 .
But Gen
Zhu is not the first Chinese official to refer to the possibility of using such weapons first in a conflict over Taiwan .
Chas Freeman , a former US assistant secretary of defence , said in 1996 that a PLA official had told him China could respond in kind to a nuclear strike by the US in the event of a conflict with Taiwan .
The official is believed to have been Xiong Guangkai , now the PLA 's deputy chief of general staff .
Gen Zhu said his views did not represent official Chinese policy and he did not anticipate war with the US .

I sent this bradblog info to a friend who lives in MD this morning and he confirmed that there was a problem at his precinct .
He got there at 7:00 and no one knew how to start up the machine .
He was offered a provisional paper ballot and that is what he voted on .
I 'll make you a bet this is affecting more than " dozens " of precincts .

Spoke to MD Board of Elections communications director , Mary Heath .
To her credit , she was professional and patient in her explanations about what has gone wrong so far in MD .
She attributed much of the problems in many polling stations , and especially across Montgomery County , to human error .
She said it has been incredibly hard for them to recruit able pollworkers and election judges who can pass background checks , absorb a huge amount of training materials , and then put in a 7 am - 11 pm volunteer work day on election day .
Remedies : 1 ) make election judge / pollworker service mandatory , like jury duty ?
Or , Democrats use this huge opportunity to staff the polls to absolutely ensure voting goes off without a hitch .
2 ) get ourselves on a paper - based , fully transparent and auditable voting process ASAP .
Not only is training for paper ballots straightforward and simple , but also the paper trail exists immediately following the vote .
When I asked about the Diebold machines , Mary claimed Maryland learned from Florida 2000 / 2004 , Ohio 2004 , and California 2006 , to make their machines more secure , etc .
Of course , when I asked why it was these machines could not be designed to provide paper receipts which could later be scanned into optical scanners for verification , she said the machines are equipped with printers , but that reprints of a single ballot are over 7 feet long ?!?
This from a company that makes ATM machines perfectly capable of printing out receipts after every transaction .
I 'm more resolved than ever to push MD legislators , hard , to resolve this issue .

The judges at our Montgomery County , MD , polling site did n't know what to do about the lack of voter access cards , so they started sending prospective voters to another polling location .
They even put up signs directing folks to the other polls .
A number of people gave up and left in disgust .
I wonder how many potential votes were n't cast because of the delay in bringing voter access cards to the polls .
Even if it were 10 potential votes , multiply that by 238 precincts in Montgomery County , and you 've got 2380 votes --- enough to change the results of many local races .
This s a Democrat county , in a Blue state , and these Diebold machines were purchased by the Democratic state elections commissioner .
Which is why our Democratic leadership will not lift a finger to get rid of these Cheating Machines .

So bradblog is n't about the truth either - you are a relatively small - time player and the faux " advertise liberally " group refuses to cover these issues or link to your blog .
americablog , atrios , fdl , digby , c&l , kos , greenwald , and the rest of that gang REFUSES to acknowledge these issues AND YOU DELETE AND BAN ANYONE THAT POINTS THIS OUT !
Then you have the gumption to post IMPORTANT BREAKING stories that get buried in silence by the MSM and the self - proclaimed " liberal " blogs ( NOT ! )
Yet you constantly ask for money , despite the fact that you are also CENSORING comments that point out the hypocracy of the concerted effort by " so- called - liberal " blogs to bury the issues you discuss .
You are part of the problem if you are not part of the solution - grandstanding over this but remaining silent ( and actively censoring ) dialog about these important issues is just as bad as the lying liars in MSM .

Now I 'm not saying it's a bad idea on the surface - for public safety that is - but I do n't know - it just seems odd .

The hacking stories we read in the papers concern attacks over the Internet against systems that are deliberately held open for access by the general public .
Voting machines , by contrast , are highly controlled and cannot be accessed over the Internet .
Hackers are not omniscient and even vendors have trouble programming tabulation software correctly .
The prospect that a hacker could not only manipulate an election but do it without exhibiting a detectable bug is so far - fetched an idea that no one has come close to showing how it might be done . ”

All I can say is what a catastrophe .
Much to my disappointment , the democrats AND republicans IN Maryland ( save about two , which were my senator ( dem ) and delegate ( rep ) ) are rotten .
It was Paula Hollinger 's democratic senate committee that haulted any sort of paper trail or way to count the votes .
Hollinger who launders money , I heard .
Thank god she lost the congressional race !
I was at a presinct in the evening .
ONE of the voting machines was down all day .
I was astonished at the results OR the people of Maryland are mindless automations who choose proven crooks to be elected because they put out a lot more crap advertising with lies .
Are people really so stupid ?
Or is it the voting machines ???
They voted for people who chose to deregulate our gas and electric so that now we are going to be paying 200 percent more .
But that is OK with their constituents .
At the end of the evening they taped cash register rolls on a window that contained the votes for each machine .
OR there is something seriously wrong with the voting machines and NO way to count the votes .
. no paper , nothing .
We have to accept their results on blind faith .
All day long my in box filled with reports from all over the state .
People turned away , not able to even vote , power outages , broken machines that would not power on .
Cards not delivered .
Poll books that when voters got there , it said they had already voted . . . and they had to fill out provisionals , but HOW are they going to check if that person voted ?
With no paper or way to trace it ??
OMG I am really mad . . . AND disenfranchised .
HOW do we KNOW if our votes even count ????
I am REALLY mad .

Maryland is one of the DIEBOLD EVM - SHOWCASE STATES , .. Brad said , ..
Meanwhile , on the other coast , out in Diebold 's one - time " showcase state " of Maryland where the Republican Governor recently declared he " no longer [ has ] confidence in the State Board of Elections ' ability to conduct fair and accurate elections in 2006 " on Diebold 's machinery , Mike Himowitz in the Baltimore Sun rages against the machines and the pitfalls of secret software used to count our votes :
With every jurisdiction in Maryland now using the same system , all it takes to ruin an entire statewide election is a single glitch in a single line of that secret code .
In the systems business , this is known as a computer monoculture .
It 's a term borrowed from agriculture to describe a large area planted in a single crop - and hence vulnerable to devastating damage from a single source .
Maryland is completely planted with Diebold 's electronic cotton - all it needs for disaster is one electronic boll weevil .
To all of this criticism , Linda H. Lamone , the state election administrator has had one response : " Trust us . "
Well , I do n't and you should n't .
Elections are n't based on trust .
They 're based on verifiable results .
You can't throw technology at a problem and throw common sense out the window .
There 's no way to fix this system .
I do n't care how much we 've spent on it .

I just want to write one of their best here .
Just THINK about this statement : Myth 4
“ Paper receipts solve the concerns regarding electronic voting system fraud . ” FACTS " ... Paper receipts provide a false sense of security , because they do not guarantee that the results recorded in the machine are the same results printed on the receipt . "
Think about that .

I feel compelled to respond to Dixicrat 's rant .
For several years I was a Democratic election judge in Montgomery County Maryland .
I stopped participating after a few elections with electronic voting .
Once the state of Maryland ( after an initial study by Johns Hopkins University determined the vulnerability of the system ) refused to allow paper receipts , that was it for me .
I felt unable in good conscience , to certify any election 's validity anymore and just maybe other intelligent people like me sat back down on their lazy bitching asses in dismay and despair .

Does anyone think it 's possible to get a question on the November ballot to let the people decide ?

No axe to grind - just asking why it is not possible to discuss the FACT that the rest of the " advertise liberally " blogs WILL NOT COVER YOUR STORIES OR LINK TO YOUR SITE ?
Who 's the FRAUD - YOU OR THEM !
Legitimate question and the facts are on my side .
It is starting to appear the disinformation is actually on your side { Ed Note : No .
It only " looks " like that because yours has been deleted , and anyone as obsessed as you are about this stuff should take the hint , sit back and consider more carefully , rather than just scheme their way boldly forward .

Taffy , giving - up is n't the answer or what made America great .
The first Revolution took 8 years to win and another 15 just to get our country going .
Americans do n't stop until they close the lid on their coffins .
Rest when you 're dead cuz deomocracy can be taken away at any time - it is not a permanent system ; it is a concept , just like freedom .

This news about the electoral mess caused by the poorly managed introduction of the new Diebold electronic voting machines is only the tip of the iceberg .
Much more disturbing to me , as a Maryland resident and an American , is the recent confirmation by a team of Princeton researchers that the Diebold machines are definitely not secure and are easily hackable .
All election results determined in part or in whole by these machines should be disallowed and , if necessary , elections rescheduled using a more secure method of vote tallying .

Synopsis
On September 26 , 2006 , attorneys for the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) determined that what appears to be the final version of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 could allow the government to detain the attorneys themselves as ' enemy combatants . '
CCR Legal Director Bill Goodman said : " This ominously broad definition of enemy combatants would mean that almost anyone who actively opposes the President or the government could be locked up indefinitely .
This bill makes a mockery of the rule of law . "
The current version of the Military Commissions redefines an " unlawful enemy combatant " ( UEC ) so broadly that it could include anyone who organizes a march against the war in Iraq .
The bill defines a UEC as " a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States " or anyone who " has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense of the United States . "
The definition makes no reference to citizenship and therefore could be read to include any number of individuals , including :
CCR attorneys and other habeas counsel , Federal Public Defenders and military defense counsel for detainees at Guantánamo Bay
Any person who has given $ 5 to a charity working with orphans in Afghanistan that turns out to be associated in some fashion with someone who may be a member of the Taliban
The bill also currently includes provisions so sweeping that they strip U.S. courts of jurisdiction over habeas petitions by any non-citizen detained by the government anywhere .
Because there is no geographic limitation in the bill 's language , it would allow the President to detain any non-citizen without their ever having the chance to challenge their detention in court : " No court ... shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the United States who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination . "
Examples of people who could be detained indefinitely with no access to a court include : A foreign tourist wearing an anti-Bush t- shirt at the Statue of Liberty
A protester at an immigration rally who has lived in the U.S. since she was six months old and is a lawful , permanent resident
CCR Executive Director Vincent Warren said : " This new version of the legislation grants the President frightening power to silence his critics .
Habeas corpus is , like voting , one of the fundamental rights of democracy .
The President 's efforts to exercise the privilege of kings must be turned back , before the so - called ' war on terror ' turns on our own citizens . "
Bill Gates pumps money into ethanol
on 04/25/2006
Filedon
04/25/2006
On April 13th , Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates made a bet on Ethanol as America 's future fuel when he bought a 25.5 % stake in a leading ethanol production company .
Bill Gates holds a 25.5 - percent stake in Pacific Ethanol Inc. , resulting from a private transaction with the maker of corn- based fuel , according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing .
Gates acquired 5.25 million shares convertible preferred stock on April 13 for $ 16 per share , the filing said .
Those shares are convertible to 10.5 million shares of common stock .
Pacific Ethanol is building an ethanol production facility in California and said in late March it hoped the deal with Cascade Investment , Gates 's investment vehicle , would close by mid-April .
In the SEC filing , Cascade said it acquired the common stock " for investment purposes only " and will continue to evaluate its ownership stake and voting position .
Cascade said it would leave open the possibility of continuing to hold the stock , disposing of it or acquiring more in the open market or through private transactions , and entering into short sales or other hedging transactions .
Pacific Ethanol ( Research ) shares jumped more than 6 percent in morning trade on Nasdaq .

Nicole Richie was photographed outside the West Hollywood Recovery Center on 626 N Robertson Boulevard .
I Googled the center and learned that it ’s an informal recovery center that focuses on 12 - step meetings .
At the top of the search were results for Crystal Meth Anonymous meetings that are held there on Wednesday nights .
These pictures of Nicole Richie outside the West Hollywood Recovery center are said to be from 9/27 – Wednesday – the same day Crystal Meth Anonymous meetings are held there .
Here ’s the schedule of meetings at the West Hollywood Recovery Center on Wednesdays .
It is possible the Nicole went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting “ step study ” and not a Crystal Meth Anonymous meeting as they are held at the same time .
There is also a Nicotine Anonymous meeting at 8:30 , but these pictures seem to be taken earlier than the 9:45 PM ending time :
AA Meeting 6:30 - 7:30 AM
AA Meeting Step Study “ Quitting Time ” 7:00 – 8:00 PM
Crystal Meth Anonymous Meeting “ Stick to the Solution ” 7:00 - 8:00 PM
AA - HIV - Negative & Sober 8:00 - 9:00 PM
Nicotine Anonymous “ Nic at Nite ” 8:30 - 9:45 PM
Nicole has denied that she checked herself into an eating disorder clinic , as has been recently rumored .
She wrote an exasperated message on her myspace blasting the rumors and saying that she ’s annoyed that people keep bringing it up :
Contrary to CNN ’s false accusations , I did not check myself into an eating disorder rehab .
I do n’t know why or how this rumor started , but I am home , in LA , and very happy .
I do not have an eating disorder , and I do n’t know how many times I have to say it .
I ’ve repeated myself so many times , I feel like a broken record .
Who ever started this rumor is evil and mean , but it ’s not true .
I am happy , and healthy , and living my life .
It ’s long been rumored that Richie ’s notorious stylist , Rachel Zoe , keeps her clients thin by serving as their drug dealer .
Nicole may indeed be telling the truth that she does n’t have an eating disorder , and her thin frame could be evidence of another addiction entirely .
If she is getting help , good for her .
She seems really happy with Brody and hopefully she ’ll kick whatever demons have been keeping her rail thin .
I ’m calling this an exclusive because I believe I ’m the first blogger to jump to this conclusion .
Richie is shown outside the 12 - step facility on 9/27 and with Brody Jenner out to dinner on 9/24 . [ via ]
Update :
It looks like late afternoon in these pictures not 8 PM , the time the meeting ended , as commentor Red Beet mentions .
It ’s unknown what Richie was doing at the 12 - step center .
To get an unbiased estimate of how attractive the subjects were , the experimenters showed the photographs of all subjects to a separate panel of students and asked them to rate the subjects on a beauty scale , using standard procedures for normalizing the scores .
Armed with the data from these experiments and surveys , the economists found several interesting results .
It turned out that beautiful people were no better than ordinary people in solving mazes .
But despite having the same productivity as others in this task , beautiful people were a lot more confident about their own abilities .
Being good looking seems to be strongly associated with self - confidence , a trait that is apparently attractive to employers .
When employers evaluated employees only on the basis of résumés , physical appearance had no impact on their estimates , as one would expect .
But all of the other treatments showed higher productivity estimates for beautiful people , with the face - to - face interviews yielding the largest numbers .
Interestingly , employers thought beautiful people were more productive even when their only interaction was via a telephone interview .
It appears that the confidence that beautiful people have in themselves comes across over the phone as well as in person .
But even when the experimenters controlled for self - confidence , they found that employers overestimated the productivity of beautiful people .
The economists estimated that about 15 to 20 percent of the beauty premium is a result of the self - confidence effect , while oral and visual communication each contribute about 40 percent .
It seems that good - looking people are good communicators as well , and their oral communication skills contribute about as much to employers ' perceptions as their looks .
As the researchers put it , " Employers ( wrongly ) expect good - looking workers to perform better than their less - attractive counterparts under both visual and oral interaction , even after controlling for individual worker characteristics and worker confidence . "
So what does a researcher do ?
It took a long time to decide to learn Erlang instead of Haskell or OCaml / F# .
What I really want to learn for now are the OTP principles of distributed application .
So I wrote my first Erlang script ( not yet an application ) and it confirmed my point of view : Erlang make easy the development of distributed program !
really !!!
At my work we needed to test performance of a TCP server ( and we ’ll used Grinder because most of our API is Python ) .
I ’ve decided to use Erlang to do the same thing as an exercise : grind.erl ( of course it will never become neither as huge as Grinder neither as efficient as Tsung ; I even do not hope it can be usefull ) .
But with few lines of code , I was able to reproduce the same behavior as Grinder : launch on multiple machine multiple tester agents executing some test function and gather the results of all the tests .
Ok , I did not told all the truth : that ’s not a very small number of lines : arround 260 ( with tests and all ) .
But all the code is for running multiple time a test function and gathering some statistics on its result ( run_task ) .
Distributed this behaviour among multiple Erlang node is only a map call ( distribute_task ) !
Here is a code extract :
distribute_task( NodeLst , Task ) -> NodeLstLen = length ( NodeLst ) , StatListener = spawn ( grind , statistic_gathering , [ now ( ) , NodeLstLen ] ) , io : format ( " ~w create statistic gathering process ~w on node ~w~n " , [ self ( ) , StatListener , node ( ) ] ) , TaskRunnerCreator = fun( Node ) -> spawn (
Node , grind , run_task , [ StatListener , Task ] ) end , Runners = lists : map( TaskRunnerCreator , NodeLst ) , io : format ( " ~w create a list of task runners : ~w~n " , [ self ( ) , Runners ] ) , Runners .
And here is a usage example :
grind:init ( [ node ( ) , grinderl@node.net ] ) .
grind:distribute_task( [ node ( ) , grinderl@node.net ] , % use 2 nodes { % on each node run the test function in 50 concurrent process {concurrent , 50} , % two statistics to gather [ {mean , writetime} , % a real value ( mean , std. dev. , min , max , med will be retrieved {count , writer_val} % a occurence counter ] , % foo function to test : must return a tuple {ok|error , Pid , ValLst} fun( Writer , WritenValue ) -> FWrite = fun( ) -> io :format ( " ~s got ~w~n " , [ Writer , WritenValue ] ) end , { WriteTime , _ Res} = timeit ( FWrite ) , {ok , self ( ) , [ WriteTime , { Writer , WritenValue} ] } end , % arguments to used for each call of the test function [ {rr , [ " bea " , " pouf " ]} , % first is taken in the list with a round - robin style {choice , [ 0 , 1 , 12 , 42 , 77 ] } % second argument is randomly choosen from the list ] } )
This first steps was to become more familiar with Erlang language .
My next steps will be :
use edoc …
use logger / trace services instead of printing every function call
use generic services ( gen_event , gen_server )
create an OTP application ( application , supervisor )
use Mnesia to gather statistics
what about OTP release
embed everything in distribution package ( automake / autoconf ? )

EBay plans to announce today that it has hired Google to sell advertising that will appear on many pages shown to users outside of the United States .
The deal is noteworthy not only because the two companies are increasingly in direct competition — in areas like online phone service , payment and product listings — but also because eBay signed a similar partnership in May with Yahoo that included ads on domestic pages .
That alliance was seen as a way to counter the growing power of Google .
Google is the leader in selling text advertisements on the Internet .
In this business , it dwarfs Yahoo , especially in Europe .
So as eBay looks to build its international advertising revenue , Google was in a position to offer a better deal than Yahoo .
“ Google is very strong in every country outside of the United States , ” said Meg Whitman , eBay ’s chief executive , in an interview Sunday night .
“ We felt this arrangement of assets made sense . ”
For men , the more they drank , the lower the risk .
One drink a week lowered the risk by about 7 percent , two to four drinks by 22 percent and five or six drinks a week by 29 percent .
Those who drank every day had a 41 percent lower risk of heart disease than those who did not drink at all .
Even among men who had up to 35 drinks per week , the protection persisted .
With women , the trend was different .
One drink a week lowered the risk by 36 percent , but daily drinking lowered it by 35 percent .
In other words , for women , alcohol consumption had a significant protective effect , but the frequency of drinking had none .
Dr. Morten Gronbaek of the Danish National Institute of Public Health , the study 's senior author , said he would not hesitate to recommend a drink a day to certain patients .
" If I were talking to a patient , about 50 with a high coronary risk profile , who I knew was n't at risk for alcohol abuse , and who did n't drink at all , I would n't hesitate to tell him that a glass of wine a day might be a good idea , " he said .
" But people who are light drinkers should certainly not be advised to drink more . "
The researchers also stressed that their data said nothing about binge drinking or about the number of drinks per occasion , and Dr. Gronbaek said that drinking was not a substitute for exercise or good diet .
" You should n't avoid exercise , " he said , " and then try to compensate by drinking . "
According to the authors , there are several plausible explanations for the effect .
Alcohol helps raise the levels of high density lipoprotein or H.D.L. cholesterol and lowers plasma fibrinogen levels , which contribute to blood clotting .
As I write this , in the late winter of 2006 , we are more than twenty years into the AIDS era .
Like many , a large part of my life has been irreversibly affected by AIDS .
My entire adolescence and adult life — as well as the lives of many of my peers — has been overshadowed by the belief in a deadly , sexually transmittable pathogen and the attendant fear of intimacy and lack of trust that belief engenders .
To add to this impact , my chosen career has developed around the HIV model of AIDS .
I received my Ph.D. in 2002 for my work constructing mathematical models of HIV infection , a field of study I entered in 1996 .
Just ten years later , it might seem early for me to be looking back on and seriously reconsidering my chosen field , yet here I am .
My work as a mathematical biologist has been built in large part on the paradigm that HIV causes AIDS , and I have since come to realize that there is good evidence that the entire basis for this theory is wrong .
AIDS , it seems , is not a disease so much as a sociopolitical construct that few people understand and even fewer question .
The issue of causation , in particular , has become beyond question — even to bring it up is deemed irresponsible .
Why have we as a society been so quick to accept a theory for which so little solid evidence exists ?
Why do we take proclamations by government institutions like the NIH and the CDC , via newscasters and talk show hosts , entirely on faith ?
The average citizen has no idea how weak the connection really is between HIV and AIDS , and this is the manner in which scientifically insupportable phrases like " the AIDS virus " or " an AIDS test " have become part of the common vernacular despite no evidence for their accuracy .
When it was announced in 1984 that the cause of AIDS had been found in a retrovirus that came to be known as HIV , there was a palpable panic .
My own family was immediately affected by this panic , since my mother had had several blood transfusions in the early 1980s as a result of three late miscarriages she had experienced .
In the early days , we feared mosquito bites , kissing , and public toilet seats .
I can still recall the panic I felt after looking up in a public restroom and seeing some graffiti that read " Do you have AIDS yet ?
If not , sit on this toilet seat . "
But I was only ten years old then , and over time the panic subsided to more of a dull roar as it became clear that AIDS was not as easy to " catch " as we had initially believed .
Fear of going to the bathroom or the dentist was replaced with a more realistic wariness of having sex with anyone we did n't know really , really well .
As a teenager who was in no way promiscuous , I did n't have much to worry about .
That all changed — or so I thought — when I was twenty - one .
Due to circumstances in my personal life and a bit of paranoia that ( as it turned out , falsely and completely groundlessly ) led me to believe I had somehow contracted " AIDS , " I got an HIV test .
I spent two weeks waiting for the results , convinced that I would soon die , and that it would be " all my fault . "
This was despite the fact that I was perfectly healthy , did n't use drugs , and was n't promiscuous — low - risk by any definition .
As it happened , the test was negative , and , having felt I had been granted a reprieve , I vowed not to take more risks , and to quit worrying so much .
Over the past ten years , my attitude toward HIV and AIDS has undergone a dramatic shift .
This shift was catalyzed by the work I did as a graduate student , analyzing mathematical models of HIV and the immune system .
As a mathematician , I found virtually every model I studied to be unrealistic .
The biological assumptions on which the models were based varied from author to author , and this made no sense to me .
It was around this time , too , that I became increasingly perplexed by the stories I heard about long - term survivors .
From my admittedly inexpert viewpoint , the major thing they all had in common — other than HIV — was that they lived extremely healthy lifestyles .
Part of me was becoming suspicious that being HIV - positive did n't necessarily mean you would ever get AIDS .
By a rather curious twist of fate , it was on my way to a conference to present the results of a model of HIV that I had proposed together with my advisor , that I came across an article by Dr. David Rasnick about AIDS and the corruption of modern science .
As I sat on the airplane reading this story , in which he said " the more I examined HIV , the less it made sense that this largely inactive , barely detectable virus could cause such devastation , " everything he wrote started making sense to me in a way that the currently accepted model did not .
I did n't have anywhere near all the information , but my instincts told me that what he said seemed to fit .
Over the past ten years , I nevertheless continued my research into mathematical models of HIV infection , all the while keeping an ear open for dissenting voices .
By now , I have read hundreds of articles on HIV and AIDS , many from the dissident point of view but far , far more from that of the establishment , which unequivocally promotes the idea that HIV causes AIDS and that the case is closed .
In that time , I even published four papers on HIV ( from a modeling perspective ) .
I justified my contributions to a theory I was n't convinced of by telling myself these were purely theoretical , mathematical constructs , never to be applied in the real world .
I suppose , in some sense also , I wanted to keep an open mind .
So why is it that only now have I decided that enough is enough , and I can no longer in any capacity continue to support the paradigm on which my entire career has been built ?
As a mathematician , I was taught early on about the importance of clear definitions .
AIDS , if you consider its definition , is far from clear , and is in fact not even a consistent entity .
The classification " AIDS " was introduced in the early 1980s not as a disease but as a surveillance tool to help doctors and public health officials understand and control a strange " new " syndrome affecting mostly young gay men .
In the two decades intervening , it has evolved into something quite different .
AIDS today bears little or no resemblance to the syndrome for which it was named .
For one thing , the definition has actually been changed by the CDC several times , continually expanding to include ever more diseases ( all of which existed for decades prior to AIDS ) , and sometimes , no disease whatsoever .
More than half of all AIDS diagnoses in the past several years in the United States have been made on the basis of a T - cell count and a " confirmed " positive antibody test — in other words , a deadly disease has been diagnosed over and over again on the basis of no clinical disease at all .
And the leading cause of death in HIV - positives in the last few years has been liver failure , not an AIDS - defining disease in any way , but rather an acknowledged side effect of protease inhibitors , which asymptomatic individuals take in massive daily doses , for years .
The epidemiology of HIV and AIDS is puzzling and unclear as well .
In spite of the fact that AIDS cases increased rapidly from their initial observation in the early 1980s and reached a peak in 1993 before declining rapidly , the number of HIV - positive individuals in the U.S. has remained constant at one million since the advent of widespread HIV antibody testing .
This can not be due to anti-HIV therapy , since the annual mortality rate of North American HIV - positives who are treated with anti-HIV drugs is much higher — between 6.7 and 8.8 % — than would be the approximately 12 % global mortality rate of HIV - positives if all AIDS cases were fatal in a given year .
Even more strangely , HIV has been present everywhere in the U.S. , in every population tested including repeat blood donors and military recruits , at a virtually constant rate since testing began in 1985 .
It is deeply confusing that a virus thought to have been brought to the AIDS epicenters of New York , San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 1970s could possibly have spread so rapidly at first , yet have stopped spreading completely as soon as testing began .
Returning for a moment to the mathematical modeling , one aspect that had always puzzled me was the lack of agreement on how to accurately represent the actual biological mechanism of immune impairment .
AIDS is said to be caused by a dramatic loss of the immune system 's T - cells , said loss being presumably caused by HIV .
Why then could no one agree on how to mathematically model the dynamics of the fundamental disease process — that is , how are T - cells actually killed by HIV ?
Early models assumed that HIV killed T - cells directly , by what is referred to as lysis .
An infected cell lyses , or bursts , when the internal viral burden is so high that it can no longer be contained , just like your grocery bag breaks when it 's too full .
This is in fact the accepted mechanism of pathogenesis for virtually all other viruses .
But it became clear that HIV did not in fact kill T - cells in this manner , and this concept was abandoned , to be replaced by various other ones , each of which resulted in very different models and , therefore , different predictions .
Which model was " correct " never was clear .
As it turns out , the reason there was no consensus mathematically as to how HIV killed T - cells was because there was no biological consensus .
There still is n't .
HIV is possibly the most studied microbe in history — certainly it is the best - funded — yet there is still no agreed - upon mechanism of pathogenesis .
Worse than that , there are no data to support the hypothesis that HIV kills T - cells at all .
It does n't in the test tube .
It mostly just sits there , as it does in people — if it can be found at all .
In Robert Gallo ’s seminal 1984 paper in which he claims " proof " that HIV causes AIDS , actual HIV could be found in only 26 out of 72 AIDS patients .
To date , actual HIV remains an elusive target in those with AIDS or simply HIV - positive .
This is starkly illustrated by the continued use of antibody tests to diagnose HIV infection .
Antibody tests are fairly standard to test for certain microbes , but for anything other than HIV , the main reason they are used in place of direct tests ( that is , actually looking for the bacteria or virus itself ) is because they are generally much easier and cheaper than direct testing .
Most importantly , such antibody tests have been rigorously verified against the gold standard of microbial isolation .
This stands in vivid contrast to HIV , for which antibody tests are used because there exists no test for the actual virus .
As to so - called " viral load , " most people are not aware that tests for viral load are neither licensed nor recommended by the FDA to diagnose HIV infection .
This is why an " AIDS test " is still an antibody test .
Viral load , however , is used to estimate the health status of those already diagnosed HIV - positive .
But there are very good reasons to believe it does not work at all .
Viral load uses either PCR or a technique called branched - chained DNA amplification ( bDNA ) .
PCR is the same technique used for " DNA fingerprinting " at crime scenes where only trace amounts of materials can be found .
PCR essentially mass - produces DNA or RNA so that it can be seen .
If something has to be mass - produced to even be seen , and the result of that mass - production is used to estimate how much of a pathogen there is , it might lead a person to wonder how relevant the pathogen was in the first place .
Specifically , how could something so hard to find , even using the most sensitive and sophisticated technology , completely decimate the immune system ?
bDNA , while not magnifying anything directly , nevertheless looks only for fragments of DNA believed , but not proven , to be components of the genome of HIV — but there is no evidence to say that these fragments do n't exist in other genetic sequences unrelated to HIV or to any virus .
It is worth noting at this point that viral load , like antibody tests , has never been verified against the gold standard of HIV isolation .
bDNA uses PCR as a gold standard , PCR uses antibody tests as a gold standard , and antibody tests use each other .
None use HIV itself .
There is good reason to believe the antibody tests are flawed as well .
The two types of tests routinely used are the ELISA and the Western Blot ( WB ) .
The current testing protocol is to " verify " a positive ELISA with the " more specific " WB ( which has actually been banned from diagnostic use in the UK because it is so unreliable ) .
But few people know that the criteria for a positive WB vary from country to country and even from lab to lab .
Put bluntly , a person 's HIV status could well change depending on the testing venue .
It is also possible to test " WB indeterminate , " which translates to any one of " uninfected , " " possibly infected , " or even , absurdly , " partly infected " under the current interpretation .
This conundrum is confounded by the fact that the proteins comprising the different reactive " bands " on the WB test are all claimed to be specific to HIV , raising the question of how a truly uninfected individual could possess antibodies to even one " HIV - specific " protein .
I have come to sincerely believe that these HIV tests do immeasurably more harm than good , due to their astounding lack of specificity and standardization .
I can buy the idea that anonymous screening of the blood supply for some nonspecific marker of ill health ( which , due to cross reactivity with many known pathogens , a positive HIV antibody test often seems to be ) is useful .
I cannot buy the idea that any individual needs to have a diagnostic HIV test .
A negative test may not be accurate ( whatever that means ) , but a positive one can create utter havoc and destruction in a person 's life — all for a virus that most likely does absolutely nothing .
I do not feel it is going too far to say that these tests ought to be banned for diagnostic purposes .
The real victims in this mess are those whose lives are turned upside - down by the stigma of an HIV diagnosis .
These people , most of whom are perfectly healthy , are encouraged to avoid intimacy and are further branded with the implication that they were somehow dreadfully foolish and careless .
Worse , they are encouraged to take massive daily doses of some of the most toxic drugs ever manufactured .
HIV , for many years , has fulfilled the role of a microscopic terrorist .
People have lost their jobs , been denied entry into the Armed Forces , been refused residency in and even entry into some countries , even been charged with assault or murder for having consensual sex ; babies have been taken from their mothers and had toxic medications forced down their throats .
There is no precedent for this type of behavior , as it is all in the name of a completely unproven , fundamentally flawed hypothesis , on the basis of highly suspect , indirect tests for supposed infection with an allegedly deadly virus — a virus that has never been observed to do much of anything .
As to the question of what does cause AIDS , if it is not HIV , there are many plausible explanations given by people known to be experts .
Before the discovery of HIV , AIDS was assumed to be a lifestyle syndrome caused mostly by indiscriminate use of recreational drugs .
Immunosuppression has multiple causes , from an overload of microbes to malnutrition .
Probably all of these are true causes of AIDS .
Immune deficiency has many manifestations , and a syndrome with many manifestations is likely multicausal as well .
Suffice it to say that the HIV hypothesis of AIDS has offered nothing but predictions — of its spread , of the availability of a vaccine , of a forthcoming animal model , and so on — that have not materialized , and it has not saved a single life .
After ten years involved in the academic side of HIV research , as well as in the academic world at large , I truly believe that the blame for the universal , unconditional , faith - based acceptance of such a flawed theory falls squarely on the shoulders of those among us who have actively endorsed a completely unproven hypothesis in the interests of furthering our careers .
Of course , hypotheses in science deserve to be studied , but no hypothesis should be accepted as fact before it is proven , particularly one whose blind acceptance has such dire consequences .
For over twenty years , the general public has been greatly misled and ill - informed .
As someone who has been raised by parents who taught me from a young age never to believe anything just because " everyone else accepts it to be true , " I can no longer just sit by and do nothing , thereby contributing to this craziness .
And the craziness has gone on long enough .
As humans  as honest academics and scientists  the only thing we can do is allow the truth to come to light .

The Best of Rebecca V. Culshaw
The Gym
It ’s Wednesday night and I ’m at the gym .
I ’ve been working out faithfully since the middle of summer .
My cholesterol ’s down , I ’ve lost some weight , and my doctor ’s thrilled with my blood pressure .
The health benefits are nice , but the real reason I ’m exercising is to look better naked .
The gym I go to is hardcore bodybuilders , cops , fireman , and soldiers for the Russian Mafia .
The facility ’s well run , clean , and five minutes from my apartment .
The after work crowd is already thinning out .
I ’m grunting through a set of lat pull downs when I hear a female voice yell , “ I know how to do it ! ”
I swivel my head towards the sound of the woman ’s voice .
It belongs to the young blonde sitting on the machine next to me .
If looks could kill the young man hovering next to her would be incinerated .
“ You ’re doing it all wrong , ” the guy says .
“ Let me show you . ”
“ I ’ve been working out for twelve years ! ” the girl says loudly .
“ I do n’t need your advice ! ” I stifle a laugh .
If that ’s true she ’s been going to the gym since she was eight .
“ I ’m just trying to help you out , ” the young man says , a hurt look on his face .
The girl ’s a knockout and not a day over twenty .
She has n’t figured out how to handle the male attention her body generates .
She will eventually .
The young man has no idea what he ’s doing .
Rule number one kid ?
Do n’t try picking up girls in the gym .
Too much insecurity flying around .
The girl gives the boy a withering stare .
I wince sympathetically .
I made similar mistakes when I was that guy ’s age .
I ’m older and wiser now – so when I fuck up its with dignified maturity .
The young man throws up his hands and walks away .
The blonde turns and looks at me .
“ What a jerk , ” she mutters .
I give her a smile and shrug .
Leave me out of it .
Finished with the weights I go into the cardio room .
I hop on an elliptical trainer and start pedaling .
I ’m just beginning to work up a sweat when Annoying Cardio Guy hops on the machine next to me .
Annoying Cardio
Guy is my age and spends most of his day at the gym .
Psychotically fit , what makes him annoying is how he frenetically pedals the shit out of the elliptical machine .
With each overpowered step he takes , the machine produces a metallic bang that can be heard out in the parking lot .
It ’s like exercising next to a jackhammer .
As Annoying Cardio Guy pounds through his workout , the sweat drips off him , puddling on the rubberized floor .
I begin to smell pepperoni .
Maybe the odors emanating from him .
Maybe it is n’t .
But if he farts I ’m out of here .
I sigh deeply and do what the nuns from my childhood told me to do offer it up .
When you think about it , the gym is a great place to develop the civic virtue of tolerance .
And when I say tolerance I do n’t mean acceptance .
I define tolerance the way the great social philosopher Mr. Garrison , from South Park would .
“ Just because you have to tolerate something does n’t mean you have to approve of it !
Tolerate means you ’re just putting up with it !
You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or , or you tolerate a bad cold .
It can still piss you off !
Jesus Tapdancing Christ ! ”
My old nuns would have agreed .
They would have said we sometimes need to put up with other peoples quirks so they ’ll put up with ours .
I do n’t think the nuns would have approved of the tap dancing Jesus part though .
After a few minutes the rhythmic banging from Annoying Cardio Guy ’s exercise machine begins to prey on my psyche like Chinese water torture .
Today was a bad day to leave my iPod at home .
I look at the clock .
I ’m getting tired .
Maybe I should call it quits .
Just then the petulant knockout blonde from earlier walks into the cardio room .
She tosses me a glance , plugs a pair of head phones into her ears , and hops on the machine in front of me .
As I watch the girls , uh , muscles move and flex under her spandex outfit , I somehow rediscover my commitment to fitness .
This I can tolerate .
I smile to myself .
The good nuns probably would n’t approve of whats going through my head now either .
Few of us today want to see the Russians as enemies .
We admire their music and literature , sympathise with their appalling history and , a few years ago , delighted in their emergence from the sour , brooding seclusion in which they languished for most of the 20th century .
It is precisely because we feel goodwill towards them that there is something of the bitterness of rejected courtship in our response to their recent behaviour , of which the apparent murder of Alexander Litvinenko is a bleak manifestation .
Why , having tasted freedom and democracy , should they wish to return to the murderous practices of Stalinism ?
How can they acquiesce in Putin 's restoration of tyranny ?
Here is a nation suddenly granted wealth which might enable its people to become prosperous social democrats like us .
Instead , to our bewilderment , Russia is institutionalising a state gangster culture which promises repression and ultimate economic failure for itself , fear and alienation from the rest of the world .
We hear of few Russians at home or abroad who have achieved wealth through honest toil .
Instead , the tools of success in Putin 's universe are corruption , violence , vice and licensed theft on a colossal scale .
" Complex feelings of insecurity , of envy and resentment towards Europe ... define the Russian national consciousness , " wrote Orlando Figes , the outstanding British historian of the country .
Underpinning all Putin 's dealings with the outside world is a demand for respect , a rage at perceived western condescension .
This is shared by his people , in a fashion which goes far to explain why so many support his policies .
Frustration about lack of respect has been woven into Russian foreign policy for centuries , accentuated under communist rule .
A Romanian who visited Russia in September 1944 was awed by the hardships accepted by Stalin 's people .
He noted a blend of arrogance and inferiority complex in their attitudes to the outside world : " They are aware of their great victories but at the same time fear they are not being shown sufficient respect .
This upsets them . "
Russian responses to western failures of deference have often been indistinguishable from those of the yob on a suburban train who assaults an innocent commuter because he dislikes the way the man looks at him .
State violence has been an unembarrassed part of the Russian polity since time immemorial .
There was much hand - wringing in the west earlier this year when Russia 's parliament formally endorsed the principle that its government enjoys a right to hunt down state enemies overseas .
Moscow dismissed the foreign reaction as bourgeois hypocrisy .
Had not President Bush publicly committed the US to a doctrine of preventive war against entire countries which he deems a threat to American security ?
It is possible to believe , as I do , that Putin did not personally order the murder of Alexander Litvinenko , while regarding the Russian president as overlord of a culture which legitimised it .
Putin cannot shrug off a simple truth about his society : his friends and supporters walk the streets in safety and wealth ; his foes perish in horrible ways , with dismal frequency .
The murder of one Russian journalist critical of his regime might be dismissed as mischance .
The deaths of 20 mock Kremlin protestations of innocence .
The end of the cold war looks more and more like one of those practical jokes the gods play upon mankind .
We rushed to celebrate the fall of the wall , the passing of an era in which east and west threatened each other with nuclear annihilation .
Yet we now perceive that dealing with a Russia rich in energy wealth presents more complex challenges .
It is a notable irony that the RAF will soon get the first of £ 20 bn worth of Typhoon fighters , an idiotic cold - war legacy .
All the participating European governments involved flinched before the diplomatic difficulties and job losses which would have followed cancellation .
We are to possess a formidable force of aircraft designed to shoot down Soviet bombers .
It is hard to conceive any scenario in which Moscow will launch bombers against the west .
Instead we must confront a defiant new Russia , fortified by possession of a substantial part of the world 's oil and gas reserves in an era when energy competition will be critical .
Even if Scotland Yard delivers a report on the Litvinenko death which concludes that the Kremlin was directly responsible , it is hard to see how Tony Blair could respond by ordering the scrambling of Typhoons .
Thus far , the response of European governments to Russian gangsterism and intransigence can either be dignified as temperate or scorned as appeasement .
Blair has sought to forge a personal friendship with Putin .
The former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder has been rewarded for his support of Moscow policies with a directorship of Gazprom - the company building a pipeline that will supply gas directly from Russia to Germany .
At the G8 in St Petersburg earlier this year , other world powers sought to treat the Russians as if they were people like us , in the lingering hope that they will become so .
This seems fanciful .
At the heart of Putin 's policies is a determination to restore the old Soviet Union 's might and influence .
It is hard to see how these would be exercised towards ends that the west would consider benign .
Though George Bush 's follies have debased the coinage of freedom and democracy , these remain noble objectives , never likely to be shared by Moscow .
This is a city where taxi drivers see no embarrassment in carrying miniature portraits of Stalin on their dashboards , where the British historian Antony Beevor is denounced because he speaks the truth about Soviet excesses in the second world war .
The Russian archives , which provided such a bonanza for western researchers for more than a decade after they were opened , are now largely closed again .
There is no pretence that this reflects national - security requirements .
It is merely because Putin was disgusted by the revelations which the files yielded to us about the horrors of the Stalinist era .
The collapse of the Soviet Union , which the world perceived as a triumph for freedom , is described by the president himself as the greatest calamity of the 20th century .
Western revulsion from Russian behaviour , including the murder of Litvinenko , merely feeds Russian paranoia .
Our hopes that contact with the west will persuade the new Russia to adopt civilised behaviour look threadbare .
" We sometimes say that one must be very unlucky to be born in Russia , " a melancholy tourist guide said to me in St Petersburg a couple of years back .
The west has no choice save to continue the weary struggle to engage with Moscow .
It would be naive , however , to anticipate that freedom and respect for law will triumph any day soon in that tragic , sometimes apparently accursed society .

Burt Rutan :
What the hell have we been doing ?
Burt Rutan , speaking at the National Space Society ’s 2005 conference , takes NASA to task for decades without meaningful progress in manned spaceflight .
Powerful words from the man who designed , built , and successfully launched his own spacecraft on more flights that year than all other space programs combined .

[ The SR - 71 and Concorde ] went all the way through their life cycle until they got too rusty to maintain , and got shut down and we retreated back to the same performance , military and commercial , that we had in 1960 .
Guys , that was 45 years ago .
Now go back from 1960 , 45 years earlier when airplanes were biplanes with fabric wings and wooden propellers .

Story Highlights • NEW : Percussion device at school causes no deaths or injuries , official says
• NEW : Gunmen then fire at electric plant , spokesman says
• Security forces reportedly surround house containing gunmen
• 11 killed when Iranian military bus bombed in same city Wednesday
Adjust font size :
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
A bomb went off Friday night at a girls school in the southeastern Iranian border city of Zahedan , according to the semi-official FARS News Agency .
No one was hurt or killed in the 10 p.m. ( 1:30 p.m. ET ) blast , a military spokesman told the Web site of Iran 's state television , Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting .
The spokesman , identified as Col. Goodarzi , told IRIB that based on initial information from the scene , a number of militants exploded a percussion bomb in the city and fired at an electricity plant before running away and hiding at a nearby house .
Security forces have surrounded the building in an attempt to arrest them , he said .
Electricity has been cut , and reporters are barred from the area , but gunfire could be heard in the streets .
Zahedan is near where Iran , Pakistan and Afghanistan meet .
According to FARS , the leader of the Jondollah group , Abdolmalek Rigy , claimed responsibility for the bombing on MKO - TV .
The group also claimed responsibility for a car bomb in the same area Wednesday .
MKO stands for the Mojahedin Khalq Organization , an Iranian terrorist group stationed in Iraq .
On Wednesday , a car bomb struck an Iranian military bus in Zahedan , killing at least 11 people and wounding more than 30 .
( Full story )
A witness told the state - run Iranian news agency IRNA that the car blew up as soon as the bus , which belonged to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , arrived to pick up military personnel at a barracks .
The small terrorist group Jondollah claimed responsibility for Wednesday 's attack , FARS reported .
The group has a history of launching attacks at Iranian border posts .
IRNA reported that five people , including a failed suicide bomber , were arrested after the attack .
According to FARS , Iranian officials said the explosives used in that attack were manufactured in the United States .
CNN could not verify those claims .

Problem : Find a regular expression , compatible with GNU grep , that recognises strings of 1's and 0's that form the binary expansion of multiples of 7 .
( Consider the empty string to be zero . ) Solution :
Here 's one ( though not necessarily a good one ) :
The standard approach to solving this problem is probably to construct a finite state automaton to compute the remainder modulo 7 of a binary string and then use the proof of Kleene 's theorem to convert the automaton to a regular expression .
But as I have some regular expression code left over from a previous post I thought I 'd try a purely algebraic approach .
Although it 's ultimately equivalent to deriving a finite state automaton I thought it might be more fun to use intuitions about linear algebra to get to the solution .
And anyway , drawing diagrams with HTML is hard ... Consider first recognising multiples of 3 .
Assume we have three regular expressions , A , B and C . A corresponds to multiples of 3 , B corresponds to numbers that are 1 modulo 3 and C matches numbers that are 2 modulo 3 .
Then we know First a note about notation : I 'm using boldandto represent binary digits but using regular 0 to represent the regular expression matching nothing and regular 1 to represent the regular expression matching the empty string .
a+b means match a or b .
So we can interpret the equation for A , say , as saying that a multiple of 3 is the empty string , or a multiple of 3 followed by a , or aafter one more than a multiple of 3 .
Similar interpretations apply for the other two equations .
We can rewrite this aswhereandWe can now use our ordinary intuitions about solving linear systems .
We want to solve for A so we need to eliminate B and C. Start by eliminating C .
We have
If we were doing ordinary linear algebra we could saybut for regular expressions we can neither subtract nor divide .
However , arguing informally now , ( 1 - a ) =1+a+a² + a³+… =aso now we can writeAnyway , those are all the principles we need .
Just eliminate each variable in turn by solving for it in terms of the other remaining variables and substituting the solution back into the remaining equations .
You should be able to finish the job and solve for A .
But you 'll notice the work gets tedious for larger integers .
That 's where the code comes in .
It starts as before but we can delete a whole lot of material :
My simplification rules are still really poor .
( Buggy , in fact , but not buggy in a way that leads to incorrect results . )
That means we do n't expect the final regular expressions to be in any way efficient .
But I 'm not trying to get the best solution , just a solution .
I 'm representing the vector v and matrix M above as simple associative arrays whose elements are found using .
Elements not represented are assumed to be 0.handles the sparse lookup : implements exactly the solution method described above .
The use ofcorresponds to my abuse of the binomial series for ( 1 - a ) above .
However rather than manipulate equations I 'm always working in terms of matrices and vectors over the regular expressions : substitutes a solution to an equation given byinto the remainder of the equations .
As I describe above , a variable is eliminated by solving for it and then substituting :
Now some code to output our regular expressions in a form compatible with grep :
Now construct M and v for the equations describing the regular expressions for the classes of binary strings modulo n: To solve a complete set of equations we reduce it one equation at a time by eliminating variables :
Print regular expression to detect multiples of 7 : Try integers besides 7 .
But note that the expressions get more and more complex .
And of course you can use the equation solving approach for problems besides recognising multiples of integers .
PS I just noticed some of the indentation went wrong on translation to HTML .
But the code appears to still compile fine with GHC .

The Queen will urge respect for the elderly and a need to " guide the young " in her Christmas speech this year .
Her December 25 message will stress the importance of a strong relationship between the generations .
More here ...
• Queen :
The nation must ' nurture young people '
• Fishnet clad Kate legs it to party with booze brothers Wills and Harry
And as if to prove her own youthful credentials , the Queen is making her speech available to download as a podcast .
It means that , for the first time , her subjects will be able to watch and listen to her traditional 3 pm broadcast on their iPods , MP3 players or mobile phones .
A download can be ordered free in advance from the Monarchy 's website , www.royal.gov.uk.
Subscribers will automatically receive the podcast on Christmas Day at 3 pm , when the Queen 's address is aired across the Commonwealth .
There is also a " click and play " option to watch the speech online .
The Queen 's theme this year is to highlight a need to steer young people away from trouble and towards more positive roles in life , while also teaching them to respect their elders .
She believes it is a message that has long been taught by religion and should be picked up by society as a whole .
She will say : " The wisdom and experience of the great religions point to the need to nurture and guide the young , and to encourage respect for the elderly . "
Buckingham Palace described the speech as highlighting " what old and young have to offer each other , and how all faiths highlight the need to nurture and guide young people . "
It was filmed at Southwark Cathedral in London .
In a preview , the Queen , wearing a spring green outfit , is shown chatting to schoolchildren as she helps them make a triptych collage of a nativity scene .
" It should twinkle rather well should n't it ... especially when the lights are on it , " the Queen tells them .
One of the youngsters remarks , as the Queen adds a piece of the mosaic to baby Jesus 's halo , that it " looks brilliant " .
The rest of her message , which was produced by ITN , remains confidential until it is aired on Christmas Day .
When she turned 80 in April this year , the Queen was described by one of her friends as " taking a leaf out of her mother 's book - the older she gets , the more she likes being surrounded by young people " .
She has also recorded a separate radio message for the Armed Services and their families .
It will be played to troops both in the UK and on postings overseas early on Christmas Eve morning .
King George
V delivered the first royal Christmas broadcast live on the radio more than 70 years ago , from Sandringham in 1932 .
He read a message composed by author Rudyard Kipling .
The original idea was suggested by Sir John Reith , the founding father of the BBC , to inaugurate the Empire Service , now the BBC World Service .
George V was at first unsure about using the relatively untried medium of the wireless , but eventually agreed .
Now his granddaughter , the Queen , is also adopting the latest technology as she makes her message available as a podcast .
She made her first Christmas broadcast in 1952 and the annual message was first televised in 1957 .
She has delivered one every year except in 1969 , when she decided the royals had been on TV enough that year following an unprecedented documentary the family made about their life .
Her greeting took the form of a written address .
The Queen 's Speech was traditionally produced by the BBC for more than 50 years but the job has been shared with ITN on an alternating basis since 1997 .
When Buckingham Palace decided to end the BBC 's monopoly , it was seen as retaliation for its Panorama interview with the Princess of Wales in November 1995 , which was not sanctioned by Buckingham Palace .
The palace denied that a slight was intended and said that it had been considering for some time how to involve the ITV network as well as the BBC .
Last year the Queen praised the humanitarian response shown to those affected by the London suicide bombings and the devastating earthquake in Pakistan and India .
Since 1993 , Channel 4 has delivered its alternative Christmas message - clashing with the Queen's .
This year it will controversially feature a Muslim woman speaking from behind a full veil .
The programme makers had to find a replacement after the original woman , Khadija Ravat , backed out following criticism from inside and outside her community .
The replacement is not being named by the channel until the broadcast .

From New Orleans .
DON'T blame the Lady .
Katrina killed no one in this town .
In fact , Katrina missed the city completely , going wide to the east .
It was n't the hurricane that drowned , suffocated , de-hydrated and starved 1,500 people that week .
The killing was done by a deadly duo : a failed emergency evacuation plan combined with faulty levees .
Behind these twin failures lies a tale of cronyism , profiteering and willful incompetence that takes us right to the steps of the White House .
Here 's the story you have n't been told .
And the man who revealed it to me , Dr. Ivor van Heerden , is putting his job on the line to tell it .
Van Heerden is n't the typical whistleblower I usually deal with .
This is no minor player .
He 's the Deputy Director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center .
He 's the top banana in the field — no one knew more about how to save New Orleans from a hurricane 's devastation .
And no one was a bigger target of an official and corporate campaign to bury the information .
Here 's what happened .
Right after Katrina swamped the city , I called Washington to get a copy of the evacuation plan .
Funny thing about the murderously failed plan for the evacuation of New Orleans : no one can find it .
That 's right .
It 's missing .
Maybe it got wet and sank in the flood .
Whatever :
No one can find it .
That 's real bad .
Here 's the key thing about a successful emergency evacuation plan : you have to have copies of it .
Lots of copies — in fire houses and in hospitals and in the hands of every first responder .
Secret evacuation plans do n't work .
I know , I worked on the hurricane evacuation plan for Long Island New York , an elaborate multi-volume dossier .
Specifically , I 'm talking about the plan that was written , or supposed to have been written two years ago by a company called , “ Innovative Emergency Management . ”
Weird thing about IEM , their founder Madhu Beriwal , had no known experience in hurricane evacuations .
She did , however , have a lot of experience in donating to Republicans .
IEM and FEMA did begin a draft of a plan .
The plan was that , when a hurricane hit , everyone in the Crescent City would simply get the hell out in their cars .
Apparently , the IEM / FEMA crew did n't know that 127,000 people in the city did n't have cars .
But Dr. van Heerden knew that .
It was his calculation .
LSU knew where these no -car people were — they mapped it — and how to get them out .
Dr. van Heerden offered this life - saving info to FEMA .
They would n't touch it .
Then , a state official told him to shut up , back off or there would be consequences for van Heerden 's position .
This official now works for IEM .
So I asked him what happened as a result of making no plans for those without wheels , a lot of them elderly and most of them poor .
“ Fifteen - hundred of them drowned .
That 's the bottom line . ”
The professor , who'd been talking to me in technicalities , changed to a somber tone .
“ They 're still finding corpses . ”
Van Heerden is supposed to keep his mouth shut .
He wo n't .
The deaths weigh on him .
“ I was n't going to listen to those sort of threats , to let them shut me down . ”
Van Heerden had other disturbing news .
The Hurricane Center 's computer models showed the federal government had built the levees around the city a foot - and - a - half too short .
After Katrina , the Hurricane Center analyzed the flooding and found that , had the levees had just that extra 18 inches , they would have been “ overtopped ” for only an hour and a half , not four hours .
In that case , the levees would have held , and the city would have been saved .
He had taken the warning about the levees all the way to George Bush 's doorstep .
“ I myself briefed senior officials including somebody from the White House . ”
The response : the university 's trustees threatened his job .
While in Baton Rouge , I dropped in on the headquarters of IEM , the evacuation contractors .
The assistant to the CEO insisted they had “ a lot of experience with evacuation ” — but could n't name a single city they 'd planned for when they got the Big Easy contract .
And still , they could n't produce the plan .
An IEM press release in June 2004 boasted legendary expert James Lee Witt as a member of their team .
That was impressive .
It was also a lie .
In fact , Witt had nothing to do with it .
When I asked IEM point blank if Witt 's name was used as a fraudulent hook to get the contract , their spokeswoman said , weirdly , “ We 'll get back to you on that . ”
Back at LSU , van Heerden astonished me with the most serious charge of all .
While showing me huge maps of the flooding , he told me the White House had withheld the information that , in fact , the levees were about to burst and by Tuesday at dawn the city , and more than a thousand people , would drown .
Van Heerden said , “ FEMA knew on Monday at 11 o'clock that the levees had breached …
They took video .
By midnight on Monday the White House knew .
But none of us knew … I was at the State Emergency Operations Center . ”
Because the hurricane had missed the city that Monday night , evacuation effectively stopped , assuming the city had survived .
It 's been a full year now , and 73,000 New Orleanians remain in FEMA trailers and another 200,000 , more than half the city 's former residents , remain in temporary refuges .
“ The City That Care Forgot ” — that 's their official slogan — lost a higher percentage of homes than Berlin lost in World War II .
It would be more accurate to call it , “ The City That Bush Forgot . ”
Should they come home ?
Rebuild ?
Is it safe ?
Team Bush assures them there 's nothing to worry about : FEMA wo n't respond to van Heerden 's revelations .
However , the Bush Administration has hired a consulting firm to fix the failed evacuation plan .
The contractor ?
A Baton Rouge company named “ Innovative Emergency Management . ” IEM .

Los Angeles
As President Bush scurries back to the Gulf Coast , it is clear that this is the greatest challenge to politics - as - usual in America since the fall of Richard Nixon in the 1970s .
Mr Bush 's famed " folksy " style has failed to impress in this crisis
But unlike Watergate , " Katrinagate " was public service journalism ruthlessly exposing the truth on a live and continuous basis .
Instead of secretive " Deep Throat " meetings in car - parks , cameras captured the immediate reality of what was happening at the New Orleans Convention Center , making a mockery of the stalling and excuses being put forward by those in power .
Amidst the horror , American broadcast journalism just might have grown its spine back , thanks to Katrina .
National politics reporters and anchors here come largely from the same race and class as the people they are supposed to be holding to account .
They live in the same suburbs , go to the same parties , and they are in debt to the same huge business interests .
Giant corporations own the networks , and Washington politicians rely on them and their executives to fund their re-election campaigns across the 50 states .
It is a perfect recipe for a timid and self - censoring journalistic culture that is no match for the masterfully aggressive spin-surgeons of the Bush administration .
' Lies or ignorance '
But last week the complacency stopped , and the moral indignation against inadequate government began to flow , from slick anchors who spend most of their time glued to desks in New York and Washington .
Images of the military in a US city have shocked many Americans
This highly successful Murdoch - owned station sets itself up in opposition to the " mainstream liberal media elite " .
But with the sick and the dying forced to sit in their own excrement behind him in New Orleans , its early - evening anchor Shepard Smith declared civil war against the studio - driven notion that the biggest problem was still stopping the looters .
On other networks like NBC , CNN and ABC it was the authority figures , who are so used to an easy ride at press conferences , that felt the full force of reporters finally determined to ditch the deference .
As the heads of the Homeland Security department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) appeared for network interviews , their defensive remarks about where aid was arriving to , and when , were exposed immediately as either downright lies or breath - taking ignorance .
And you did not need a degree in journalism to know it either .
Just watching TV for the previous few hours would have sufficed .
Iraq concern
When the back - slapping president told the Fema boss on Friday morning that he was doing " a heck of a job " and spent most of his first live news conference in the stricken area praising all the politicians and chiefs who had failed so clearly , it beggared belief .
The president looked affronted when a reporter covering his Mississippi walkabout had the temerity to suggest that having a third of the National Guard from the affected states on duty in Iraq might be a factor .
Thousands were forced to wait days for food and shelter
And it is not only on TV and radio where the gloves have come off .
The most artful supporter of the administration on the staff of the New York Times , columnist David Brooks , has also had enough .
He and others are calling the debacle the " anti 9 - 11 " : " The first rule of the social fabric - that in times of crisis you protect the vulnerable - was trampled , " he wrote on Sunday .
" Leaving the poor in New Orleans was the moral equivalent of leaving the injured on the battlefield . "
Media emboldened
It is way too early to tell whether this really will become " Katrinagate " for President Bush , but how he and his huge retinue of politically - appointed bureaucrats react in the weeks ahead will be decisive .
Government has been thrown into disrepute , and many Americans have realised , for the first time , that the collapsed , rotten flood defences of New Orleans are a symbol of failed infrastructure across the nation .
Blaming the state and city officials , as the president is already trying to do over Katrina , will not wash .
Black America will not forget the government failures , and nor will the Gulf Coast region
Viewpoint : US shamed
The dithering and incompetence that will be exposed will not spare the commander - in - chief , or the sunny , faith - based propaganda that he was still spouting as he left New Orleans airport last Friday , saying it was all going to turn out fine .
People were still trapped , hungry and dying on his watch , less than a mile away .
Black America will not forget the government failures , nor will the Gulf Coast region .
Tens of thousands of voters whose lives have been so devastated will cast their mid-term ballots in Texas next year - the president 's adopted home state .
The final word belongs to the historic newspaper at the centre of the hurricane - The New Orleans Times - Picayune .
At the weekend , this now - homeless institution published an open letter : " We 're angry , Mr President , and we 'll be angry long after our beloved city and surrounding parishes have been pumped dry .
" Our people deserved rescuing .
Many who could have been , were not .
That 's to the government 's shame . "
もの人がブックマークしているこの「 Rubyを仕事に使うべし！」という記事で書かれているRubyの優れた特徴は、実際のところ、どの部分が、どこまで本当なのでしょうか？
少し検証してみたいと思います。
「 Rubyがスゴイ」とされる点のどれがホントでどれがウソ？
「 Rubyを仕事に使うべし」では、まず、Rubyの特徴として、
( 1)いろんな言語のいいとこ取り
( 2) 構文が強 力
(3) 楽しくプログラミン グ
(4)問題が起こりにくいように設計されている という点を冒頭で掲げています。
まず、これらをどのように検証すればよいか、考えてみます。
まず、(1)のいいとこ取りについては、いいとこ取りをし続けながらいつも進化しているのは、最近の言語はみんなそうで、それはRuby独自の特徴でもなんでもありません。
たとえば、C#は、その典型で、VM、自動メモリ管理、パッケージによる名前空間管理、マルチスレッド、ベリファイアはJavaから、GenericsはC++から、強力な正規表現はPerlから、アノニマスメソッドはLISPのラムダやクロージャーのパクりでしょう。
そして、そのパクられ元であるJava、C++、Perlもオリジナルじゃなく、さらに別言語からパクりまくってきています。*1
なので、 「いいとこ取り」などという抽象的なことを言っていてもダメで、具体的に、どのような機能(の組み合わせ)が生み出すどのような具体的メリットが他の言語に無くって、Rubyにあるのか、そういう具体的な部分がキモなわけです。
そして、これ は( 2) 〜( 4)についても同じで、他の言語だって、強力な構文はあるし、やり方しだいで楽しくプログラミング出来るし、問題が起こりにくいように設計もされているわけで、すべて、個々の具体的な機能が生み出す、具体的なメリットについて、Ruby独自のものがあるかどうか、という裏付けのあるものだけが、唯一意味のあるRubyの特徴と言えるのではないでしょうか？
そして、もと記事の作者の方も当然そこのところが分かっているので、
( A ) メタプログラミング
( B) ブロック構 文 の２つをRubyの力の源泉としてあげています。
しかし、多くのケースで 、Ruby の「 メタプログラミング 」 と「ブロック構文」と同様のことを実現できる機能は、他の言語にもあります。それらと具体的にどのようにメリットの違いがあるのかを、具体的に比較しなければ、きちんとした比較になりません。
「 ブロック構文があるからRubyが生産性が高い」というのはどこまで本当か？
たとえば、ブロック構文については、C#で、ある特定ブロックだけ別スレッドで実行したかったら、以下のように記述できます。 string cmd = " LiveForever " ; if ( cmd != null ) { f.th ( delegate { // ここからブロック開始 f.sleep(300 ) ; processCommand ( cmd ) ; // ここがブロックの終わり } ) ; } このコードで面白いのは、別スレッドで実行されるブロックの中から、元のスレッドで使われていたcmdという一時変数に、そのままアクセスできていることです。いわゆるクロージャもどきですね。LISPプログラマからは、「20年前から知っとるわ」とか言われるでしょうけど。
ちなみに、この、f.thというメソッドは、.NETのクラスライブラリにデフォルトで組み込まれているものに、シンプルな汎用ラッパをかぶせたものです。ちなみに、その汎用ラッパは、一行で実装できます(笑 ) 。
もちろん、これは、スレッドにしか使えない構文でもなんでもなくって、普通に、コードブロックを引数みたいに他のメソッドに渡すことができます。
たとえば 、「取得する」というメソッドに、種別という名前の変数と、任意のコードブロックを引数として渡して実行するには、以下のように記述します。
取得する( 種別 , delegate { //ここからブロック開始 string id = getID ( tr_text , 重複 ) ; if ( rssid != null ) { MM cell_m = y.hm ( tr_text , @ " ( ]*>(? .+? ) \s*) {11} " ) ; if ( cell_m.成功 ) { try{ MyItem item = new MyItem ( ) ; item . ID = id ; CaptureCollection cells = cell_m.m. Groups [ " val " ] .
Captures ; string str ; str = cells [ 5 ] .
ToString ( ) ; item.CurrentVal = int.Parse ( str , NumberStyles .
Any ) ; } catch ( Exception ex ) { print ( ex ) ; print ( " tr_text : " + tr_text ) ; } } } // ここでブロック終了 } ) ;
ただ、これは、ダイナミック言語のように、実際にコードブロックを引数で渡しているわけじゃないです。
見かけ上、コードブロックを引数渡ししているかのように、ソースコードを記述できるだけなんですね。
実際には、C#のコンパイラが、コードブロックをメソッドに変換し、メソッドへのポインタをデリゲートオブジェクトでラップして渡しているんですね。
つまり、実際にコードブロックという、メタオブジェクトをパラメータとして渡しているわけじゃないんです。
しかし、ここで考えなきゃならないことは、プログラマーの「生産性 」と「気持ちよさ」です。
メソッドにコードブロックを引数として渡しているように記述した同じソースコードが、コンパイル時にメソッドに変換されようが、実行時に実際にコードブロックというメタオブジェクトとして渡されようが、プログラマにとっては、どちらでも良いのではないのか？という点が重要なのではないのでしょうか？
ソースコードの生産性と保守性と気持ちよさが変わらないのだったら、それが内部的にどのように実行されるかなど、どうでもいいことではないでしょうか？
むしろ、C#のように、型付けの強い言語の場合、コンパイル時に多くの部分を解決することを前提とした方が、コンパイラがいろいろ潜在的に問題のあるコードを自動チェックしてくれたり、また、開発環境が型を解析して、インテリセンスやリファクタ機能などの、コーディング生産性を向上させる機能を提供してくれるというメリットもあります。*2
結局、 「 具体的なメリット」と、「そのメリットが具体的にどの程度の頻度で生じるか」、ということを吟味すると、少なくとも、「ブロック構文があるからRubyが生産性が高い」かどうかは、この「Rubyを仕事に使うべし！」という記事では、まるで明らかにされていないのです。
そもそもメタプログラミングとは何か？ メタプログラミングとは、要は、プログラム自体を操作するプログラミングです。
たとえば、クラス、メソッド、コードブロックといったプログラムの構成要素を操作するわけです。
単純なものだと、あるクラスのクラス名を文字列として取得するプログラムも、ごく原始的なメタプログラミングと言えます。
そして、メタプログラミング機能は、おおざっぱに、読み出し系と書き込み系に分けられます。
たとえば、読み出し系の例では、実行時に外部から読み込んだXMLファイルの中に記述されたクラス名のクラスのオブジェクトを生成し、通信でサーバから送られてきたメソッド名のメソッドを実行するといったケースが、これに当たります。
また、たとえば、RDBのテーブル名と同じ名前のクラスを取ってきて、そのクラスのインスタンスをそのテーブルに格納されているレコードの数だけ生成し、そのレコードのフィールド名と同じ名前のインスタンスフィールドに、データを格納する、というプログラムが書けます。
もし、この読み出し系メタプログラミング機能がなかったら、RDBのテーブルごとに、このデータを読み出してオブジェクトにするルーチンを別々に用意しなければならないのですが、読み出し系メタプログラミング機能のおかげで、1回書けば、それを使い回せます。
ここでのミソは、プログラミング時には、それがどんなクラスで、どんなメソッドを持つか分からないのに、とにかくそのインスタンスを生成して、そのメソッドを実行する、というプログラムが書けてしまうことです。ソースコード内に、字面として現れないクラスやメソッドを実行できることがミソなわけです。
一方で、書き込み系のメタプログラミングは、たとえば、実行時に新しいクラスやメソッド自体を合成したり、書き換えたりする操作です。
これを使えば、たとえば、複数のクラスを実行時に足し合わせるようなことが出来ます。なので、多重継承を許さない言語処理系で、多重継承もどきのことができたりします。
あるいは、継承のセマンティックスを拡張して、フィールドの初期値を集合演算のunionを取るようにすることもできます。たとえば、クラスAの「使える色」という定数フィールドの値が、「赤,青」だったとして、そのクラスを継承するクラスBで、「使える色」というフィールドの値を「青,緑」にしておくと、継承時に集合演算されて「赤,青,緑」というフィールド値になります。
メソッドの例では、たとえば、アスペクト志向プログラミングのように、既存のコードをいじらずに、実行時に、ある特徴をもったメソッドが実行される前に、実行され、それらのメソッドの動作ログをとるといったような使い方が出来ます。
これらのメタプログラミング機能を、どこまでサポートしているかは、言語によって、それぞれ異なりますが、少なくとも、読み出し系については、C#やJavaにかぎらず、VisualBasicなど、最近のメジャーな言語の多くではサポートされています。
「 メタプログラミングが強力だからRubyが生産性が高い」というのはどこまで本当か？
キモは、これらのメタプログラミング機能の具体的メリットと、そのメリットが生じる頻度です。
そして、それは、読み出し系と書き込み系に分けて考えるべきでしょう。
まず、読み出し系についてですが、確かに、読み出し系のメタプログラミングは、具体的な生産性や気持ちよさにはかなり貢献するのですけど、読み出し系メタプログラミング機能は、JavaやC#やVisualBasicなど他の言語にもあります。
なので 、Rubyの読み出し系メタプログラミング機能と他の言語の読み出し系メタプログラミング機能で、具体的にどのような効用の差があるのか、ということです。
ちょっと冷静に考えてみれば分かると思いますが、読み出し系メタプログラミングで扱うオブジェクトなんて、クラス、メソッド、フィールド、プロパティなど、どの言語にもありふれた、退屈なほど分かりやすいオブジェクトでしかありません。クラスオブジェクトからメソッドオブジェクトを取り出すAPIは、ようは、単にメソッド名やメソッド種別を引数として指定して取り出すだけで、どう見ても、言語に関係なく、複雑な操作にはなり得ません。
たとえば、C#で、ある特定のオブジェクトのクラスの、フィールドオブジェクトの配列を、インスタンスフィールド限定で、取り出すには、次の一行で済みます。 FieldInfo[ ] fa = o. GetType( ) .
GetFields ( BindingFlags .
Instance ) ; メソッドも同様です。 MethodInfo[ ] fa = o. GetType( ) .
GetMedhods ( BindingFlags .
Instance ) ; また、取り出したメソッドオブジェクトの中から、ある特定の名前のメソッドを探したければ、 foreach ( MethodInfo m in ma ) if ( m. Name == name ) return m ; で事足ります 。
もちろん、わざわざループを回さなくても、メソッド名と種別を指定して、一発でメソッドオブジェクトを取り出すAPIも処理系が用意しています。
また、取り出したメソッドオブジェクトに引数を渡して実行するには、 object 引数リスト = new object { 7 , " 実行したよん。 " } ; meth .
Invoke( o , 引数リスト ) ; とするだけです 。
どの操作も、なんも、ややこしいことはありません。
この程度のことをするのに、Rubyと他の言語で生産性にそれほど大きな差が出ることは、とても考えにくいです。
なので、元記事 の 「 Rubyを仕事に使うべし！」では、
Javaでのメタプログラミングは，リフレクションAPIやバイトコード操作＊3を用い，ときにはJava仮想マシン（Java VM）の仕様の知識まで要求される難易度の高いものです。
と書いてありますけど、これは、少なくとも、読み出し系には当てはまりそうにありません。
次に、書き込み系のメタプログラミング機能ですが、実は、書き込み系のメタプログラミング機能は、読み出し系メタプログラミング機能と柔軟なクラスライブラリの組み合わせで、置き換え可能なことがほとんどなのです。
とくに、C#のカスタム属性と読み出し系のメタプログラミング機能を組み合わせれば、たいてのものは、かなりエレガントに実装出来てしまいます。もちろん、同様の機能はJavaにもあります。
たとえば、先ほどの、フィールドの初期値を集合演算で継承するというように、継承のセマンティクスを拡張したクラスをどう実装するかというと、単に、カスタム属性(たとえば、Union継承、など)でマークされたクラスをプログラム中からリストアップして、そのクラスオブジェクトの継承関係をさかのぼっていって、やはり、あるカスタム属性でマークされたフィールドをリストアップして、その初期値を取り出して、集合演算して、格納し直す、という処理をすればいいだけです。
また、どうしても、実行時に、二つ以上のクラスを合成して、多重継承のようなことをさせたいという場合、単に、ハッシュテーブルにメソッドを格納して、オブジェクトの代用として使えば、実用上は、それで事足りちゃったりするんですよね。
つまり、複数のクラスから、それぞれ、メソッド一覧を取り出し、そのメソッド一覧と、その所属インスタンスをペアにして、メソッド名をキーにして、ハッシュテーブルに格納しておくとか。
その、多重継承オブジェクトのメソッドを呼び出すとき、いちいち文字列で記述するのがウザイし、タイプミスが起きるのがイヤだというのなら、C#のenumを使えばいい。場合によっては、特定の処理だけ、外部のパラメータファイルで記述してもいいし。
もちろん、書き込み系のメタプログラミング機能を使った方が、これらは、エレガントにかけますよ。でも、圧倒的多数のプログラマが日々格闘している、圧倒的多数のアプリケーションでは、生産性も気持ちよさも、実際には、それほどかわらんですよ。
もちろん、まったく新しいプログラミングパラダイムの要求されるシステムとか、そういう研究室レベルのプログラミングは別ですよ。書き込み系のメタプログラミングができるとできないとで、大きな差がでるケースもあるかもしれません。でも、そういうプログラムは、そもそもRubyなんかじゃなく、Rubyなんかよりも、もっとずっと本格的なメタプログラミングのできるCLOSとかで書くべきでしょう。
こうしてみると、読み出し系にしろ、書き込み系にしろ、「メタプログラミングが強力だからRubyが生産性が高い」というのは、少なくとも、あの記事からは、読み取れないということが分かります。
その他、細々とした部分 まず 、Javaのループをわざわざカウンタを回すなど、冗長な書き方にして、シンプルなRubyのループ記述と比較していますが、これはフェアではありません。実際には、Javaでは、以下のようにカウンタを使わない、シンプルなループ記述ができます。 for ( int i : integers ) { System.out.println( i ) ; } これだと 、Rubyのシンプルなループ記述とそれほど大きな差はありません。
もちろん、C#でも同様に、シンプルなループ記述ができます。 また、Rubyのシンプルなプロパティ定義として、以下のようなサンプルがあり、setterとgetterをわざわざ記述しなければならないJavaの冗長さと比較していますが、これもフェアではありません。 class Foo # クラスFooを定義 attr_accessor : bar # プロパティbarを定義 attr_reader : baz # プロパティbazを定義 end foo = Foo.new # Fooオブジェクトを作成 foo. bar = 23 # プロパティbarに値を設定 puts foo.baz # プロパティbazから値を取得して出力 foo.baz = 42 # エラー。bazにはsetterが定義され
そもそも、フィールドでなく、わざわざプロパティにするのは、読み出しと書き込みの際に、なんらかの処理や制限を加えたいからです。
単純に読み出しと書き込みの両方を許可するだけのプロパティならば、それは、単なるフィールドとなんら変わりませんので、読み出しと書き込みの両方が出来るだけのプロパティがシンプルに記述できることなど、メリットではありません。
そして、もし、読み出しと書き込みの際に、プログラムコードによって処理や制限を加えたいのであれば、RubyだろうとJavaだろうとC#だろうと、言語に関係なく、setterとgetterに相当するメソッドは記述しなければなりません。
もちろん、setter/getterの記述が煩雑かどうか、という話ですが、たとえば、C#のsetterとgetterの記述は、かなりシンプルになっています。わざわざそれが煩雑なJavaと比較して、Rubyの記述がシンプルであるとしても、それは、Rubyがシンプルなのではなく、RubyやC#に比べると、Javaの記述がやや煩雑だというだけの話です。
もちろん、わざわざsetterやgetterを記述するまでもなく、単に、読み出しか書き込みのどちらか片方だけを許可したい場合もあります。
しかし、たとえば、上記のattr_readerのケースのように、単に読み出しだけで、書き込みを禁止するプロパティーのシンプルな記述をしたい場合、
まず第一に、フィールドを指定して、それをラップするプロパティーを自動生成し、かつ、そのフィールドへの全てのアクセスをプロパティへのアクセスに変換してくれるリファクタツールのある開発環境を使っているのは、すくなくとも現在ではありふれた話ですので、そういうケースでは、単に自動生成し、setterの部分のコードを削除すればいいだけなので、他の言語と、生産性にたいした差が出ません。たとえば、C#の場合、VisualStudioにそういう機能があります。
第二に、たとえ、開発環境の機能を使わず、完全に手だけでハンドコーディングしたとしても、それほど大した手間じゃありません。
たとえば、C#だと、上記のbazプロパティは、次のようにかけます。 int _baz ; int baz{ get{ return _baz ; }} この程度のわずかなシンタックスシュガーで、それほど生産性に大きな違いがでるのでしょうか？
最後に、問題が出ないように設計云々ですが、たとえば、リソースの解放し忘れでトラブルが起きないようにする構文は、たとえばC#でもusingとして使えます。もっと言うと、Rubyのような動的言語より、JavaやC#の方が、実行時に問題を引き起こすコードが書けないように、制限する機能については、ずっと充実しているという見方すらできます。特に、難易度の高い部分と低い部分を切り分け、経験の浅いプログラマが、おかしなコードを記述してシステムトラブルを防ぐようなフレームワークを記述する能力についてJavaやC#がRubyよりも劣っているという議論は、かなりムリがあるのではないでしょうか。
結論 というわけで、少なくとも 、 「 Rubyを仕事に使うべし！」ではRubyの生産性が飛躍的に高いということの、説得力のある説明にはなっていないことがわかります。
そして、これは、他のRubyの解説記事を分析しても、同様で、Rubyの生産性の高さを喧伝する記事は、冷静に吟味してみると、どうも説得力に欠けるものばかりです。
少なくとも、私は説得力のあるRubyの生産性についての記事にお目にかかったことがありません。

Dare Obasanjo recently wrote about the failure of Kuro5hin , which was originally designed to address perceived problems with the slashdot model :
[ Kuro5hin allowed ] all users to create stories , vote on the stories and to rate comments .
There were a couple of other features that distinguished the K5 community such as diaries but the democratic aspect around choosing what was valuable content was key .
K5 was a grand experiment to see if one could build a better Slashdot and for a while it worked , although the cracks had already begun to show within the first year .
Five years later , I still read Slashdot every day but only check K5 out every couple of months out of morbid curiosity .
The democracy of K5 caused two things to happen that tended to drive away the original audience .
The first was that the focus of the site ended up not being about technology mainly because it is harder for people to write technology articles than write about everyday topics that are nearer and dearer to their hearts .
Another was that there was a steady influx of malicious users who eventually drove away a significant proportion of K5 's original community .
Besides the malicious users one of the other interesting problems we had on K5 was that the number of people who actually did things like rate comments was very small relative to the number of users on the site .
Anytime proposals came up for ways to fix these issues , there would often be someone who disregarded the idea by stating that we were " seeking a technical solution to a social problem " .
This interaction between technology and social behavior was the first time I really thought about social software .
This is , unfortunately , a pattern I 've also observed in the various online communities I 've participated in .
And it 's a very old pattern indeed .
Clay Shirky 's essential A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy dates this phenomenon all the way back to 1978 :
In the Seventies , a BBS called Communitree launched , one of the very early dial - up BBSes .
This was launched when people did n't own computers , institutions owned computers .
Communitree was founded on the principles of open access and free dialogue .
" Communitree " – the name just says " California in the Seventies . "
And the notion was , effectively , throw off structure and new and beautiful patterns will arise .
And , indeed , as anyone who has put discussion software into groups that were previously disconnected has seen , that does happen .
Incredible things happen .
The early days of Echo , the early days of usenet , the early days of Lucasfilms Habitat , over and over again , you see all this incredible upwelling of people who suddenly are connected in ways they were n't before .
And then , as time sets in , difficulties emerge .
In this case , one of the difficulties was occasioned by the fact that one of the institutions that got hold of some modems was a high school .
And who , in 1978 , was hanging out in the room with the computer and the modems in it , but the boys of that high school .
And the boys were n't terribly interested in sophisticated adult conversation .
They were interested in fart jokes .
They were interested in salacious talk .
They were interested in running amok and posting four - letter words and nyah - nyah - nyah , all over the bulletin board .
And the adults who had set up Communitree were horrified , and overrun by these students .
The place that was founded on open access had too much open access , too much openness .
They could n't defend themselves against their own users .
The place that was founded on free speech had too much freedom .
They had no way of saying " No , that 's not the kind of free speech we meant . "
But that was a requirement .
In order to defend themselves against being overrun , that was something that they needed to have that they did n't have , and as a result , they simply shut the site down .
Now you could ask whether or not the founders ' inability to defend themselves from this onslaught , from being overrun , was a technical or a social problem .
Did the software not allow the problem to be solved ?
Or was it the social configuration of the group that founded it , where they simply could n't stomach the idea of adding censorship to protect their system ?
In a way , it does n't matter , because technical and social issues are deeply intertwined .
There 's no way to completely separate them .
As a community grows , these types of rules – neither social nor technical , but a hybrid of both – become critical to the survival of the community .
If moderators fail to step in , the damage can be fatal :
Geoff Cohen has a great observation about this .
He said " The likelihood that any unmoderated group will eventually get into a flame - war about whether or not to have a moderator approaches one as time increases . " *
As a group commits to its existence as a group , and begins to think that the group is good or important , the chance that they will begin to call for additional structure , in order to defend themselves from themselves , gets very , very high .
I 've seen it play out exactly like this , with reluctant moderators whose hands are forced due to outcry from the users .
All of Clay 's articles are worth reading ; I 'd follow up with Communities , Audiences , and Scale which is particularly relevant to blogs and other community driven websites – it proposes that social software , as we typically think of it , may not scale after all .
Which reminds me of a quote from Scrubs :
Cox :
Thanks to your little gesture , she ( Dr. Clock ) actually believes that the Earth is full of people who are deep down filled with kindness and caring !
Kelso :
Well that 's absurd .
People are bastard coated bastards with bastard filling .
Cox : Exactly !
If you 're building software with social components , plan for the worst kinds of behavior from your users from the start .
At least lay the groundwork for technological and social controls to handle those inevitable issues , or you 'll eventually regret it .

Who is Barack Obama ?
Probable U. S. presidential candidate , Barack Hussein Obama was born in Honolulu , Hawaii , to Barack Hussein Obama , Sr. , a black MUSLIM from Nyangoma - Kogel , Kenya and Ann Dunham , a white ATHEIST from Wichita , Kansas .
Obama ’s parents met at the University of Hawaii .
When Obama was two years old , his parents divorced .
His father returned to Kenya .
His mother then married Lolo Soetoro , a RADICAL Muslim from Indonesia .
When Obama was 6 years old , the family relocated to Indonesia .
Obama attended a MUSLIM school in Jakarta .
He also spent two years in a Catholic school .
Obama takes great care to conceal the fact that he is a Muslim .
He is quick to point out that , “ He was once a Muslim , but that he also attended Catholic school . ”
Obama ’s political handlers are attempting to make it appear that he is not a radical .
Obama ’s introduction to Islam came via his father , and this influence was temporary at best .
In reality , the senior Obama returned to Kenya soon after the divorce , and never again had any direct influence over his son ’s education .
Lolo Soetoro , the second husband of Obama ’s mother , Ann Dunham , introduced his stepson to Islam .
Obama was enrolled in a Wahabi school in Jakarta .
Wahabism is the RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world .
Since it is politically expedient to be a CHRISTIAN when seeking major public office in the United States , Barack Hussein Obama has joined the United Church of Christ in an attempt to downplay his Muslim background .
ALSO , keep in mind that when he was sworn into office he DID NOT use the Holy Bible , but instead the Koran .
Barack Hussein Obama will NOT recite the Pledge of Allegiance nor will he show any reverence for our flag .
While others place their hands over their hearts , Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches .
Let us all remain alert concerning Obama ’s expected presidential candidacy .
The Muslims have said they plan on destroying the US from the inside out , what better way to start than at the highest level – through the President of the United States , one of their own !!!!
Origins : Barack Obama served as an Illinois state senator for several years , and in 2004 he won a seat representing that state in the U.S. Senate .
His keynote address before the Democratic National Convention in June 2004 brought him national prominence , and he is currently one of the leading contenders for the nomination to represent the Democratic Party in the 2008 presidential election .
Barack Obama has an unusual and interesting background , which the above - quoted piece draws on to paint him as a dangerous , camouflaged radical Muslim .
Much of the information presented therein about his background is distorted and exaggerated , however , and no evidence supports a claim that Obama is a Muslim ( radical or otherwise ) .
Claim : Barack Hussein Obama was born in Honolulu , Hawaii , to Barack Hussein Obama , Sr. , a black MUSLIM from Nyangoma - Kogel , Kenya and Ann Dunham , a white ATHEIST from Wichita , Kansas .
Obama ’s parents met at the University of Hawaii .
Barack Hussein Obama ( Senator Obama ’s father ) was born on the shores of Lake Victoria in Alego , Kenya .
He met and married an American woman , Ann Dunham of Wichita , Kansas , while they were both attending the University of Hawaii .
Their son , also named Barack Hussein Obama , was born on 4 August 1961 at the Kapiolani Medical Center in Honolulu , Hawaii .
( News accounts have also variously reported his birth as having occurred at Queen ’s Medical Center in Honolulu . )
Although the elder Obama was raised as a Muslim , no evidence supports the claim that he was ever a “ radical Muslim , ” and Senator Obama ’s family histories note that his father was an atheist or agnostic ( i.e. , no longer a practicing Muslim ) by the time he married the younger Obama ’s mother .
Of his mother ’s religious views , Senator Obama wrote :
For my mother , organized religion too often dressed up closed - mindedness in the garb of piety , cruelty and oppression in the cloak of righteousness .
For my mother , organized religion too often dressed up closed - mindedness in the garb of piety , cruelty and oppression in the cloak of righteousness .
This is n’t to say that she provided me with no religious instruction .
In her mind , a working knowledge of the world ’s great religions was a necessary part of any well - rounded education .
In our household the Bible , the Koran , and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology .
On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church , just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple , the chinese New Year celebration , the Shinto shrine , and ancient Hawaiian burial sites .
But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part .
Religion was an expression of human culture , she would explain , not its wellspring , just one of the many ways — and not necessarily the best way — that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives .
In sum , my mother viewed religion through the eyes of the anthropologist she would become ; it was a phenomenon to be treated with a suitable respect , but with a suitable detachment as well .
Claim :
When Obama was two years old , his parents divorced .
His father returned to Kenya .
His mother then married Lolo Soetoro , a RADICAL Muslim from Indonesia .
When Obama was 6 years old , the family relocated to Indonesia .
Obama attended a MUSLIM school in Jakarta .
He also spent two years in a Catholic school .
Barack Obama ’s parents separated when he was two years old , his father moving to Connecticut to continue his education before returning to Kenya .
When the younger Obama was six years old , his mother married again , this time to Lolo Soetoro , an Indonesian oil manager .
Barack and his mother moved to Jakarta , Indonesia , where Obama spent 4 - 5 years attending both Muslim and Catholic schools before his mother sent him back to the United States to live with his maternal grandmother .
The school Barack Obama attended in Indonesia was “ Muslim ” primarily in the sense that the preponderance of its student body was Muslim ( because Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country ) , but both the Muslim and Catholic schools he attended in Indonesia offered a few hours of religious instruction each week .
In his 2006 book , The Audacity of Hope , Obama elaborated on his early schooling , explaining that he attended both Catholic and Muslim schools in Indonesia — not out of any particular religious affiliation , but because his mother wanted him to obtain the best education possible under the circumstances :
During the five years that we would live with my stepfather in Indonesia , I was sent first to a neighborhood Catholic school and then to a predominantly Muslim school ; in both cases , my mother was less concerned with me learning the catechism or puzzling out the meaning of the muezzin ’s call to evening prayer than she was with whether I was properly learning my multiplication tables .
Claim : Obama takes great care to conceal the fact that he is a Muslim .
He is quick to point out that , “ He was once a Muslim , but that he also attended Catholic school . ”
Obama ’s political handlers are attempting to make it appear that he is not a radical .
Barack Obama never stated that he “ was once a Muslim ” ( radical or otherwise ) , so his “ handlers ” have nothing to “ conceal . ”
Obama communications director Robert Gibbs noted that “ Senator Obama has never been a Muslim .
As a six - year - old in Catholic school , he studied the catechism . ”
Barack Obama has been associated with the United Church of Christ since the mid-1980s , describes himself as a Christian , and says that he is “ rooted in the Christian tradition . ”
Claim : Obama ’s introduction to Islam came via his father , and this influence was temporary at best .
In reality , the senior Obama returned to Kenya soon after the divorce , and never again had any direct influence over his son ’s education .
As noted above , Barack Obama ’s parents divorced when he was only two years old , and his father then moved thousands of miles away , from Hawaii to Connecticut , so he could n’t have received much of an “ introduction to Islam ” from his ( biological ) father :
My father was almost entirely absent from my childhood , having been divorced from my mother when I was two years old .
My father was almost entirely absent from my childhood , having been divorced from my mother when I was two years old .
At the time of his death , my father remained a myth to me , both more and less than a man .
He had left Hawaii back in 1963 , when I was only two years old , so that as a child I knew him only through the stories that my mother and grandparents told .
( Barack ’s only other childhood contact with his father occurred when he was eleven years old , and his father came to visit Hawaii for a month at Christmastime .
The elder Obama died when Barack Jr. was twenty - one years old . )
Claim : Lolo Soetoro , the second husband of Obama ’s mother , Ann Dunham , introduced his stepson to Islam .
Obama was enrolled in a Wahabi school in Jakarta .
Wahabism is the RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world .
The claim that Obama attended a radical Wahabbist school in Indonesia in the mid-1960s is exceedingly far - fetched , given that :
The large Indonesian community resident in Mecca was a medium through which knowledge about Wahhabism reached Indonesia , but the community itself appears to have remained virtually immune to Wahhabi influences .
In reality there was little direct influence of Wahhabism on Indonesian reformist thought until the 1970s .
Insight magazine claimed in a January 2007 article that Barack Obama spent at least four years attending what is variously described as a “ madrassa , ” a “ radical Muslim religious school , ” or a “ Muslim seminary ” in Indonesia , but CNN has more recently reported that its own investigation found those claims to be false :
[ R]eporting by CNN in Jakarta , Indonesia and Washington , D.C. , shows the allegations that Obama attended a madrassa to be false .
CNN dispatched Senior International Correspondent John Vause to Jakarta to investigate .
[ R]eporting by CNN in Jakarta , Indonesia and Washington , D.C. , shows the allegations that Obama attended a madrassa to be false .
CNN dispatched Senior International Correspondent John Vause to Jakarta to investigate .
He visited the Basuki school , which Obama attended from 1969 to 1971 .
“ This is a public school .
We do n’t focus on religion , ” Hardi Priyono , deputy headmaster of the Basuki school , told Vause .
“ In our daily lives , we try to respect religion , but we do n’t give preferential treatment . ”
Vause reported he saw boys and girls dressed in neat school uniforms playing outside the school , while teachers were dressed in Western - style clothes .
“ I came here to Barack Obama ’s elementary school in Jakarta looking for what some are calling an Islamic madrassa … like the ones that teach hate and violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan , ” Vause said on the ‘ Situation Room . ’
“ I ’ve been to those madrassas in Pakistan … this school is nothing like that . ”
Vause also interviewed one of Obama ’s Basuki classmates , Bandug Winadijanto , who claims that not a lot has changed at the school since the two men were pupils .
Insight reported that Obama ’s political opponents believed the school promoted Wahhabism , a fundamentalist form of Islam , “ and are seeking to prove it . ”
“ It ’s not ( an ) Islamic school .
It ’s general , ” Winadijanto said .
“ There is a lot of Christians , Buddhists , also Confucian . …
So that ’s a mixed school . ”
The Associated Press reported similarly :
A spokesman for Indonesia ’s Ministry of Religious Affairs said claims that Obama studied at an Islamic school are groundless .
A spokesman for Indonesia ’s Ministry of Religious Affairs said claims that Obama studied at an Islamic school are groundless .
“ SDN Menteng 1 is a public primary school that is open to people of all faiths , ” said the spokesman , Sutopo , who goes by only one name .
“ Moreover , he studied earlier at Fransiskus Assisi , which is clearly a Catholic school . ”
Obama later transferred to SDN Menteng 1 the elite , secular elementary school at the center of the controversy .
The school is public but is very competitive and has exceptionally high standards .
It is located in one of the most affluent parts of Jakarta and attracts mostly middle - to upper - class students , among them several of former dictator Suharto ’s grandchildren .
Indonesia is home to several of the most radical Islamic schools in Southeast Asia , some with alleged terrorist links .
But Akmad Solichin [ the vice principal at SDN Menteng 1 ] , who proudly pointed to a photo of a young Barry Obama , as he was known , said his school is not one of them .
Moreover , a statement released by the Obama campaign affirmed that :
In the past week , many of you have read a now thoroughly - debunked story by Insight Magazine , owned by the Washington Times , which cites unnamed sources close to a political campaign that claim Senator Obama was enrolled for “ at least four years ” in an Indonesian “ Madrassa ” .
The article says the “ sources ” believe the Madrassa was “ espousing Wahhabism , ” a form of radical Islam .

The article says the “ sources ” believe the Madrassa was “ espousing Wahhabism , ” a form of radical Islam .
All of the claims about Senator ObamaÂ ’s faith and education raised in the Insight Magazine story and repeated on Fox News are false .
Senator Obama was raised in a secular household in Indonesia by his stepfather and mother .
ObamaÂ ’s stepfather worked for a U.S. oil company , and sent his stepson to two years of Catholic school , as well as two years of public school .
To be clear , Senator Obama has never been a Muslim , was not raised a Muslim , and is a committed Christian who attends the United Church of Christ in Chicago .
Furthermore , the Indonesian school Obama attended in Jakarta is a public school that is not and never has been a Madrassa .
Claim :
Since it is politically expedient to be a CHRISTIAN when seeking major public office in the United States , Barack Hussein Obama has joined the United Church of Christ in an attempt to downplay his Muslim background .
As noted above , Barack Obama describes himself as “ a Christian , ” says that he is “ rooted in the Christian tradition , ” and his association with the United Church of Christ began over twenty years ago , long before he contemplated a political career .
( Obama was first elected to the Illinois state senate in 1996 , but he has been involved with the United Church of Christ since the mid-1980s . )
The beginnings of Obama ’s relationship with the church were described in an April 2004 Chicago Sun-Times article :
Obama is unapologetic in saying he has a “ personal relationship with Jesus Christ . ”
As a sign of that relationship , he says , he walked down the aisle of Chicago ’s Trinity United Church of Christ in response to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright ’s altar call one Sunday morning about 16 years ago .
Obama is unapologetic in saying he has a “ personal relationship with Jesus Christ . ”
As a sign of that relationship , he says , he walked down the aisle of Chicago ’s Trinity United Church of Christ in response to the Wright ’s altar call one Sunday morning aboutago .
The politician could have ended his spiritual tale right there , at the point some people might assume his life changed , when he got “ saved , ” transformed , washed in the blood .
But Obama wants to clarify what truly happened .
“ It was n’t an epiphany , ” he says of that public profession of faith .
“ It was much more of a gradual process for me .
I know there are some people who fall out .
Which is wonderful .
God bless them … I think it was just a moment to certify or publicly affirm a growing faith in me . ”
These days , he says , he attends the 11 a.m. Sunday service at Trinity in the Brainerd neighborhood every week — or at least as many weeks as he is able .
His pastor , Wright , has become a close confidant .
So how did he become a churchgoer ?
It began in 1985 , when he came to Chicago as a $ 13,000 - a- year community organizer , working with a number of African - American churches in the Roseland , West Pullman and Altgeld Gardens neighborhoods that were trying to deal with the devastation caused by shuttered steel plants .
“ I started working with both the ministers and the lay people in these churches on issues like creating job - training programs , or after - school programs for youth , or making sure that city services were fairly allocated to underserved communities , ” he says .
“ And it was in those places where I think what had been more of an intellectual view of religion deepened .
“ I became much more familiar with the ongoing tradition of the historic black church and its importance in the community .
And the power of that culture to give people strength in very difficult circumstances , and the power of that church to give people courage against great odds .
And it moved me deeply . ”
Claim : ALSO , keep in mind that when he was sworn into office he DID NOT use the Holy Bible , but instead the Koran .
This statement is completely false .
It is a mistaken reference to a different politician , Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison , not Barack Obama .
Claim : Barack Hussein Obama will NOT recite the Pledge of Allegiance nor will he show any reverence for our flag .
While others place their hands over their hearts , Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches .
Senator Obama drew some criticism over a photograph that showed him standing without his hand over his heart during the playing of the U.S. national anthem , but the claim that he “ will NOT recite the Pledge of Allegiance ” is false .
During the Democratic candidates ’ debate on 15 January 2008 , Senator Obama directly refuted the three primary rumors about him that are circulating via e-mail : that he is a Muslim , that he was sworn in to Congress on the Quran , and that he refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance :

Global ' Sunscreen ' Has Likely Thinned , Report NASA Scientists

A new NASA study has found that an important counter - balance to the warming of our planet by greenhouse gases – sunlight blocked by dust , pollution and other aerosol particles – appears to have lost ground .
The thinning of Earth ’s “ sunscreen ” of aerosols since the early 1990s could have given an extra push to the rise in global surface temperatures .
The finding , published in the March 16 issue of Science , may lead to an improved understanding of recent climate change .
In a related study published last week , scientists found that the opposing forces of global warming and the cooling from aerosol - induced " global dimming " can occur at the same time .
" When more sunlight can get through the atmosphere and warm Earth 's surface , you 're going to have an effect on climate and temperature , " said lead author Michael Mishchenko of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) , New York .
" Knowing what aerosols are doing globally gives us an important missing piece of the big picture of the forces at work on climate .
"
The study uses the longest uninterrupted satellite record of aerosols in the lower atmosphere , a unique set of global estimates funded by NASA .
Scientists at GISS created the Global Aerosol Climatology Project by extracting a clear aerosol signal from satellite measurements originally designed to observe clouds and weather systems that date back to 1978 .
The resulting data show large , short - lived spikes in global aerosols caused by major volcanic eruptions in 1982 and 1991 , but a gradual decline since about 1990 .
By 2005 , global aerosols had dropped as much as 20 percent from the relatively stable level between 1986 and 1991 .
Sun-blocking aerosols around the world steadily declined ( red line ) since the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo , according to satellite estimates .
The decline appears to have brought an end to the " global dimming " earlier in the century .
Credit : Michael Mishchenko , NASAThe NASA study also sheds light on the puzzling observations by other scientists that the amount of sunlight reaching Earth 's surface , which had been steadily declining in recent decades , suddenly started to rebound around 1990 .
This switch from a " global dimming " trend to a " brightening " trend happened just as global aerosol levels started to decline , Mishchenko said .
While the Science paper does not prove that aerosols are behind the recent dimming and brightening trends -- changes in cloud cover have not been ruled out -- another new research result supports that conclusion
In a paper published March 8 in the American Geophysical Union 's Geophysical Research Letters , a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University 's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics , New York , also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time .
The GISS research team conducted the most comprehensive experiment to date using computer simulations of Earth 's 20th - century climate to investigate the dimming trend .
The combined results from nine state - of - the - art climate models , including three from GISS , showed that due to increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols , the planet warmed at the same time that direct solar radiation reaching the surface decreased .
The dimming in the simulations closely matched actual measurements of sunlight declines recorded from the 1960s to 1990 .
Computer simulations of Earth 's climate over the entire 20th century show the effect of airborne particles called aerosols : sunlight reaching the surface decreased over most of the globe ( blue ) and in some regions remained unchanged ( white ) or slightly increased ( yellow ) .
Credit : Anastasia Romanou , Columbia University Further simulations using one of the Goddard climate models revealed that aerosols blocking sunlight or trapping some of the sun 's heat high in the atmosphere were the major driver in 20th - century global dimming .
" Much of the dimming trend over the Northern Hemisphere stems from these direct aerosol effects , " Romanou said .
" Aerosols have other effects that contribute to dimming , such as making clouds more reflective and longer - lasting .
These effects were found to be almost as important as the direct effects .
" The combined effect of global dimming and warming may account for why one of the major impacts of a warmer climate -- the spinning up of the water cycle of evaporation , more cloud formation and more rainfall -- has not yet been observed .
" Less sunlight reaching the surface counteracts the effect of warmer air temperatures , so evaporation does not change very much , " said Gavin Schmidt of GISS , a co-author of the paper .
" Increased aerosols probably slowed the expected change in the hydrological cycle .
" Whether the recent decline in global aerosols will continue is an open question .
A major complicating factor is that aerosols are not uniformly distributed across the world and come from many different sources , some natural and some produced by humans .
While global estimates of total aerosols are improving and being extended with new observations by NASA 's latest generation of Earth - observing satellites , finding out whether the recent rise and fall of aerosols is due to human activity or natural changes will have to await the planned launch of NASA 's Glory Mission in 2008 .
“ One of Glory 's two instruments , the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor , will have the unique ability to measure globally the properties of natural and human - made aerosols to unprecedented levels of accuracy , " said Mishchenko , who is project scientist on the mission .
``We have witnessed this weekend amongst the worst violence that I have ever seen in my policing service of 40 years , '' Mr Moroney told reporters .
``Never in my working life did I ever imagine a mob , a drunken mob , turning on a woman , an innocent woman who happened to stray into their path . ''
Mr Scully said : " There appears to be an element of white supremacists and they really have no place in mainstream Australian society , those sort of characters belong in Berlin 1930s , '' he said .
` I 'm horrified that amidst that large crowd were pretty much people who have pretty ugly views . ''
Mr Moroney said he had been asked by NSW Premier Morris Iemma to explore additional measures to boost police powers in response to threats of violence .
This could include a new street policing unit and restrictions on alcohol , which played a large role in the riots , he said .
' Real ' locals shocked
Diana Kontoprias , who runs a gelato bar near the beach , witnessed most of violence yesterday .
She told ABC Radio " real locals " were disgusted by the events .
" They were so embarrassed , so shocked of how the day unfolded , " she said .
" It was a disgrace , I do n't think anyone in the local area agrees with what happened yesterday . "
Terrorism , gang rapes behind riots : MP
Federal Liberal backbencher Bruce Baird , whose Cook electorate takes in many of the suburbs affected , said tensions had been simmering within the primarily Anglo - Saxon community against people of Middle Eastern descent for some time .
He said many locals were angry , particularly after six women from the area were killed in the 2002 Bali bombings .
" Where this riot took place is actually the site of where we 've got the Bali memorial for these women , " Mr Baird told ABC Radio .
Asked if the riots were revenge for Bali and September 11 , Mr Baird said : " I think so . "
" I think there 's been increasing emphasis on terrorism and our security , " he said .
" There has been high - profile rape cases in Sydney and of course , the Sutherland Shire itself is very much an Anglo - Celtic enclave and during the week it is pretty much Anglo and on the weekends there are lots of visitors that come from elsewhere . "
20 injured , 16 arrested More than 20 people have been injured and 16 arrested as race - fuelled violence spread through Sydney 's beachside suburbs overnight .
But NSW Premier Morris Iemma says police are in control of the situation .
A series of apparent revenge attacks - including two stabbings - occurred overnight following the unrest at Cronulla , where more than 5000 people gathered yesterday .
Drunken mobs within the crowd yelled racist chants and chased down and bashed people of Middle Eastern appearance at the beach in an extended show of violence .
Police and an ambulance crew were also assaulted as racial tensions peaked .
A total of 25 people , including two ambulance officers , were injured , about 40 cars were vandalised and an Australian flag was burned during the mob scenes .
Police said 16 people had been arrested across Sydney and charged with 42 offences .
Mr Iemma today described the behaviour as " stomach turning " and said it would not be tolerated .
" I saw yesterday people trying to hide behind the Australian flag , well they are cowards whose behaviour will not be tolerated , " Mr Iemma told Channel Nine .
" That was the most disgraceful , disgusting behaviour that I 've ever seen . "
Mr Iemma said he planned to bring together community leaders for discussions about how to prevent further violence .
Police had the resources and the equipment to deal with the violent scenes , he said .
Police were forced to use capsicum spray and batons in their battle to subdue the Cronulla rioters , who pelted officers with bottles and stomped on patrol cars .
Later , a 23 - year - old man was injured and more than 40 cars smashed with baseball bats in an apparent revenge attack at Maroubra , in Sydney 's east .
A group of about 60 men of Middle Eastern appearance and armed with baseball bats smashed the windows of parked cars about 9 pm ( AEDT ) .
The group then clashed with local group , the Bra Boys , outside the Maroubra Bay Hotel .
A 23 - year - old Maroubra man was taken to Prince of Wales hospital after he was stabbed with a sharp implement , believed to be a stick or nail , in the hip .
Later , a second 23 - year - old man was stabbed in the back by a group of males , described as being of Middle Eastern appearance , at a golf club at Woolooware , in Sydney 's south .
He was taken to hospital in a serious condition .
Riot police were also called to Brighton - le - Sands , in Sydney 's south , overnight to control a group of about 200 brawling youths who had reportedly thrown projectiles at police .
Twelve people were arrested at Cronulla .
They will face Sutherland Local Court at a date to be fixed .

Distance
The approximate distance in meters that it takes to type in the text .
Normal typing keys are assumed to be 1.8 cm square ( including gap between keys ) .
Distance is calculated with the following algorithm :
for each key pressed
if previous key pressed with same finger
add distance from previous key to this key
else
add distance from previous key back to the home row
add distance from home row to key
So for " look " the distance is l->l + l->o + o->o + o->l + k->k using qwerty .
The distance it takes to actually depress a key is not included .
The distance from the last key back to the home row is not included .
Same hand
The percent of keys that use the same hand to type as the previous key did .
The thumb and repeated keys are not counted toward same hand , but the percent is of the total keys .
For example , in " cool " ( qwerty ) only the l counts toward same hand .
Same finger
The percent of keys that use the same finger to type as the previous key did .
The thumb and repeated keys are not counted toward same finger , but the percent is of the total keys .
Total keys shows the number of keys processed .
Characters not appearing on the corresponding keyboard are not processed .
Finger
This lists the percent of keys pressed with each finger ( in order ) .
Percents are of fingers only and do not include the thumb / spacebar .
Monads for the Working Haskell Programmer
-- a short tutorial .
Theodore Norvell
Memorial University of Newfoundland
New : Updated to Haskell ' 98 .
This short tutorial introduces monads to Haskell programmers .
It applies to Haskell ' 98 .
Gofer programmers ( are there any left ? ) can read it too ; there is a section at the end detailing the differences between Haskell and Gofer around monads and another about the differences between Haskell 1.3 , Haskell 1.4 , and Haskell 98 .
The reader is assumed to have a familiarity with the basics of Haskell programming such as data declarations , function definitions , and lambda expressions .
Familiarity with classes and instance declarations will help .
Simulating states without Monads
Consider the following function
f1 w a = let ( b , x ) = g1 w a ( c , y ) = h1 w x b ( d , z ) = i1 w x y c in ( d , z )
where a , b , c , and d all have the same type , State .
In a sense this definition is very similar to an imperative program in which a represents the initial state , d represents the final state , and b and c represent intermediate states .
The functions f1 w , g1 w , h1 w x , and i1 w x y can be thought of as imperative routines that transform the state and produce results .
The results are like the return values in C programs and are bound to variables x , y , and z in the example .
A C routine that corresponds to this would look something like this :
int f1 ( float w ) { const char x = g1 ( w ) ; const double y = h 1 ( w , x ) ; const int z = i1 ( w , x , y ) ; return z ; }
All this explicit passing of states around can get a bit tedious , especially when programs are modified .
It also makes the program hard to read vs. the equivalent C program .
Note that if we ignore the w , x , y , and z , then g1 , h1 , and i1 are being composed .
Can we define a kind of " composition operator " that allows us to deal with the returned values as well as the state ?
Simulating states with Monads
The functions that transform the state in the example above all have the type State -> ( State , a ) for some result type a .
Let 's generalize over the type of the state and create a type to represent these transforms
type StateTrans s a = s -> ( s , a )
Let us define two functions .
The first is a kind of composition function .
(>>= ) :: StateTrans s a -> ( a -> StateTrans s b ) -> StateTrans s b p >>= k = \s0 -> let ( s1 , a ) = p s0 q = k a in q s1
The second is a function that turns a value into an " imperative program " that does not change the state , but returns the result .
return :: a ->
StateTrans s a return a = \s -> ( s , a )
Our original function may now be written with all the shunting of state around hidden by these operators :
f w = ( g w ) >>= ( \x -> ( h w x ) >>= ( \y -> ( i w x y ) >>= ( \z -> return z ) ) )
You could also format this as follows
f w = g w >>= \x -> h w x >>= \y ->
i w x y >>= \z -> return z
You should verify that f is equal to f1 , if g = g1 , h = h1 , and i = i1 .
( Warning , if you really try to make the above definitions of >>= and return , your Haskell compiler will complain , for reasons that will be explained later .
However , you could try changing the names a little , e.g. change >>= to >== and change return to rtn . )
A nicer syntax
Now Haskell provides a nice syntax to sugar - coat the calls to >>= .
It turns out that the definition of f can also be written as
f w = do x <- g w y <- h w x z <- i w x y return z
The " do " is a keyword of Haskell .
Any program involving a " do " can be translated to one that does n't use " do " by the following 4 rules :
1 An expression
do pattern <- expression morelines
becomes expression >>= ( \ pattern -> do morelines )
2 An expression
do expression morelines
becomes expression >> do morelines
3 An expression
do let declarationList morelines
becomes
let declarationList in do morelines
4 . Finally when there is only one line in the do , an expression
do expression
becomes expression
In the second rule , we saw the >> operator ; this is used when the result of the first operand is not subsequently used .
It can always be defined as
p >> q = p >>= ( \ _ -> q )
So
do p q
is the same as
do _ <- p q
The " do " notation follows the same conventions as other multi-line constructs in Haskell .
All lines must be vertically alligned .
Alternatively , you may use braces and semicolons if you prefer " free format " :
do {x <- g w ; y <- h w x ; z <- i w x y ; return z }
How to Really Declare the StateTrans Monad .
So far we 've seen the monad concept applied to implicitly passing state .
However monads can be used to implement several other programming features including : consuming input , producing output , exceptions and exception handling , nondeterminisim .
To handle this variety , the basic operations of >>= and return are overloaded functions .
( Haskell requires that overloaded functions be declared in class declarations and defined in instance declarations .
This is the reason that >>= and return can not be defined exactly as described in previous sections . )
The class that >>= and return are declared in is called Monad and is itself declared in the Haskell Prelude .
That declaration looks like this
class Monad m where ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b ( >> ) :: m a -> m b -> m b return :: a -> m a fail :: String -> m a m >> k = m >>= \_ -> k fail s = error s
To make a state transform monad that actually works with Haskell 's " do " notation , we have to declare >>= and return within an instance declaration .
There is one minor problem ; type synonyms can not be used in instance declarations , so we define StateTrans s a as a new type .
newtype StateTrans s a = ST ( s -> ( s , a ) )
and we define the functions return and >>= for this type as follows :
instance Monad ( StateTrans s ) where -- ( >>= ) :: StateTrans s a -> ( a -> StateTrans s b ) -> StateTrans s b ( ST p ) >>= k = ST ( \ s0 -> let ( s1 , a ) = p s0 ( ST q ) = k a in q s1 ) -- return :: a ->
StateTrans s a return a = ST ( \s -> ( s , a ) )
We do n't need to define the >> operator ; it is defined automatically in terms of >>= .
Note these new definitions change the type of functions like our example function f .
Indeed f is no longer equal to f1 , since its type is different .
To apply members of the monad , we define a new function
applyST :: StateTrans s a -> s -> ( s , a ) applyST ( ST p ) s = p s
Now applyST f is equal to f1 .
Which is the Monad ?
Technically each Monad ( in Haskell ) is not a type , but a " type contructor " .
In our state transformer example , we have actually declared an infinite set of monads .
For each type s , there is a type constructor StateTrans s .
Each such type constructor has been declared to be a Monad by the instance declaration above .
An example
A short example shows how the StateTrans monad lets you code in a fairly imperative style .
We will implement a variation on Euclid 's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two positive integers .
while x != y do if x < y then y := y-x else x := x-y return x
First we must define a type to represent the state :
type ImpState = ( Int , Int )
Next we define some simple state transformers to access and change the state .
We use the type ( ) and its sole value , ( ) , when a state transformer does not return a useful value .
getX , getY :: StateTrans ImpState Int getX = ST ( \( x , y ) - > ( ( x , y ) , x ) ) getY = ST ( \( x , y ) - > ( ( x , y ) , y ) ) putX , putY :: Int -> StateTrans ImpState ( ) putX x ' = ST ( \( x , y ) - > (( x ' , y ) , ( ) ) ) putY y' = ST ( \( x , y ) - > ( ( x , y ' ) , ( ) ) )
Now we can write the algorithm with the state squarely in the background :
gcdST :: StateTrans ImpState
Int gcdST = do x <- getX y <- getY ( if x == y then return x else if x < y then do putY ( y - x ) gcdST else do putX ( x - y ) gcdST )
And finally a function to construct an initial state , run the program and discard the final state
greatestCommonDivisor x y = snd( applyST gcdST ( x , y ) )
This small example only hints at the utility of monads .
It would be much shorter to write the algorithm in a conventional functional style .
The savings from not having to explicitly pass the state around become larger as the program becomes larger .
Monads , Monoids , and Identities
The term " monad " comes from category theory , which is a branch of algebra ( or , depending on whom you talk to , algebra is a branch of category theory ) .
There is no need to understand the algebra at all to understand the use of monads in functional programming .
This section and the next , just touch on the algebra a little bit .
Monads share some similarity with monoids * , with >>= being similar to the monoid operation and the return operator taking the place of the identity member .
Specifically we have the following identities
return a >>= k = k a
p >>= return = p
( p >>= j ) >= k = p >>= ( \x ->( j x >>= k ) ) [ provided x is not free in j or k ]
These identities hold in the StateTrans monad and ought to hold for any monad we define .
Zeros and addition
Monoids sometimes also have a zero member and an addition operator .
In Haskell , the zero member of a monad is called mzero and the relevant identity is
mzero >>= k = mzero
In a state transformation monad , mzero might represent an exception .
I.e. an indication that the task can not be completed .
When a Monad has a zero member , it often also has an addition operation , mplus , obeying the following additional identities
p `mplus` mzero = p = mzero `mplus` p
p `mplus` ( q `mplus` r ) = ( p `mplus` q ) `mplus` r
It turns out that monads with zeros and addition are common enough that there is a library class , called MonadPlus , defined to encompass them .
If mzero represents failure to complete a computation , mplus might represent a way of combining alternative computations such that , if one fails , the other can succeed instead .
Exceptions , exception handling , and backtracking .
We generalize the StateTrans monad , to include a zero element and an addition operation .
To do this we must change the type to include the possibility of failure :
newtype StateTransEx s a = STE ( s -> Maybe ( s , a ) )
( The Maybe type constructor is defined in the Haskell Prelude as
data Maybe t = Just t | Nothing
" Maybe " is itself a Monad , but I wo n't be using that fact here . )
We use Nothing to represent failure , i.e. , an exception , and Just ( s , a ) to represent success with result a and new state s .
We must define >>= and return so that it is a monad .
We define >>= so that it propagates exceptions .
That is , if p throws an exception , then so does p >>= f .
instance Monad ( StateTransEx s ) where -- ( >>= ) :: StateTransEx s a -> ( a -> StateTransEx s b ) -> StateTransEx s b ( STE p ) >>= k = STE ( \ s0 -> case p s0 of Just ( s1 , a ) -> let ( STE q ) = k a in q s1 Nothing -> Nothing ) -- return :: a -> StateTransEx s a return a = STE ( \s -> Just ( s , a ) )
We define mzero and mplus to make StateTransEx s a member of class MonadPlus .
mzero will mean throw an exception .
mplus will give a means to recover from an exception ; mplus p q will mean , execute p , but if an exception is thrown in p , then recover by executing q instead .
Since MonadPlus is not in the Prelude , but rather the Monad library , we must import it from the Monad library ( the import declaration must go at the top of your Haskell module ) .
import Monad ( MonadPlus ( .. ) , guard ) instance MonadPlus ( StateTransEx s ) where -- mzero :: StateTransEx s a mzero = STE ( \s -> Nothing ) -- mplus :: StateTransEx s a -> StateTransEx s a -> StateTransEx s a ( STE p ) `mplus` ( STE q ) = STE ( \ s0 -> case p s0 of Just ( s1 , a ) -> Just ( s1 , a ) Nothing -> q s0 ) applySTE ( STE p ) s = p s
Now , if we execute p `mplus` q , and p fails , then the computation will be resumed with q .
Note that q starts with the state that p started with , not the state that p had reached when the exception ocurred ; p and q can be regarded as alternative computations .
Although I 've called this exception handling , " backtracking " is arguably a more accurate term .
We can use mplus and mzero to implement backtracking algorithms .
Consider the classic problem of finding a way to place 8 queens on an 8 by 8 chess board such that no queen attacks another .
First the state
type QState = ( [ Int ] , [ Int ] , [ Int ] )
We use three lists to keep track of three sets : the set of occupied columns , the set of occupied south - west diagonals and the set of occupied south - east diagonals .
The south - west diagonals are represented by the difference in the column and row number .
The south - east diagonals are represented by the sum of the row and column number .
There are functions to get and set each of these components of the state :
getCols = STE ( \( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) -> Just ( ( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) , cols ) ) getSWDiags = STE ( \( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) -> Just ( ( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) , swDiags ) ) getSEDiags = STE ( \( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) -> Just ( ( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) , seDiags ) ) putCols c = STE ( \( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) -> Just ( ( c:cols , swDiags , seDiags ) , ( ) ) ) putSWDiags sw = STE ( \( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) -> Just ( ( cols , sw:swDiags , seDiags ) , ( ) ) ) putSEDiags se = STE ( \( cols , swDiags , seDiags ) -> Just ( ( cols , swDiags , se:seDiags ) , ( ) ) )
We do n't want to add a column or a diagonal to a set it is already in .
To ensure that we do n't , we use the library routine guard defined by
guard true = return ( ) guard false = mzero
The following routines fail if the item being added to a set is already in the set :
tryPutCol c = do cols <- getCols guard ( c `notElem` cols ) putCols c tryPutSWDiag sw = do swDiags <- getSWDiags guard ( sw `notElem` swDiags ) putSWDiags sw tryPutSEDiag se = do seDiags <- getSEDiags guard ( se `notElem` seDiags ) putSEDiags se
The next routine attempts to place a queen at a particular spot , failing if the new queen would attack one that is already on the board .
( I 'm assuming there is no other queen in the same row , so no check is required to see if the row is occupied . )
place r c = do tryPutCol c tryPutSWDiag ( c-r ) tryPutSEDiag ( c+r )
The main algorithm to place queens in each of rows [ 0.. r - 1 ] of a board with colNum columns is :
queens r colNum = if r == 0 then getCols -- Success , return list of columns else tryEach [ 0..colNum - 1 ] ( \c -> do place ( r - 1 ) c queens ( r - 1 ) colNum )
The tryEach " loop " is a control structure defined by
tryEach :: MonadPlus m => [ a ] -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b tryEach [ ] f = mzero tryEach ( h:t ) f = f h `mplus` tryEach t f
( We could also define tryEach in terms of the library function , msum , which takes a list of monad members and combines them with mplus : tryEach xs f = msum ( map f xs ) ) .
To find an arrangement on an 8 by 8 chess board we write :
applySTE ( queens 8 8 ) ( [ ] , [ ] , [ ] )
Nondeterminism
The StateTransEx monad provides a limited form of nondeterminism .
Computations either succeed or fail , but if they succeed , they succeed but once .
For example in
do ( p `mplus` q ) r
if p succeeds and then r then fails , q will not be given a chance to " execute " .
To get nondeterminism of the sort found in languages such as Icon , SNOBOL , and Prolog , we need to allow a computation to succeed more than once .
To create such a monad , we replace the Maybe type constructor with the list type constructor :
The type is
newtype StateTransMany s a = STM ( s -> [ ( s , a ) ] )
I leave it as an exercise to define >>= , return , mplus , and mzero for this monad , and to change the queens example to generate all solutions to the 8 - queens problem .
The IO Monad
Haskell defines a monad called IO that is used to describe computations that interact with the operating system -- in particular to perform input and output .
For example , here is how you can write a function to read a file , printing an error message if the file can not be read
maybeReadFile :: String -> IO ( Maybe String ) ---- --
Read a file or print an error message and return Nothing .
maybeReadFile fileName = catch ( do s <- read File fileName return ( Just s ) ) ( readErrHandler fileName ) readErrHandler :: String -> IOError -> IO ( Maybe String ) readErrHandler fileName err = do putStr ( " Error reading file " ++ fileName ++ " " ++ show err ++ " .
" ) return Nothing
You can see that the IO monad also supports exception handling , though with the " catch " function , not the mplus operator .
( mplus would be inappropriate because changes to the world can not be undone ! )
In Haskell the main program should be of type IO ( ) .
It is often said that pure functional languages can't be used to write interactive programs .
At first glance the IO monad seems to contradict this idea .
You can think of it this way :
When your functional program is executed , it does not interact with the operating system , it merely computes an object of type IO ( ) , which describes a set of possible interactive computations .
An interpreter interacts with the environment to make one of these computations happen .
The fact that Haskell is a lazy language is key to this , for the set of computations for many applications is infinite , even if each computation is finite .
The choice of which computation is needed is governed by the input ; thanks to lazyness , only the computation that is actually required is computed .
Lists as a Monad
The list type constructor itself is a simple monad .
Its definition is
instance Monad [ ] where xs >>= f = concat ( map f xs ) return x = [ x ] instance MonadPlus [ ] where mzero = [ ] mplus = (++)
( The notation [ ] in the first line of each instance declaration refers to the list type constructor , i.e. the function that maps each type to its corresponding list type . )
The definition of the list constructor as a monad allows one to write such things as
do a <- [ 1,2,3 ] b <- [ 3,4,5 ] return ( a+b )
This evaluates to
[ 4,5,6,5,6,7,6,7,8 ] ,
just as does the list comprehension
[ a+b | a <- [ 1,2,3 ] , b <- [ 3,4,5 ] ]
Monads and Software Engineering
The key to engineering a large software project is to make changes easy ..
Monads can be used to make functional programs far more adaptable .
You need to insert another processing step ?
Go right ahead , do n't worry about plumbing the state .
You need another variable in the state ?
No problem , just change the underlying state and the basic members of the monad .
You need to output messages from your computation ?
No problem , just change the monad to add an output string .
You need to handle exceptions or nondeterminism ?
No problem , just change the monad .
It might be said that Haskell with monads does not give you much that you wo n't find in an imperative , nondeterministic language , with extensible , strong , but generic typing , and a powerful applicative expression sublanguage .
The problem is there is no such language in common use .
Monads make up for many of the drawbacks of Haskell relative to imperative languages , but without giving up any of its strengths .
More information
Monads can be used for parsing .
By using the remaining input as state , the StateTrans monad can be used to write deterministic recursive - descent parsers .
Better yet , the StateTransEx and StateTransMany parsers can ( respectively ) be used to create backtracking parsers and non-deterministic parsers ( allowing ambiguous grammars ) .
Monadic parsing is the topic of the following paper :
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer , Monadic parser combinators , Technical Report NOTTCS -TR - 96 - 4 , Department of Computer Science , University of Nottingham .
Available on the Web at http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/Department/Techreports/96-4.html
I like to add an output for error and warning message , to the monad , and the possibility of fatal errors that can not be recovered from .
I also use a clearer separation between parsing and lexical analysis than Hutton and Meijer .
My own monadic parsing combinators are available on the web at http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/index.html#ParsingMonad

There is a whole lot that could be said about the mathematical theory of monads .
It is my belief that most programmers do n't need to know much of this theory to reap the benefits of programming with monads .
Philip Wadler 's papers give an introduction to the mathematics and pointers back to the earlier , more mathematical , literature .
A Note for Gofer Programmers
Almost everything in this tutorial applies equally to Gofer .
However a few notations are different .
I think the following table completely summarizes the notational differences assuming you are using Gofer 2.30 and the cc.prelude prelude .
Haskell Gofer >>= replace by `bind` >> no equivalent ?
return replace by result newtype replace by data MonadPlus replace by Monad0 and MonadPlus
Gofer supports both the " do " syntax ( if Gofer is compiled with the right options ) and a " comprehension " syntax for monads explained next .
In Gofer the so - called " list " comprehension notation is an alternative to the " do " notation , no matter whether you are using the list monad or any other monad .
You can write
[ a+b | a <- getX , b<- getY ]
which means the same as
do a <- getX b <- getY return ( a+b )
The advantage of the " do " notation is that it does n't force you to end with a " return " .
In Gofer , each instance of class Monad must be an instance of class Functor .
To be in class Functor a monad m must support a function called map of type ( a -> b ) -> ( m a -> m b ) .
The map function lifts an ordinary function to a monad function .
For monads , it can always be defined by
map f p = [f a | a <- p ]
In Gofer , use of the IO monad requires a special compilation option and inclusion of the file iomonad.gs .
A Note for Haskell 1.3 and 1.4 users
In Haskell 1.3 and 1.4 mzero is called zero and mplus is called ++ .
There is a separate class MonadZero , declaring the zero .
All the classes are declared in the Prelude , so you do not need to import from Monad .
Haskell 1.4 supports the comprehension syntax for Monads ( see the Gofer section ) .
End Notes
A monoid is an algebraic structure consisting of a set S and an operation * with the following properties
Closure : x*y is in S , if x and y are both in S. Associativity : x *( y*z ) = ( x *y ) * z for all x , y , and z in S. Identity :
There is an element e in S such that e*x= x*e = x , for all x in S .
Examples of monoids are the integers with multiplication as the operator , character strings with catenation as the operator , functions with composition as the operator , and programming langauge statements with sequential composition as the operator .
Also any group is a monoid and any monoid that has inverses is a group .
A UFO omitting a " yellow ray " has been seen across Western Iran , the Fars News Agency claimed in a report recently .
" Witnesses told FNA ( Fars News Agency ) that the object has been observed for more than an hour , " the report said , adding : " In a similar incident last Monday , an Unidentified Flying Object was witnessed in the same area and at the same time . "
According to eye witnesses , " the UFO has been as big as a ball , with a yellow ray and a bright reddish color in the center .
They also stated that the object has been flying at a very low altitude . "
The FNA said Iranian officials declined to comment .
The Iranian news outlet also reported a UFO " crashing " last Wednesday , " in Barrez Mounts in the central province of Kerman . "
" Deputy Governor General of Kerman province Abulghassem Nasrollahi told FNA that the crash , which was followed by an explosion and a thick spiral of smoke , has caused no casualties or damage to properties , " the report said , adding : " He further denied earlier reports that the explosion has been the result of a plane or chopper crash , reminding that all the passing aircrafts have been reported as sound and safe . "
Iranian authorities were investigating the crash , described by witnesses as an explosion " caused as a result of the crash of a radiant unidentified flying object onto the ground . "
" Meantime , an informed source told FNA that the object has been on fire and there has been thick smoke coming out of it prior to the crash , concluding that the object could n't have been a meteor as meteors do not smoke , " the article said .
It added : " The source also said that the crash has been witnessed by people in several cities , and mentioned that the rendezvous point was located 100 kilometers from the provincial capital city of Kerman .
He said that people in the city of Rafsanjan also reported to have witnessed a similar incident several days ago . "
The remarks , made in Beirut today by the Foreign Office Minister , Kim Howells , were the first public criticism of the US voiced by Britain .
The Observer can also reveal that Tony Blair urged restraint in a private telephone convseration with the Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , last week .
Sources close to the Prime Minister said that Olmert replied that Israel faced a dire security threat from the Hizbollah militia and was determined to do everything necessary to defeat it .
Britain 's policy shift came as Israeli tanks and warplanes pounded targets across the border in south Lebanon today ahead of an immenently expected ground offensive to clear out nearby Hizbollah positions which have been firing dozens of rockets onto towns and cities inside Israel .
Downing Street sources said Blair still believed Israel had every right to respond to the missile threat , and held the Shia militia responsible for provoking the cirisis by abducting two Israeli soldiers and shelling Israel .
But they said they had no quarrel with Howells 's scathing denunciation of Israel 's military tactics .
Speaking to a BBC reporter before travelling on for talks in Israel , where he will also visit missile - hit areas of Haifa and meet his Israeli opposite - number , Howell said : ' The destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people .
These have not been surgical strikes .
If they are chasing Hizbollah , then go for Hizbollah .
You do n't go for the entire Lebanese nation . '
He added : ' I very much hope that the Americans understand what 's happening to Lebanon . '
Only hours earlier , President Bush used his weekly radio address to place the blame for the crisis squarely on Hizbollah and their Syrian and Iranian backers .
He said that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who is due to leave for the Middle East today , would ' make it clear that resolving the crisis demands confronting the terrorist group that launched the attacks and the nations that support it . '
Blair is scheduled to meet the President in Washington at the start of a US visit this Friday .
Senior diplomats said it was highly unlikely there would be a major diplomatic move to restrain Israel 's planned south Lebanon incursion at least until then .
An advance force of tanks moved across the border yesterday , backed by a fierce barrage of airstrikes , including a half tonne bomb dropped on a Hizbollah outpost .
Israeli forces focused much of their fire on the village of Ma roun al - Ras , on the crest of a hill less than a kilometre across the border .
It was swathed in thick swirl of smoke .
Specially armour plated D - 9 bulldozeers have also been brought in to level networks of foxholes and underground bunkers dug by Hizbollah .
Israel 's army chief - of - staff Dan Halutz told reporters in Tel Aviv on Friday any military incursion would be limited in scope .
' We will fight terror wherever it is because if we do not fight it , it will fight us .
If we do n't reach it , it will reach us , ' he said .
' We will also conduct limited ground operations as much as needed in order to harm the terror that harms us . '
Warnings to civilians
Israeli radio broadcast renewed warnings for civilians to flee the area by 7 pm local time , but reports emerged of Lebanese casualties , including a seriously injured Lebanese woman who was taken to a hospital in the northern Israeli town of Safed .
An adviser to the Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz told The Observer : ' We are finally going to fight Hizbollah on the ground .
The Israeli people are ready for this and the Sunni Muslim world also expect us to fight Shia fundamentalism and we are going to deliver . '
But he added : ' We have no intention of conquering and holding territory .
We plan to clean a strip a mile from our border of Hizbollah bunkers and rocket - launching sites ...
We will go in and then we will go out . '
The Israeli air force dropped leaflets on southern Lebanon this week telling residents to leave their homes to avoid getting harmed in the fighting .
Among the hundreds of thousands fleeing the fighting , there were few able - bodied men of military age .
Ali Suleiman , 50 , from a village a few miles outside the coastal city of Tyre said his eldest son had joined Hizbollah .
' When he dies , I will send another son and another and another .
Tell Mr Blair , Muslims are not afraid - not of bombs or ships or hunger .
We get our power from God . '
Hizbollah has operated freely in the border region since Israel withdrew six years ago and are believed to have amassed an arsenal of some 12,000 rockets .
More than a week of airstrikes have done little to prevent Hizbollah from firing rockets at areas in northern Israel , including Haifa , the country 's third - largest city .
Today , more than 65 rockets fell - a dramatic increase from the previous 24 hours and at least 12 Israelis were injured .
Britain 's decision publicly to break ranks with the Americans over Israel 's military tactics will cause deep concern in Jerusalem and a senior Israeli diplomat was at pains last night to play down any suggestion of a rift .
He said any feeling in London that Olmert 's response to the Blair telephone call was a rebuff would be inaccurate .
' The tone was very positive .
We agree on all the major aspects of this crisis and we are greatly appreciative of Britain 's position . '
The Israeli Prime Minister , the source said , was merely reflecting an ' absolute determination to deal with the threat which we face from Hizbollah and to see that the UN resolutions requiring it to be disarmed are finally carried through . '
Senior British sources also stressed their unwavering conviction that Hizbollah , and their Syrian and Iranian supporters , were responsible for igniting the crisis .
They added that both the Syrian and Iranian ambassadors had been called into the Foreign Office last week to drive that message home .
Home Sweet Home ?

Culture Shock USA - Part I
I had not been home for almost eight years .
A lot had happened in that time .
From Europe , my fellow Americans seemed to have lost their capacity to think straight .
Some in Europe and the States rightly spoke of a slippery slope into totalitarianism .
I long hoped that my country would at some point understand what the Patriot Act represents .
But not even the disgraceful conduct of our soldiers in Abu Ghraib was enough to keep the current administration from winning a majority in the elections of 2004 .
Would I come home to an America too scared of terrorists to understand my fears ?
Would I understand my fellow Americans at all anymore ?
And would they understand me ?
What is life like in the heart of the Imperium Americanum ?
Would I be held at the border if I was not able to provide officials with an address of where I was going , as happened to my sister - in - law ( " Erwartest du heute Besuch ? " ) , or was my name on a no - fly list ( Will the World Finance the Imperium Americanum ? ) because of the criticism of the current administration 's foreign policy I had already published ?
Put all of your bags on the conveyor belt , take off all watches , jewelry , belt buckles , and other metal objects and put them in a bin , also take off your jackets and put them in a bin , take your shoes off , whoever has a six - pack can come right on up front , we 'll also be checking for smiles - you back there : stop yawning !
The security guard at the international Airport in New Orleans obviously wanted to become a standup comedian .
Instead , he spent his time keeping people in a good mood by interweaving nonsense into the deadpan commands he was barking out to the passengers waiting to undergo security checks .
Ever seen a crowd of laughing people at the metal detectors in an airport ?
Let 's get right to the point : I had a great time in my 30 - day stay in the US .
What 's more , little had changed .
Sure , lots of things were different , but it was all mainly just the continuation of where the country was headed in the mid-1990s .
In other words , for me the US had changed as though September 11 had never happened .
Recent American Homeland Security policies remind many shocked Europeans of the barbaric practices of the Nazis or former communist East Germany .
But I did not by any means have the impression that I was entering a country about to lose its democracy ; this was not Nazi Germany in 1933 , as some fear .
However , this realization also left me at a loss , for it meant that my country did not have to change its character fundamentally to bring about the things that had made such a comparison imaginable for so many people .
When I was in school , I learned that the anti-communist tirades of Senator McCarthy were an un-American aberration .
What my country had done a few years before in Vietnam had not yet made it into my schoolbooks .
And when I was getting my master 's degree at the University of Texas during the first Gulf War , then - President Bush Sr. went on television to explain why we had to intervene militarily in the Gulf .
In his hands , he held a report by Amnesty International about Saddam Hussein 's terrorist régime .
" They 're gonna laugh him out of office " , I thought , expecting the media to point out the next day that Amnesty International has similar reports about most countries , but we are not invading everywhere .
But the media did not report this .
Instead , students at UT Austin were soon selling T - shirts with I 'd fly 10,000 miles to smoke a camel written on them .
Every day , I walked by such a stand , but I always managed to spare myself the embarrassment of pointing that there are lots of camels in Saudi Arabia , the country we claimed to be defending .
So I come from a country that is able to produce something like McCarthy , Vietnam and the Gulf Wars I and II every 10 or 20 years .
These events are not un-American aberrations ; they are defining moments in my country 's history .
For many Americans , they are something to be proud of .
The " old " Hardy Street in downtown Hattiesburg , Mississippi , where I went to elementary school .
Four lanes with a turning lane in the middle , and the stores are close to the street
What had changed ?
The US is moving further and further away from an infrastructure that would allow people to get around without a car .
Urban sprawl continues unabated .
What looks like a highway is actually just the extension of Hardy Street .
It still has four lanes , but now there are also four turning lanes - a total of eight lanes instead of five .
In addition , there is now a wide median .
To the right , the first free - standing stores are being built - but the storefronts are no longer directly on the street , but rather behind a ditch .
The strip mall is so far behind these free - standing stores that you would n't even expect there is one in this picture .
Lots of space for cars , but you 'd better not try to walk anywhere - or catch public transport .
No bus stop here .
When I visited the old part of Hattiesburg that I used to live in , it was clear why there was so much development on the outskirts of town : the old part of town has been written off .
Whites know why : blacks have " taken over " - " there goes the neighborhood " .
And when white flight sets in , the money moves out .
As a friend of mine in Germany from Baton Rouge put it , " America 's cities look like a bomb has gone off in the middle of them .
But in the suburbs , everything looks OK " .
When I was a boy , I used to eat pizza here - right in the middle of Hattiesburg , Mississippi .
The fine print on city - limits signs in the US reads , " No deposit , no return " .
Meanwhile , indoor shopping malls have come up with ways of attracting senior citizens : they are marketing themselves as air - conditioned exercise arenas with in - house ambulance services .
The elderly can have their daily walk without suffering from the heat of the South , and if anyone has a heart attack , help is not far - right between the ice cream shop and the everything - for - a - dollar mart .
The Turtle Creek Mall offers two oxygen units and an external defibrillator .
So are American shopping malls finally turning into a sort of neighborhood after all , where people bump into each other and chat without necessarily wanting to buy something ?
When Americans ask me why I like to live in these cramped old European inner cities , I usually try to sell the idea by comparing European town centers to our malls .
Imagine there are apartments and parks above the two floors where everyone goes shopping .
Most stores are then closer to your front door than your own car is .
Everyone likes to walk everywhere , neighbors bump into each other all the time , and eventually everyone just hangs out without wanting to buy anything .
Up to now , every American I have talked to has found that notion appealing , but I have yet to see any apartments on top of malls .
Culture shock ?
I really only experienced culture shock once during my stay , and that was on the very first night .
But it lasted the whole 30 days .
My brother picked me up from the airport in New Orleans , and we went to eat Mexican with his wife .
I was a bit jetlagged , but my brother and his wife said that I should n't miss the place they wanted to take me to .
The food was great , but everyone in the restaurant was sitting on rinky - dink benches , and the ventilation , lighting and plumbing were hanging down from the uncleaned ceiling without any further decoration .
It was a dive , and everyone seemed to like it that way .
For four weeks , I went from one hole in the wall to the next .
In a bar in Austin , Texas that was even called The Hole in the Wall , the ceiling was covered with nothing more than grey fire - resistant foam that had been sprayed on .
But the best part was the shack on the outskirts of Hattiesburg , Mississippi that by all accounts had the best barbecue in town .
" Leatha 's " had obviously been built by the people who did the cooking .
The floor was cheap plywood that groaned under the weight of Big Mama Leatha , the hospitable chef whose own girth was the best recommendation for her cooking .
They must have spent days picking out the furniture for the place , for no two chairs were alike .
But the food was great , and our waitress popped up with a pitcher of sweetened iced tee before I had half - finished my glass - all you can eat & drink , a concept practically unknown in Europe .
Near the end of my stay , I spoke with my brother about this culture shock .
He said that everyone just wants to have good food , and if the place is done up too fancy , you just have to pay more .
You can take the boy out of the country , but you can't take the country out of the boy
This culture shock was not , however , severe enough to prevent me from feeling right at home , especially in Leatha 's shack out in the country in Mississippi .
No one felt any need to hide their poverty or their wealth .
And anyway , the people who had money did not want to go to some fancy restaurant with white tablecloths , wine glasses , and more silverware than you can shake a stick at ; they would rather drive an expensive pickup to a shack where you can eat piles of great meat with your hands .
Strangely enough , after reading all the hubbub about SUVs , I suddenly found myself unable to understand what the big deal was .
Southerners have been driving pickups for decades , and these Hummers ( which I had not yet seen in real life ) did not look that big at all next to the pickups I was used to seeing .
And anyway , the biggest vehicle you can buy is not an SUV , but a CXT - a real cabin for an 18 - wheeler with a permanently attached bed in the back instead of a trailer hitch .
Probably , SUVs have only raised such commotion because soccer moms outside the South began using them as family cars .
In the South , Hummers fit well into the landscape .
After all , it was not so long ago that we really needed off - road vehicles .
( I may be wrong , but somehow I can't imagine " soccer mom " being spoken with a Southern drawl . )
I knew that I had really made it back to the Deep South when Leatha 's son , said to suffer from a slight mental impairment , came to our table after we had placed our orders and asked us what song he should sing .
We chose the Christmas classic " Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire " , which the young man promptly began crooning after sticking his hands in the pockets of his overalls .
Frank Sinatra would have sounded similar shortly before dying of thirst .
To make matters worse , our crooner was singing the lines of the lyrics in a more or less random order .
That made it difficult for him to know when he had finished .
So when he hit a spot that could be taken for a finale , we all began clapping to convince him that the song was over and that he had made everyone happy .
Which he had .
I felt like I was in one of William Faulkner 's stories ; it is often so hard to tell which of his characters still have all their marbles .
The people with no psychological excuse are often the worst .
Everyone a potentially crazy Southerner .
But common Southern decency - or as one of Faulkner 's characters once put it , " Dammit , sir , will you accuse a lady to her face of smelling bad ? " - demands that you not go around judging other people , for nobody is perfect , and those who are without sin should cast the first stone .
" There you go " , I thought to myself , " now you 're thinking like someone from the Bible Belt .
Welcome home .
And now pass me some of them beans . "

It ’s an old staple of science fiction .
Software comes to life and wipes out humanity .
One of the most vivid examples of this plot device is in the movie Terminator .
In it , a defense program named Skynet becomes self - aware and then it creates robots that are hell - bent on destroying us .
Terminator is a great popcorn flick , but it could n’t ever happen , right ?
Well , maybe it ’s happening already .
Science fiction writers usually hypothesize a takeover based upon intelligence .
Machines become smarter than us , so they win .
But , what about the opposite tack ?
Think about your code .
If you ’re lucky , you ’re working in Java .
I know that ’s an odd thing to say today .
Everyone is down on Java in some way or another , but if you ’re working in Java you ’re lucky because your code is relatively new .
Java is a fairly young in language terms .
There are teams out there that are using ancient mainframe languages , in - house proprietary languages , and even languages so obsolete that they have to buy compilers on eBay .
Code in those languages may be tough to work with and tough to understand , but the code did at least get one thing right .
It survived .
How did it survive ?
It survived by being valuable and difficult to replace .
That sounds a lot like natural selection does n’t it .
The code beat out all of the other code on the fitness landscape .
Once you adopt this way of looking at code , business looks different .
Some companies , instead of replacing an integral application , put it on life support .
They try to keep it and everything it needs running smoothly and often they are surprised by just how much it needs .
If an application is designed to use specific hardware , the hardware has to stay , along with the OS , the file formats , particular database technology , the tool chain .. the list goes on .
Over time , the company is n’t paying the price of an application ; it ’s paying the price of a complete eco-system .
And , let ’s not forget the human element .
How many people want to work on 40 year old technology ?
Costs grow and grow .
No , I think that code is alive .
Some code lives long after the company that made it .
It survives acquisition after acquisition and sale after sale , and it silently shapes the entire markets .
Have you ever thought of some killer feature that a company could use in their systems that would make them millions ?
Chances are , they ’ve thought of it too , but the architecture of their code does n’t allow it .
At that point , who is control , really , the company or the code ?
It all comes back to one thing : code survives by providing value and by being difficult to replace .
The primordial soup is chunky with SQL , ant scripts , and old servlet carcasses .
Time goes on , and complexity builds .
Sort of makes you want to refactor , does n't it ? :-)
Well - hung males may enjoy an evolutionary advantage over their less well - endowed competitors – in certain rodents , anyway .
The finding may help answer the vexing question of why penis size is so variable among mammals .
Steven Ramm , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Liverpool , UK , gathered published measurements of the length of the penis bone in four orders of mammals : rodents , primates , bats and carnivores , then corrected for the fact that related species tend to have similar - sized penises .
He compared these adjusted lengths with body weight and testis size , which is a good indicator of a species ’ promiscuity and so of …
A team of American and French scientists has developed a method to determine the influence of past volcanic eruptions on climate and the chemistry of the upper atmosphere , and significantly reduce uncertainty in models of future climate change .
In the January 5 issue of the journal Science , the researchers from the University of California , San Diego , the National Center for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) and the University of Grenoble in France report that the chemical fingerprint of fallout from past eruptions reveals how high the volcanic material reached , and what chemical reactions occurred while it was in the atmosphere .
The work is particularly relevant because the effect of atmospheric particles , or aerosols , is a large uncertainty in models of climate , according to Mark Thiemens , Dean of UCSD ’s Division of Physical Sciences and professor of chemistry and biochemistry .
“ In predictions about global warming , the greatest amount of error is associated with atmospheric aerosols , ” explained Thiemens , in whose laboratory the method , which is based on the measurement of isotopes — or forms of sulfur — was developed .
“ Now for the first time , we can account for all of the chemistry involving sulfates , which removes uncertainties in how these particles are made and transported .
That ’s a big deal with climate change . ”
Determining the height of a past volcanic eruption provides important information about its impact on climate .
If volcanic material only reaches the lower atmosphere , the effects are relatively local and short term because the material is washed out by rain .
Eruptions that reach higher , up to the stratosphere , have a greater influence on climate .
“ In the stratosphere , sulfur dioxide that was originally in the magma gets oxidized and forms droplets of sulfuric acid , ” said Joël Savarino , a researcher at the CNRS and the University of Grenoble , who led the study .
“ This layer of acid can stay for years in the stratosphere because no liquid water is present in this part of the atmosphere .
The layer thus acts as a blanket , reflecting the sunlight and therefore reducing the temperature at ground level , significantly and for many years . ”
To distinguish eruptions that made it to the stratosphere from those that did not , the researchers examined the isotopes of sulfur in fallout preserved in the ice in Antarctica .
The volcanic material is carried there by air currents .
Thiemens , Savarino and two of their students traveled to Antarctica and recovered the samples by digging snow pits near the South Pole and Dome C , the new French / Italian inland station .

Sulfur that rises as high as the stratosphere , above the ozone layer , is exposed to short wavelength ultraviolet light .
UV exposure creates a unique ratio of sulfur isotopes .
Therefore the sulfur isotope signature in fallout reveals whether or not an eruption was stratospheric .
To develop the method , the team , which also included Mélanie Baroni , the first author on the paper who is a postdoctoral fellow working with Savarino , and Robert Delmas , a research director at the CNRS , focused on two volcanic eruptions .
Both eruptions , the 1963 eruption of Mount Agung in Bali and the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines , were stratospheric according to the isotope measurements .
“ Young volcanoes have the advantage of having been documented by modern instruments , such as satellites or aircraft , ” said Savarino , who began his investigations into sulfur isotope measurements when he was a postdoctoral fellow working with Thiemens .
“ We could therefore compare our measurements on volcanic fallout stored in snow with atmospheric observations . ”
Not only did their isotope measurements match the atmospheric observations , they were also able to distinguish the Pinatubo eruption from the eruption of Cerro Hudson that occurred the same year .
Cerro Hudson did not send material as high as the stratosphere and the fallout had a different sulfur isotope fingerprint than the fallout from Pinatubo .
Volcanic material from more ancient eruptions is preserved in Antarctica , but the older , deeper seasonal layers of ice are extremely thin as a result of the pressure from the overlying ice .
Therefore , it is not currently feasible to extract enough fallout from the ice to apply the isotope method to all past volcanoes .
However , data from eruptions in the recent past reveal what chemical reactions of sulfates occur in the upper atmosphere .
Some scientists have proposed that if global warming becomes severe , sulfates could be injected into the stratosphere in order to block some of the incoming solar radiation and reduce the temperature .
Thiemens explained that understanding the chemical reactions of sulfates in the stratosphere is critical to determining if this approach would be effective .
“ Sulfates can cause warming or cooling depending on how they are made , ” he said .
“ They are usually white particles , which tend to reflect sunlight , but if they are made on dark particles like soot , they can absorb heat and worsen warming . ”
The study was funded by the French Polar Institute ( IPEV ) and the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs .

Phase Change in Fluids Finally Simulated After Decades of Effort
Everyone knows what happens to water when it boils �everyone , that is , except computers .
Modeling the transformation process of matter moving from one phase to another , such as from liquid to gas , has been all but impossible near the critical point .
This is due to the increasingly complex way molecules behave as they approach the change from one phase to another .
Researchers at the University of Rochester , however , have now created a mathematical model that will allow scientists to simulate and understand phase changes , which could have an impact on everything from decaffeinating coffee to improving fuel cell efficiency in automobiles of the future .
The findings have been published in Physical Review Letters .
" This problem has baffled scientists for decades , " says Yonathan Shapir , professor of physics and chemical engineering at the University of Rochester , and co-author of the paper .
" This is the first time a computer program could simulate a phase transition because the computers would always bog down at what 's known as the ' critical slowdown . '
We figured out a way to perform a kind of end - run around that critical point slowdown and the results allow us to calculate certain critical point properties for the first time . "
" Critical slowdown " is a phenomenon that happens as matter moves from one phase to another near the critical point .
As molecules in a gas , for instance , are cooled , they lose some of their motion , but are still moving around and bumping into each other .
As the temperature drops to where the gas will change into a liquid , the molecules ' motion becomes correlated , or connected , across larger and larger distances .
That correlation is a bit like deciding where to go to dinner �quick and easy with two people , but takes forever for a group of 20 to take action .
The broadening correlation dramatically increases the time it takes for the gas to reach an overall equilibrium , and that directly leads to an increase in computing time required , approaching infinity and bogging down as the gas crosses the point of phase change .
To illustrate the effect , imagine a perfectly pure and still lake .
If you drop a pebble into this lake , its ripples would spread outward , dissipating until the lake had returned to a calm equilibrium again .
But , if you were to take this impossibly perfect lake just barely above the critical point and drop your pebble , the ripples would remain as ripples much longer �likely bouncing off the distant shores .
This imaginary lake would take seemingly forever to return to its calm equilibrium again .
The research team of Shapir , Eldred Chimowitz , professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering , and physics graduate student Subhranil De created a novel approach to tackle the phase - change process .
They devised a computational model consisting of two separate reservoirs of fluid at equilibrium and near the critical point threshold .
One reservoir was slightly more pressurized than its neighbor .
The reservoirs were opened to each other and the pressure difference caused the fluids to mix .
The team let the simulation run until the entire system reached thermodynamic equilibrium .
By watching the rate that equilibrium returned , the team was able to calculate the behavior at the critical point .
Their simulation findings match predictions and experimental results , including very precise measurements performed in microgravity on the Space Shuttle .
" In principle , it 's a difficult calculation , " says Chimowitz .
" Fluid systems require a different class of models than the common lattice models used by researchers who have studied dynamic critical behavior .
These different classes give rise to different dynamic critical exponents and we found them , for the first time , in real fluid systems . "
The best known examples of phase changes are perhaps water to ice and water to steam .
Phase changes of many different physical types occur , however , such as the separation of a liquid mixture to its components , which should also abide by the Rochester team 's results .
The team 's simulation approach will likely be used by industry in a variety of ways , not the least of which will be to derive more power from a fuel cell .
Since fuel cells rely on the transportation of protons through a membrane separating two electrodes , Shapir and Chimowitz believe it should be possible to use their work to find the most efficient configurations for a fuel cell .
Other applications , such as removing the caffeine from coffee , work in a similar way and will likely also benefit .
Chimowitz also has just published a much - praised book about the subject , called Introduction to Critical Phenomena in Fluids from Oxford University Press .
The book has been nominated for the Association of American Publishers ' Award for Excellence in Professional and Scholarly Publishing .
This research was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation .
1. City of Snakes
In heels as well !
Yeah .
Yes , I 'm a professional transvestite so I can run about in heels and not fall over , ‘ cause , you know , if women fall over wearing heels , that 's embarrassing ; but if a bloke falls over wearing heels , then you have to kill yourself !
It ’s the end of your life , it 's quite difficult .
So , San Francisco ! ( singing ) San Francisco , San Francisco …
Not “ San Fran , ” no , apparently not !
I did n’t know that , I would ’ve said “ San Fran , ” but you ’d go , “ No , we do n’t like “ San Fran , ” fuck it ! ”
Or what ’s the other one you do n’t… ?
Oh , Frisco !
You do n’t like that either .
( audience hissing )
And you ’re a city of snakes , I see ! ( Eddie hisses )
Everyone goes to a gig with a snake in their bag .
( hisses )
No other cities have snakes as much as you .
I ’ve been to New York , no fucking snakes ; Paris , no snakes ; London , no snakes .
San Francisco , full of fucking snakes !
( hisses )
We did that at school !
So you call it ( rolling eyes ) “ The City . ” ( mocking sounds )
“ The City .
”
And you do n’t tell tourists about the weather in July and August .
You do n’t fucking tell anyone .
They ’re all going around in summer shirts , going , “ Jesus Christ !
I ca n’t see !
I ca n’t see !
Fog !
There ’s fog ! ”
And it really shifts it , your fog !
I saw John Carpenter ’s film , “ The Fog , ” seen it a few times , and that fog shifts it .
I thought , “ Well , that ’s Hollywood , that ’s fog moving really fast , ” but your fog is that speed !
( mimes running )
Busy , busy , busy !
It could be late to get in someone ’s face somewhere !
It runs down the road , does n’t it ?
Faster than the fucking taxis !
Of which there are five …
I do n’t know what that ’s about .
You ’re a no - taxi city , are n’t you ?
Five taxis , all going , “ I got people in . ”
Hours !
( sounds of taxis speeding by )
Then , when you get in , they do n’t know where they ’re going .
I had to tell the guy , “ Get in the back , I ’ll drive ! ”
He ’s sitting in the back , going , “ Well , I do n’t know …
I ’ve only lived here four million years ! ”
Cable cars are fun .
Everyone gets on board and becomes a rhesus monkey .
No one talks on a cable car , they just hang and stare …
And the guy in the front , with no steering wheel , going , “ What the fuck ?
What the fuck ’s this one ? ”
Pulling levers , levers …
Is it four levers that just do fuckall ?
That it ?
He ’s always ringing that bell , going , “ Help ! Help ! ” ( imitates bell clanging )
Endless bell ringing !
What is he , the Hunchback of Notre Dame ?
The bell …
Him and the guy from the stock market are the same person , I think .
At the end of the stock market , they ring a bell .
It ’s the same bell .
Oh , yes .
( mimes writing )
“ Never link those two together again . ” 2 . Squirrels in Makeup
Yes , so I was going to be in the army when I was a kid .
Yes .
I say that , and people go , “ Oh , yeah , yeah ! ” No , I was , I was going to be in the army when I was a kid .
‘ Cause if you 're a transvestite , you 're actually a male tomboy , that 's where the sexuality is .
Yeah , it 's not drag queen , no ; gay men have got that covered .
This is male tomboy , and people do get that mixed up , they put transvestite there - no no no no !
Little bit of a crowbar separation , thank you !
And gay men , I think , would agree .
It 's male lesbian , that 's really where it is , ok ?
Because … it 's true !
‘ Cause most transvestites fancy girls , fancy women .
So that 's where it is .
So it ’s “ running , jumping , climbing trees , putting on makeup when you 're up there . ”
That 's where it is !
I used to keep my makeup in a squirrel hole , up the tree .
The squirrel would keep makeup on one side , and he'd keep nuts on the other side .
And sometimes I 'd get up that tree , and that squirrel would be covered in makeup !
( mimes squirrel putting on makeup )
" La la , la la… Oh ! ( mimes squirrel eating )
What ?!
Fuck off ! "
He seemed to say .
And squirrels always eat nuts with two hands , always two hands , and occasionally , they stop and go ( gasps ) , as if they 're going , " Did I leave the gas on ?
No !
I 'm a fucking squirrel ! "
And occasionally they go , " Fucking nuts !
Fed up with them always .
I long for a grapefruit . "
Yeah .
So that 's very much like the army -- the running , jumping , climbing trees is , not the squirrel bit -- the trees bit .
And I was !
I loved the army stuff , which is the running , jumping , standing still , “ Found you , ” ah - ah , flag , “ Look , ” hat , you know .
Bang !
I liked all that stuff , the gun thing …
I liked blowing up milk bottles .
You know , kill the milk bottles .
Boom !
Explode milk bottles .
Yes .
It seems fun - there 's this thing of power in you hands .
There 's all this National Rifle Association and everyone in America is - I mean , 13 year olds keep going out and they get hold of weapons from their grandfather 's arsenal !
" I 'll borrow the Howitzer , the M16 machine gun , the Uzi … " What the fuck 's the grandfather doing ?!
This kid down in Arkansas just helped himself to a ton of military weapons , and went and blew away his school !
And the National Rifle Association says that , " Guns do n't kill people , people do , ” but I think the gun helps , you know ?
I think it helps .
I just think just standing there going , " Bang ! "
That 's not going to kill too many people , is it ?
You'd have to be really dodgy on the heart to have that …
( imitates gunfire noises )
I think they should just try that , you know .
But yeah , shooting clay pigeons , I think , yeah , go for that .
Shooting clay pigeons , they ’re fuckers !
Come round your house , whiz through ( fly - by noises )
They do nothing , they do n't even eat flies !
You know ?
Spiders eat flies , so they 're all right , keep them , you know ?
Flies do n't eat fuckall , so kill 'em !
And clay pigeons - everyone shoots them in the air .
Wait 'til they land !
Then go up to the clay pigeon ... ( shoots )
Much easier .
Yeah .
So !
I did n't join the army , as you might have noticed ...
Yeah , ‘ cause there 's not much makeup in the army , is there ?
No ?
They only have that night - time look , and that 's a bit slapdash , is n't it ?
And they look a mess !
So you can't join , even though the American armed forces have a distinct policy of " do n't ask , do n't tell " towards the alternative sexualities .
If you 're a bloke wearing a lot of makeup , you know …
I do n't think they need to ask , really !
And so you can't join , they go , " No , no , you can 't .
It 's the wrong shade of lipstick for the Army , I 'm afraid ... "
And they 're missing a huge opportunity here , ‘ cause we all know one of the main elements of attack is the element of surprise , and so what could be more surprising than the 1st Battalion Transvestite Brigade ?
Airborne wing !
The airborne wing parachuting into dangerous areas with fantastic makeup !
And a fantastic gun !
And the opposing forces going , " Fucking ‘ell , look at these guys !
Look at that !
They ’ve got guns .
They 've got guns !
Jesus , they 've got guns ! "
Ah , bugger .
I was so surprised !
Were you surprised ?
I was surprised .
Anyway , so yes , sooo …
Also , if you 're a transvestite , you get lumped into that weirdo grouping , you know ?
When I was in New York , there was a guy in the Bronx whowas living in a cave … like you do , and he was coming out and shooting at geese and … ( chuckles ) a lot of weird things going on with this guy ; and the police picked him up and they found a collection of women 's shoes , and they thought , " Maybe he 's a transvestite . ”
And if he is , he 's a fucking weirdo transvestite !
I 'm much more in the executive transvestite area .
Travel the world , yes , it 's much more executive .
Like J. Edgar Hoover , what a fuckhead he was !
They found out when he died that he was a transvestite , and they go , " Well , that explains his weird behavior ! "
Yeah , fucking weirdo transvestite !
( pointing to himself ) Executive transvestite .
It 's a lot wider community , more wide than you 'd think …
History 3 . Yes , and I grew up in Europe , where the history comes from .
Oh , yeah .
You tear your history down , man !
“ 30 years old , let 's smash it to the floor and put a car park here ! "
I have seen it in stories .
I sawsomething in a program on something in Miami , and they were saying , " We 've redecorated this building to how it looked over 50 years ago ! "
And people were going , " No , surely not , no .
No one was alive then ! "
Well , we got tons of history lying about the place , big old castles , and they just get in the way .
We 're driving -- " Oh , a fucking castle !
Have to drive around it ... "
Disney came over and built Euro Disney , and they built the Disney castle there , and it was , " You better make it a bit bigger , they 've actually got them here ...
And they 're not made of plastic ! "
We got tons of them , ‘ cause you think we all live in castles , and we do all live in castles !
We all got a castle each .
We 're up to here with fucking castles !
We just long for a bungalow or something .
And I grew up in the 70s , when the careers advisor used to come to school , and he used to get the kids together and say , " Look , I advise you to get a career , what can I say ?
That 's it . "
And he took me aside , he said , " Whatcha you want to do , kid ?
Whatcha you want to do ?
Tell me , tell me your dreams ! "
" I want to be a space astronaut !
Go to outer space , discover things that have never been discovered . "
He said , " Look , you 're British , so scale it down a bit , all right ? "
" All right , I want to work in a shoe shop then !
Discover shoes that no one 's ever discovered right in the back of the shop , on the left . "
And he said , " Look , you 're British , so scale it down a bit , all right ? "
" All right , I want to work in a sewer then !
Discover sewage that no one 's ever discovered , and pile it on my head , then come to the surface and sell myself to an art gallery . "
He said , " What the fuck have you been smoking , eh ?
Certainly you have n't been smoking in a bar in California , that 's for certain ! "
‘ Cause you can 't !
No , no smoking in bars now , and soon , no drinking and no talking !
Be careful , California !
You 're supposed to be the crazy state , the out there , the wild ones , you know ?
In the future , everyone 's going to say , " Come down to the library , we 'll have a wild time , shall we ? “ ( mimes dragging on a joint )
“ Do n't know where that fucking book is , mate , it could be anywhere !
There 's a lot of 'em about ! "
Yeah , so , yes , so that was it .
There was a spirit of ex-empire , this thing of “ things ca n't be done , " whereas in America , I thought there was a spirit of " can be done ! "
The pioneer thing .
" Go do it , what do you want to do ? " “ I want to put babies on spikes . "
" Go then !
Go ! ”
It 's the American Dream !
" Hi ! I 'm Crazy Eddie !
I put babies on spikes .
Do you want a rack of babies ?
We 've got babies on racks !
Mmm , they taste of chicken ! "
They do !
Babies taste of chicken !
Cannibals say that human flesh tastes of chicken , so babies must taste of chicken .
And chicken tastes of humans .
( nervous laughter from audience )
Good , I 'm glad you 're coming with me on that .
Yes , so this is all true .
And so , yes .
Soin Europe , we had empires .
Everyone had them - France and Spain and Britain and Turkey !
The Ottoman Empire , full of furniture for some reason .
And the Austro - Hungarian Empire , famous for fuck all !
Yes , all they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard .
And the German empire , very organized , they ’d always build an empire , “ ein , zwei , ein , zwei , “ build an empire , very Prussian , and then they 'd celebrate with a World War !
And then lose the whole fucking empire by the end of the war .
In the 30s , Hitler , Czechoslovakia , Poland , France , World War II ... the Russian front , not a good idea ...!
Hitler never played “ Risk ” when he was a kid ...!
‘ Cause , you know , playing “ Risk , ” you could never hold on to Asia .
That Asian - Eastern European area , you could never hold it , could you ?
Seven extra men at the beginning of every go , but you could n't fucking hold it !
Australasia , that was the one !
Australasia , all the purple ones !
Get everyone on Papua New Guinea and just build up and build up ...
And Hitler ended up in a ditch , covered in petrol , on fire , so , that 's fun !
I think that 's funny , ‘ cause he was a mass - murdering fuckhead .
And that was his honeymoon as well !
Double trouble !
" Eva , let 's marry . "
" Where should our honeymoon be ? " " Well , in a ditch , covered in petrol , on fire .
I 've already arranged it upstairs . "
" Oh , how romantic , Adolf . "
" Yes , I thought ! " Fun !
What a bastard !
And he was a vegetarian , and a painter , so he must have been going , " I ca n't get the fucking trees …
Damn !
I will kill everyone in the world ! "
And he was a mass - murdering fuckhead , as many important historians have said .
But there were other mass murderers that got away with it !
Stalin killed many millions , died in his bed , well done there ; Pol Pot killed 1.7 million Cambodians , died under house arrest at age 72 , well done indeed !
And the reason we let them get away with it is because they killed their own people , and we 're sort of fine with that .
“ Ah , help yourself , ” you know ?
“ We 've been trying to kill you for ages ! ”
So kill your own people , right on there .
Seems to be …
Hitler killed people next door ...
“ Oh… stupid man ! ”
After a couple of years , we wo n't stand for that , will we ?
Pol Pot killed 1.7 million people .
We can't even deal with that !
You know , we think if somebody kills someone , that 's murder , you go to prison .
You kill 10 people , you go to Texas , they hit you with a brick , that 's what they do .
20 people , you go to a hospital , they look through a small window at you forever .
And over that , we can't deal with it , you know ?
Someone 's killed 100,000 people .
We 're almost going , " Well done !
You killed 100,000 people ?
You must get up very early in the morning .
I can't even get down the gym !
Your diary must look odd : “ Get up in the morning , death , death , death , death , death , death , death – lunch - death , death , death - afternoon tea - death , death , death - quick shower … "
So I suppose we 're glad that Pol Pot 's under house arrest … you know , 1.7 million people .
At least he - we know where he is - under house arrest !
Just do n't go in that fucking house , you know ?
I know a lot of people who'd love to be under house arrest !
They bring you your food …
" Just stay here ?
Oh , all right .
( singing laconically )
Have you got any videos ? "
You know , you just sit there all day ...
And Pol Pot was a history teacher .
And Hitler was a vegetarian painter .
So ... mass - murderers come from the areas you least expect it .
I do n't know how the flip comes over , but it happens .
So , yeah .
There was a lot of that , and we built up empires - we stole countries !
That 's what you do , that 's how you build an empire .
We stole countries with the cunning use of flags !
Yeah , just sail around the world and stick a flag in .
" I claim India for Britain ! "
They go , " You can't claim us , we live here ! 500 million of us ! "
" Do you have a flag ? "
" We do n't need a bloody flag !
It 's our country , you bastards ! "
" No flag , no country , you can't have one !
That 's the rules that I 've just made up , and I 'm backing it up with this gun that was lent from the National Rifle Association . "
That was it , you know ?
4 . Royal Genetics And Queen Victoria became Empress of India .
She never even fucking went there , you know ?
She was one of our more frumpy queens … they 're all frumpy , are n't they ?
Because it 's a bad idea when cousins marry !
Bottom of the gene pool , you know .
You 'rejust scraping the barrel there , “ We 've have n't got enough for any more of you royals there , sorry . ”
First rule of genetics : spread the genes apart !
But the royals are just obsessed with , " Are you a royal family ?
Are you a royal member ?
Well , then you can marry me ‘ cause you 're same gene pool , and our IQs will go down the toilet . ”
Fantastic !
That 's why there 's no crazy royals , they 're all kind of , " Hello !
Hello , what do you do ?
You 're a plumber !
What on Earth is that ? "
So yeah .
And after World War II , all the empires sort of dissolved .
And we did n't - we came first inWorld War II , but we were financially fucked by the end , ‘ cause there was a period of time where it was just us and the Nazis , and they 'd been making weapons for ages !
They had a head start !
We were going , " Get the tanks out !
Get the… we have n't got any tanks ?
Then get that ice cream van out there !
Get it out there !
Kill !
All right , fuck it .
( mimes making ice cones and throwing them )
Fuck off !
Everything !
Just throw everything at them !
Just … that 's not … harder !
Orange fruities !
And Zooms !
Throw the Zooms !
Fuck off , you bastards !
Pots and pans !
Get pots … just throw the pots and pans at them ! "
So by the time America came in - ‘ cause you were watching a U.S. cavalry film , ‘ cause the U.S. cavalry always comes in right just towards the end of the film - ( sings charge melody ) " Ok , let 's go America ! " ( charge melody )
" I love the smell of Europe in the morning !
So , how 're you doing ? " , we were going , " Fucking ‘ell , where 've you been ? "
" Ah , having breakfast .
So , what 's going on , hey ? "
So , America did well , Russia did well , and deservedly so , because half a million American soldiers died , half a million British soldiers died , and about 26 million Russian soldiers died .
Soldiers and civilians , and that 's just 50 times as many .
It 's just un-fucking - believable , you know , and no one mentions it !
These are just figures I discovered .
That 's why they put up …’ cause , I mean , Napoleon had been steaming in there 100 years before : " I 'm going to kill them , I 'm going to kill them , going to …
Oh , it 's a bit cold , it 's a bit cold .
Right !
Ok , ok , bad idea . "
And then Hitler , " I 've got a better idea , got a better idea …
Oh , it 's the same idea !
It 's the same idea , it 's the same idea ... "
So no wonder they set up the Eastern Bloc !
They wanted a buffer zone .
It was n't fair , but that 's what they did .
So that 's where they 're coming from .
And about 20 million Nazi Germans died , but they did start it , they did start that one .
And , yeah , so it was that , and France hated them all ‘ cause Southern France was collaborating with the Germans , embarrassing !
So since then , they 've been kind of spiky and kind of , French ...
I 'm very positive on the French , my family way back was French , so I go with it , but they are kind of , well , fucking French at times ...
" All of Europe , you must do this ! "
" Well … we 're not gonna !
We 're gonna have a sandwich . "
And Germany and Japan , they do seem to have a natural instinct in a very generalized way for organization and being military , but , you know , there 's a very strong Green Party there now , kids with beards , it 's getting okay , and I just think Japan and Germany should be the peacekeepers of the world .
They should be parachuted in ; whenever something breaks out , parachute Germans and Japanese in .
They ’ll go , " Look , we 've done this before , we 've done the killing .
Hello !
Take it from us , just chill out ! "
And then , they ’d organize peace really quickly .
" All right , peace , peace , peace , peace is organized ! ”
It could be brilliant if they could do that .
That 's their destiny , man !
Yeah .
Italy invented fascism in 1922 .
Mussolini said , " Right , we 're all fascists ! " but most Italian people are always on scooters going , " Ciao ! "
And they 're into football , and life , and they 're not fascists , you know ?
He said , " We 're all fascists ! " " All right , ciao ! "
No helmet on… ( imitates scooter running )
All those 50s films , like “ Roman Holiday , ” it 's just like that !
Everyone 's just cool and hangs out .
Strategic Sheep 5 . So after World War II , the whole world was going , " Come on , Europe , give these countries back .
Come on , we just had a bloody war ; let 's give 'em back .
Britain ? " " Wha ' ? "
" What 's that behind your back ? "
" Oh , it 's India and a number of other countries . "
" Give 'em back . "
" Oh , all right .
There 's that one there , and there 's that one … ” “ Falkland Islands ? ” “ Oh , we need the Falkland Islands ... for strategic sheep purposes ! "
Yeah .
And then it was a case of no empire no longer .
But in America , it was different .
The founding fathers landed in 16 ( mumbles ) .
They set off from Plymouth and landed in Plymouth !
How lucky is that ?
" This is Plymouth ?
We 've just come from Plymouth !
We 've gone round in a circle .
Lads , back on the boats . "
They finally got there and said , " Ah , this is where our God has brought us to !
We can practice our religion here , we can raise a family .
There 's nobody here !
Excuse me …
There 's nobody here !
Yes , a land empty of human existence …
Who the fuck are these guys ?
( mimes the headdress )
What 's all this , please ?
No , we do n't want any of your food , thank you very much !
Just put some clothes on ! "
Meanwhile , that winter …
" Excuse me , do you have any food ? ( mimes the headdress ) I love all this , love the idea ! ( chuckles )
Yes , I 'm sorry , we were a bit brusque when we first arrived , we did n't realize you owned the entire country !
But you have no system of ownership ?
Mmm , interesting !
Maybe that can come in useful later …
Food !
Thank you very much , very nice ...
Yes , there 're more of us coming but we 'll keep our promises . "
So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many , many years , and then President Clinton lied about a relationship , and everyone was surprised !
A little naïve , I feel !
Everyone fucking lies !
When we were kids , we lied our heads off !
" I did n't do it !
I was … I was n't … I was dead at the time !
I was on the Moon ! With Steve ! "
And your Dad 's going , " I have n't evenaccused you of anything yet . "
" Oh , all right .
Well … what is … what 's the que … well , I… I… well … what ? "
" Did you brush your teeth ? " " No… yes … what 's correct ?
Anywa … yeah .
I was dead at the time ! "
Then when you 're more mature , you do start telling the truth in odd situations .
" I 'm sorry , I 've broken the glass , I 've broken this … is that expensive ?
I 've broke it .
I 'll pay for that , I 'm sorry . "
And you do that so people in the room might go , " What a strong personality that person has .
I like to have sex with people with strong personalities .
" " And I 've broke other things , I smashed that , and that 's gone , and I 've just thrown the cat out the window and ... "
Oh , yeah !
So , perjury , you know !
If you commit perjury , I do n't care , do n't give a shit .
I do n't think you should because you grade murder .
You have murder one , murder two ; you realize that there can be a difference in the level of murder , so there must be a difference in the level of perjury .
Perjury one is when you 're saying there 's no Holocaust when 10 million people have died in it , and perjury ... nine , is when you said you shagged someone when you did n't .
You know , it 's ...
So yes , so in America , the Native American situation , and slavery did n't do very well .
And in Europe now we 've a new thing : the European Union .
500 million people , 200 languages - no one 's got a clue what there saying to each other !
But it 's the cutting edge of politics , in a very extraordinarily boring way .
Because we 've got 15 different countries in the European Union at the moment and trying to get them to decide anything is a little bit , " Which … wha… is it … oh no , here , back up , you … oh , you 're in with him !
Uh - huh , I 'm with …
Oh , you 're with him ! " you know .
For 18 years we had a government in Britain who was a right - wing government and their policy towards Europe was one of , " No ! No !
No !
I can 't !
( singing with his fingers in his ears ) "
And now we 've got a government whose policy is more , " Bonjour ! Hola !
Tak !
Da ! ( mimes playing banjo ) Ciao ! " Britain needs to be in the driving seat of Europe .
In the driving seat , or in the passenger seat , that 's pretty good , you know , ‘ cause you can take a sleep for a little bit ...
" Are we there yet ? "
At the moment , Britain 's not even in the European car .
We 're outside the car , at the traffic lights , going , " We 're going to clean your windows , all right ? "
Yes .
And we had the Pagans in Britain .
You did n't really have the Pagans here .
You had the Native Americans and it was much more of a warrior , aboriginal - type existence , and ... we had the Pagans .
They were into sex , death , and religion in an interesting night - time telly type of way .
And we had the Druids !
Long white robes , long white beards , early transvestites , did n't get their shaving together ; and they built Stonehenge , one of the biggest henges in the world .
No one 's built a henge like that ever since .
No one knows what the fuck a henge is !
Before Stonehenge , there was Woodhenge and Strawhenge , but a big bad wolf came and blew them down , and three little piggies were relocated to the projects .
But they built Stonehenge , and it's built in an area called Salisbury Plain in the South of England .
The area of Salisbury Plain where they built it is very ( eerie chanting ) , ‘ cause that 's good , you know .
It 's a mystical thing ; build it in a mystical area .
You do n't want to build it in an area that 's ( singing upbeat jazzy tune ) .
No , there you build Trump Tower .
But yeah , so they built it there .
And the stones !
The stones are 50 foot high , 30 foot long , 20 foot deep , and other measurements as well !
And they ’re not from ‘ round there , that 's the amazing thing !
Remember , this is B.C. ( mumbles ) .
This was before the B.C. / A.D. changeover , when everyone was going , “ Is it A.D. yet ? ” ( mimes adjusting watch )
You did n't have to wind your watch back , you had to get a new bloody watch !
“ Oh , it ’s A.D. , is n’t it ?
Fucking ‘ ell ! ”
And the Muslim people going , " A.D ? Who 's he ? "
Yes . ( hearty laugh from audience member )
Good laugh there !
So , yeah , the stones are from 200 miles away , in Wales , so these guys in Wales were obviously carving the rocks out of the very living mountain ...
" Fantastic , building a henge , are we ?
That 's a fantastic idea !
That 's a marvelous religion the Druids have got !
Yes , got a lot of white clothing , I like that .
There we go ! "
And they smashed out a huge stone and then they put tree trunks down to roll it along on .
" All right , walk it along , here we go , here we go . "
" Help you push 'em along ?
It 's not far , is it ? "
And the Druids going , " Heave , everyone , heave !
Well done , everyone , you 're doing very well !
You 'll love it when you see it .
I 've seen some of the drawings already , it 's very special . "
After 200 miles …
" You fucking bastards !
You never told us 200 miles !
200 miles in this day and age - I do n't even know where I live now ! ( sighs )
I wish the Christians would hurry up and get here ! "
And they set all the stones up and the Druids still there tinkering around going , " No , that stone and this one - can we swap them around ? "
So that was the Pagans .
And then the Romans came along with their gods that they had borrowed from the Greeks .
They invaded Greece , conquered them and stole all their gods ... and renamed them with Roman names , ‘ cause the Roman gods before that were kind of crap , you know - Geoff , the god of biscuits , and Simon , the god of hairdos …
You know , they had the God of War , the God of Thunder , the God of Running Around and Jumping , and stuff .
" Oh , let 's get some of those !
Thank God they 've got some gods , ‘ cause we have these crap gods , you know ? "
Yes , the Emperor Fabulous put that into operation and ...
There should have been an Emperor Fabulous , should n't there ?
" I am the Emperor Fabulous ! " " Oh , yes , so you are . "
" Yes .
And my son , Fabulous II , and him … really interesting guy ... “ So yeah , and the Romans went Christian and then we had Christianity for about 1500 years .
You know , Catholicism , we believed in the teachings of Cathol , and everything it stood for ...
Then Henry VIII came along .
Henry VIII , a big , hairy king , and he said to the Pope , the head of the Catholic Church : " Mr. Pope !
I 'm going to marry my first wife , and then I 'm going to divorce her .
Now , I know what you 're going to say but stick with me , my story gets better .
I 'm going to marry my second wife and then I 'm gong to kill her , cut her head off !
Ah , not expecting that , are ya ?
Third wife , gonna shoot her .
Fourth wife , put her into a bag .
Fifth wife , into outer space .
Sixth wife , on a Rotissimat .
Seventh wife , made out of jam .
Eighth wife … ” ( makes sound similar to putting babies on spikes )
And the Pope 's going , ( Italian accent ) " You crazy bugger !
You can't do all this !
What are you , a Mormon ?
You can't marry all these people !
It 's illegal !
You can't do all this !
I am the Pope , I am the head of the Church , I have to keep up … ciao !
I have to keep up standards .
What have you been reading , the gospel according to St. Bastard ? "
So Henry VIII , who was Sean Connery for this film , said : ( imitating Sean Connery )
" Well then , I will set up a new religion in this country .
I will set up the Psychotic Bastard religion . "
And an advisor said , " Why not call it Church of England , Sire ? "
" Church of England , actually .
Much better ...
Even though I ’m Scottish myself . "
So they did !
That 's the birth of Church of England , the birth of the Anglican Church !
Disgusting , eh ?
That 's no basis to start a religion on !
Nothing to do with the Protestant church , I mean , Henry just shagged and killed a lot of women and then stole all the money off the monasteries .
You know , rape and pillage , that is !
The Protestant faith was different .
That started probably around a similar time , but that was about Martin Luther , this German guy who pinned a note on a church door saying , " ' ang on a minute ! "
But in German , so , " Ein Minuten , bitte .
Ich habe einen kleinen Problemo avec diese Religione . "
He was from everywhere .
So yeah and so the Protestant faith was sort of tacked on by Queen Elizabeth I a bit later .
" Oh , principles !
Thank God !
We 've got some principles . "
Nowadays , Church of England is much more , " Hello , how are you ? "
Much more a hobby - type ... " Hello ! "
A lot of people in Church of England have no muscles in their arms .
" Hello , yes ... ( chuckles )
Yes , that 's what I thought .
( chuckles )
Do come in , you 're the only one today !
Now the sermon today is taken from a magazine that I found in a hedge .
Now lipstick colors this season are in the frosted pink area and nail colors to match ...
And this reminds me rather of our Lord Jesus !
Because surely , when Jesus went into Nazareth on a donkey , he must have got tarted up a bit … ”
6 . Jeezy Creezy
“ We will now sing hymn 405 , " Oh God , What on Earth Is My Hairdo All About ? " ( drearily ) " Oh God , what on earth is my hai - airdo ... "
There 's something weird , something phenomenally dreary about Christian singing .
The Gospel singers are the only singers that just go crazy , joyous and it 's fucking amazing !
And it 's born out of kidnapping , imprisonment , slavery , murder , all of that - and this joyous singing !
And the Church of England , well , all those sort of Christian religions , which is mainly Caucasian white people , with all the power and money - enough power and money to make Solomon blush , and they 're all singing , ( dirge - like ) " Oh , God , our hope in ages past , our hope for years ... "
They 're the only groups of people that could sing , " Hallelujah " without feeling like it 's a " Hallelujah ! " thing .
( drearily )
" Hallelujah , hallelujah , joyfully we lark about . "
It 's just not kicking , is it ?
God must be up there going , " What on Earth is that ? "
God , who is James Mason .
( Imitating Mason )
" What on earth is that , Jesus ?
Jesus Christ !
What on earth is that ? "
" Do n't take my name in vain , Dad ! " " Jeezy Creezy , what on Earth is that ? "
" Do n't call me Jeezy Creezy !
Look Dad , I went down there , I taught 'em to be hang out , be groovy , drink a bit of wine , they split into different groups !
You 've got the Catholics , the Protestants , the Jesuits , the Methodists , the Evangelicals , the free Presbyterians , the locked up Presbyterians ... the Quakers , the Bakers , the Candlestick Makers ...
The Mormons are from Mars , Dad , we 've had that checked out . "
" And what does the Holy Ghost think of all this ? "
" Oh , he 's useless , Dad .
Got a sheet over his head these days . " ( spookily ) " Oh ... Holy Ghost !
Holy Ghost ... Holy Ghost ! "
" Holy Ghost , this is not an episode of Scooby Doo ! "
" I would have succeeded if it was n't for those pesky God and Jesus fellows ! "
Cause Shaggy and Scooby are interesting characters .
They 're two of the most major characters in American literature .
Because , and I mean this sincerely , and I think it 's fantastic , because they are cowards .
They are cowardly characters - they believe in cowardice and sandwiches .
And can you think of any in the whole realm of the English - speaking literature that are characters like that ?
Cowardly characters that you identify with .
‘ Cause you identify with them , you 're with them all the way !
" Go Shaggy ! Go Scooby ! "
The rest of the guys who drive the van , " Fuck off ! " Scrappy Doo , a Magnum ... ( shoots )
" Thank you , Granddad . " ( general laughter )
Well remembered .
But Shaggy and Scooby ; the only other character , I mean , tell me now if you can think of any character ‘ cause I 'm willing to learn , but somebody mentioned Falstaff .
A Shakespearean character !
It 's that level of greatness !
Falstaff , you sort of identify with him , but he has a melancholy with him .
But Shaggy and Scooby are upbeat all the time , saying ( imitates Scooby Doo talking )
And you love 'em !
You 're with 'em !
There 's part of us that - Shaggy and Scooby at every stage of the way .
So if you travel around the world , and , you know , ‘ cause your American foreign policy does give you a difficult time to exist around the world , two tricks : one , say you 're Canadian , that helps .
It works in Europe , it 's very good !
And the second is just say , " Shaggy and Scooby . "
And they go " Shaggy and Scooby ! "
International credit card , I think !
So yeah .
Church of England Fundamentals
7 .
So the Pagan religion I do n't know a huge amount about , but it was this earthy thing .
Christianity had split into many different areas - Catholicism still has the fire and brimstone , ( beating drum ) " Row , you bastards ! ”
You know ...
Original sin !
What a hellish idea that is !
People have to go , " Father , bless me for I have sinned , I did an original sin… I poked a badger with a spoon . "
" I 've never heard of that one before !
Five Hail Mary's and two Hello , Dolly's . "
" Oh , all right ... "
" Bless me , Father , for I have slept with my next door neighbor 's wife . "
" Heard it !
I want an original sin . "
" Oh , I 'm terribly sorry ! "
The Anglican faith does n't have that .
You 'll never go , " Vicar , I have done many bad things . "
" Well , so have I . " " What shall I do ? " " Well , drink five Bloody Marys and you wo n't remember . "
Because the Anglican faith had a lack of principles for a long time .
You can't get really headstrong about it .
You can't say , you know , like the Islamic jihads that we hear bout .
We get scared about those Islamic jihads .
I think we do assume that everyone who is into the Islamic religion is having a jihad every other bloody day .
There 's a lot of very relaxed Islamic people , and we got to understand - remember , this is very important - and we do assume that jihads are just like , you know , everyday three jihads are issued by every individual .
It just seems they 're everywhere .
" The fruit shop shortchanged me !
A fucking jihad on them ! "
Bump into someone , say , " Hey !
A fucking jihad on you ! "
" How many jihads have you got going now , Dad ? "
" Well , 24 .
God , it 's difficult to keep up with them ! "
I just do n't think that 's happening .
But you can't do that in Church of England , you can't say , " You must have tea and cake with the Vicar , or you die ! "
You can't have extreme points of view , you know .
The Spanish Inquisition would n't have worked with Church of England .
" Talk !
Will you talk ! "
" But it hurts ! " " Well , loosen it up a bit , will you ?
Fine ... "
‘ Cause that 's what it would be .
" Tea and cake or death ?
Tea and cake or death ?
Tea and cake or death ! "
Students with beards , ( mimes demonstrating with picket signs )
" Tea and cake or death !
Tea and cake or death !
Little Red Cookbook !
Little Red Cookbook ! " ‘ Cause , " Cake or death ? "
That 's a pretty easy question .
Anyone could answer that .
" Cake or death ? " " Eh , cake please . "
" Very well !
Give him cake ! "
" Oh , thanks very much .
It 's very nice . "
" You !
Cake or death ? "
“ Uh , cake for me , too , please . "
" Very well !
Give him cake , too !
We 're gonna run out of cake at this rate .
You !
Cake or death ? "
" Uh , death , please .
No , cake !
Cake !
Cake , sorry .
Sorry ... "
" You said death first , uh - uh , death first ! "
" Well , I meant cake ! " " Oh , all right .
You 're lucky I'm Church of England ! "
Cake or death ? "
" Uh , cake please . "
" Well , we 're out of cake !
We only had three bits and we did n't expect such a rush .
So what do you want ? "
" Well , so my choice is ' or death ’ ?
I ’ll have the chicken then , please .
“ Taste of human , sir .
Would you like a white wine ?
There you go , thank you very much . ” “ Thank you for flying Church of England , cake or death ? "
“ I asked for the vegetarian . "
" Ah , yes , the vegetarian , yes !
There we go , Mr. Hitler .
There we go ...
Like a bit of wine ?
Thank you very much ... you Nazi shithead ! "
So , yeah .
So the Pagan religion had very big festivals , remember , on Easter and Christmas .
The Christian religion came along and had very big festivals , at Easter and Christmas .
Jesus died on one and was born on the other .
( doubting sounds )
‘ Cause Jesus I do think did exist , and he was , I think , a guy who had interesting ideas in the Gandhi - type area , in the Nelson Mandela - type area , you know , relaxed and groovy ; and the Romans thought , " Relaxed and groovy ?!
No , no , no , no , no ! "
So they murdered him .
And kids eat chocolate eggs , because of the color of the chocolate , and the color of the ... wood on the cross .
Well , you tell me !
It 's got nothing to do with it , has it ?
You know , people going , " Remember , kids , " the kids who 're eating the chocolate eggs , " Jesus died for your sins . "
" Yeah , I know , it 's great ! ” “ No , no no , it 's bad , it 's bad ! ” “ No , it 's bad !
It 's very bad .
It 's terrible !
Whatever you want , just keep giving me these eggs . "
And the bunny rabbits !
Where do they come into the crucifixion ?
There were no bunny rabbits up on the hill going , " Hey , what , are you going to put those crosses in our warrens ?
We live below this hill , all right ? "
Bunny rabbits are for shagging , eggs are for fertility .
It 's a festival - it 's the spring festival !
Christmastime , you know , Jesus born to a big jolly guy in a red jacket .
" Ho , ho , ho !
Ho , ho , ho , baby Jesus !
And what would you like for Christmas ? "
" Peace on Earth and goodwill towards men . "
" Well , what about a clockwork train ? "
" Oh , yes , much better .
Forget peace on earth , I do n't care . ”
And , you know , the Christmas fir tree , there 's none of them in Nazareth .
The “ partridge in a pear tree ” song was not sung at the Last Supper .
They were n't there going , " ' And a partridge in a pear tree .
Five goold rings !'
Come on , loosen up , Judas . "
" Oh , all right ... " " ' On the seventh day of Christmas ...’
Judy , come on , Judy , loosen up . "
" Do n't call me Judy , I 've told you ! "
" Oh !
Can you lend us a fiver , Judy ?
I 'm a bit short . "
" All right , lads , Leonardo da Vinci 's painting the picture , so everyone get your positions , here we go . " " Jesus , why are you doing the big arms thing ? "
" Well , I do n't know …
I just thought I 'd do a big arms thing , I do n't know . "
" Well , I 'm going to do a big arms thing as well . "
" Yeah , me too !
I 'll call that the big arms ... "
" Look , we can't all do big arms !
We 'll look like a squadron of Spitfires , for fuck 's sake !
I 'll do big arms and you just look at me and go , ' Ooh , he 's doing big arms . ' " " All right . "
" Leonardo , have you got that one ?
Have you got the painting ?
All right , now a fun one as well , ‘ member ... ( mocking laughter ) " 8 . God Attack The Queen
That “ Partridge in a pear tree ” song , the only bit we like of it is that , ( singing ) " Five gold rings ! "
People go berserk at that point !
People come running in from other rooms , ( singing ) " Five gold rings ! "
The rest of it , we do n't know ; above that , it 's just , ( singing , uncertain ) " Twelve …monkeys mating , eleven … donkeys dancing , ten pigmies farming , nine … socks … a swimming …( certain ) five gold rings ! "
This is a human thing .
We only like to learn a little bit of a song .
We can't be bothered , yeah .
The American national anthem I 've noticed is a bit hazy in the middle !
‘ Cause it starts strong and you finish strong , but the middle bit 's a bit , ( singing ) " And fish in the sky , and a big … monkey pie ... "
I 've seen guys up there , halfway through , just losing it .
" What the fuck is it ? " " I came second , I 'm from Turkey !
I do n't know !
Would you like some furniture ? ”
But in Britain we do n't win many gold medals at the Olympics … because we 've chosen not to !
It 's a political statement !
Because we hate our national anthem .
Because it 's “ God Save the Queen , ” you see ?
“ God Save the Queen . ”
Now the Queen lives in a very big house , she has barbed wire outside , and people with guns in front of that .
That 's one saved fucking queen , I 'll tell you !
That 's the problem !
She 's overly saved !
She has no idea of the struggle of human existence .
We have to work for a living , raise a family … we do n't have nannies all running around the place .
It 's what you 've got to do in your life , you know ?
So it 's " God Save the Queen . "
No !
It 's too saved .
It 's " God Attack the Queen , " that 's what it should be !
( singing )
" God attack the Queen , send big dogs after her that bite her bum .
Let them chase after her and rip her knickers off ... "
That 'd be fantastic !
Then she'd have to fight the crazy dog with a handbag with a brick inside of it .
" Crazy dog !
Crazy dog ! "
" Arrgghh , kill the Queen ! " " No - crazy dog ! "
And maybe she 'd kill the crazy dog and everyone in Britain would go , " Hey , fair play to the Queen , - killed the crazy dog . "
And the Queen would have self - respect for the first time in her life !
Yes .
It would work .
It 'd be fantabulous .
But in America , you win the gold medal , I ’ve seen you at the Olympics .
You stand there , hand on the hearts …
You and the Roman Empire are the only people who ’ve ever done that , so be very careful !
‘ Cause you ’re the new Roman Empire , you realize that ?
There ’s no one else going !
‘ Cause the only other big power is China , I supposed , but they ’re going , “ Ah… oh … ” kind of thing .
1.000 million , but they ’re all just getting ready .
But you ’re the Roman Empire , yeah !
So you ’ve got vomitoriums and orgies to look forward to …
Let the President lead the way !
‘ Cause no one cares in America and … I do n’t know .
In Europe , we ’re just watching you , and going , “ What are you doing ? ” ‘ Cause in France they would n’t care , and in Britain , they ’d get shot .
If the Prime Minister had done something , everyone would go , ( mumbling sheepishly ) .
“ Can the government say what was happening on the recent affair with the Prime Minister ? ” “ Well , the government would like to say ( more mumbling ) . ”
“ Thank you . ”
But you do sing the national anthem - I 've seen you singing the national anthem , and I 've worked out how to do it .
If you 're lost in the middle of it and you 're singing the words , becausethe Tannoy systems at big stadiums , you know , it does n't matter wherever you 're singing it .
All that people care about is the look , because there 's figures on this .
70 % of what people react to is the look , you know , it 's how you look ; and 20 % is about how you sound ; and only 10 % is what you say .
So if you look good and sound good , just up there going , ( sings gibberish to a few bars of The Star Spangled Banner )
Big mouth !
( more gibberish to a few more bars )
The eyes ! ( more gibberish )
Use that !
( more gibberish )
And keep confirming and denying things .
( more gibberish , up to the words ' Star spangled banner yet wave ' ) Everyone will go wild !
Oh , yeah , oh yeah !
Action Transvestite 9 . I 'm an action transvestite , actually , as well as being an executive transvestite .
I 'm an action transvestite !
‘ Cause it 's running , jumping , climbing trees , you know .
So I went snowboarding when I was in Aspen .
Andyou look cool when you snowboard , you just look cool , you know ?
You can not but look cool ‘ cause you 're nailed to a fucking plank of wood .
As long as you 're vertical , you 're going , " Hey , yes ! " ( swishing sounds )
Skiing , you can be kinda… ( wobbles about ) .
There 's a lot of that stuff , but this is just ( speeding sounds ) .
And there 's only two positions in snowboarding :
One is looking cool ; the second is DEAD !
Right ?
Pow !
So I was looking cool and I was going 50 , 60 thousand miles an hour !
‘ Cause you have no idea !
The police never pull you over .
They never , ( makes siren noises )
" Ah , fucking ‘ ell ! ( swishing sound to stop )
‘ Cause the police need to be able to walk up to you in that kind of condescending way .
" Ok , Sonny Jim , what do you think you 're doing , eh ? "
And they can't do that on a snowboard , because they have to go ... ( jumping with legs together , then wobbling to keep vertical )
" Your taillight 's out , and … you 've got no… knees . "
So anyway , that did n't happen .
No , I was just going fast , and I fell , and I smashed my head , and ... my head was fine .
But my neck went , " Oh , no .
Oh , no , thank you . "
So I had to go see a chiropractor in New York , and they 're different to osteopaths , chiropractors , because of the spelling .
Of course , they 're both very powerful figures on the Scrabble board , though ...
" Chiropractor ... chiropractor ... chiropractor ... 93 letters , chiropractor . "
And they crack your bones , that 's what they do , they crack your bones !
And they take x-rays , but it ’s pointless , because whatever is wrong with you …
" You 've got a bad back , I 'm gonna crack your bones . ”
“ You 've got diphtheria , I 'm gonna crack your bones . ”
“ Your head 's come off !
I 'm gonna crack your bones . ”
“ It looks like your mother !
I 'm going to crack your bones . "
And then , when they crack your bones it goes ( painful sigh ) and then , “ Ahh ! ” but not sort of ( reliefsigh ) , but ( disconcerted sigh ) .
All the way up your spine , " Crack your bones , crack your bones , crack your bones . "
And they sort of arrange you into a nice , comfortable ( mimes chiropractor ’s actions )
And sometimes it does n't crack !
Sometimes it just goes , " ____ " .
Then they pull a mallet from their belt and they try to make the noise .
“ Make the noise !
I live for the noise ... "
And they do your head as well , around here , and they get it into a nice position , and you 're thinking , " Where the… ?
No , I do n't think it 's supposed to go around that ...! "
In the end , you just trust them , you trust them .
They could havetheir fingers in your nostrils , one foot on the back of your underpants , and they 're pushing your spine away with a broom .
" Well , what 's this one about ? " " I have no idea . " ( sings fanfare )
" Wherever he falls , there shall he be buried . "
Heimlich Gesture 10 .
Also , if you 're in a restaurant and you 're choking to death , you can say the magic words , " Heimlich maneuver . "
If you 're just coughing and got some , you say , " Heimlich maneuver , " and all will be well .
The trouble is , it 's very difficult to say " Heimlich maneuver " when you 're choking to death .
Yeah .
( mumbling and coughing )
" Your hymen ’s been removed ? " " No no . ( more mumbling and coughing )
" You need it removed ?
Right … " I do n't know how you remove a hymen ...
But yeah .
No , Heimlich maneuver , developed by Dr. Heimlich who woke up one night , obviously , and went , " A fist , a hand , hoocha hoocha hoocha ... lobster !
Yes , Hilda !
Hilda !
Wake up , Hilda ! "
" Oh , what is it , Dr. Heimlich ? "
" Why are you calling me Dr. Heimlich ?
I 'm you 're husband , for fuck 's sake !
Loosen up , do n't be so bloody Prussian . "
" Well , what is it , Günther ? " " I have invented a maneuver ! " " What are you , a bloody tank commander now ? "
" No !
My name is going to be famous in restaurants ! "
I do n't think he actually did it that way .
I do n't think it was ( snaps fingers ) a wing and a prayer , I think he must have experimented .
He was German , organized .
( German accent )
" Ok , Hans , I want you to swallow this golf ball ... " ( choking and coughing ) “ I cannot breath . "
“ I know you cannot breath .
I will now make you breath with the cunning use of ... " ( muffled shot ) “ I still cannot breath . "
" Ok , maybe not , maybe this will … ( muffled shot )
“ Jesus fucking Christ ! ” " Ok , then maybe with a frying pan ... "
Pow ! ( Hans coughing throughout , as Dr Heimlich smacks him )
" Must be a combination .
No , ok … " " Ok , two frying pans … Frying pan in the bollocks …
Bollocks stop… " Frying pan … " ( Hans collapses to thefloor )
" Oh , he 's dead . "
Other doctors are going , " How 's it coming along , Dr. Heimlich ? "
" Well , not very well at the moment .
It 's not really a maneuver at the moment .
It 's more of a gesture . "
As the National Rifle Association says , it 's not guns that kill people - it 's maneuvers .
I 'm a film nut as well , complete nut on films .
I used to break into film studios ; there 's a studio called Pinewood Studios near London , and I broke in there when I was 15 .
And I crept around , creeping , creeping , and hoping that some guy with a big cigar might go , " Hey !
A creeping kid !
For my film , ' The Creeping Kid ! '
You , you 're in ! "
" Ah , me ?
Uh , yeah ... "
But no , it did n't happen !
They were filming tall , angular ... veterinarians that day ... I did n't have my bag …
And my hand up a horse 's ... anyway .
So yes !
But we 've got known in Britain for making the smaller films , you know .
Recently , we 've been pulling out of that into the more “ Trainspotting ” area , but the smaller films , they 're kind of “ a room with a view with a staircase and a pond ” - type movies .
Films with very fine acting , but the drama is rather sort of subsued and - subsumed or - a word like that .
Sub - something or another .
You know , just folded in and everything 's people opening doors .
" Oh , I 'm - oh , what ?
Well , I ’ve - oh . "
" What is it , Sebastian ?
I 'm arranging matches . "
" Well , I - I thought you - ... I 'd better go . "
" Yes , I think you 'd better had . " ( sings morose melody )
And you can't eat popcorn to that !
You 're going ( mimes trying to eat popcorn but getting frustratedand sighs ) .
Whereas if the film did any little bit of business in America , if the film did some decent bit of business , then Hollywood would take it , and they 'd remake it , and they 'd up the budget by 50 million and it'd be called , “ The Room With A View of Hell ! ” “ Staircase of Satan ! ” “ Pond of Death . ”
And have people open the door , going , " You 're fucking in here all the time !
All the time you 're in here with the fucking matches !
In here with the fucking matches !
You 're fucking doing and fucking ( clucking ) " " You do n't talk to me that way !
You do n't talk to me that way !
You fuck my wife ?
You fuck my wife ?
You fuck my wife ?
You fuck my wife ?
You fuck my wife ? "
" I am your wife ! "
" That does n't matter !
That does n't matter !
I say again , you fuck my wife ? "
" All right , yes , I fucked your wife .
I am your wife , and I fucked her . " " ( Nonsensical ) fucking matches - I can't get 'em ...
I 'm going to drive around town and put babies on spikes . " ( sounds of babies sliding on the spikes )
“ Oh , no !
Space monkeys are attacking ! ”
A whole new part of the film that was n't in the original !
( mimics battle sounds )
" Damn , its jammed ! " ( dialing on mobile )
“ Janine , I love you really , even though you fucked my wife ... " ( big explosion ) ( mimics eating and drinking everything in sight while watching )
" It ’s a fucking handbag .
With a brick in it !
It 's the Queen !
Do n't know who that is ... ”
Yeah .
British Bad Guys 11 .
We play bad guys in Hollywood movies because of the Revolutionary War .
Yes , there ’s no two ways about it .
And the French , who were on your side in the Revolutionary war , they play more esoteric characters .
They have characters who turn up and go , " My name is Pierre !
I come from Paris .
I ’ve come to have sex with your family . "
" Help yourself ... because of the debt of honor to General Lafayette . "
You know your own history , right ?
You do n't know who he is , do you ?!
What was it ?
The Spanish - American War ?
The French Banana War ?
What ?
The Revolutionary War !
Hung out with Washington .
Lafayette .
Street named after him in New York .
Forget it !
But we play bad guys , like take “ The Empire Strikes Back , ” from the “ Star Wars trilogy . ”
The Death Star !
The Death Star… just full of British actors opening doors and going , " Oh , I 'm - oh , oh ... "
" What is it , Lieutenant Sebastian ? "
" It 's just the Rebels , sir .
They 're here . "
" My God , man !
Do they want tea ? "
" No , I think they 're after something more than that , sir .
I do n't know what it is , but they 've brought a flag . " ( cracks up )
" Damn , that 's dash cunning of them !
Ah , Lord Vader ! " ( heavy breathing and in a deep voice ) “ Uh , hello . " ( cracks up again )
‘ Cause he was only impressive ‘ cause he had that James Earl Jones voice .
( deep voice ) ” I am Vader .
The Force is strong with you . "
If he had a much more , ( camp Cockney accent ) “ Hello .
Look , I 'm Lord Vader and just pay a - bloody - ttention , all right ?
Luke , Luke , the Force is strong with you . "
" Is it ? " " Yeah . "
" Well , who told you that ? "
" Some bloke !
Yeah , he said the Force was really rather strong with you . "
" Well , how strong ? " " Uh , as strong as a small pony . "
" Oooh , that 's quite strong , that is . "
The film would never have fucking worked , would it ?
12 . The Great Escape “ The Great Escape , ” now there ’s a film .
A lot of British actors , I ’m British , so link up there .
Steve McQueen , action hero ; action transvestite , linkup there .
The story is based on a true story about 76 British prisoners , I think , who escaped from the prisoner of war camp in Silesia , in Poland .
They ’re all experts at escaping ; they ’ve escaped from lots of other prisons , and they ’re all put together , so they say , “ Hey , let ’s work together . ”
Steve McQueen plays the American guy who is dropped into British films in order to make them sell … in America , that is , because you ’d go , “ Oh , I ’m not gonna see it , it ’s full of British guys , and what the fuck do I know about British things ? ” I was in … where was I ?
I did a gig in Memphis , and this guy came up to me , and it was fucking weird .
This guy had two kids , and he said , “ You British ? ” I went , “ Yeah , ” but wanted to go , “ No , I ’m from Mars , actually . ” “ You British ? ” “ Yeah ” And he said , “ Hey , kids !
Jimmy Sue , Bobby Will , Fishy Bob ! ”
No , he said , “ Talk British to my kids ! ” I said , “ No , I ’m not gonna talk British to your kids , you do n’t talk … it ’s English ! ‘ ello ? ”
And the kids were , ( shaky accent ) “ No , Dad , we wanna go see … ” ( Slow , slurry )
“ No , Dad , we wanna go see the man emasculating a donkey over there . ”
“ Talk British to my kids !
Talk , or I ’ll get my arsenal of weapons out ! ”
So that was fun .
So yes , “ The Great Escape , ” yes .
It ’s all true , and Steve McQueen is there to make it sell , and he ’s cool , I ’m totally into him , I ’m a very big fan of Steve McQueen – “ Bullitt . ”
Fog… no fucking fog in “ Bullitt , ” does it ?
That film , “ The Rock , ” when they ’re all out in Alcatraz , they go , “ We ca n’t send this nuclear weapon to San Francisco , we ca n’t fucking find it !
It ’s covered in fog !
“ All right , we ’ll have to get Oakland , then . ” ( people stirring )
Oh , fight , fight , fight ! ( in sing - song ) Oakland , San Francisco , Oakland , East Bay !
You ’re not called West Bay , are you ?
No , you ’re just ( mockingly ) “ The City . ”
“ Are you going to “ The City ” today ?
“ I might go to “ The City . ” And Oakland is just a collection of houses , is it ?
So … so yes , “ The Great Escape . ”
In “ The Great Escape , ” they say , “ Look , we ’re gonna do the biggest escape in the history of people escaping from things they should n’t . “ “ Fantastic . ”
And Steve is n’t really a part of this , he ’s just hanging out , playing baseball , runs with the van , does an escape , gets caught , covered in mud , and stuff like that ; but the British are working away , they ’re digging three tunnels – Charley , Barley and Farley .
No , four tunnels , Charley , Barley , Farley and Wally ; no , five tunnels , Charley , Barley , Farley and Wally … Nobody expects the Spanish tunnel king !
And they ’re digging away , and there ’s people in charge of shoveling it up , people putting breathing apparatus in , putting things on trolleys , lighting apparatus ; people disguising the entrance of the tunnel so it looks like a kibbutz or something ; people saying , “ I ’ve turned my uniform inside out , turned up my collar , I ’ve turned my buttocks into a hat , and I now look like a German officer … but I have no buttocks . ”
“ Jawol , mein Herr .
So habe ich linge wenige .
Locherbekommen . ”
“ Well done , Simpkins .
That ’s a line from Monty Python , is n’t it ? ” Donald Pleasance is doing forgeries on bits of tin can with a bit of jam .
Clang !
And on the day of the escape , they ’re all there , and Steve McQueen has joined up in the escape , and the British have trilby hats on , overcoats , canoe , a bit of a rabbit …
And Steve ’s just there in jeans and a T - shirt , disguised as an American man !
He romps out , jumps in a motorbike , knocks a guy off , and within 15 minutes , he ’s in the borders of Switzerland .
This is from Poland !
And if you do n’t know the geography , it goes Poland , Czechoslovakia , Holland , Venezuela , Africa , the Hanging Gardens of Babylon … and then Switzerland , where the Nazi gold comes from .
( imitates people muttering about Nazi gold ) I love the way you do that !
Whenever I say something slightly weird , you all mutter .
“ I ’m catching the ferry right now ! ” Anyway , so yes , so Steve ’s just damn cool , he jumps on the motorbike , and as soon as he gets on , the music cuts to ( sings action film theme ) .
The British are all down at the train station .
“ Ca n’t we do a motorbike ?
Damn ! ”
“ Yes , a train ticket to …
Ich möchte einen ticket to nach …
London .
No , not London !
Calais !
That ’s nice and Nazi , is n’t it ? ” “ Ihre Pässe , bitte . ” “ My passport ?
All right . ” ( clangs ) ( clanging continues )
“ It ’s a bit clangy and a bit jammy … ” “ Yes , I ’m from the steel and jam area of Stuttgart . ”
The British are getting hassled , and Steve is away , and he gets to Switzerland .
Remember , Jim Rockford nicks an airplane in that film , and he flies to Switzerland , and he gets about 20 miles away from it in an airplane !
Steve is on a fucking motorbike and he gets there !
Before him !
What ’s he got in the fucking motorbike , jet wings ?
I dunno !
So yeah , all the British are getting hassled , the Gestapo are after them , people are on rowing boats , some on bicycles , one on a rabbit , in a kangaroo , you know , in pogo stick .
Steve ’s motor biking away …
Steve ’s over the first line of bared wire , “ Go , Steve , go ! ” Into the second line of barbed wire …
Nearly makes it , does n’t quite , but lives to tell the tale .
Meanwhile , the British are all rounded up and shot in the head !
Now what signals is this giving to kids from the different countries , Britain and America ?
American kids watching Steve , saying , ( shaky accent ) “ Steve , you ’re damn cool !
Yeah , I ’m fucking with you , man , all the way !
Absolutely !
Lived to tell the tale , good on you ! ”
You know ?
I do n’t know why he ’s Australian , but anyway …
“ Absolutely .
G’day . ”
But we ’re just watching it and thinking , “ We ’re fucked !
All that planning , the logistics , everything , and we get fucking blown away . ”
Chip on my - fish and chips on my shoulder .
13 . Engelbert and JFK And Engelbert Humperdinck !
Yes , he was the man .
That 's not his real name ; he 's from Britain , but that 's not his name .
There 's very few Humperdincks in Britain .
He was born Gerry Dorsey , not Engelbert Humperdinck .
His parents were not Mr. and Mrs. Humperdinck .
They never said , " What shall we call our son so he does not get the shit kicked out of him at school ? "
“ We shall call him Engelbert ! " " Good , that 'll work ! "
No , his name was Gerry Dorsey , and he released songs as Gerry Dorsey , songs such as ( mumbles ) which did n't work ‘ cause nobody could hear what he was saying .
And then his managers , obviously , said , " We 're going to change your name , Gerry !
It 's the name that 's the problem . "
And his name changed from Gerry Dorsey to Engelbert Humperdinck .
I mean , I just wanted to be in the room when they were working that one through .
" Zingelbert Bembledack !
Yingybert Dambleban !
Zangelbert Bingledack !
Wingelbert Humptyback !
Slut Bunwalla ! "
" What ? ! "
" All right , Kringelbert Fishtybuns ! Steviebuns Bottrittrundle ... "
" No , Gerry Dorsey , I like Gerry Dorsey ! " " No , we ca n't do it ...
Who we got ?
Zingelbert Bembledack , Tringelbert Wangledack , Slut Bunwalla , Klingybun Fistelvase , Dindlebert Zindledack , Gerry Dorsey , Engelbert Humptyback , Zengelbert Bingledack , Engelbert Humperdinck , Vingelbert Wingledanck … "
" No , no , go back one .
Go back one .
" Engelbert Humperdinck . "
That 's it . "
And it worked !
But he 's dead now , you hear that ?
Yeah , today , on CNN .
I heard it as I was just coming out .
Very weird , ‘ cause Frank Sinatra was just recently as well , was n't it ?
Yeah .
Hmm .
No , this is what I heard on the telly when I coming out .
( inhales deeply and exhales )
It 's not true , heh .
( exhales )
No , it is true .
Yeah , he was L.A. Something happened .
He was in L.A. , and that 's all I caught … it was just before I came out .
So , yeah .
( exhales )
No , it is true .
No , he was in a car in L.A. driving along and something hit him or something like that .
( about 25 seconds of pauses and audience laughter , as Eddie nods and denies the truth of this statement )
No no , no , he 's all right , he 's all right !
He 's fine !
He 's cooking , he 's jumping , he 's doing his thing in L.A. - he 's absolutely fine .
How do I know ?
I do n't know , I do n't know !
I think he's got a cold , that 's what they said .
No , a tan , that 's it !
But back in the 60s , though , back in the 60s , President Kennedy became the President of the United States of America , and he we went to Berlin , stood on the Berlin wall and he said , " People of Berlin . .. " ( hearty American ) ” People of Berlin . "
I can't do an impression of President Kennedy , so this is ... " People of Berlin . Amy dumped … " No , James Mason playing him ... ( imitates Mason ) “ People of Berlin , I have come to you to tell you something about the American states .
I sound a bit like God , do n't I ?
Yes .
But I have come to say to you that every free citizen of the world is a citizen of Berlin .
And I wish to say to you , ' Ich bin ein Berliner . ' "
And the crowd went fucking wild !
Trouble is , " Ich bin ein Berliner " means " I am a donut , " and ...
This is true , and this is what he said , he said " I am a donut ! "
And , as I say , 70 % of how you look , 20 % of how you sound , only 10 % is what you say .
He said " I am a donut " and they went wild !
Because " Ich bin Berliner " is " I am a Berliner . "
But " Ich bin ein Berliner , " is - that 's the name of a donut they have there .
And it 's like going to Frankfurt : " I am a Frankfurter ! "
" Yeah , we 've heard about that one , Jackie . "
Hamburg - " I am a Hamburger , too ! "
Lucky he did n't do a tour of Germany , eh ?
" I am a Hamburger , a Frankfurter , and a donut . "
But the people in Berlin must 've gone , " What did he say ? "
" He said he was a donut ! " " I thought he said he was a donut too ! "
" So what does that mean ? " " It 's a slang !
It 's American !
He 's a donut !
He 's a fucking donut .
Fucking donut , a fucking donut , a fucking donut .
He 's a fucking donut .
I think that 's what it must mean . ”
“ What do you think , Dr. Heimlich ? " " Huh ? ( coughing throughout ) I do n't … I do n't know , I have swallowed a football and I can ' tget it out .
Can you perform my maneuver on me , the me maneuver ? "
" Huh ? " " Hilda , Hilda , get me a map of everything . "
He also made a speech about space .
President Kennedy said , " By the end of this decade , I have decided to put a man on the surface of the Moon . "
At the same time , our Prime Minister in Britain , Sir Dingly Dang ...
You do n't know anyway , do you ?
You have no idea !
It was Sir Fritz Bunwalla .
Engelbert Slaptyback , who was Prime Minister at the time , and he stood up and he said , " By the end of this decade , I have decided to put a man on the surface of the Earth ! "
And so he did .
But it was kinda weird , ’ cause we could n't do the space race .
We had no money , you know , rationing did n't stop ' til the year 2001 !
I still have n't even lived that long .
But anyway , we just did n't have any money .
So you were getting space rockets , testing them , sending a cat , dog , a fish , a monkey up into space .
The fish was interesting !
We did n't have enough money to put a man in a track suit up a ladder !
I mean , I would 've been there , " Go man , go ! " " I 'm going , I 'm going !
' Ang on ! " " Just hang on to the ladder ! "
" Hello , Swindon , I am here .
Swindon , can you hear me ? "
" Swindon here , we are monitoring you on our instruments at the moment , we 've got you on a tuba . ”
“ There should be a bigger laugh for that joke , I think . "
" Yeah , I can't quite understand it ; I thought it was really funny .
Swindon , a knackered , kind of Fresno town . "
" They do n't seem to be going for it . ”
“ They 're obviously bastards . "
" Anyway , Swindon , I 'm nearly at the Moon … actually , that 's a bit of an understatement , that one .
Have you got another big ladder , another bit of ladder ?
I do n't think we 're quite at the Moon yet , but I can see right over the top of the houses !
Fantastic ! " Moon Monsters 14 .
But they went to the Moon , Neil Armstrong , Buzz Aldrin , and Michael Collins , going round and round , working out the IRA thing .
And Neil stepped on the Moon and said , " One small step for man , a giant leap for mankind . "
Good line but not his line , I do n't think … it did n't feel like his line , you know ?
I bet that was just given to him and he was coming down the steps going , " Small step for man , a giant leap for mankind .
Small step for man , a giant leap for mankind .
Do n't get it wrong , Neil .
Do n't fuck it up .
Here we go .
I 'm a small man with a giant big - shit !...
One man , small giant , two ... two mens ...
What was it ? "
‘ Cause you gotta say something , you can't go down to the Moon and go , " Oh , it 's all sticky !
It 's covered in jam ! "
You can't land on the Moon and go , " Fucking ‘ell , I 've been in that spacecraft ( stretching noises )
Right , I need a piss . "
You can't land on the Moon and wind down the window and go , " Is this - Sea of Tranquility ?
Sea of Tranquility ?
Is this Sea of Tranquility ?
Sea of Tranquility ?
There 's no one around ! ”
But he had a sense of humor so he should have used it , ‘ cause there was that lunar module there – a fixed camera , just fixed , not panning left or right , just stationary .
So he could 've been there saying , " Hi , people on the Moon .
As you can see , the Sea of Tranquility here , there 's the mountains in the distance , there 's the Earth !
There , you 're looking back up at yourselves there .
Over to my right , I can see a fucking monster !
There 's a monster behind me !
( screaming )
Oh no , help !
Get off my leg ! "
Buzz Aldrin in a monster outfit ( growling )
Neil doing a close - up with …
" He 's got me , Houston .
The monster 's got me !
He wants cash !
He 's got my hand up behind my back .
I think he knows jiu - jitsu !
He wants cash for the release of my life .
Send a million … - two million dollars , leave it in a bag by the Sea of Tranquility .
I do n't know , the North Shore !
What the fucking ‘ ell ...? "
Oh , it would have worked , would n't it ?
But they went to the Moon and they brought back rock .
They brought back rock !
Trouble is , we ’ve got rock .
That was the one thing we did n’t need , was n’t it ?
“ Rock , Neil ?
I do n’t know whether you looked at the planet before you took off , but it ’s made of fucking rock ! ”
“ But it ’s Moon rock … ” “ Oh , fucking hell !
This is Earth rock , Neil , come on !
( mocking ) Earth rock with special minerals .
It ’s rock , is n’t it ?
Have you heard ?
On the stock market , rock ’s gone up three points !
No , it has n’t , has it ?
‘ Cause it ’s fucking rock !
We wanted diamonds , or sherbet or a squirrel with a gun ! ”
So they went to the Moon and they found rock .
They ’ve found ice as well recently , so it ’s rocks and ice .
What an exciting planet !
Obviously a party planet .
And they went to mars and found more rock , but it ’s red this time , so …
We ’ve got the most boring solar system I ’ve ever heard of …!
And I ’ve never heard of any !
And no monsters , either !
Not one fucking monster has turned up in the history of looking .
‘ Cause we ’ve been ready for monsters , we ’ve been waiting for them for so long !
Pictures of monsters , stories of monsters , documentaries of monsters , films , programs , television things - not one fucking monster !
Nothing , not even a squirrel with a flute has turned up .
( sings jaunty flute tune ) “ Monster !
Very small monster ! ”
“ Get the flute off him , that ’s where he gets his power ! ” I think the world needs monsters , I think we need them because we ’ve got this thing of …
Humans are very good with a little bit of adversity , not too much , but enough .
It ’s like in the Cold War - World War II is better , the Cold War was just a negative thing .
World War II had everyone pulling together against something , and there was some positive stuff that came out of it .
Now that the Cold War is gone , everything is loose and free .
Everyone ’s a bit obsessed with upstairs , have you noticed ?
All the films lately , “ The X Files , ” “ Independence Day , ” “ Armageddon , ” “ Deep Impact , ” “ Deep Throat … ”
All these things .
We ’re all looking upstairs now .
And in America , terrorism is starting to happen .
You know , the Oklahoma City bombing , which everyone was sure was some Islamic fundamentalist thing , and you found out it was some white guys from nearby .
That must have freaked you out something rotten !
“ These guys from around the corner ?
They look like us !
Oh , fuck ! ” Yeah , bit of a weird one .
And the Aryan supremacists have come around with their ideas of “ get some chemical weapons and kill people . ”
And you say , “ What ’s the plan ?
What does that achieve ? ”
“ Nothing , really . ”
And it wo n’t work – Aryan supremacists , white supremacists , black supremacists , blue supremacists - especially the blue supremacists , they ’ll never work , because if you get the same people from the same genetic group to all intermarry , hello ?
Cousins marrying , hello ??
IQ down the toilet !
Hitler was trying this ’ first generation of Nazis would have been , “ Sieg Heil ! ” Second generation , “ Sieg Heil … ” Third generation , “ Er… Sieg … er… I ’ve no idea . ”
The FBI picked up a guy who was trying to access anthrax through the mail .
Who the fuck do you write to for anthrax ?!
Is there a big desk , with people going , “ More requests for anthrax ?
Thank you , Jeff . ” ( mimes typing )
“ Dear Mrs. Stevens , thank you for your request for anthrax , one of the most dangerous chemical weapons known to humankind .
We have pleasure in rushing you three buckets of anthrax for your own personal use only … ”
But this guy was doing it fraudulently , he must have been a bit cunning .
( mimes typing again )
“ Dear Sir , my name is Daisy , I am a cow .
I wish to take my own life , so please send me three buckets of anthrax , as anthrax is designed to kill cattle and I want to end it all right now .
P.S. : I can not shoot myself as I have no opposable thumbs . ”
Pedigree dogs and mongrel dogs are proof of this experiment .
Pedigree dogs are all inbred , you take the grandmother and the great - nephew , ( mimes forcing copulation )
“ There you go … ”
And they ’re all next to each other in the genetic pool , so they look kinda good , but they just go , “ Er… woof … ”
“ And what do you think about the latest doggie situation ? ” “ Er… w - woof … I like meeting other dogs . ”
Whereas the mongrel dog with a black patch over a white face , furry on top and sleek down below because a lion shagged a whippet … that ’s the one !
That ’s the one that goes on and nicks your credit cards and drives to the Bahamas !
15 . Puberty
But I 'm going to finish up today by talking about puberty !
Which is a , kind of spiky subject , but it 's interesting , because there 's things like these kids that started shooting people , which you 've had in America .
Because guns do n't kill people , it 's just that certain noise they make .
It 's just a bullet ripping through peoples ' bodies .
That 's what kills people !
Yeah , have guns but do n't allow any ammunition .
There !
We got it !
We got it sorted !
And they just go ( mimes throwing gun in frustration )
So , yeah .
But puberty was … well , before puberty , at school , I did n't tell kids I was a transvestite ‘ cause I thought they might kill me with sticks , you know ?
" Why ? "
" I do n't know , he said a word we did n't understand .
And he won at Scrabble with it . "
So , yes .
So most transvestites fancy girls , and you can tell people this .
" Yes , most transvestites fancy girls . "
" Well who told you that ? "
" A transvestite told me that ! "
" Probably lives in a cave somewhere . "
" No , an executive transvestite did ! ” " Oh , really ?
Well … fantastico . "
So , yeah .
So I played kiss - chase with the girls - tag a girl , she has to kiss you , kinda sexy .
But then puberty came !
Puberty came and destroyed my confidence , destroyed my everything !
Which , I think , is part of the thing that causes these kids to go off and commit murder , essentially , ‘ cause it is such a hell of a gear change .
Think about it !
‘ Cause before puberty , girls and boys are going , " Girls ! ( disgusted noise ) ! "
" Boys ! ( disgusted noise ) "
Then it gets to puberty , and instead they 're going , " Girls !
Oh … " or , you know , " Boys , boys , " whatever sexual preference you 're going , but you just start switching on , sort of … ( interested noises ) .
And you think , " God , I want to get off with some of these people , I better look my best . "
And then Mother Nature says , " No , you will look the worst you 've ever looked in your life ! " ( raspberry mimicking explosion )
" Hold on , where did I get all this from ?
Jesus !
It 's ( disgusted noises ) .
We repulse ourselves !
I mean , I usedto look in the mirror and go , " Well , I 'm not going to shag me , that 's for certain ! "
‘ Cause that 's what narcissism is all about , is looking in the mirror and going , " God , I 'd like to have sex with myself ! "
You know ?
It 's all sort of self - attraction thing .
And then , when you 're at the acne thing , you just go , " Uh-uh , no way ! "
And parents should tell you the facts of puberty !
" Look , your hair 's going to go greasy , your face will become a general plague area ...
Here 's a book on the Black Death ...
Tufts of hair will grow on your chin , not in a sexy stubble way , but in a continuing plague theme .
Down here , I 'm not going to even talk about that !
But here 's a picture of your Uncle Jim ... ( getting scared and turning picture around alternately )
Sorry , it ’s the other way up ...
No , that 's your aunt , sorry ...
That 's Queen Victoria . "
And it 's over months and years , is n't it .
Puberty 's over months and years .
It should be one day , get the fucker over with !
Go into school , ( squeakily ) “ Sorry I 'm late , I do n't know why I was late . "
By the time you get home , ( gruffly ) " Right , I 'm going home to get a job with a drill . "
And that one day at school will be , ( swinging from high to low ) " Sorry , I do n'tknow the answer to that question , I do n't ...
' Scuse me , can I be excused ?
I seem to have the plague ... "
And then I had to chat up girls and I had never used my vocal ability to chat up girls , and when your voice is breaking it 's very hard !
It 's going , ( silkily ) " Why , Susan , I really kind of ( squeakily ) fancy you .
( low voice )
I saw you in the ( squeaky ) playground . "
I had to chat up girls and I 'd only tagged them before and I did n't have the verbal power to be able to say , " Susan , I saw you in the classroom today .
As the sun came from behind the clouds , a burst of brilliant light caught your hair , it was haloed in front of me .
You turned , your eyes flashed fire into my soul , I immediately read the words of Dostoyevsky and Karl Marx , and in the words of Albert Schweitzer , ' I fancy you . ' " But no .
At 13 , you 're just going , " 'ello , Sue .
I 've got legs .
Do you like bread ?
I 've got a French loaf .
( smacking sound ) Bye !
I love you ! "
So it was all not working very well .
And later on , when we become more mature , we have that line , where if you 're talking to someone , getting on well , you can say that great line , " Do you want a cup of coffee ? "
And if they go , " Ah … yeah , okay , " then sex is on , yeah ?
That 's the unwritten rule .
Does n't always work .
If the President of Burundi says , " Would you like a cup of coffee , " you 're not supposed to go , " Oh , I 'm in here ! "
" And how do you take it ? "
" Anywhere I can find it big boy !
Oh , just a cup of coffee ?
All right ...
I thought you meant ' Do you want a cup of coffee ! '
So you 're from Burundi , are you ?
Fantastic !
Yeah !
No , I know , it 's near Zaire , is n't it ?
Near Tanzania , yeah .
Yeah .
No , I learned them all when I had chicken pox .
I have to go now , ‘ cause my grandmother 's on fire ... "
But normally it does work as long as you keep the chat sexy .
" Yes , I like my coffee hot and strong .
Like I like my women !
Hot and strong ...
With a spoon in them .
Ah , the curve of the spoon , the curve of your breast !
I like to run the spoon ( talking with the tongue sticking out ) across my lips ... "
Then you 're pretty close , yeah ?
16 . Splashy Splashy
And I was a very driven Boy Scout .
Very driven Boy Scout !
Driven everywhere I was , and ... ( chuckles )
This is such a crap joke !
Other nights I 've never even said it ‘ cause I thought , " It ’s so crap ... "
I 'm just laughing that you laughed .
Anyway .
But I was a driven Boy Scout .
No , I was actually just driven .
You know , I was just a… forget this .
Anyway , so ...
Yeah , I had all the badges !
I had all the badges , I had my sort of “ Landing on the Moon ” badge !
You know , advanced badges .
My “ Nuclear Fusion ” badge , and my “ Menachem Beguin Disguise Kit ” badge , which was great , and so I was a top scout !
I was a chief scout , had my own tribe and everything , and me and this other guy who was a chief scout , we went on an outing as sort of chaperones for these girls who were slightly younger than us .
So it was 10 girls , two boys - pretty good odds for a shy kid .
We went to an activity center , where you climb a tree and eat a sausage and it 's kind of …
It builds your character so you know about sausages .
And we end up in a swimming pool , and I 'm doing splashy splashy with this girl I really fancy .
And she 's doing splashy splashy back and I 'm going , " Fucking ‘ell , splashy back ! "
You know , ‘ cause splashy splashy is the aquatic equivalent of " Do you want a cup of coffee ? "
Right ?
So splashy splashy 's going well and I suddenly think , “ I know !
I 'll turn around , I 'll do swimmy swimmy , and then maybe she 'll do swimmy swimmy too in a kind of chase me - chase me way and then we'd do catchy catchy and underwater sexy sexy ! ”
But I was so elated that splashy splashy was actually working that I just swam like a boy chased by sharky - sharky !
I swam , and I swam and I swam , and I was in Egypt when they caught up to me !
And that 's a long way from England .
‘ cause it goes England , Venezuela , Beirut , Africa , Cincinnati , Hanging Gardens of Babylon ...
It 's near Switzerland .
So , yeah , it was just … it was n't working .
And I was saving my virginity !
You know , it 's cool to lose your virginity at 13 .
Yeah , say , " Yeah , I was 13 , she was 25 , you know ...
Yeah ... I was an animal !
What can I say ? "
But I was saving my virginity for a woman made out of breasts !
And I was getting on !
I was 18 and they were going , " Have you done it ?
Have you done it yet ? "
" Uh , I 'm not from your country . "
Go on to college , you know , still nothing , and I thought , " Stop saving yourself for some imaginary person who just is n't there !
Just lose your virginity !
Just find anyone , anyone , as long as they 've got a pulse .
Or not !
Pulse optional ! "
And I was 21 before I lost my virginity .
21 !
That 's not cool at all , is it ?
But then I tell everyone about it , so that 's quite cool .
And I 've done it since then . ( counts with his fingers )
But the weirdest thing of all was I actually lost my virginity a year before I lost my virginity .
Yeah … weird !
A year before , when I was 20 , I actually had a night of whey - hey - hey - hey !
So the next morning it was one of those post - virginity breakfasts , I was thinking , you know .
" Hey , just sit there .
( singing )
Breakfast cereal , bacon and eggs .
Bit of coffee bubbling away .
Freshly squeezed mango juice ! "
She 's going , " You 're very chipper this morning . "
I 'm going , " Yeah , yeah , fucking ‘ell !
Yeah !
‘ cause last night , ( chuckles , then sings ) lost my virginity ! "
" Oh yeah , with who ? " ( moving head from left to right )
I did this for an hour , and I was going , " With you !
With you !
What the fuck ( clucks incoherently )
What the fuck was last night all about ? ! "
You know , and she said , " No ! " And we had this conversation , and the words ejaculation came into the conversation , and the world ' premature ' as well .
And I came back with , " No , ejaculation - mature , mature ejaculation .
Not premature , post - mature , veteran ejaculation !
Wise , learned man ejaculation !
Mature man who does the washing up - type ejaculation ... "
But she said , " No ! " She vetoed it !
She was China in the United Nations Security Council … in the United Nations Security Council Of My Virginity .
And so it just did n't work !
It was … fucked me off , I tell you .
But she 's dead now , so ...
No , she is n't ...
No , she was in L.A. , in a car , with Engelbert Humperdinck , and ... 17 . Bilingual Encore
So that 's the end of my show , and I do like to end the show with a kind of " Oh " feeling , and I think I 've done that quite well .
But thank you very much for being here .
I hope you 've enjoyed it .
Yeah ...
N ( Eddie comes back and plays with a clapping audience for about 30 seconds )
What ?
Now I just wanna talk quickly about language , and then we can all go .
Yeah , language .
They do say Britain and America are two countries separated by the Atlantic Ocean , and it ’s true .
No , they say , “ two countries separated by a common language , ” that ’s the line ; it ’s an Oscar Wilde line , I think .
And we do pronounce things in a different way , like you say “ caterpillar ” and we say “ caterpillar , ” and …
You say “ aluminum ” and we say “ aluminium . ”
You say , “ centrifugal ” and we say “ centrifugal . ”
You say , “ leisure ” and we say “ lizuray . ”
You say “ baysil ” and we say “ bahsil . ”
You say “ ’erbs ” and we say “ herbs , ” because there ’s a fucking “ H ” in it …
But you spell through THRU , and I ’m with you on that , ‘ cause we spell it “ THRUFF , ” and that ’s trying to cheat at Scrabble .
“ How can we get that “ OU ” sound ? ” “ Well , a “ U ” will work , ” “ What about an “ O ” as well ? ” “ We do n’t need it , we ’re fine . ”
“ No , I think an “ O ” in . ” “ Well , all right . ”
“ And a “ G ” as well . ” “ What ? ! ” “ Yes , a “ G ” would be good .
We need a silent “ G ” in the background , in case of any accidents or something . ”
“ Well , all right . ”
“ And an “ H ” as well . ” “ Fucking ‘ell !
Hang on . ”
“ An “ H ” in case some herbs come along . ” “ All right … ” “ And a Q , and a P , and a Z … Look it ’s a word in Scrabble that ’s 480 points ! ”
So yes , and we do have slight differences in that arena , but in Europe we have 200 languages .
200 languages !
Just count them , I know you wo n’t !
And future generations of Europeans – I ’m sorry , Europeans , but we ’re gonna have to be bilingual ; we ’re gonna have to be , and English speakers hate this !
“ Two languages in one head ?
No one can live at that speed !
Good Lord , man !
You ’re asking the impossible ! ”
“ But the Dutch speak four languages and smoke marijuana … ” “ Yes , but they ’re cheating !
Everyone knows marijuana is a drug enhancement that can help you on track and field to come last in a team of 8 million other runners … who are all dead . ”
I do n’t know how the Dutch do it , but anyway , we ’re gonna have to learn , and the reason for doing it is , one , for being groovy and just getting out there and doing it , but the second is we just lose a lot of business in the rest of Europe , ‘ cause German people phone up …
“ Wir haben fünf millionen Deutschmark … ” “ Just fuck off , will you , mate ? ” ( hangs up )
“ He was speaking German , I told him to go away , I told him to fuck off ..!
I do n’t know , something about fünf million in Deutschmarks .
I told him to get knotted !
We do n’t want any of his deutschy markys …
We do ?
We do want that ?
Oh , I ’m terribly sorry !
Oh , fuck !
Redial … ”
So yeah , I ’m into this , I ’m into this idea ; it ’s a positive thing , man .
I took my last show , “ Glorious , ” to Paris and I did it in French , and the French people came and stared at me , with that look in their eyes of “ quoi ? ”
Because , you know , there ’s no standup in France , and they ’re not used to English people speaking French , but I was doing it as a positive thing , because we could be the biggest melting pot in the world !
500 million people , all we have to do is melt a bit , just move it around …
Fucking move it around !
It was partly that and partly to just go , “ yeah … ” ( mocking sounds )
So I did that .
And I learnt French at school , up to the age of 16 , and then I just kept talking it endlessly after that .
And at school , the first page I ever learnt in French was full of things that are quite difficult to get into conversation , thinks like “ the mouse is underneath the table ” – la souris est en dessous la table .
Just slip that when you ’re buying a ticket to Paris : “ Le train à Paris , oui ?
C’est ici ?
C’est maintenant ?
Cinq minutes … la souris est en dessous la table … ”
The other line was , “ the cat is on the chair ” – le chat est sur la chaise – slightly more easy to fit in ; and “ the monkey is on the branch ” – “ le singe est sur la branche . ”
Very difficult to get into a conversation !
Not a lot of jungle in France … monkeys thin on the ground … thin in the air … just generally pretty trim !
And yes , so it just was n’t working .
We go to bars and cafés , that ’s where we go ; we go to bars and cafés , and we sit there and we have chats in the café .
“ Oui , j’aime beaucoup le cafê , le cafê noir and très fort ; très choud … ( inhales ) avec une cuillère dedans … ( mocking sound )
Ah , le virage de la cuillère ; le virage des poitrines …
Je mets la cuillère dans la bouche … ”
“ Je suis le Président de Burundi ! ”
Ah , oui , Burundi !
Je le connais bien !
C’est tout près de Zaire , oui ?
Tout près de Mozambique …
No , Tanzanie , Tanzanie ! ( chuckles falsely )
Oui , je les ai appris quand j’ai les pox de poulet .
Je dois part maintenant parce que ma grandmère est flambèe … ”
If you do n’t speak French , by the way , all that was fucking funny , all right ?
We go and get hotel rooms for the night : “ Vous avez une chambre , monsieur ? ” “ Oui , nous avons les chambres , nous sommes un hôtel ! ” “ OK , je voudrais une chambre avec un grand lit … ” – a large bed – “ avec une vue de la mer … ” – a view of the sea – “ avec une douche … with a spider . ”
“ Oui , monsieur … c’est chambre 42 , monsieur . ” “ 42 ?
Merci beaucoup .
Mais , la souris est en dessous la table , le chat est sur la chaise et le singe est sur la branche . ” “ Quois ? ” “ Il y a un singe sur la branche ?
Le chat ?
La souris ? ” “ Ou est le singe ? ” “ Le singe est sur la branche . ” “ Est - ce que le singe est dans la chambre ? ”
In the end , the only way I could get that line into a conversation was I had to go to France with a cat , a mouse , a monkey , a table and a chair , and wander around heavily wooded areas .
“ Come on , come on !
Someone ’s coming , someone ’s coming !
Quick , positions !
Les positions , maintenant !
Boulot , boulot !
Tout de suite !
Vas-y !
Vas-y !
“ Bonjour ! ” “ Eh , bonjour .
Qu’est - ce qui se passe ? ”
“ Bonjour , je suis Anglais , je suis ici en vacances .
C’est très belle ici , les couleurs , les bois , très belle . ” ( inhaling )
“ Tu est un travesti ? ” “ Oui , je suis un travesti , mais pas un travesti typical .
Je suis un travesti executive … Un travesti d’action ! ” “ Très bien … ” “ Mais , la souris est en dessous la table , le chat est sur la chaise et le singe est… est… le singe est disparu . ”
Cause the monkey would fuck off !
He ’d do his own thing .
He was a bloody monkey !
He was a cheeky monkey … and he knew my French was n’t very good , so he ’d go off and do things .
“ Ah , le singe … maintenant … regarde .
Il est sur une bicyclette .
Il joue au banjo .
Et il fume une pipe .
Maintenant , il arrête …
Il lit un journal , il a on journal …
Et maintenant il est dans l’autobus !
Il conduit l’autobus !
Et Sandra Bullock est dans l’autobus !
Il y a une bombe dans l’autobus !
Il faut conduire l’autobus plus de 50 kilomètres par l’heure .
Et Keanu Reeves !
Là !
Il arrive dans la voiture !
Il a pas de cheveuxet Jeff Daniels est déjà mort …
Regarde , il se jette dans l’autobus .
Et Dennis Hopper , oh !
Dennis Hopper , quel méchant ! ”
That was the film “ Speed ” in French , which in France was called “ La Vitesse ! ”
Or at least it should have been , but in fact it was called “ Speed . ” Yeah … [ Click HERE for French Translation ] 18 .
In Conclusion So in conclusion , ladies and jelly spoons …
America , you have the American Dream , you have the American Dream !
We have n’t got the European Dream yet , that ’s what we ’ve got to get ; we ’ve got to get a dream to build on .
You have the American Dream ; the dream is to be born in the gutter , and raise , and grow up and get all the money in the world and stick it in your ears and go ( blows raspberry ) The American Dream !
A fantastic dream of money in your ears and swimming through fivers .
The American Dream !
In Europe … I do n’t know , we have n’t got a dream yet .
Well , the dream was … ( mimics sleeping and dreaming )
“ Oh … get off , you fuckin ’ …!
Flag .
No ! ” ( wakes up with a gasp )
“ Hilda , Hilda , wake up , Hilda ! ”
“ What is it , Dr. Heimlich , you waking - up type person ? ” “ I ’ve dreamed the European Dream .
I dreamt that every country in Europe spoke a different language and they hated each other …
Oh , that ’s true , is n’t it ?
Yes . ”
That was the dream , but now , maybe now , the dream is to be in the South of Europe – to be in Greece , in Italy , in Spain , and to be on a moped with no helmet on , riding along , going , “ ciao ! ”
That ’s a pretty cool dream ; it ’s not much of a dream , but it ’s as good as we ’vegot so far , and it ’s pretty funky , ‘ cause when you die … you look a mess , but I do n’t know , I just like it .
( mimics riding on a Vespa ) ‘ Cause you ’re in a fucking hairdryer .
There ’s dogs walking faster than you !
It ’s just pretty damn cool for me .
That ’s the European Dream , thank you very much .
Good night .
Perfume was first used by the Egyptians as part of their religious rituals .
The two principal methods of use at this time was the burning of incense and the application of balms and ointments .
Perfumed oils were applied to the skin for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes .
During the Old and Middle Kingdoms , perfumes were reserved exclusively for religious rituals such as cleansing ceremonies .
Then during the New Kingdom ( 1580 - 1085 BC ) they were used during festivals and Egyptian women also used perfumed creams and oils as toiletries and cosmetics and as preludes to love - making .
The use of perfume then spread to Greece , Rome , and the Islamic world .
And it was the Islamic community that kept the use of perfumes since the spread of Christianity led to a decline in the use of perfume .
With the fall of the Roman Empire , perfume 's influence dwindled .
It was not until the twelfth century and the development of international trade that this decline was reversed .
Perfume enjoyed huge success during the seventeenth century .
Perfumed gloves became popular in France and in 1656 , the guild of glove and perfume - makers was established .
The use of perfume in France grew steadily .
The court of Louis XV was even named " the perfumed court " due to the scents which were applied daily not only to the skin but also to clothing , fans and furniture .
The eighteenth century saw a revolutionary advance in perfumery with the invention of eau de Cologne .
This refreshing blend of rosemary , neroli , bergamot and lemon was used in a multitude of different ways : diluted in bath water , mixed with wine , eaten on a sugar lump , as a mouthwash , an enema or an ingredient for a poultice , injected directly ... and so on .
The variety of eighteenth - century perfume containers was as wide as that of the fragrances and their uses .
Sponges soaked in scented vinaigres de toilette were kept in gilded metal vinaigrettes .
Liquid perfumes came in beautiful Louis XIV - style pear - shaped bottles .
Glass became increasingly popular , particularly in France with the opening of the Baccarat factory in 1765 .
As with industry and the arts , perfume was to undergo profound change in the nineteenth century .
Changing tastes and the development of modern chemistry laid the foundations of perfumery as we know it today .
Alchemy gave way to chemistry and new fragrances were created .
The French Revolution had in no way diminished the taste for perfume , there was even a fragrance called " Parfum a la Guillotine . "
Under the post - revolutionary government , people once again dared to express a penchant for luxury goods , including perfume .
A profusion of vanity boxes containing perfumes appeared in the 19th century .
Due to its jasmine , rose and orange - growing trades , the town of Grasse in Provence established itself as the largest production center for raw materials .
The statutes of the perfume - makers of Grasse were passed in 1724 .
Paris became the commercial counterpart to Grasse and the world center of perfume .
Perfume houses such as Houbigant ( Quelques Fleurs , still very popular today ) , Lubin , Roger & Gallet , and Guerlain were all based in Paris .
In 1760 , in London , James Henry Creed founded the House of Creed perfume .
With the turn of the century fragrance houses emerged in Europe .
The Crown Perfumery was founded in 1872 by William Sparks Thomson , a maker of crinolines and corsets .
Catering to the high society in London and Europe , he launched a collection of floral fragrances called Flower Fairies .
Queen Victoria granted the Crown Perfumery her own crown 's image to top the fragrance bottles .
In 2002 Clive Christian discontinued the Crown line of fragrances and replaced them with the luxurious Clive Christian perfume line .
Soon bottling became more important .
Perfume maker Francois Coty formed a partnership with Rene Lalique .
Lalique then produced bottles for Guerlain perfume , D'Orsay , Lubin , Molinard , Roger & Gallet and others .
Baccarat then joined in , producing the bottle for Mitsouko ( Guerlain ) , Shalimar ( Guerlain ) and others .
Brosse glassworks created the memorable bottle for Jeanne Lanvin 's Arpege perfume , the famous Chanel No.5 , and most recently for Parfums Raffy single note fragrances .
Floral fragrances became more popular in the 20th century .
Fracas perfume by Robert Piguet fragrances was first released in 1948 by master perfumer Germaine Cellier and is known as the premier Tuberose fragrance .
In 1921 - Couturier Gabrielle Chanel launched her own brand of perfume , created by Ernest Beaux , she calls it Chanel No.5 because it was the fifth in a line of fragrances Ernest Beaux presented her .
Ernest Beaux was the first perfumer to use aldehydes regularly in perfumery .
The 1930's saw the arrival of the leather fragrances , and florals , also became quite popular with the emergence of Worth 's Je Reviens ( 1932 ) , Caron 's Fleurs de Rocaille ( 1933 ) and Jean Patou 's Joy perfume ( 1935 ) .
With French perfumery at it's peak in the 1950's , other designers such as Christian Dior , Jacques Fath , Nina Ricci perfume , Pierre Balmain and so on , started creating their own scents .
The recent popularity of celebrity fragrances has also made an impact on the industry although most experts do not expect the trend to last .
Today there are over 30,000 designer perfumes on the market and perfumes are no longer for the wealthy .
The perfume industry has undergone several changes in technique , material and style .
All of which have created the modern fragrance industry , one that still incorporates creativity , mystique and romance along with marketing to appeal to the masses .
In recent years the emergence of small and exclusive fragrance brands have been marketed .
Known as niche fragrances , brands such as Amouage , Montale perfume , Xerjoff , Parfumerie Naturelle , Bois 1920 , Odori perfume are bringing back the high quality fine fragrances of the past perfume artisans .
These fragrances contain the finest oils from all over the world and have revived the passion of perfumery for so many .
Perfume samples are a great way to try these niche fragrances .
I ’m shocked !
SHOCKED !
A Justice Department investigation has found pervasive errors in the FBI ’s use of its power to secretly demand telephone , e-mail and financial records in national security cases , officials with access to the report said yesterday .
The inspector general ’s audit found 22 possible breaches of internal FBI and Justice Department regulations — some of which were potential violations of law — in a sampling of 293 “ national security letters . ”
The letters were used by the FBI to obtain the personal records of U.S. residents or visitors between 2003 and 2005 .
The FBI identified 26 potential violations in other cases .
Now , normally this would assume that these cases came before a judge , were looked at to ensure they met the standards , and somehow still passed the scrutiny they needed to be blocked .
But as we all know , that ’s not how they roll .
The letters enable an FBI field office to compel the release of private information without the authority of a grand jury or judge .
The USA Patriot Act , enacted after the 2001 attacks , eliminated the requirement that the FBI show “ specific and articulable ” reasons to believe that the records it demands belong to a foreign intelligence agent or terrorist . …
Now the bureau needs only to certify that the records are “ sought for ” or “ relevant to ” an investigation “ to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities . ”
I would think that this goes against the 4th Amendment .
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
I do believe this would entail a complete instance of the government to demand records of peoples ’ “ papers , and effects ” without a warrant , and by the above quote , the proof of probable cause ( which is no longer certified by a judge ) is greatly diminished .
Of course , I ca n’t completely blame the FBI here .
Business has been more than willing to roll over for the feds , to the point where they are providing information that is n’t asked for and is not legally allowed to be provided .
Of course , our wonderful FBI is destroying that information filing it away for future use .
In at least two cases , the officials said , Fine found that the FBI obtained full credit reports using a national security letter that could lawfully be employed to obtain only summary information .
In an unknown number of other cases , third parties such as telephone companies , banks and Internet providers responded to national security letters with detailed personal information about customers that the letters do not permit to be released .
The FBI “ sequestered ” that information , a law enforcement official said last night , but did not destroy it .
Now , do n’t you feel safer ?
After all , we do n’t need to worry about terrorists in a police state .
We just need to worry about the police .

The French police force plans to ditch Microsoft 's Internet Explorer as its preferred browser software and replace it with Firefox by the end of the year .
Up to 70,000 desktops will be switched over to a Firefox and Thunderbird email client set - up because of the combo's " reliability , security and inter- interoperability with other state services " , " General Christian Brachet , IT director of the French police force said .
Brachet said the gendarmerie had settled on Firefox because it is based on the W3C standard and can used on Windows , Mac and Linux boxes .
Basing its systems on open net standards will make it easier for French citizens to report crimes online in future , once such facilities are introduced .
The move over to an open source browser follows the French police 's switch from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice , a change implemented last year that 's expected to save the force € 2 m ( $ 2.4 m ) a year , AFP reports .
The news agency reports that other French government departments - including the interior customs , culture and finance ministries - are also moving towards open - source alternatives .
The finance ministry is leading the charge with plans to move 80,000 desktops to Linux starting in 2H 2006 .
Colonel Nicolas Geraud , deputy director of the gendarmerie 's IT department , said the force was considering its options over a move from Windows to Linux .
Geraud made his comments during a presentation to the Solution Linux 2006 exhibition in Paris last week . ®
The sting of a jellyfish has been shown to be one of the fastest processes in the whole of biology .
Using a super - fast camera technique German researchers have found it can fire off in just 700 nanoseconds .
The team , writing in Current Biology , calculates that the acceleration is equivalent to 5,410,000 times gravity .
Its impact generates a pressure of seven Gigapascals , which is in the same range as a gunshot .
The stings arrive in the form of tiny capsules called nematocysts ( pictured ) , which contain toxic compounds delivered through a spike .
They are fired off for both defence and capturing prey by members of the Cnidaria phylum which includes jellyfish , anenomes and corals .
The elastic walls of nematocysts are key to the snap release .
They are made of a stretchy collagen - based polymer and inflated to 15 Megapascals pressure by an ion-packed protein matrix .
The team says the spring from the potential energy stored in the wall is responsible for the incredible speed .
The new research rates the top speed of nematocyst release one hundred times faster than previously measured .
In order to capture the process , the camera was run at a blistering 1,430,000 frames per second . ®
Q : What the hell is “ Enterprise Ruby ” anyway ?
A : Yet another ‘ stack ’ of crap so complex that any salesperson can use
Steak
and Strippers to easily sell it to management thanks to the bikeshedding
effect .
– Zed S. ( author of Mongrel ) at QCon 2007
Fellow Rubyists , Ruby is now mainstream .
Like it or not , we are there .
Ruby applications are now developed for
banks ,
telecoms , investment companies , newspapers … not just cool Web 2.0
startups
anymore .
Every middleware , operating system and IDE product vendor has a
dynamic languages strategy .
This is a new situation that Ruby community
has
to deal with .
Why do we care ?
Three major reasons :
It gives us all an opportunity to convert our love of Ruby into a day
job .
If you are a good Ruby programmer in North America , there is no
reason
why you have to be working with Java or .NET today , unless you like it .
Community is changing .
Ruby - talk / Rails - talk traffic is already
bordering on insane , with a number of silly questions answered on page
10 of
the Pickaxe steadily growing .
It was n’t like this four years ago , when I
joined .
The threat that Zed S. refers to in the quote above .
I call it
“ R2EE
scenario ” .
I love # 1 and hate # 2 , but it ’s # 3 I want to talk about today .
Enterprise Ruby now
ThoughtWorks , the company I work for , has a fairly large number of
people
working on Ruby gigs .
Large enough to get funding and management support
for
initiatives like CruiseControl.rb and Rails continuous integration
build .
Large enough , in fact , that we can look at our own projects and say “ OK ,
this is what Ruby stack in the corporate IT world should look like ” .
Turns out , it ’s LAMP , bunch of Mongrels and Rails on x86 servers .
Sounds
familiar , eh? OK , “ enterprise ” Ruby apps usually have to talk to Oracle ,
instead of MySQL , they may have to authenticate against LDAP or
ActiveDirectory , some need messaging , reporting , or even the dreaded
WS - Deathstar [ © DHH ] .
There are some special needs .
Fundamentally ,
though ,
it ’s still the same straightforward approach to design and architecture
that
Ruby world is all about .
… and tomorrow
Zed says : “ Yet another ‘ stack ’ of crap so complex that any salesperson
can
use Steak and Strippers to easily sell it to management thanks to the
bikeshedding effect . ”
Well , it may happen .
Our cherished Ruby day jobs may yet turn into a
nightmare of complexity and closed - sourced bloatware .
Hopefully , we can
at
least have curly brackets instead of angled ones …
Or maybe not .
Agile movement , another Good Thing ™ that has recently
gone
mainstream , succeeded in rescuing many , in corporate IT and elsewhere ,
from
the misery , which is heavyweight development process .
This gives us
hope .
Maybe we can rescue ourselves and others from this other misery , which
is
bloated middleware ?
Or should we all seek refuge in “ three men and a Web 2.0 site ” shops ?
I
immensely respect the aforementioned men and their lifestyle choices .
Especially them whose company name starts with a number .
Seriously , I
do .
But this is not the only way .
I think , Ruby community has the opportunity , the power , and the duty to
prevent R2EE from happening .
What will help ?
Ruby .
Beautiful language that has been evolving for some years .
Open-sourced
and not controlled by a middleware vendor .
Rails .
A framework that has been extracted from a real life application
to
make development easier and faster .
Not designed by a committee to solve
every problem of the world , including the imaginary ones .
Again ,
open - sourced and not controlled by a middleware vendor .
Rails is not the
last framework you will ever need ( which is a good thing ! ) , but it sets
the
right tone and serves as an example of what frameworks and libraries
should
look like in our brave new world .
Experience .
The history is repeated twice .
First as a tragedy , and then
a
farce .
It looks like both already happened .
Now we can learn the lesson
and
not repeat it again .
Culture .
Before Ruby started turning mainstream , it was ( to me , at
least )
this little quiet corner where one could escape the frustrations of
one ’s
day job .
Ivory tower architects who do n’t code , complexity for the sake
of
complexity , design by committee , premature standardization - all those
things did not belong here .
They were culturally unacceptable .
Let ’s keep it this way !
Despite the popular impression , most corporate IT decision makers are
not
all that sensitive to Steak and Strippers .
But they have to make those
decisions without solid , recent , firsthand user experience to rely on .
So ,
the Bikeshedding Effect is the problem .
Technology judgments are made by
people who do n’t code , relying on white papers , word of mouth and
“ common
sense ” .
Ruby community can affect these things .
After all , people in
corporate IT read blogs and go to conferences , like everybody else .
They
hear you .
I think , we should make it “ common sense ” that “ enterprise Ruby stack ”
does
not have bloated middleware within it , does n’t need it , and does n’t want
it .
Make it culturally unacceptable .
I want to ask one more question : why is the E - word anathema in this
community ?
Yes , people choose fancy words for self - description .
Yes ,
these
words can become associated with bad things .
And yes , staying away from
the
whole thing is a possible lifestyle choice .
Changing the game is another
equally valid choice , however .
So , who or what are we , as a community ,
sending those “ $ &#* off ! ” signals to ?
I think , we should clarify our message .
It ’s not “ Enterprise , $ &# *
off ! ” ,
it ’s “ Enterprise , welcome !
Bloatware , $ &#* off ! ”

Satellite gravity measurements give estimates of the loss of mass over Greenland and surrounding regions between April 2002 to November 2005 ( Image : Jianli Chen )
The world ’s second largest ice cap may be melting three times faster than indicated by previous measurements , according to newly released gravity data collected by satellites .
The Greenland Ice Sheet shrank at a rate of about 239 cubic kilometres per year from April 2002 to November 2005 , a team from the University of Texas at Austin , US , found .
In the last 18 months of the measurements , ice melting has appeared to accelerate , particularly in southeastern Greenland .
“ This is a good study which confirms that indeed the Greenland ice sheet is losing a large amount of mass and that the mass loss is increasing with time , ” says Eric Rignot , from NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , US , who led a separate study that reached a similar conclusion earlier in 2006 ( See Greenland ’s glaciers are speeding to the ocean ) .
His team used satellites to measure the velocity of glacier movement and calculate net ice loss .
Advertisement
Yet another technique , which uses a laser to measure the altitude of the surface , determined that the ice sheet was losing about 80 cubic kilometres of ice annually between 1997 and 2003 .
The newer measurements suggest the ice loss is three times that .
“ Acceleration of ice mass loss over Greenland , if confirmed , would be consistent with proposed increased global warming in recent years , and would indicate additional polar ice sheet contributions to global sea level rise , ” write the University of Texas researchers in the journal Science .
Identical twins
The satellites that provided the new data are results the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) pair .
These identical US and German satellites fly 220 kilometres from one another .
They use a microwave ranging system and Global Positioning System to measure precisely the distance between one another .
Tiny changes in that distance reflect changes in the Earth ’s gravity field , which in turn is a measure of the density of part of the Earth .
“ The gravity data are spectacular in providing precise information about what is happening to the ice sheets , ” says NASA climatologist James Hansen , director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York , US .
“ They provide the net effect of mass change , due to both melting and snowfall changes .
It confirms our expectation that the warming climate will cause Greenland ice to shrink . ”
Based on the glaciology of the region , Rignot says he does not think that the north - eastern part of Greenland ’s ice cap has lost as much ice as the Texas team suggests – 74 cubic kilometres annually .
Other factors could account for the discrepancy , acknowledges Clark Wilson , one of the University of Texas team .
For instance , scientists do not fully understand the ocean tides in the Arctic Ocean , and there are not a lot of weather stations to monitor air pressure there .
GRACE only measures changes in gravity due to changing mass – it cannot tell if that results from changes in air , water , rock or ice .
So to find changes due to ice loss alone , the researchers have to subtract the estimated contribution of water and air .
If that is not well known , it results in higher uncertainties in the interpretation .
“ We ’re hoping as time goes on , we ’ll have improved tide models , improved atmospheric pressure estimates and also better ways to use the GRACE data themselves , ” Wilson told New Scientist .
Thwarted plans
The Greenland Ice Sheet holds about 2.85 million cubic kilometres of ice – 10 % of the world ’s ice mass .
If it all melted , it would raise the average sea level about 6.5 metres .
This is not GRACE ’s first measurement of an ice sheet .
Another team at the University of Colorado , Boulder , US , similarly used the GRACE system to show that the Antarctic ice sheet was losing about 152 cubic kilometres annually from 2002 to 2005 ( See Gravity reveals shrinking Antarctic ice ) .
“ We should be making plans for the next generation of gravity satellites , but with the cutback in NASA funding for Earth science , this is not happening , ” says Hansen , who earlier in 2006 accused officials at NASA headquarters of trying to stop him from speaking out on greenhouse gas emissions ( See Top climatologist accuses US of trying to gag him ) .

A log of a year in Jiangsu Nanjing , from August 2006
Long before his famous antenna moustache , Salvador Dalí antagonized those around him by sporting a Mohawk haircut .
I discovered this in the early 1980 ’s when I found a photo of the young artist published in an obscure punk rock fanzine .
While I do n’t remember the name of the diminutive self - published zine , I never forgot the stridently non-conformist look of that defiant artist as he stared at me from out of the past .
At the time I was deeply involved in the cultural insurgency of the L.A. punk rock scene , and I had already created an influential cover illustration for SLASH Magazine that promoted the radical maverick hair - do , so the photo of the youthful surrealist really struck a chord with me .
For years I kicked myself for not having purchased that slapdash xeroxed punk zine , as I never saw the photograph of Dalí published anywhere again .
Over the decades I kept my eyes open for the elusive snapshot , but to no avail .
Out of curiosity I recently conducted a web search for the image , but that also turned up nothing .
As chance would have it , this past June found me in my local library exploring the shelves of art books .
I randomly picked up an interesting volume called Writers on Artists , and when I cracked the hardback open , low and behold … there was my long sought after photograph of Dalí .
By conventional measures , Jitbhai Chowdhury is a model farmer .
He uses organic manure and natural pesticides .
He grows fruit trees round the edge of his alfalfa fields and tends his dairy cattle with care .
Every day he produces 25 litres of milk which he sends to a collection point in the nearby village of Kushkal in Gujarat , India , for delivery to the state dairy .
It ’s because of people like him that India is n’t starving .
But for all its virtues , Chowdhury ’s 2 - hectare farm is sowing the seeds of a global disaster .
To grow the fodder that he needs to feed his cows , he is entirely dependent on irrigation water pumped from deep underground .
Over the course of a year , his small electric pump sucks twice as much water from beneath his fields as falls on the land as rain .
No wonder the water table in the village is 150 metres down and falling by 6 metres a year .
Chowdhury is one of millions of farmers doing this across the world .
From China to Argentina , and Australia to the US , people are increasingly dependent on “ fossil ” water extracted unsustainably from deep underground .
Collectively , our actions are threatening to revive a spectre that nobody has seriously worried about for the best part of 40 years – mass global starvation .
Back in the 1960s , the world was gripped by a Malthusian nightmare .
The planet ’s population was set to double in a generation , and nobody knew how everyone would be fed .
Scare stories abounded .
In 1968 , for example , Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich wrote in his best - selling book The Population Bomb that “ the battle to …
Some believe a bat turns into a man at night
A BBC correspondent says the attacks are being blamed by some on a demon called " Popo Bawa " meaning winged bat .
Some men are staying awake or sleeping in groups outside their homes .
Others are smearing themselves with pig's oil , believing this repels attacks .
Reports of the demon 's existence have been common for many years in Zanzibar , where locals claim it originated .
The BBC's John Ngahyoma in Dar es Salaam says not many people actually believe that the demon exists and there have been no sightings .
But Mbaruku Ibrahim , who hails from Zanzibar , says the story of the demon is common there and people in his village on Pemba island sleep beside a huge fire outside their houses whenever it is said to appear .
The story goes that the bat is able to transform itself into a man at night and it has also been blamed for rapes of women .
Sheikh Yahya Hussein , a prominent astrologer in Tanzania , claims that the demon is a spirit that is unleashed by witches to torment their opponents .
Belief in witchcraft and superstitions is widespread in Tanzania , especially in rural areas .
A guy called Ben Smither from Norwich in the UK has put together a hot - as - the - sun personal scooter / skateboard that takes the totally scalable motorized gyroscopic stabilization concept from Segway , and does it with only a single wheel .
In all , the project cost about £ 300 ( ~$ 580 ) in parts , although Ben did n't elaborate on how long it took to put together .
You 'll also need to have some level of expertise in electronics if you want to build your own -- test yourself : can you say what a H - Bridge driver is without Googling it ? -- although we 're sure that before long
Ben or someone else will use their capitalist prerogative and start selling flat - pack kits for a premium ( if they do , then they better watch out for Sony and their Segway - esque skateboard patent application ) .
Until then , we 'll have to keep traveling to places using our legs : oh , what a bore .

The invention is confined to paper so far
But the synthetic tree proposed by Dr Klaus Lackner does not much resemble the leafy variety .
" It looks like a goal post with Venetian blinds , " said the Columbia University physicist , referring to his sketch at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Denver , Colorado .
But the synthetic tree would do the job of a real tree , he said .
It would draw carbon dioxide out of the air , as plants do during photosynthesis , but retain the carbon and not release oxygen .
If built to scale , according to Dr Lackner , synthetic trees could help clean up an atmosphere grown heavy with carbon dioxide , the most abundant gas produced by humans and implicated in climate warming .
He predicts that one synthetic tree could remove 90,000 tonnes of CO2 in a year - the emissions equivalent of 15,000 cars .
" You can be a thousand times better than a living tree , " he said .
Carbon sinks
For now , the synthetic tree is still a paper idea .
But Dr Lackner is serious about developing a working model .
His efforts suggest the wide net of ideas cast by scientists as they face the challenge of mitigating climate change .
Dr Lackner believes that carbon sequestration technology must be part of the long - term solution .
Global reliance on fossil fuels would not decrease any time soon , he said , and developing countries cannot be expected to wait until alternatives are available .
The technology calls for two things : seizing carbon and then storing it .
Direct capture of CO2 , from power plants for example , is the simplest , according to Dr Lackner .
But this does n't work for all polluters .
A car ca n't capture and store its carbon dioxide on - board ; the storage tank would be too large .
" It 's simply a question of weight , " he said .
" For every 14 grams of gasoline you use , you are going to have 44 grams of CO2 . "
The alternative is to capture emissions from the wind .
In this case , a synthetic tree would act like a filter .
An absorbent coating , such as limewater , on its slats or " leaves " would seize carbon dioxide and retain the carbon .
Dr Lackner predicts that the biggest expense would be in recycling the absorber material .
" We have to keep the absorbent surfaces refreshed because they will very rapidly fill up with carbon dioxide , " he said .
If an alkaline solution such as limewater were used , the resulting coat of limestone would need to be removed .
Dr Lackner is considering other less - alkaline solutions to prevent carbonate precipitation .
" There are a number of engineering issues which need to be worked out , " he said .
Home use
A synthetic tree could be planted anywhere .
A small one could sit like a TV on the lawn to balance out the CO2 emitted by one person or family .
But more practically , said Dr Lackner , a device the size of a barn would sit in the open air , near repositories for easy transportation and storage of carbon .
He estimated that 250,000 synthetic trees worldwide would be needed to soak up the 22 billion tonnes of CO2 produced annually .
But not everyone is rooted to the idea .
Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineer Howard Herzog thinks Dr Lackner 's design will not hold together on the scale he proposes .
He said you would expend more energy in capturing the CO2 - in keeping the slats coated in absorbent and disposing of it - than you would save .
" Once the solvent captures the CO2 , it holds it on tight , " said Dr Herzog , " and it 's going to take a lot of energy to break those bonds . "
He said that much more research was needed on the technology .
" The idea of air capture is seductive and would really be great to have , " said Dr Herzog , " but it 's important to separate out the concept from the technical details . "
' Early days '
Meanwhile , Dr Lackner is pursuing his idea for carbon storage .
While he was at the US Department of Energy 's Los Alamos National Laboratory , his team worked on a storage method based on a natural chemical process known as rock weathering .
When CO2 binds with magnesium , it creates carbonate rocks which , according to Dr Lackner , retain carbon permanently and safely .
Currently , he said , the process is still too expensive to develop on a large scale .
But Dr Lackner is optimistic that the costs for carbon capture and storage will come down .
" This is still the early days of climate solutions , " he said .
The Real Deal : Getting Out of Narco Dollars HQ
Getting Out of Narco Dollars HQ
In 1996 , my company and I were targeted by a private informant and a group of investigators working for the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) .
If you have ever seen the movie " Enemy of the State " with Will Smith and Gene Hackman , then you understand how the drill works .
Will Smith plays a successful Washington lawyer who is targeted in a phony frame and smear by a US intelligence agency .
The spooky types have high - speed access to every last piece of data on the information highway - from Will 's bank account to his telephone conversations - and the wherewithal to engineer a smear campaign through the papers and the Council on Foreign Relations types .
The organizer of an investment conference once introduced me by saying , " Who here has seen the movie Enemy of the State ?
The woman I am about to introduce to you played Will Smith in real life . "
One day I was a wealthy entrepreneur with a beautiful home , a successful business and money in the bank .
I had been a partner and member of the board of directors of a Wall Street firm and then Assistant Secretary of Housing - Federal Housing Commissioner during the Bush Administration .
I had been invited to serve as a governor of the Federal Reserve Board and instead started my own company in Washington , The Hamilton Securities Group .
Thanks to our leadership in digital technology , financial software and analytics , Hamilton was doing well and poised for significant financial growth .
One of my software tool innovations , Community Wizard , helped communities access data about how all the money works in their place .
Accessible through the World Wide Web , Community Wizard was illuminating an unusual pattern of defaults on HUD mortgages and other government and homeowner losses in areas in which the CIA had admitted to facilitating cocaine trafficking by Iran Contra supporters .
According to the CIA , we were paying our government to help the narco dollars make money in a way that - if you read Community Wizard 's comic book - like money maps - was losing taxpayers and homeowners billions of dollars .
The next day I was hunted , living through 18 audits and investigations and a smear campaign directed not just at me but also at members of my family , colleagues and friends who helped me .
I believe that the smear campaign originated at the highest levels .
For more than two years I lived through serious physical harassment and surveillance .
This included burglary , stalking , having houseguests followed and dead animals left on the doormat .
The hardest part was the necessity of keeping quiet about the physical danger lest it cost me more support or harm my credibility .
Most people simply do not believe that such things are possible in America .
In 1999 , I sold everything to pay what to date is approximately $ 6 million of legal and administrative costs .
My estimate of equity destroyed , damages and opportunity costs is $ 250 million .
I moved to a system of living in several places on an unpredictable schedule in the hope that this would push up the cost of surveillance and harassment and so dissuade my tormentors from following .
The places were chosen to move me as far away as possible from the corridors of power in Washington and on Wall Street filled with people benefiting from narco dollars and their reinvestment .
That strategy - combined with excellent legal and administrative work by a first rate team of very courageous people --- has been successful in besting the targeting .
It made it possible for me to understand how our economic addiction to narco dollars worked and how to it was draining our neighborhoods .
I teamed up with the members of my family and friends and their neighbors who were getting drained .
Four days after Insight Magazine published its cover story on me this summer , the head investigator targeting us resigned unexpectedly .
Three weeks later the last of 18 audits and investigations was suddenly closed down .
A follow - up article by Insight 's Paul Rodriguez described the closed investigation as something that " many inside both HUD and the Department of Justice regarded as a political vendetta against Fitts . "
The miracle had happened .
We have overcome a serious targeting .
Like in the movie where Will Smith comes out fine , my story has a happy ending .
It 's a wonderful feeling .
As Winston Churchill 's once said , " Nothing is more exhilarating than being shot at without result . "
I believe that one of the reasons for my happy ending was that our actions to deal with the investigation reflected the understanding of narco dollars that I acquired from living and traveling throughout America and talking with people from all walks of life about how narco dollars were impacting our lives and neighborhoods in many different places .
Understanding narco dollars is something I need to know to help entrepreneurs around the country build the profitable deals and businesses that will get the Solari Index and Dow Jones in our neighborhoods rising together .
Where I live , folks do not want to know about what is wrong on the Titanic .
They do not want to know that a flood of narco dollars is rolling over us .
They know these things .
What they want to know is how to build arks .

There is a classic mathematical nuisance known as the Monty Hall problem which can be hard to wrap the mind around .
It is named after the classic game show “ Let ’s Make a Deal , ” where a contestant was allowed to choose one of three doors , knowing that a valuable prize waited behind one , and worthless prizes behind the others .
On the show , once the contestant made their choice , Monty Hall ( the host ) opened one of the other doors , revealing one of the worthless prizes .
He would then open the contestant ’s chosen door to reveal whether they picked correctly .
The Monty Hall problem asks , what if the contestant were allowed to change her door choice after she saw the worthless prize ?
Would it be to her advantage to switch doors ?
In other words , if the contestant guesses that the new car lay behind door # 1 , and Monty opened door # 2 to reveal a goat , is the new car more likely to be behind door # 1 , or door # 3 ?
At this point , the imperfect wad of meat called the “ brain ” fires up it neurons , and usually informs its owner that revealing the contents of one of the other doors simply changed the contestant ’s odds from one - in - three to fifty - fifty .
But that is n’t the case .
It has been mathematically proven that if the contestant were allowed to switch her door to # 3 after seeing the goat behind # 2 , she ’d be twice as likely to win .
How can this be ?
It is n’t intuitive , but it ’s true .
Great mathematicians have puzzled over this , as well as great scientists at Los Alamos and professors at MIT .
The best way to look at it is to realize that the door - opening is essentially misdirection in this problem .
When the contestant selects a door , she is dividing the doors into two sets : A ) The doors she DID select , and B ) the doors she did NOT select .
She already knows that at least one of the doors in set B is not a winner .
The fact that Monty opens one to reveal a goat does n’t add any information , and it does n’t improve the one - in - three chance the contestant had at the initial picking .
In explaining the effect , it helps to increase the scale of the question .
Imagine that there are 100 doors to choose from instead of three , but still just one prize .
When hypothetical contestant Contessa chooses her door , she effectively divides the doors into Set A that contains her one door ( 1 % chance of including the prize ) , and Set B that contains 99 doors ( 99 % chance ) .
Our imaginary Monty then proceeds to reveal goats behind 98 of the 99 doors in Set B , skipping over one seemingly random door .
The odds that Contessa picked the winning door on her first try remain at one - in - a - hundred , so when asked if she wants to keep her original door or switch to that one other unopened door , the better answer is more obvious .
Monty is essentially asking , “ Do you want to keep your door and its chance of winning , or take all 99 of the other doors and their chance of winning ? ”
The problem is that the human brain is hard - wired to seek out patterns , discarding much of the non-patterned data .
This system usually works very well in keeping unimportant information from overwhelming the mind , but occasionally too much information ends up on the cutting - room floor .
There is another problem called the Gambler ’s Folly which also illustrates the mind ’s lackluster performance in gaging probability : Imagine that you flip an ordinary coin 99 times , and amazingly , it comes up heads every time .
What are the odds that it will come up heads again on the 100th flip ?
Most people would say that it ’s a very unlikely possibility , but it turns out that the odds are exactly 50 % ( overlooking the negligible chance that the coin will land on its edge ) .
The reason we think otherwise is because our pattern - oriented brains see the 100 - flip scenario as extremely rare , which it is ⁠— it has a one in 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 chance of happening .
But if you sit down and write out any random sequence of heads and tails , it has the exact same odds of appearing as does 100 heads .
The typical human brain just does n’t assign random sequences the same significance as clear patterns ⁠ — such as 100 heads on a coin flip⁠ — so the importance of the pattern is artificially inflated .
The human brain is a great pattern recognition engine , but sometimes that causes it to overlook the subtleties of numbers .
Where exactly is the river Pang ?
Maps say that this little chalk stream - the one believed to have inspired Kenneth Grahame 's Wind in the Willows - bubbles from a spring in the heart of the Berkshire Downs and flows south and east to the river Thames at Pangbourne .
But last week , when I went to find it , almost a third of the Pang was missing .
I went with Alastair Driver , the Environment Agency 's head of conservation , and it was certainly nowhere near where his map said it should be , just outside the village of East Ilsey .
Nor was it under Apple Pie Hill , grid reference SU5274979250 , where the Ordnance Survey map pinpointed it .
" I bet it 's there , in that ditch , " said Driver as we drove through the village of Compton on the edge of the Downs .
But it soon became clear that the river had migrated to lower ground .
" Pang ?
Dunno , never heard of it , " said Paul , a contractor replacing 10 km of leaking pipework for Thames Water on the other side of the road from the course of the Pang near Hampstead Norrey .
" There 's been no water in it for two years , " said the landlord of the White Hart Inn , which once overlooked the river .
" There used to be ducks in there - now look at it ... "
A wooden bridge outside the pub spanned only earth .
We did find water in the Pang three miles further on , but a game of Pooh sticks assured Driver that the river was not flowing and so was technically a pond .
Eventually we spied the Pang trickling gently over a gravel bed - at least nine miles from where we had started .
The first butterflies of the year flapped past blossom , a deer crossed the lane and Driver was ecstatic at the arrival of spring and the finding of the river .
But more generally , Driver is far from happy about the way things are going : he thinks that a wildlife disaster is now practically inevitable in south - eastern England this year because it has rained so little these past 16 months .
" Unless we get freakishly heavy rain you can assume that we are in for the toughest year since 1976 , " he told me later .
For most of Britain , emergency drought measures and government exhortations to save water seem irrelevant .
Last week , even as seven south - eastern water companies imposed hosepipe bans and three asked for more draconian drought orders , reservoirs in Wales and the west country were releasing water to prevent flooding .
Heavy rains and snow left rivers full in the north , and levels in underground aquifers across much of Britain were well above average .
But south and east of a line roughly from Norfolk to Hampshire , Britain is increasingly like a desert .
It 's one of the driest areas of Europe , and rainfall is declining .
Meanwhile the water - guzzling population is going ever up and the summers are getting ever warmer .
Because of the geology , the 11 million people who live there mostly get their water from boreholes which tap into chalk aquifers , but because there have been two consecutive dry winters , water levels are now seriously depleted - as can be seen in the Pang .
And because almost all the rain that falls between April to October is taken up by trees and plants or by evaporation , there is no chance that they are going to replenish at all before next winter .
But just how bad is the situation ?
The Environment Agency said this week that its monitoring borehole in the Chiltern hills was showing lower water levels even than in 1976 , the time of the worst drought in living memory .
Thames
Water , the country 's biggest water company , says that things are now " very serious " .
But then it would say that , you might argue - or how would it get us to reduce our consumption ?
So I asked one government water man to be brutally honest , off the record .
" It 's not an emergency - yet , " he said .
" But if it 's a dry summer , and anything goes wrong at the end of August or in September - such as a major water main burst - then you could have difficulties . "
What does that mean - water rationing ?
" Yes ... but the real nightmare is what happens if next winter is dry , too .
What happens if the aquifers do not get replenished as they should from October through to March ? "
Elliot Morley , the water minister , has been playing down the drought .
" The water supply in the south - east is not in crisis , " he reassured MPs last week .
But Mike Hegarty , for one , is not so sanguine .
The operations director of Sutton and East Surrey Water , which supplies 650,000 people south of London , is on the front line of drought defence .
This week , Hegarty 's company 's only reservoir , which provides 15 % of the company 's water , was full .
But most of its water comes from underground and its test borehole , showing the state of its underground water supplies - in use for the past 45 years - was registering its lowest levels ever .
Hegarty can't drill deeper for water because of pollution problems , and he can't dig elsewhere for water because there 's nowhere left to dig .
" We have had almost 30 % less rain in the past 18 months than the region normally receives .
This is a 100 - year event , " he says .
" We 're now in uncharted territory .
We do not really know how the boreholes will react .
We actually have less water available per person in a year than the Sudan , or Egypt . "
The difference , of course , between this region and Egypt , is that East Surrey is Britain 's seventh wealthiest region and the most water - profligate in Britain .
It has 50 golf courses , each using up to 7 m litres of water a season , as well as 2,000 private swimming pools , countless dishwashers and Gatwick airport .
On top of that , every man , woman and child in East Surrey uses nearly 170 litres a day , 40 more than the average .
People just do not understand the seriousness of the situation , says Hegarty .
Despite a hosepipe ban , letters to every household and ads in the cinemas , demand has still not been quenched , he says .
Now the company wants a drought order to allow it to ban car - washes , park and playing field watering , the filling of swimming pools , the playing of fountains and the cleaning of boats , among other things .
A group of window cleaners , some golf courses and the swimming pool maintenance workers have objected , but many of the region 's 17,000 businesses are probably unaware how hard they may be hit .
If the order is approved by Morley , Hegarty expects to cut demand at peak times in the summer by 25 % .
And if suburbia refuses to save water ?
He shrugs .
" It 's generally accepted that the resource is fully developed in the south east .
[ He means by this that there 's no water available . ]
It 's not as if we can borrow it .
We 're getting a bit from Thames , but everyone is in the same situation . "
In fact , few people in south - east England have much sympathy for the water companies .
Although rivers are evidently healthier and bathing waters cleaner than a decade ago , water charges have risen nearly 25 % in the past two years , and will go up again soon .
Meanwhile the companies leak 15 - 35 % of what they supply , and their profits are in many cases spectacular .
Thames Water , for example , is losing 227 m litres of water more per day from its pipes than it did in 2001 .
This is more than all of Leeds , with 800,000 people , uses each day .
" We would like what they leak , " says Hegarty .
Thames
Water says that it can't win .
" Until recently , all the regulatory pressure was to improve the water quality and sewerage .
That took the lion 's share of the investment , " says its spokesman , Nick Tennant .
He says the company now intends to replace 1,000 miles , or 5 % , of its ancient pipes by 2010 .
Then there are the 565,000 new houses the government intends to build in the south - east .
" Where will the water come from to supply the additional housing demand ? " asks Nick Herbert , MP for Arundel and South Downs , whose own patch is to take 58,000 new homes .
" Even after the pipes have been fixed and with much greater water efficiency , there 's no way we can keep up with that population increase , " says Thames Water .
The water companies view the future with alarm .
To make money they must sell as much water as possible , which means they must have access to as much as possible .
As they can no longer rely on underground water , and the Environment Agency will not let them draw any more from rivers , their best option , they believe , is to build reservoirs .
New ones are already planned for Southern Water , South East Water , Portsmouth Water and Thames Water .
Others propose to extend existing ones .
The government , embarrassed by its ecological illiteracy while planning for massive growth in a semi-arid region , and its refusal to insist on water minimisation standards in new homes , will probably allow most water companies to eventually build reservoirs but only when they have shown they have stopped their leaks and explored all other possibilities .
So it is that Thames Water , for one , is investigating desalination plants , a water grid , transferring water by canal , rain - cloud seeding , even towing icebergs down from the Arctic .
But it 's no secret that what it wants is a Very Big Reservoir .
Officially it 's called the Upper Thames Major Resource Development ( UTMRD ) .
Unofficially , it 's going to be a 10 square mile lake , one of the biggest in Britain - in a boggy area of Oxfordshire four miles from Abingdon .
It has been quietly planned for more than 10 years and is expected to cost nearly £ 1bn to construct .
Ecologists reckon it would be no great loss to the Thames Valley but local people are divided on the project .
Some want the reservoir to be made as beautiful as possible , to attract wildlife and water sports , while others want it as ugly as possible to deter crowds of sailors and traffic .
It would probably take 10 years to build and fill .
" We would just like it to come to a head , " says one member of a local residents ' group called Fluvius , which is talking to Thames Water about the reservoir .
" I was in a pub not long ago and asked how many people here were for the reservoir .
Only two were against .
Basically , [ it will be built on a ] flat agri -desert that grows lousy crops .
The main worries are whether it will affect the water table and flood our houses . "
Back near the River Pang , Driver finds a small pond , half full , in a nature reserve .
He bends down and shows me the egg of a great crested newt that is about to hatch .
He says it will probably die as the water evaporates over the next month or two - as will much of the insect life here .
" The water companies will undoubtedly apply to [ extract ] large amounts from rivers this summer , in which case wildlife will suffer badly .
The Pang can recover because it habitually migrates according to the water table , but it could take a decade or more for most rivers to recover if too much water is taken out of them .
" This is really all about how we use our water and how efficient we are with it .
It 's not as if we are going to die if we do n't use our dishwashers .
The question really is , should we be using a dishwasher and letting a river die ? "
We 've seen plenty of examples of the Bush administration 's love for rewarding disaster .
Screw up a little ?
Promotion .
Screw up a lot ?
Medal of Freedom time !
What does BushCo do about success ?
That 's been harder to characterize , because there have been so few successes in this administration that the policy went untested .
But we do have the example of Bob Maxwell .
When Bush came into office , it was Mr. Maxwell 's job with the Department of the Interior to conduct audits on oil firms and make sure they were paying royalties for the oil they extracted on public lands .
It was a job he did well .
During a 22 - year career , Bobby L. Maxwell routinely won accolades and awards as one of the Interior Department ’s best auditors in the nation ’s oil patch , snaring promotions that eventually had him supervising a staff of 120 people .
With Mr. Maxwell at the helm , the Interior Department recovered hundreds of millions of dollars that were owed to the American people , but which the oil companies tried to avoid paying .
But midway through the first Bush term , the administration did a slight reorganization of the Interior Department .
One that essentially ended oversight of the oil companies and kicked Mr. Maxwell to the curb .
That came exactly one week after a federal judge in Denver unsealed a lawsuit in which Mr. Maxwell contended that a major oil company had spent years cheating on royalty payments .
" When I got this citation , they told me this would be very good for my career , " said Mr. Maxwell , smiling during an interview here .
" Next thing I knew , they fired me . "
Today , at 53 , Mr. Maxwell lives on a $ 44,000 annual pension in a two - bedroom bungalow in the hills outside the Hawaiian capital .
Just so it 's clear : Maxwell had already recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for taxpayers .
He had just uncovered indications that a major oil company was cheating , costing taxpayers millions more .
His reward was to be " reorganized " out of a job .
In Bush World success cannot be tolerated – especially success which takes money from his pals in the oil patch .
Fortunately for all of us , Maxwell is not being quiet in his forced retirement .
Invoking a law that rewards private citizens who expose fraud against the government , Mr. Maxwell has filed a suit in federal court in Denver against the Kerr - McGee Corporation .
The suit accuses the company , which was recently acquired by Anadarko Petroleum , of bilking the government out of royalty payments .
It also contends that the Interior Department ignored audits indicating that Kerr - McGee was cheating .
Three other federal auditors , who once worked for Mr. Maxwell and still work at the Interior Department , have since filed similar suits of their own against other energy companies .
Every major oil company – from Exxon Mobil on down – has tried to get in Mr. Maxwell 's way , but he 's won every court battle .
Should he win the final judgment , Kerr - McGee will have to pony up another $ 50 Million .
We do n't often think of accountants as heroes , but Bob Maxwell certainly lives up to that title .
He 's waged a David vs. Goliath struggle against Big Oil in the name of the American public , and continues to fight even after he was thrown from his position .
It 's unlikely the Bush administration is going to award him a medal , but he certainly deserves public accolade .
The struggle Maxwell 's waging is only a small part of the Bush administration 's overall mismanagement of public resources .
In February , the Interior Department admitted that energy companies might escape more than $ 7 billion in royalty payments over the next five years because of errors in leases signed in the 1990s that officials are now scrambling to renegotiate .
The errors were discovered in 2000 , but were ignored for the next six years and have yet to be fixed .
Get that ?
The Bush administration came into office knowing that there were problems in the system that would cost the public $ 7 billion over five years , and they did n't do a thing to stop it .
They could have , but they did n't .
In fact , they removed the barriers that were keeping the companies from cheating even more .
Another $ 7 billion dollars given away to the oil companies .
Sounds like somebody 's in line for a medal !
Scientists have different theories on how our noses interpret smells .
by Mary Tucker
Smell is the most mysterious of the five senses - scientists are still not exactly sure how the nose decodes odors .
The sense of smell often seems like the forgotten sense , perhaps because scent cannot be transmitted as obviously as images or sound .
But watch a dog - with a sense of smell about a million times more sensitive than ours - identify a person by their smell or sniff out traces of drugs and it is obvious what a powerful means of communication it can be .
For humans , scent plays a big role in attraction and is strongly tied to memory .
But how is smell written into molecules ?
And how do our noses interact with scent molecules ?
Since classical times , scientists have been trying to pin down solid olfactory rules but they still do n't know exactly how the nose works .
Decoding the shape of smell
What we do know is the world is made of atoms and those atoms connect to make molecules .
Molecules are what we smell , from wherever they are evaporating , and they reach our nose through the air .
Though we know almost everything possible about molecules , we do n't know how our nose reads them .
Chemists make hundreds of new molecules every week but what each molecule is going to smell like is always a mystery .
The prevailing theory , first refined in 1952 by John Amoore at Oxford University , is the shape or steric theory of odor .
The theory , simply stated , proposes that the shape of a molecule determines its smell .
In other words , a rose molecule smells like a rose molecule because its shape is coded precisely for the nose to interpret this way .
It does this by a lock and key method within the olfactory nervous system : the shape of an airborne molecule ( the key ) fits into complementary odorant receptor proteins on the outside of the nasal cell ( the lock ) .
Amoore also proposed that there are seven primary odours ( ethereal , camphoraceous , musky , floral , minty , pungent and putrid ) .
But the shape theory is not without its pitfalls .
" Shapists " are plagued by the indisputable evidence that not all similarly shaped molecules smell alike , while sometimes differently shaped molecules do .
Also unexplained is the fact that humans can detect many more smells than there are odorant receptors in the nose .
Aware the shape theory does n't hold up to watertight scientific scrutiny , scientists have long been pursuing other explanations , with limited success .
Scent vibrations
In 1996 , Luca Turin , a biophysicist at University College London , thought he may have come up with the answer to how we smell .
In his new book The Secret of Scent ( Faber and Faber 2006 ) , he outlines his hotly contested vibrational theory of smell , and explains how " â€ ¦like the origin of life , the mechanism of general anaesthesia , the extinction of dinosaurs , the kinship of the Basque language , [ smell ] is a scientific Sword in the Stone . "
Photo credit : Gray 's Anatomy
This diagram shows the receptor neurons in the nose that convert odors to electrical signals that the brain can interpret .
Turin first came across the vibrational theory in the mid-1980s , noticing that it had first been conceived of in the 1930s , later revived in the 1960s , but both times discarded .
With the advent of modern technology , he was able to revisit the theory and apply new testing methods .
Vibrational theory states that molecules in every substance generate a specific vibration frequency that the nose interprets as a distinct smell .
More specifically , it speculates that the vibration frequency of odor molecules is converted to smell recognition via a form of electron tunnelling with the help of receptors in the lining of the nose .
In many ways , according to vibrational theory , the way we smell is similar to the way we hear .
A molecule 's vibrations play out like a chord of music - but instead of music , we get the chemical melody of scent .
In his investigations , Turin noticed that a vibration producing a wave number of 2500 always produced a smell of sulphur .
He then found a different molecule - with the same vibration frequency - that also possessed the same smell : the molecule borane .
After looking for molecules that were identical in shape but with different vibrations , he theorised that because they had their own unique " chord patterns " , they should have different smells .
Despite achieving an apparent scientific breakthrough , Turin was immediately confronted with criticism from members of the scientific community , who doggedly refused to support the publication of his research .
The backstabbing world of scientific peer review is the central preoccupation of Chandler Burr 's new acclaimed biography of Turin , The Emperor of Scent ( Random House , 2003 ) .
( Interestingly , Burr , an ardent supporter of Turin 's work , has recently been named by The New York Times as their first ever perfume critic ) .
Despite much vindication from Burr and other members of the press , Turin 's vibrational theory - like the shape theory -- has not been immune to inconsistencies .
Experiments done in 2004 by Vosshall and Keller at Rockefeller University found three of Turin 's proposed predictions on the vibrational nature of smell to be false .
Whether the shape or vibrational theory , a combination of the two - or something completely different - gains further and credible scientific ground remains to be seen .
For the foreseeable future , the debate rages onâ€ ¦

SBC 's pending acquisition of AT&T will make the resultant merged company which is expected to take the name of ATT the largest telecommunications company in the United States .
And with big britches come big statements , as illustrated in this exerted interview with SBC's CEO Edward Whitacre .
I suspect that you might want to sit down and take deep breath before reading Whitacre 's response to the following question :
How concerned are you about Internet upstarts like Google ( GOOG ) , MSN , Vonage , and others ?
How do you think they 're going to get to customers ?
Through a broadband pipe .
Cable companies have them .
We have them .
Now what they would like to do is use my pipes free , but I ain't going to let them do that because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it .
So there 's going to have to be some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay for the portion they 're using .
Why should they be allowed to use my pipes ?
The Internet can't be free in that sense , because we and the cable companies have made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo !
( YHOO ) or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes [ for ] free is nuts !
Whiteacre 's sleight of hand is cute almost endearing .
He tries so hard to make this about cost and competition , but he leaves out the most important part : their customers .
It 's SBC 's DSL customers who are paying to " use these pipes , " and the idea that certain kinds of usage are categorically different than others has a fair share of problems .
On the technical level , IP traffic is IP traffic .
The customer downloading scores of images from NASA is n't really different from someone making a call on VoIP .
If , like SBC , you sell your DSL at speed - based packages , then aside from limitations you have spelled out in your Terms of Service , that traffic is the customers ' to use .
Furthermore , where do you draw the line ?
SBC wants to charge you for VoIP , but why not charge you for your access to the Wall Street Journal , or your iTunes Video downloads , or your pr0n site subscriptions ?
Forget that , why not charge website owners when your users visit their pages ?
Of course , we can all see what 's going on here .
As I warned last week , the issue of " network neutrality " is going to become increasingly large as companies who provide Internet access get jealous of the companies that are using internet access to offer new products and services .
And , as I noted then , there 's software in development aimed squarely at death by nickel and dime .
The irony of all of this , and it is a fantastic example of real irony , is that SBC decries the likes of Google and Vonage because of " unfair competition , " when plenty of SBC customers will tell you that they use SBC because their local market does n't have any other competitive choices .
In fact , not only is SBC the sole choice in some areas , but SBC also forces its customers to also have landline service , even if they only want naked DSL .
I 'll make a prediction : if SBC starts in with implementing this inanity , their customer base will dwindle .
In the meantime , let 's all pull for better telecommunications laws , while keeping our eyes peeled for backdoors bought and paid for by the lobbies .
One third of giant planet systems may also harbour Earth - like planets
Because of the way we currently look for planets around other stars , most that have been detected so far have been gas giants like Jupiter or Saturn .
But one - third of these giant planet systems may also harbour worlds like our own , according to an analysis by scientists in the US .
Details of the research appear in the latest issue of the journal Science .
The study focused on a type of planetary system containing so - called " Hot Jupiters " .
These massive bodies orbit extremely close to their parent stars - in some cases closer than Mercury circles the Sun .
The technique commonly used to find these distant planets detects their gravitational pull on a star .
So there is a bias towards finding massive worlds orbiting close to their parent " sun " .
Hot Jupiters are thought to have migrated inward toward their stars as their planetary systems were forming .
Debris field
At this stage the evolving planetary system is populated with small planetoids , icy and rocky debris and gas in a " protoplanetary disc " .
A gas giant ploughing through this orbiting material creates considerable disturbance .
But how exactly this affects the evolving planetary system is the matter of some debate .
Previously , researchers have proposed that inward migration of gas giants caused the disc material either to be vacuumed up or ejected from the cosmic neighbourhood .
" There is certainly scattering , but one of the things people did not take into account was the dense gas in these protoplanetary discs , " said co-author Avi Mandell , from Pennsylvania State University , US .
" This gas provides the force that migrates the giant planets inwards but it also damps down the scattering and ejection of particles allowing them to stay caught in the orbit of the star .
" They stay in rather chaotic and often wide orbits ; but usually if they remain in the system for millions of years , they settle down and return to a circular orbit where they can merge with other bodies and turn into full planets . "
Habitable zone
The researchers , led by Sean Raymond , of the University of Colorado at Boulder , carried out computer simulations of gas giant migration in forming planetary systems .
They started off with more than 1,000 virtual Moon - sized objects made of rock and ice and simulated about 200 million years of planetary evolution .
The team concluded that about one of every three known planetary systems could harbour Earth - like planets in habitable zones further out than the Hot Jupiters .
The habitable zone is the region of a planetary system which is neither too hot nor too cold - such that water on the surface of a planet will neither evaporate nor freeze , but instead can stay liquid .
" Our simulations show that you can form a giant planet where Jupiter is in our system and move it through to the inner part of the system .
Planets like Earth can still form outside them - as long as they do n't get too close to the giant planet , " Avi Mandell told the BBC News website .
" If you get too close , the gas giant will scatter material outwards .
But if you are far enough away , material can continue to form outside it . "
Earth - like planets in habitable zones form in the presence of large amounts of water , the researchers suggest .
This raises the possibility that planets like ours orbiting in habitable zones could be covered in oceans - providing all the key constituents required for life .
" We now think there is a new class of ocean - covered - and possibly habitable - planets in solar systems unlike our own , " said Dr Raymond .
The simulations also showed that rocky planets known as Hot Earths often form inside the orbits of Hot Jupiters .
A team at the University of California , Berkeley , has already found one such example , orbiting just two million miles from its parent star .
THE brain is the most complicated object known .
How it gets that complicated is , however , almost completely unknown .
But part of the answer may turn out to be junk — at least that is the conclusion of a study led by Fred Gage of the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , which has just been published in Nature .
One of the puzzling features of the human genome is that although genes are numerous they actually form less than 5 % of the DNA in a cell nucleus .
The rest was thus , rather cavalierly , dubbed “ junk DNA ” by those who discovered it .
Gradually , a role for some of this junk has emerged .
In particular , parts of it regulate the activity of genes , and thus which proteins are produced and in what quantities .
That has implications for what a cell does — or , to put it another way , what type of cell it is .
One of the most puzzling sorts of junk , though , is something known as a LINE - 1 retrotransposon .
This is junk that wo n't stay in one place .
Retrotransposons are sometimes known as “ jumping genes ” .
They pop from chromosome to chromosome with gay abandon .
The assumption has been that they are genetic parasites .
They resemble retroviruses , which certainly are parasites ( HIV , the cause of AIDS , is a retrovirus ) .
And the effect of a string of irrelevant LINE - 1 DNA popping into the middle of a functional gene is indeed traumatic .
The gene in question stops working .
The parasite hypothesis is supported by the fact that although bits of DNA that look as if they have once been part of a LINE - 1 element make up 20 % of the human genome ( ie , they are more than four times as abundant as real genes ) , only 100 retrotransposons are actually able to leap around , and only ten of those leap often .
By and large , the parasites have been disabled , suggesting they are such bad news that evolution has eliminated them .
Dr Gage and his colleagues , however , suspect that at least some of those that have not been disabled have been allowed to live on for a purpose .
Instead of being destroyed , they have been subverted — and what they have been subverted to do is to create complexity in the brain .
Light fantastic
The researchers were led to this idea when they scanned the stem - cell precursors of nerve cells with a device called a gene chip .
This detects the activity of genes by measuring the presence of the molecular messengers they send into the cell to do their bidding .
To their surprise , the researchers discovered a lot of LINE - 1 messengers , suggesting that retrotransposons are active in these precursor cells .
To find out what was going on , Dr Gage and his colleagues built a piece of DNA that included a human LINE - 1 retrotransposon ; a gene for a molecule called green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) ; a genetic switch to turn the whole lot on ; and a special sequence of DNA that keeps the switch in the “ off ” position unless the retrotransposon jumps from one place to another .
The result of all this genetic engineering was a system that produces light in cells in which a retrotransposon has jumped .
And GFP glows green , as its name suggests , so such cells are easy to spot .
The researchers spliced their creation into the DNA of nerve - cell precursor cells from rats ( which they then grew as laboratory cultures ) .
They also spliced it into the DNA of a line of mice , so that it was present in every cell in the mice 's bodies .
Nerve - cell precursors can turn into two types of brain cell besides nerve cells .
These other two types have supporting , rather than starring roles in the brain , and cannot transmit nerve impulses .
The rat - cell work showed that LINE - 1 jumping happens only in precursors that turn into nerve cells , and that it seems to be regulated by a protein called Sox2 that is already known to play a crucial role in the formation of nerve cells .
The mouse work showed that LINE - 1 was not jumping in any other parts of the body ( except , oddly , the sex cells — a result that had been seen before ) .
That suggests it is happening in the brain for a purpose .
The mouse work also showed that the retrotransposons were jumping mainly into genes that are active while precursor cells are changing into their destined cell types .
The team identified a dozen and a half such genes that were affected by LINE - 1 , and followed up one of them , PSD - 93 , in detail .
PSD - 93 makes a protein found in the places where nerve cells touch each other and pass their signals on .
When LINE - 1 jumped to a location in the genome near PSD - 93 it increased production of the protein .
That increase , at least in cell cultures , made it likelier that a developing precursor cell would turn into a nerve cell .
So much is observation .
This is where the speculation comes in .
Brain formation is an incredibly wasteful process .
About half of the nerve cells created in a developing brain have died by the time that brain has formed .
Many researchers think that which cells live and which die is decided by a process similar to natural selection .
Cells with the right properties in the right places flourish ; those without wither .
But natural selection requires random variation to generate the various properties .
Retrotransposons could provide that variation , by affecting gene expression at random , depending on where they pitch up .
Changing the quantities of proteins such as the one made by PSD - 93 would probably change the nature of the affected cell quite radically , and might even be responsible for generating the different types of nerve cell that are known to exist .
Certainly , the brain has many more different types of cell in it than any other organ .
A similar idea about generating variation has been proposed in the past , to explain the activity of LINE - 1 elements in sex cells .
This , the theory goes , would bolster variety in an individual 's offspring above and beyond the variation already provided by sexual reproduction .
That is an interesting idea .
But the thought that the complexity of the mammalian brain — and the existence of human intelligence — depends on variety induced by a tamed genetic parasite is truly audacious .
Whether it is true remains to be seen .
George Orwell has earned the right to be called one of the finer writers in the English language through such novels as 1984 , Animal Farm , and Down and Out in Paris and London , and essays like " Shooting an Elephant . "
Orwell excoriated totalitarian governments in his work , but he was just as passionate about good writing .
Thus , you may want to hear some of Orwells writing tips .
A scrupulous writer , in every sentence that he writes , will ask himself at least four questions , thus :
What am I trying to say ?
What words will express it ?
What image or idiom will make it clearer ?
Is this image fresh enough to have an effect ?
And he will probably ask himself two more :
Could I put it more shortly ?
Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly ?
One can often be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase , and one needs rules that one can rely on when instinct fails .
I think the following rules will cover most cases :
Never use a metaphor , simile , or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print .
Never use a long word where a short one will do .
If it is possible to cut a word out , always cut it out .
Never use the passive where you can use the active .
Never use a foreign phrase , a scientific word , or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent .
Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous .
From Orwell 's essay " Politics and the English Language . "

I am a welfare kid .
Oldest of 5 children , mother has a 9th grade education .
She married my father at 15 ( he was 21 ) , had me a year later at age 16 , and so forth .
Father has an 8th grade education .
Dear dad took off after 10 years of marriage - have heard I have several unknown siblings out there somewhere .
No , he never once paid a penny of child support .
He just left .
Mom 's family is from Missouri - you guessed it , trailer parks , shacks , too many people stuffed into small houses with too many animals , bugs and parasites .
We were the runny - nosed kids in worn - out clothes people looked down on to make themselves feel better .
After dear dad took off , mom supported us by working in various nursing homes as a nurse 's aid or as a laundry person .
Other jobs she had were motel maid , waitress , phone sales , cleaning taverns after closing , etc .
We have been homeless , living in a borrowed car , eating at missions when we were in larger towns / cities .
Oh , did I mention the places we lived ?
Before I was 18 , we lived in Missouri , Okalahoma , Kansas , Arkansas , California , Utah , South Dakota and Oregon .
We rarely spent more than 6 months in the same place , same school district , usually it was a completely different town .
We stood in the free cheese lines , went to the church clothes closets , accepted the Thanksgiving and Christmas kindnesses of strangers with as much dignity as possible .
We endured sermons from all the different churches that my mom tried to get help from .
Rarely did the help come .
Did we like it ?
Not a danged minute of it .
The sympathetic looks from the do - gooders who pretended to care .
Those who expected us to fall at their feet because they brought us a turkey .
Am I grateful ?
Yes .
To my mother .
She found ways to feed us when there was no food .
When I was a bitchy teenager refusing to stoop so low as to " go begging " as I called it , she went alone or with one of my brothers .
I was ashamed that we were so poor .
Teenagers hate being different , no matter what they tell you .
As a young teen , I babysat for money to buy a pair of " cool " jeans so I could be something like the other kids .
I wore that stupid pair of jeans until they wore out and then bought another pair .
The people I remember most from childhood are those who looked upon us as people and not a cause .
Those who sat with us , laughed with us , just talked with us .
Those who looked beyond the ragged clothing and to the people we were .
My brothers were unruly at times - guess what , mom was tired .
She did n't always have the energy to do it all .
Mom made sure we could all read , spell and write well .
She knew we would be judged by that .
She also made sure we had books no matter where we were .
libraries are free .
Those books became escapes from lives we could not deal with sometimes .
All but one of us dropped out of high school .
With the moving around , it was almost impossible .
We received GEDs instead .
Today , all we kids are grown .
I am completing my Bachelors .
My sister has almost completed her Masters .
My three brothers work as a computer tech , sheetrock hauler and a med aide in a nursing home .
I do n't have children but my siblings have given me nine wonderful nephews and nieces .
Growing up , we learned early on that all we really had was one another .
We currently all live within 5 miles of one another .
When I count my best friends , I count my brothers and sister first .
We live far away from my mother 's family .
They are the very definition of dysfuntion .
Not good people to be around in any situation .
I 'm not sure how it happened , but none of us were ever in jail , ever addicted to anything more than nicotine .
According to some statistics and to most people 's prejudice on this board , we should all be white trash meth addicts .
For those of you who look down upon those little kids with hungry eyes and brave faces , reach out to them instead of judging .
It can really make a difference .
Thanks for reading .
A post on the Register , claiming that Google might be close to rolling out a " Goobuntu " Linux desktop distro , has been making the usual rounds in the tech news circuit today .
Despite today being earnings release day , presumably a very busy time at the Google press relations office , technology spokeswoman Sonya Borälv responded very quickly to my query on the topic .
She said that " [ w ] e use Ubuntu internally but have no plans to distribute it outside of the company . "
The fine folks behind Ubuntu will be happy with this indirect endorsement by one of the biggest names in technology , but there wo n't be any Goobuntu PCs on the shelves of your local Best Buy for the foreseeable future .
The Register is probably right when it says that Ubuntu stands to gain from having Google engineers working on their code , but the main premise for the article is easily dismissed .
The idea of Goobuntu is n't exactly new ( French skills required ) , but the rumors and doctored screenshots of Goobuntu or other purported Google OSs have always turned out to be nothing more than hot air .
Yet every time one rumor gets shot down , another one emerges a few weeks later , and the media circus begins again .
Why this fascination with the possibility of a Google OS ?
Perhaps it 's a byproduct of Google 's recent forays into desktop tools .
To wit : there 's the Desktop Search utility , Google Talk instant messenger , Google Earth mapping toy , and more , but a full - blown consumer OS is a different ballgame .
The Google web browser is another rumor that just wo n't die , and until that one happens , we 're unlikely to see a more complex product like a Google Linux .
Licensing could be another issue holding back any public efforts to provide a Google OS .
If Ubuntu adopts GPL 3 for any significant part of its distribution , the expected DRM - hating nature of that license would make it hard to reconcile Ubuntu , or any other OS or software released under GPL 3 , with Google Video and any future Google Music service , which depend on DRM for their existence .
Linus Torvalds has said that the Linux kernel will not be covered by GPL 3 , but until it 's clear which way distributions like Ubuntu or the underlying Debian will go with the major underpinnings of the OS , it might be unwise for any company invested in DRM - dependent services to start any major OS - related projects .
The Debian project is well known for its freedom - lovin ' attitude , though the community is not unequivocally supportive of GPL 3 .
Come back next month for another Google OS rumor deconstructed .
I have tried to distill the techniques and tricks I have developed over the years into a set of tips .
Hopefully , these will be useful to people trying to become better programmers .
Enjoy !
Any comments , advice , additional tips , what have you , can be mailed to the author .
This is a work in progress .
As time permits , I will keep adding new ideas .
These tips are primarily focused on C .
Also , these tips are intended for intermediate - to - advanced programmers .
Some of these ideas may be applicable to other languages , and may be useful to beginning programmers as well .
If so , please let me know .
There was a point in my career when I had a fair bit of experience , and was trying to learn more .
Unfortunately , there was n't much information about how to become a better programmer .
What books that were available were mostly teaching beginners , or were teaching project management ( software engineering ) .
Later , I had some time and I started writing a book on the subject .
I could never quite finish it .
However , I did manage to get into the form of a full - day lecture .
That had a couple of problems .
The first was that it only reached a small audience .
( The other was that my throat could n't take a full day of lecturing . )
So , instead , I decided to convert the course into this set of web pages .
I still intend to write a book using this material some day .
So , please , use it for your own education , link to it , recommend it to your colleagues - but do n't take it any further .
Particularly do n't incorporate it into your own book .
Also known as , why should I listen to you .
I 've got a fair bit of experience programming ; mostly system software - stuff like compilers , operating systems & device drivers , interpreters & virtual machines , etc .
Its been mostly in C , but there are a fair number of other languages in the mix - including odd - ball stuff like Forth , Prolog , ML , Lisp and SIMULA , as well as assembler , C++ , Python etc .
At this point I 've written well over 600,000 lines of code ; it may even be as much as a million .
I 've also got a some experience from the hardware end of things - I 've done things like help design new micro-processors and port Linux to both embedded development platforms and large multi-processor systems .

RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday November 29 , 2006 Print This Email This
In the name of God , the Compassionate , the Merciful O , Almighty God , bestow upon humanity the perfect human being promised to all by You , and make us among his followers .
Noble Americans ,
Were we not faced with the activities of the US administration in this part of the world and the negative ramifications of those activities on the daily lives of our peoples , coupled with the many wars and calamities caused by the US administration as well as the tragic consequences of US interference in other countries ;
Were the American people not God-fearing , truth - loving , and justice - seeking , while the US administration actively conceals the truth and impedes any objective portrayal of current realities ;
And if we did not share a common responsibility to promote and protect freedom and human dignity and integrity ;
Then , there would have been little urgency to have a dialogue with you .
While Divine providence has placed Iran and the United States geographically far apart , we should be cognizant that human values and our common human spirit , which proclaim the dignity and exalted worth of all human beings , have brought our two great nations of Iran and the United States closer together .
Both our nations are God-fearing , truth - loving and justice - seeking , and both seek dignity , respect and perfection .
Both greatly value and readily embrace the promotion of human ideals such as compassion , empathy , respect for the rights of human beings , securing justice and equity , and defending the innocent and the weak against oppressors and bullies .
We are all inclined towards the good , and towards extending a helping hand to one another , particularly to those in need .
We all deplore injustice , the trampling of peoples ' rights and the intimidation and humiliation of human beings .
We all detest darkness , deceit , lies and distortion , and seek and admire salvation , enlightenment , sincerity and honesty .
The pure human essence of the two great nations of Iran and the United States testify to the veracity of these statements .
Noble Americans ,
Our nation has always extended its hand of friendship to all other nations of the world .
Hundreds of thousands of my Iranian compatriots are living amongst you in friendship and peace , and are contributing positively to your society .
Our people have been in contact with you over the past many years and have maintained these contacts despite the unnecessary restrictions of US authorities .
As mentioned , we have common concerns , face similar challenges , and are pained by the sufferings and afflictions in the world .
We , like you , are aggrieved by the ever - worsening pain and misery of the Palestinian people .
Persistent aggressions by the Zionists are making life more and more difficult for the rightful owners of the land of Palestine .
In broad day - light , in front of cameras and before the eyes of the world , they are bombarding innocent defenseless civilians , bulldozing houses , firing machine guns at students in the streets and alleys , and subjecting their families to endless grief .
No day goes by without a new crime .
Palestinian mothers , just like Iranian and American mothers , love their children , and are painfully bereaved by the imprisonment , wounding and murder of their children .
What mother would n't ?
For 60 years , the Zionist regime has driven millions of the inhabitants of Palestine out of their homes .
Many of these refugees have died in the Diaspora and in refugee camps .
Their children have spent their youth in these camps and are aging while still in the hope of returning to homeland .
You know well that the US administration has persistently provided blind and blanket support to the Zionist regime , has emboldened it to continue its crimes , and has prevented the UN Security Council from condemning it .
Who can deny such broken promises and grave injustices towards humanity by the US administration ?
Governments are there to serve their own people .
No people wants to side with or support any oppressors .
But regrettably , the US administration disregards even its own public opinion and remains in the forefront of supporting the trampling of the rights of the Palestinian people .
Let 's take a look at Iraq .
Since the commencement of the US military presence in Iraq , hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed , maimed or displaced .
Terrorism in Iraq has grown exponentially .
With the presence of the US military in Iraq , nothing has been done to rebuild the ruins , to restore the infrastructure or to alleviate poverty .
The US Government used the pretext of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , but later it became clear that that was just a lie and a deception .
Although Saddam was overthrown and people are happy about his departure , the pain and suffering of the Iraqi people has persisted and has even been aggravated .
In Iraq , about one hundred and fifty thousand American soldiers , separated from their families and loved ones , are operating under the command of the current US administration .
A substantial number of them have been killed or wounded and their presence in Iraq has tarnished the image of the American people and government .
Their mothers and relatives have , on numerous occasions , displayed their discontent with the presence of their sons and daughters in a land thousands of miles away from US shores .
American soldiers often wonder why they have been sent to Iraq .
I consider it extremely unlikely that you , the American people , consent to the billions of dollars of annual expenditure from your treasury for this military misadventure .
Noble Americans ,
You have heard that the US administration is kidnapping its presumed opponents from across the globe and arbitrarily holding them without trial or any international supervision in horrendous prisons that it has established in various parts of the world .
God knows who these detainees actually are , and what terrible fate awaits them .
You have certainly heard the sad stories of the Guantanamo and Abu - Ghraib prisons .
The US administration attempts to justify them through its proclaimed " war on terror . "
But every one knows that such behavior , in fact , offends global public opinion , exacerbates resentment and thereby spreads terrorism , and tarnishes the US image and its credibility among nations .
The US administration 's illegal and immoral behavior is not even confined to outside its borders .
You are witnessing daily that under the pretext of " the war on terror , " civil liberties in the United States are being increasingly curtailed .
Even the privacy of individuals is fast losing its meaning .
Judicial due process and fundamental rights are trampled upon .
Private phones are tapped , suspects are arbitrarily arrested , sometimes beaten in the streets , or even shot to death .
I have no doubt that the American people do not approve of this behavior and indeed deplore it .
The US administration does not accept accountability before any organization , institution or council .
The US administration has undermined the credibility of international organizations , particularly the United Nations and its Security Council .
But , I do not intend to address all the challenges and calamities in this message .
The legitimacy , power and influence of a government do not emanate from its arsenals of tanks , fighter aircrafts , missiles or nuclear weapons .
Legitimacy and influence reside in sound logic , quest for justice and compassion and empathy for all humanity .
The global position of the United States is in all probability weakened because the administration has continued to resort to force , to conceal the truth , and to mislead the American people about its policies and practices .
Undoubtedly , the American people are not satisfied with this behavior and they showed their discontent in the recent elections .
I hope that in the wake of the mid-term elections , the administration of President Bush will have heard and will heed the message of the American people .
My questions are the following :
Is there not a better approach to governance ?
Is it not possible to put wealth and power in the service of peace , stability , prosperity and the happiness of all peoples through a commitment to justice and respect for the rights of all nations , instead of aggression and war ?
We all condemn terrorism , because its victims are the innocent .
But , can terrorism be contained and eradicated through war , destruction and the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocents ?
If that were possible , then why has the problem not been resolved ?
The sad experience of invading Iraq is before us all .
What has blind support for the Zionists by the US administration brought for the American people ?
It is regrettable that for the US administration , the interests of these occupiers supersedes the interests of the American people and of the other nations of the world .
What have the Zionists done for the American people that the US administration considers itself obliged to blindly support these infamous aggressors ?
Is it not because they have imposed themselves on a substantial portion of the banking , financial , cultural and media sectors ?
I recommend that in a demonstration of respect for the American people and for humanity , the right of Palestinians to live in their own homeland should be recognized so that millions of Palestinian refugees can return to their homes and the future of all of Palestine and its form of government be determined in a referendum .
This will benefit everyone .
Now that Iraq has a Constitution and an independent Assembly and Government , would it not be more beneficial to bring the US officers and soldiers home , and to spend the astronomical US military expenditures in Iraq for the welfare and prosperity of the American people ?
As you know very well , many victims of Katrina continue to suffer , and countless Americans continue to live in poverty and homelessness .
I 'd also like to say a word to the winners of the recent elections in the US :
The United States has had many administrations ; some who have left a positive legacy , and others that are neither remembered fondly by the American people nor by other nations .
Now that you control an important branch of the US Government , you will also be held to account by the people and by history .
If the US Government meets the current domestic and external challenges with an approach based on truth and Justice , it can remedy some of the past afflictions and alleviate some of the global resentment and hatred of America .
But if the approach remains the same , it would not be unexpected that the American people would similarly reject the new electoral winners , although the recent elections , rather than reflecting a victory , in reality point to the failure of the current administration 's policies .
These issues had been extensively dealt with in my letter to President Bush earlier this year .
To sum up :
It is possible to govern based on an approach that is distinctly different from one of coercion , force and injustice .
It is possible to sincerely serve and promote common human values , and honesty and compassion .
It is possible to provide welfare and prosperity without tension , threats , imposition or war .
It is possible to lead the world towards the aspired perfection by adhering to unity , monotheism , morality and spirituality and drawing upon the teachings of the Divine Prophets .
Then , the American people , who are God-fearing and followers of Divine religions , will overcome every difficulty .
What I stated represents some of my anxieties and concerns .
I am confident that you , the American people , will play an instrumental role in the establishment of justice and spirituality throughout the world .
The promises of the Almighty and His prophets will certainly be realized , Justice and Truth will prevail and all nations will live a true life in a climate replete with love , compassion and fraternity .
The US governing establishment , the authorities and the powerful should not choose irreversible paths .
As all prophets have taught us , injustice and transgression will eventually bring about decline and demise .
Today , the path of return to faith and spirituality is open and unimpeded .
We should all heed the Divine Word of the Holy Qur'an : " But those who repent , have faith and do good may receive Salvation .
Your Lord , alone , creates and chooses as He will , and others have no part in His choice ; Glorified is God and Exalted above any partners they ascribe to Him . " ( 28:67 - 68 ) I pray to the Almighty to bless the Iranian and American nations and indeed all nations of the world with dignity and success .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad President of the Islamic Republic of Iran 29 November 2006
Why are conspiracy theories so popular ?
We may not always believe what we 're told , but we still can't resist listening to them .
Guy Smith , producer of 9/11 : The Conspiracy Files , suggests the answer may lie deep within us all .
I admit it .
If I 'm being really honest , I can't deny that I 'm a bit of a conspiracy theorist .
Perhaps we all are .
It 's easy to dismiss all conspiracy theories as " bunkum " , but remember just occasionally they do turn out to be true .
Remember Watergate ?
Iran -contra ?
Special Branch collusion with loyalist terrorists in Northern Ireland ?
As Jim Fetzer , one of the leading 9/11 conspiracy theorists , says : " Just because you 're paranoid , does n't mean they are n't out to get you . "
The Conspiracy Files website
The 9/11 conspiracy movement Q&A : What really happened Timeline : 9/11
Programme preview I 've just spent the best part of nine months investigating the numerous conspiracy theories surrounding the al - Qaeda attacks on 11 September , 2001 .
They range from the plausible - that intelligence agencies in the Middle East may have had some inside knowledge about what was planned - to the totally wacky - that United 93's passengers were abducted by government agents .
But the deeper you dig in the dark world of conspiracies , the more you realise that different theories share much in common .
The conspiracy theorist seizes on any apparent inconsistency and from that germ of truth the story is built up .
What happened to the white car apparently involved in Diana 's accident ?
Was there a second gunman on the Grassy Knoll ?
And why did it take so long to scramble US fighters on 9/11 ?
And we can't help but be fascinated by them .
Perhaps it 's because deep down , we 're all story tellers .
It 's one of the things that makes us who we are .
Since the dawn of time , we 've been creating heroes and monsters as a way of trying to make sense of the world .
In the beginning , we told those tales round camp fires .
Now , it 's through internet chat rooms or on mobile phones .
But it 's still basically the same process - weaving stories out of real life .
Tablets of clay Nearly five thousand years ago , the legend of Gilgamesh was scratched on to clay tablets by scribes in ancient Mesopotamia , now Iraq .
It 's an epic tale of good guys and demons fighting it out in an uncertain world where those we love can be snatched from us at the whim of the gods .
One of the original conspiracies : the Epic of Gilgamesh Archaeologists believe it was the first story ever to be written down and as I researched the 9/11 conspiracy theories , I was struck how The Epic of Gilgamesh has many parallels with modern conspiracy theories .
When something awful , inexplicable or just plain evil rocks our world , we have an instinctive need to construct elaborate explanations to try and make sense of our anxiety and fear .
Many eye - witnesses to 9/11 thought , " This terrible event can't just be something as simple as 19 young hijackers armed with pocket knives .
There must be more too it than that - because the alternative is just too horrific to contemplate . "
That alternative is a realisation we are all vulnerable to forces beyond our control ; even princesses and presidents are n't immune to " everyday " tragedies like road accidents or random acts of violence .
" I believe the idea that conspiracy theorists are looking for a bigger reason is absolutely right , " says Frank Spotnitz , writer of The X Files .
Feels ' unfair '
" I think the most potent targets for conspiracy theories are events of disproportionate tragedy .
For example , the president of the United States is assassinated by a lone gunman .
It does n't seem fair , it does n't seem right , it ca n't be .
This one guy could n't have done it - there must be larger forces at work . "
The most potent targets for conspiracy theory are events of disproportionate tragedy
Frank Spotnitz , The X Files writer
Frank Spotnitz on conspiracy theories
And so we take comfort in complicated stories about wider conspiracies , usually involving remote , distant figures .
In the past it was mythical gods and monsters .
In the more secular modern world , ancient superstitions have been discarded - now it 's out - of - touch leaders and unseen government agencies who fill the role of the bogeymen .
We find it reassuring to create an explanation that vindicates our world view .
It reinforces our beliefs , suspicions and , yes , even our prejudices .
And from Homer to Harry Potter , the stories we weave always have a hero who is trying to seek out " the truth " .
Their mission is to go where mere mortals fear to tread - whether it be the Minotaur 's labyrinth or the labyrinthine recesses of the secret state - and bring back knowledge to share with the rest of us .
In the age of the internet , those fearless warriors are the self - styled conspiracy theorists whose hunting grounds are the furthest strands of the web .
There one can find any number of rumours , stories or scenarios which can be strung together to create the perfect explanation for just about anything that goes wrong in the world .
Your rational half knows these theories probably are n't true , but our instinctive side thinks , well just maybe there 's something in it .
In 5,000 years , we have n't changed at all .
And maybe that 's a very reassuring thing to know .
9/11 : The Conspiracy Files was broadcast on Sunday , 18 February 2007 at 2100 GMT on BBC Two .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
I totally disagree with the author of this piece .
Obviously he must work for an undercover government department and is trying to poo poo conspiracy theories .
The reason I believe some CT's is not due to some romantic storytelling desire .
It is because sometimes there are so many inconsistencies in the official versions of events .
Also sometimes there is proof and evidence that something different happened to what the authorities ( who may have their own reasons for you to believe differently ) are telling you .
Steve Wilson , Weymouth , Dorset I believe that every human being enjoys analysing different conspiracy theories , would n't life be dull without someone else 's views ?
The fact is , we can't settle on a particular answer without totally checking every possible theory , whether it's a huge disaster such as 9/11 or who took the last of the lemonade .
It 's human nature to question , that has n't changed in 5,000 years , so therefore wo n't ever change .
It 's a way of life .
Sophie , Plymouth I think it 's the factual discrepancies of 9/11 , such as steel allegedly melting at an unnaturally low temperature , and the numerous anomalies around the Pentagon impact , that has given rise to doubts rather than any inability to deal with reality .
If reality is causing a problem to anyone with that event , it will be the people who claim that the laws of physics changed beyond all recognition that day .
Chandra , London Sorry Chandra no conspiracy there , as a metallurgist I can tell you that the current evidence is not for any melting of steel in the WTC , rather a softening , as starts to occur at 425C .
A quite normal event in any large fire .
Edward , Sheffield
The problem I have with many conspiracy theories is that they often rely on the fallacy that because of the perceived lack of evidence to support version A of why something happened , version B MUST be the right one .
Imagine you are arrested for the murder of someone you have never met .
You might not be able to produce any evidence that you were n't responsible , but that does not , on its own , mean that you MUST therefore be guilty .
The police would need evidence that you were responsible at least on the face of it in order to charge you .
The journalists involved in breaking the Watergate story revealed the " alternative " truth about the burglary , supported by evidence .
Why do n't we demand the same standards today ?
Pie in the sky
There have been conspiracies in the past , so you can't dismiss a conspiracy theory on the grounds that conspiracies never exist .
Second , the reason humans have a deep - seated weakness for these theories is that we are programmed to try to find patterns in order to explain the world .
Sometimes the patterns are random and we impose a false order on the information , but it is wrong to say that this desire is anything to do with storytelling .
Grant , London UK
I have worked on a TV show called the Conspiracy Zone which aired on the now defunct TNN network .
Conspiracy theories are like good gossip , everybody wants to hear - truth or not .
Iman Morales , New York City I do not in principle disagree that conspiracy theories cannot always be attributed to such events as pointed out in your article .
I also understand that in the cases of Diana and JFK we do tend to want to find the bogeyman lurking in the background .
I am led to believe that the US government of 1941 knew about the Japanese coming to bomb Perl Harbour and allowed it to happen in order to overcome political opposition to joining WWII .
It is a logical political thing to happen , however distasteful it may seem .
By the same token I must ask myself if I could have sat quietly listening to a secret service agent telling me that an aircraft had been flown into the World Trade Centre and calmly continue reading to a group of school children ?
Either Bush is dumber than we all think or he was counting the aircraft , allowing it all to happen before reacting .
The reaction being to commence the war on terror .
Tim Crilly , Hahnheim , Germany Come now .
Could it not be shock that something so audacious and devastating had been carried out ?
I remember that day , the entire office gathered in stunted silence around the TV .
Natural reaction .
Christina , Aberdeen Bush 's reaction was exactly the same as mine and everyone else I know : stunned silence .
That probably makes him a rotten president - it does n't make him a conspirator .

What are these ?
You ’ve seen why it ’s better than Windows , now check out seven reason on why you should switch to Linux — courtesy of TUX .
Continue reading to see them all .
Beryl Linux Touchscreen
1. It Does n’t Crash
Linux has proved to be so reliable and secure that it is commonly found in dedicated firewall and router systems used by high - profile companies to secure their networks .
For more than ten years , it has not been uncommon for Linux systems to run for months or years without needing a single reboot
2. Viruses Are Few and Far Between
Although it is possible to create a virus to target Linux systems , the design of the system itself makes it very difficult to become infected .
A single user could cause local damage to his or her files by running a virus on his or her system ; however , this would be an isolated instance rather than something could spread out of control
3. Freedom of Choice
Linux offers freedom of choice as far as which manufacturer you purchase the software from as well as which application programs you wish to use .
Being able to pick the manufacturer means you have a real choice as far as type of support you receive .
Being open - source software , new manufacturers can enter the market to address customer needs
4. Applications , Applications , Applications
Each Linux distribution comes with hundreds and possibly thousands of application programs included .
This alone can save you thousands of dollars for each desktop system you configure .
Although this is a very small subset , consider that the OpenOffice.org office suite is included as well as the GIMP , a program similar to ( and many people say more capable than Adobe Photoshop ) ; Scribus , a document layout program similar to Quark Xpress ; Evolution , an e-mail system equivalent to Microsoft ’s Outlook Express ; and hundreds more
5. Virtually Hardware - Independent
Linux was designed and written to be easily portable to different hardware .
For the desktop user , this means that Linux has been and likely always will be the first operating system to take advantage of advances in hardware technology such as AMD ’s 64 - bit processor chips
6. Interoperability
More and more computers are being connected to networks .
No system would be complete if it did not include tools to allow it to interoperate with computers running other operating systems .
Once again , Linux is very strong in this area
7. Standards
Linux itself and many common applications follow open standards .
This means an update on one system will not make other systems obsolete
Efficiency is unquestionably the largest , cheapest , and cleanest wedge among the many we need decarbonize our energy economy .
Energy efficiency tends to cost just 1 to 3 cents per kWh saved , far less than even coal - fired generation .
Every renewable technology , from wind to solar , to biomass , has trade - offs .
At the very least , we have to decide if the energy we are using for one purpose is not better used for something else .
Energy efficiency is the exception to this rule : you can not use a kilowatt - hour or a BTU over and over again .
Given these advantages over generation , it ’s amazing that energy efficiency is nevertheless so extremely cheap .
Given an even moderately efficient [ pun intended ] market , you would expect that all the cheap energy efficiency measures would long ago have been taken until the marginal price of the next efficiency measure was above the marginal price of added electricity generation .
So why has n’t it ?
Why is TXU trying to build a half dozen coal fired power plants in the face of broad opposition from the community when , for a fraction of the cost , they could instead pay to help people insulate their homes , change to more efficient air conditioners , and replace energy efficient lighting and save as much power as they plan to generate with the coal plants without any cost for fuel and harm to the environment from mining and emissions ?
For that matter , why do n’t TXU ’s customers ( and the rest of us ) take these steps ourselves , when the internal return on investment is many time what we can rationally hope to achieve in the financial markets , and in many cases is even higher than the interest borrowers with the worst credit ratings pay on their credit cards .
( Like most financial advisors , I hate debt , especially credit card debt , but even if you ’re drowning in $ 30,000 of credit card debt at 25 % APR , it still makes sense for you to buy a pack of CFL ’s at $ 3 each on that high - interest credit card , and replace every incandescent light bulb in your house that you use more than 2 hours a day . )
Here ’s a blog which does a good job outlining the usual answers : lack of financing , perverse incentives , and disinterest on the part of people for whom energy is only a tiny part of the budget ( all of which are true . )
He goes on to outline perscriptions that will undoubtably help to break down the barriers to the adoption of many Energy Efficiency measures .
I see other barriers that lie behind these .
Not just a failure of normal market forces , but conceptual problems .
While energy in general is a fuzzy concept to most people , using less energy is even less tangible .
You just ca n’t drop energy efficiency on your foot .
You ’re not even at risk of electricution from it .
The pernicious consequence of systems of measurement is always that things we can’t measure go unnoticed .
If you have a hammer , everything looks like a nail , but even more insidiously , things that will never look like nails no matter how hard you squint dissappear from your vision altogether .
It is this psychological quirk that makes energy efficiency go unnoticed .
What image comes to your mind when I say “ wind power ” ?
If you ’re anything like me , you probably had a image of a forest of giant wind turbine blades turning gracefully on the horizon like ballet dancers .
Or , you might be like my wife , who would also have an image of a wind farm , but thinks they are ugly ( although not so ugly as the haze from a distant coal plant ) despite recognizing their necessity .
She wishes they were painted to camouflage them into the background .
Whatever your attitude towards wind power , you probably saw an image .
Now try “ energy efficiency . ”
It ’s a lot trickier , is n’t it ?
I think about energy efficiency all the time , the way a teenage boy thinks about sex ( okay , maybe not quite that much ) , and even I ca n’t settle on an image .
My mind flashes from the act of replacing an incandescent bulb with a compact fluorescent lightbulb ( CFL ) to an industrial scale combined heat and power facility , to closing the blinds at night to keep the heat in .
Not only is energy efficiency hard to picture , it ’s also hard to measure .
To compute the energy savings from any activity , you have to establish a baseline : how much energy would you have used if you had not changed your methods .
Even in the simplest case of replacing a CFL , we do n’t really know that the bulb we replace would really have stayed in the socket until the CFL breaks : A CFL can easily last 10 years , and by that time , we may be replacing all our bulbs with LEDs .
And that does not even begin to account for the effects on our HVAC systems .
Is your mind spinning ?
That ’s my point .
It can be so hard to get our minds around all the impacts of energy efficiency that , for most people , the most people , it may actually be rational to waste a little energy in order to avoid the headache that trying to get their mind around efficiency may entail .
The problem is , that decades of conserving brain power has left us as a society that wastes energy egregiously .
My prescriptions , designed to make thinking about efficiency easier :
Measure energy use at every opportunity .
Many Prius drivers report that the real - time MPG gauge on the dash causes them to change their driving habits to grive more efficiently .
Getting a Kill - a- Watt energy meter makes us think more about our next electronics purchase .
Getting to know your electric meter can also motivate you to track down wasted energy .
A radical idea : on new homes , the electric meter should be inside , along with the circuit breakers .
New meters can be read ( and even turned on and off ) remotely , so there is no reason any longer to have them on the side of the house where we never see them .
Another thing we need to measure is when we use our electricity , not just how much .
Wholesale electricity prices can vary from a few cents per kWh to 30 cents or more during peak consumption .
As we move to a grid based on renewable energy supplies , most of which are intermittent and non-dispatchable , we need to get used to paying the real - time price of the energy we ’re using .
Wide - spread adoption of time of use metering will drive the invention and adoption of appliances that can adapt themselves to changing prices .
There are direct , immediate benefits to the system by shaving peak loads , but the real benefits will come when people adopt new ways of doing things and new devices that will cause our appliances to run and our devices to charge when electricity is plentiful , and runonly the most essential uses of electricity when it is scarce .
Xcel is currently doing a pilot study on Time of Use Pricing in Colorado .
The preliminary result are that the right pricing scheme encourages customers to change their energy use much more than they had anticipated … but it still would not be “ economic ” to change out meters for more sophitocated models capable of handling this sort of billing .
Their definition of “ economic ” almost certainly does not include the benefits of the creativity which realistic pricing would unleash .
Allowing utilities to profit from selling less rather than more .
This concept , known as decoupling , is covered well here .
It ’s important to remove ( or even reverse ) the incentive of utilites to sell us more electrons when we really want them to help us use less .
Finally , I do call this blog EE / RE Investing , so here are the sectors that I see benefiting from these recommendations as they are adopted :
— down 10 % this week , after dropping 20 % the week before .
In the last 6 months , 8 million people have stopped caring about those TV plane crash survivors on that island full of mysteries .
We 've gone from laughing with the castaways to laughing at the writers .
( " What if there 's a magic turtle ? " )
Those complex characters we loved and cared about are trapped in a limbo of ever - shifting plot lines and motivations .
Here 's how to rescue them ...
Among renewable energy sources , solar power is viewed as likely to contribute most to the world ’s primary energy supplies by 2020 , according to a survey of venture capitalists and other financial investors conducted at the recently concluded Cleantech Forum XII in San Francisco by Jefferies & Company , Inc. , a leading investment bank focused on growing companies and their investors .
Among renewable energy sources , solar was selected by 40 % of respondents , followed by wind ( 33 % ) , hydro ( 22 % ) and geothermal ( 5 % ) .
“ Given that hydro power represents a much greater percentage of global energy supplies today than does solar , the survey results imply robust growth forecasts for solar energy among conference participants , ” said Jeffrey Bencik , Vice President and Equity Research Analyst at Jefferies providing coverage of clean technology companies .
“ To surpass hydro by 2020 , solar would need to grow faster than 30 % per year , and that assumes
hydro -generated power remains flat .
While wind is expected to grow quickly as well , solar remains the more attractive investment because of the higher growth rate , better profit margins and , at least in the US , a wide range of investment options , including both traditional manufacturing and potentially game - changing technologies . ”
In addition , 75 % percent of attendees surveyed believe President Bush ’s target for the US to consume 35 billion gallons of ethanol and other alternative transportation fuels by 2017 — up from 5 billion today — is
attainable .
“ Investors are clearly optimistic on the outlook for renewable fuels , but several issues need to be settled before we can reach the President ’s target , ” said Laurence Alexander , Vice President and Equity Research
Analyst at Jefferies responsible for coverage of chemicals and industrial biotechnology .
“ These include the impact on grain costs , the availability of water supplies and logistics .
As part of the solution to these issues ,
alternate feedstocks , such as switchgrass and algae , are attracting more interest and may prove the more viable long - term solution .
Investors are also showing more appreciation for the favorable outlook for biodiesel and
the opportunity to integrate biofuels with biobased chemicals .
The President ’s goal should be achievable , but it will require additional investment in a broader range of technologies and feedstocks . ”
The survey results also indicate strong investor optimism for hybrid transportation .
Asked which technology has the broadest commercial investment potential over the next five years , 39 % of respondents chose hybrid transportation , followed by ethanol ( 26 % ) , biodiesel ( 24 % ) and hydrogen fuel cells ( 11 % ) .
The results support the strong optimism shown by respondents for the attainment of President Bush ’s alternative fuel
consumption target , with alternative fuels accounting for half of the responses .
Hosted by the Cleantech Venture Network ( R ) , the Cleantech Forum was held at the San Francisco Marriott from February 19 - 21 .
With investment bankers , research analysts and trading professionals focused on clean technology in the US , Europe and China , Jefferies is a Global Premiere Sponsor of the Cleantech Venture Network .
“ With more than 800 venture capitalists and other investors in attendance , the strong turnout to this year ’s Cleantech Forum is a testament to the growing investor interest in clean technology and alternative energy , ” said Jeff Lipton , Managing Director of CleanTech Investment Banking at Jefferies .
“ Over the past three years , this sector has achieved critical mass , allowing investors to dedicate and commit resources to understand and follow the related industries . ”
Leveraging the firm ’s strong coverage of growing companies in the clean technology and alternative energy sectors , Jefferies recently introduced a number of indices benchmarking emerging opportunities in this area .
The
Jefferies Global Clean Technology IndexSM is a composite index of nearly 50 leading small - and mid-cap companies engaged in clean technology worldwide .
The Clean Technology index includes companies engaged in solar and wind energy , as well as providers of biofuels , batteries , fuel cells , microturbines , enzymes and catalysts , and crops and seeds .
In addition to the composite index , Jefferies has launched targeted sub-indices tracking companies focused on energy generation , energy storage and industrial biotechnology , markets for which widely available performance indicators do not exist .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Google Inc. , racing to head off a media industry backlash over its video
Web site YouTube , will soon offer anti-piracy technologies to help all copyright holders thwart unauthorized video sharing , its chief executive said on Wednesday .

Google Inc. , racing to head off a media industry backlash over its video
Web site YouTube , will soon offer anti-piracy technologies to help all copyright holders thwart unauthorized video sharing , its chief executive said on Wednesday .
REUTERS/www.youtube.com
“ We are definitely committed to ( offering copyright protection technologies ) , ” Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt said in an interview .
“ It is one of the company ’s highest priorities , ” he said .
“ We just reviewed that ( issue ) about an hour ago , ” Schmidt told Reuters when asked what Google was doing to make anti-piracy technologies widely available to video owners .
“ It is going to roll out very soon ...
It is not far away . ”
YouTube , which Google acquired late last year , plans to introduce technology to help media companies identify pirated videos uploaded by users .
But , to date , the tools are only being offered as part of broader licensing talks , media industry insiders complain .
Schmidt declined to give a specific timeframe of weeks or months to cover all potential users , saying that any move would take time to cover all Google ’s services , including YouTube , and to be made available to all copyright holders wishing to use the anti-piracy technology .
“ It is not some product you can just build and leave alone , ” Schmidt said .
Protecting copyrighted material is likely to involve an endless cat - and - mouse game to keep pace with hackers bent on breaking such security tools .
MySpace , the popular Internet social network owned by News Corp. said last week it would offer its own version of copyright protection services for free .
MySpace is YouTube ’s biggest rival .
YouTube ’s “ proposition that they will only protect copyrighted content if there ’s a business deal in place is unacceptable , ” a spokesman for Viacom Inc. , owner of MTV Networks and Comedy Central , complained recently .
Schmidt said Google plans to make video anti-piracy tools generally available to copyright owners .
“ We have to do that , ” he said , but cautioned that , “ It takes a while to roll this stuff out ” on a wide basis .
Earlier this month , Viacom demanded YouTube remove more than 100,000 Viacom video clips from the site after the two sides failed to reach a distribution agreement .
In a prepared statement last week , YouTube said the process of identifying copyrighted material is not an automated process and required the cooperation of media company partners .
For instance , a clip of a TV show owned by one company might contain music produced by another , making the process of identifying ownership difficult .
“ These matters are very complicated and we are working with our partners to identify and solve these problems , ” YouTube said in an e-mailed statement issued last week .
If there is a ' face of child obesity ' , it is six - year - old , 15 - stone Dzhambulat Khatokhov .
Sheer size has made this boy from a poor Russian family a hero in his home town and an object of fascination in the west .
Nick Paton
Walsh tracks him down
Just sitting down in Dzhambulat Khatokhov 's house sucks you straight into his empty world .
" There is not a single piece of furniture that he has not broken , " his mother , Nelya , laments as I perch on a stool barely held together by a quiver of nails .
Six - year - old Dzhambulat is 4ft 7in ( 1.4 m ) tall but weighs a staggering 15 stone ( 95kg ) .
Since he was three , he has been touted as the biggest child in the world .
But the sparsely furnished flat in which Nelya , 38 , lives with the boy - phenomenon known as " Dzhambik " and his superlative - free , skinny brother Mukha , 14 , confirms that fame does not always go hand in hand with fortune .
Dzhambik is so big that there is n't room for much else in his life .
He is hostage to the attention that his enormousness brings him .
People feed him ; people talk about how big he is .
He takes great pleasure in throwing his weight down on to his only real piece of furniture , a steel - framed bed , grinning as it groans under his weight .
At times , he is a walking test of how people view obesity - is he tragically out of control , Benny Hill - funny , or happily rotund ?
Does he himself know or even care ?
You may recognise him : his photograph and proportions are often used to illustrate the increasingly extreme nature of child obesity in the west .
Five per cent of British 12 - year - olds are clinically obese , and a third of American kids aged between 9 and 11 are considered overweight , with experts predicting that a fifth will be obese by 2010 .
Yet beneath Dzhambik 's image there is often little more than a brief caption , setting out his dimensions , his gift for wrestling , and the fact that he lives in Kabardino - Balkaria , an impoverished republic in southern Russia .
The story of how Dzhambik ( pronounced Jam - Bic ) got so big is not a long one , his mother insists .
He was born , ate three or four times a day , and just grew .
But the life that his size has given him is not so easily summed up .
This is a story of an ordinary six - year - old boy stuck in an abnormal skin and a world of adult fascination .
Dzhambik , a local hero , is easy to find .
His mother Nelya , 38 , agrees to meet me but , two phone calls into our discussions , begins to ask about the " royalties " .
Other journalists have unsolicitedly paid $ 500 to meet her son , she says .
I explain that the Guardian does not pay for information , then , sensing this is a deal - breaker , add that I might make an exception and pay 5,000 rubles ( £ 100 ) .
From then on , all Nelya really wants to talk about by phone is money , trying to get me to agree to twice as much up front .
When I arrive in Terek , an hour 's drive from the regional capital of Nalchik , it is obvious why .
The town is plush with grass , but little else .
Mukha , Dzhambik and his fame are all that Nelya , a nurse and single mother on £ 60 a month , has .
We collect Dzhambik from his nursery school , and my notebook and the photographer 's camera immediately plunge us into his world of disproportionate attention .
" Everyone loves him , " says his teacher Zhenia Khadinova as his schoolmates bound around him , performing for the camera .
" He 's sporty , likes singing and English .
The kids do n't tease him and he is average in class .
We can't all be at the top , " she adds .
Nelya tells me about a set of tests that Dzhambik had done in Moscow two years ago , which said that he was healthy .
" It said his organs were of proportionate size , " she says .
" He 's only been ill with flu once .
He eats three times a day , sometimes four .
He was born a normal 6 lb 6oz . "
We should mention at this point that Dzhambik , who most of the time looks at the floor , is really very fat indeed .
His eyelashes are forced upwards by the rolls of fat that are his eyelids .
His thigh fat hangs over his knees .
His wrists look as if they have been swollen by bee stings .
When he walks down the stone staircase inside the school , it thuds .
He is not much of a talker , and we try to escape the crowd in the local park .
He sits down on a bench , his brother 's friends still milling around .
" He 's not a local hero , but an international one , " says Murat , 14 , before confiding that his nickname in school is " Boba , " or Gladiator .
I ask questions , about school , sport , his size .
What I get is a few words of schoolboy English : " My name is Dzhambik . "
" I like to be big , " he eventually adds , with a little help from Nelya .
During our two afternoons together I am run through the gamut of things he " does " for the camera .
He sings something Nelya says is a version of the alphabet .
He puts his arms in a Popeye pose .
He stands on the scales , his arms perfectly straight down each side , as if standing to attention .
He hulas a large metal hoop .
He puts on a jumbo - sized wrestling vest and fights with his brother , occasionally thumping him with such force that there is a significant pause between Mukha being hit and Mukha laughing , during which Mukha wonders whether someone eight years his junior should be getting away with this .
Yet Dzhambik seems truly happy when we play draughts on a chessboard I have brought him .
" I 'm going to beat you , " he laughs , thumping his palm on the carpet before letting out an enormous belch .
The absence of furniture means we are both lying on the floor .
Dzhambik does not so much lie down as bellyflop on to the carpet .
His huge stomach means he can't stand up normally by bending his knees .
Instead , he must get into the start position for a press - up , and slowly edge his hands and feet closer together until he can balance and bend his back upright .
It is as if his limbs are held straight by plastercasts of fat .
Around him are the trappings of his childhood : the photographs with Russian chatshow hosts , the encyclopaedia he reads from , and a certificate from a Russian organisation that registered his apparent world record .
Aged three years and two months , he weighed 6st 3lb and was " the biggest child in the world " , considered " perfectly healthy with unique strength " .
The certificate claims affiliation with the Guinness Book of Records , but a Guinness spokesman said they had no record of Dzhambik and were unlikely to have a " biggest child " category .
All the same , Dzhambik is way ahead of his two competitors across the border in Georgia , three - year - old Luka Meliksishvili , who weighed 4st ( 26kg ) when he was only 15 months old but is reportedly growing by 4lb or 5 lb ( 2kg ) a month , and Georgiy Bibilauri , who was 9st 8 lb ( 62 kg ) when he was five .
Dzhambik does n't like losing at draughts , and is more than a handful when unhappy .
As Nelya changes him out of his wrestling vest and puts on his Ronaldinho football shirt , he grumpily decides to thump her a couple of times .
Nelya tries to laugh it off .
She holds up his size 58 shorts and says , simply : " Nightmare . "
She asks me , concerned : " Do you think a child like this has any future prospects ?
Might some British TV producers be interested in him ? "
Dzhambik is clearly tired , and I leave .
We meet up again the next day at the Vostok entertainment arcade .
Dzhambik loves the video games hall ; the video games hall loves Dzhambik .
As her two children drive racing - car simulators imported from Japan , surrounded by goggle - eyed kids , Nelya tells me : " He does not eat that much . "
Then she adds : " He is happy that size .
It is not shameful .
He likes showing people how strong he is . "
She says such huge people are native to Kabardino - Balkaria , a sleepy collection of spa towns and idyllic greenery in the north Caucasus , a two - hour drive west of Chechnya .
The predominantly Muslim republic , one of Russia 's poorest , saw a violent uprising in the capital , Nalchik , last October , when police buildings were attacked by hundreds of local men , part of an Islamic underground formed in response to police brutality and corruption .
Yet Dzhambik 's hometown of Terek seems a million miles away , a place of legend and tradition .
Nelya refers to " Sosruka " , a Kabardinian legend about a friendly giant born in a village .
In a region where wrestling is a popular sport , Dzhambik 's size is easily cast as an athletic advantage .
Nelya says that Dzhambik and Mukha , who are the same height but 9st 4lb and eight years apart , have different fathers .
Mukha 's dad , also father to her 18 - year - old son Rezuan , who is currently serving as a conscript on Russia 's border with China , is not around any more .
Dzhambik 's father , Mikhail , 40 , a taxi driver , lived with Nelya for five years , but left shortly after Dzhambik 's birth .
He visits perhaps twice a month , she explains .
" His ancestors were very big , " she says .
" Mikhail was born in a triplet and we say that the size of his two siblings and ancestors went into Dzhambik . "
She says that when he was a month old , Dzhambik began to grow at twice the usual pace .
" After one year he weighed 2st 7lb and began to walk without any problems , and talk , too .
He always liked lifting things and sport . "
She says the record organisation contacted them during their first trip to Moscow in 2003 , after which Dzhambik 's weight hit the front page of Russia 's biggest selling paper , Komsomolskaya Pravda .
They travelled to Ukraine , Georgia , Tokyo , Moscow , France , Germany and the Czech Republic as Dzhambik 's fame spread .
She looks lovingly at both her kids .
" One day they will both be Olympic champions and look after me , " she says .
" We 're moving to Nalchik so Dzhambik can have a professional trainer and learn to swim .
The doctors say he is a truly unique child .
His psychology is already that of an adult .
He sorts out situations like an adult does . "
Dzhambik has run out of game tokens and comes over to me .
After irritably throwing some toys onto the table where we are sitting , he says : " Nick , play cars with me ! "
Soon , cars turn into ice cream .
I buy the boys an ice cream each .
As we sit outside the video games hall , Dzhambik demolishes and grabs Mukha's .
Neither Mukha or Nelya notice .
A passerby asks if she can have her photo taken with Dzhambik .
As the boys get restless , we move to a nearby fairground , where Dzhambik soon becomes the main attraction .
The fairground owner grants us a free pass to all rides , an act of generosity soon explained by the crowd that follows Dzhambik around , wanting to have their pictures taken with him .
Nelya sighs : " See how everyone comes up to him .
He is exhausted by that . "
Each time the shutter closes , his face softens to offer a perfect smile , a pose clearly practised over years .
We sit in the cafe for a few minutes before another crowd gathers for a photo opportunity .
Some of our neighbours are angry at having their space invaded .
Dzhambik loves the dodgems and raises his middle finger at me when he crashes into me during one race .
After his fourth free go , we move back into town for a proper meal .
The waitresses at the cafe want their picture taken with him , too .
The man at the next table asks if he can buy him an ice cream .
" See how people act with us , " says Nelya .
" That is how it is for us . "
I ask if Dzhambik , now on his fourth ice cream in as many hours , could perhaps eat less .
" He does not always eat this much , " she replies , a little embarrassed .
He finishes his ice cream and grabs a piece of bread .
" Stop , " says Nelya , and he puts the bread down .
It must be a complicated relationship , Dzambik and food .
It has brought him his fame , and if he stops eating so much , then he will spend the rest of his life as the man who used to be the fattest kid in the world .
Nelya does n't talk much about how his life will be if he keeps these proportions when he is older , but seems sure his health is fine .
Back at home in Terek , she shows me the two medical analyses done by Moscow doctors .
Dr Sergei Podulov , who examined him once in 2003 and once in 2004 , said : " Dzhambik is absolutely healthy .
He has no illnesses . "
He said Dzhambik 's grandfather was also a " Bogatyr " , a Russian word for a sort of gentle giant .
Both the medical analyses end with the recommendation that he should wrestle and do sumo for exercise .
Today , Nelya lacks the means to investigate Dzhambik 's situation further in the costly and sometimes unscrupulous world of Russian healthcare .
" Why test him all the time if he is healthy ? " she says .
" It 's expensive to fly to Moscow and the blood tests are traumatic for him . "
At home again , the kids are captivated by a new musical system the magnanimous Guardian has bought them ( £ 40 ) .
I ask Dzhambik to list his favourite things .
" The music system , " he says .
" Your watch ( £ 20 , now on his wrist ) .
And money . "
He buries his face in Nelya 's arm and giggles .
When I later give Nelya 8,000 rubles ( £ 160 ) , she looks at me and asks : " I do n't want this if it comes out of your pocket , understand ?
Only if it is the Guardian's . "
She asks me to hand it to her discreetly .
" I do n't want the children to know where it comes from , " she says .
As I turn to leave and they return to being a normal family again , the emptiness of the flat looms .
Nelya , her face reddened by the spring sun and wrinkled by the exhaustion of being Dzhambik 's main connection to the outside world , follows me down the stairs outside .
She says , pleadingly : " Please do not write anything bad about us . "

gdb tips
gdb を使う上で便利な tips を紹介します。基本的な使い方をマスターしている人向けです。
.gdbinit の設定
ホームディレクトリに .gdbinit を置いておくと、gdb の起動の際に読み込まれます。私の場合は次のような設定をしています。
set history save on set history size 10000 set history filename ~/.gdb_history set print pretty on set print static - members off set charset ASCII
set history から始まる最初の 3 行は履歴に関する設定です。それぞれ、 gdb のコマンドラインの履歴をファイルに保存する、保存する行は最大 10000 行、ファイル名 は ~/.gdb_history 、という意味になります。デフォルトでは gdb を実行したカレントディレクトリに履歴が保存されますが、私の好みでは履歴がいろいろなディレクトリに散らばっているよりも一箇所にまとまっていた便利なので、そのようにしています。
set print から始まる 2 行は表示に関する設定です。以下のようなクラスがあるとき、
class
Foo { public : Foo( ) : a_( 100 ) , b_( 200 ) {} ; private : int a_ ; int b_ ; static int c_ ; } ; int Foo: : c_ = 300 ;
デフォルトでは 、Foo のインスタンスは次のように表示されますが、
( gdb ) p foo $ 1 = {a_ = 100 , b_ = 200 , static c_ = 300}
上記の設定をしておくことで、次のような表示になります。
( gdb ) p foo $ 1 = { a_ = 100 , b_ = 200 }
最後の 1行は gdb が文字列を表示する際の文字コードを指定しています。現状の gdb ( 6.5 で 確認 ) のデフォルト は ISO - 8859 - 1 であるため 、 UTF - 8 の端末では文字化けが起きることがあります。これを防ぐために
ASCII に設定しています。将来的に gdb が UTF - 8 をサポートしたらそれに切り替える予定です。
コマンドライン引数つきでデバッギを起動
通常、プログラムにコマンドライン引数をつけて gdb 上で実行したい場合、以下のように実行しますが、
% gdb program ( gdb ) run -- foo -- bar
-- args オプションを用いると、次のように実行できます。この方がシェルの履歴を再利用できるので何かと便利です。
% gdb -- args program -- foo -- bar ( gdb ) run
print の活用
print は変数をそのまま表示するだけでなく、基数を変換して表示したり、式の評価にも使えます。次の例では基数の変換を行っています。print には他にもいくつか書式があります。詳しくは gdb から help print を実行してください 。
% gdb ( gdb ) p 100 $ 1 = 100 ( gdb ) p/x 100 # 16 進数で表示 $ 2 = 0x64 ( gdb ) p/o 100 # 8 進数で表示 $ 3 = 0144 ( gdb ) p/t 100 # 2進数で表示 $ 4 = 1100100
式の評価では関数呼び出しも行えます。危険な関数呼び出しを行った場合、デバッギが死んでしまうこともあります。
% gdb /usr / bin/gdb # libc の関数を呼ぶために何かバイナリが必要 ( gdb ) start ( gdb ) p 1 + 2 $ 1 = 3 ( gdb ) p abs ( - 100 ) # abs ( ) 関数を呼び出している $ 2 = 100 ( gdb ) p puts ( 0 ) # 関数を危険な方法で関数を呼び出すと...
Program received signal SIGSEGV , Segmentation fault .
0x40126c7f in strlen ( ) from /lib/libc.so.6
The program being debugged was signaled while in a function called from GDB .
GDB remains in the frame where the signal was received .
To change this behavior use " set unwindonsignal on " Evaluation of the expression containing the function ( puts ) will be abandoned .
なお、関数の呼び出しは call コマンドでも行えます 。
gdb の変数の活 用
print で式を評価して表示すると、値の履歴が $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , ... という gdb の変数に格納されます。これらの変数は名前が短くタイプしやすいのがポイントです。
( gdb ) p getenv ( " SHELL " ) $ 1 = - 1073742700 ( gdb ) x/s $ 1 # -1073742700 をコピペするより楽 0xbffffc94 : " / bin/zsh " ( gdb ) x/s $ # 最後の値は $ でも参照でき る 0xbffffc94 : " / bin/zsh " ( gdb ) p ( char ) * $ 1 # * をつけてデリファレンスしたりもできる $ 2 = 47 '/'
なお、gdb には $ pc ( プログラムカウンタ ) , $ sp ( スタックポインタ ) といった特殊な変数も用意されています。
continue で n 回進め る
ループの中にブレークポイントを設定した場合など、デバッギが頻繁に停止しすぎて鬱陶しいことがあります。この場合、 continue の引数に数字 ( n ) を渡せば n - 1 回 だけ停止をスキップします ( つまり、continue を n 回実行したのと同じ ) 。次の例では continue 5 でループを 5 周 進めています 。
( gdb ) list 1 #include < stdio.h > 2 3 int main ( ) { 4 int i ; 5 for ( i = 0 ; i < 100 ; ++i ) { 6 printf ( " %d
" , i ) ; 7 } 8 return 0 ; 9 } ( gdb ) b 6 Breakpoint 1 at 0x804835e : file test.c , line 6 . ( gdb ) c ( gdb ) c 5 Will ignore next 4 crossings of breakpoint 1 . Continuing .
0 1 2 3 4 Breakpoint 1 , main ( ) at test .c:6 6 printf ( " hello , world
" ) ;
同様のことは ignore コマンドを使ってブレークポイントに ignore カウントを付加してもできます 。
比較的マイナーなコマンド
通常、 backtrace , break , watch , continue , step , next , finish , print といった一般的なコマンドだけで十分ですが、次のようなコマンドも役に立つことがあります。
display
ブレークポイントやステップ実行などでデバッギが停止するたびに特定の式を評価して表示する機能です。特定の変数の変化を監視したいときに使います。値の変化を表示し続けると、ログとして残るので便利です。
( gdb ) display foo # 変数 foo を監 視
commands
ブレークポイントでデバッギが停止するたびに特定のコマンドを実行する機能です。display でものたりないときに使えます。
( gdb ) command 1 # ブレークポイント 1 にコマンドを関連づけ る
Type commands for when breakpoint 3 is hit , one per line .
End with a line saying just " end " .
>p ( char *) ctime ( &t ) # unix time を見やすく表 示
>end
condition
ブレークポイントに特定の条件を関連付ける機能です。指定した条件が真のときのみデバッギが停止します。
( gdb ) condition 1 i % 5 == 0 # i % 5 == 0 のときに停 止
x
x は特定のアドレスから始まるデータを表示するコマンドです。以下の例では getenv ( ) が返すアドレスから環境変数 SHELL を表示しています。p getenv ( " HOME " ) が整数を返すのは gdb が getenv ( ) の型を知らないためです 。( char *) に cast すれば p でも表示できます 。
% gdb /usr / bin/gdb ( gdb ) start ( gdb ) p getenv ( " SHELL " ) $ 1 = - 1073742700 ( gdb ) x/s $ 1 0 xbffffc94 : " / bin/zsh " ( gdb ) p ( char *) getenv ( " SHELL " ) # cast しても OK $ 2 = 0xbffffc94 " / bin/zsh " ( gdb ) printf " %s
" , getenv ( " SHELL " ) # printf でも OK / bin/zsh ( gdb ) x/s getenv ( " SHELL " ) # これも OK 0xbffffc94 : " / bin/zsh "
x にはデータ表示に関するさまざまな書式があります。詳しくは gdb から help x を実行してください 。
まとめ
gdb のコツを紹介しました。端末から生の gdb を使う機会はいまどき減ってきているかもしれませんが、グラフィカルなデバッガが使えない場面ではまだまだ現役です。他にも便利なテクニックがあったらぜひ教えてください。

What does it take to design and build an MMORPG ?
These are substantial pieces of software with piles of content , complex client / server technology and large amounts of infrastructure .
A recent Interplay SEC filing indicated a development budget of $ 45 M to produce an MMORPG ( plus another $ 30 M in launch expenses ) , and a number of MMORPGs have spent even more .
In this article , Jon Radoff sheds some light on the skills , people and technologies that are required to create a modern MMORPG product .
An MMORPG is like a large piece of enterprise software : they consist of databases , specialized servers , client software and a huge amount of content .
To begin our journey through the world of an MMORPG , let ’s begin with the part that seems most familiar : the content .
Content and 3D Programming
When people use the term “ content ” in an MMORPG , they are referring to all of the places , creatures and things you can visit within the virtual world .
It includes the actual landscapes , buildings , and dungeons you explore ; the monsters and players you can see ; the graphics for items .
Even things like music , sound effects and the special effects used for things like explosions and spells are a type of content .
Very few individuals possess all of the skills necessary to create a large variety of visual effects that are present in an MMORPG .
Just as in the film business , where there are graphics programmers , costume designers , makeup artists and miniature modelers ( to name just a few ) , the game business employs a large number of specialized artists who are capable of working on the various sensory components of the game .
By the time you see an animated monster inside a game , it is likely that it is the product of several peoples ’ work .
Concept Art
The first step in creating a 3D image is to develop what is called the “ concept art . ”
Depending on the game company , this could be as simple as a pencil sketch of the intended creature or building — or could be a sophisticated piece of art , crafted with either traditional media or inside a paint program ( Photoshop is popular ) .
The purpose of the concept art is to give the 3D artists a blueprint to follow ; it also provides the art director with an opportunity to establish consistent themes across the various art .
3D Modeling
Once the concept of art is created , the job of creating a 3D animation begins .
The first step is to create a 3D model of the images .
There are a large number of 3D modeling programs on the market , but most game companies use either Maya or 3D Studio Max .
There are also some specialized products , such as Poser , for designing things such as human figures .
Creating a new model from scratch requires one to build a model from a set of “ primitives , ” which include objects such as spheres , cylinders , cubes , and so forth .
The designer has the ability to attach these objects together or perform a variety of transformations such as stretching vertices , twisting objects , and so forth .
In many cases , a designer will tap into a library of existing models and modify them as appropriate , since creating new models entirely from scratch would take far too long for a project that may easily include hundreds of similar images .
Finally , the designer might use another type of product called a “ 3D sculpting ” program ( such as Zbrush ) to add natural looking features to the model , such as wrinkles or cracks .
The final surface of a 3D image is a set of polygons .
The total number polygons in a model are called the “ polygon count . ”
Models with a larger number of polygons take longer for your computer to render because each individual surface has its own texturing and shading .
Because a computer game needs to render these models in real - time , the number of polygons is limited to what current computers are able to handle .
As of 2007 , some of the more advanced computer games in development have 10,000 or more polygons , whereas a model for a Hollywood movie ( which has the luxury of rendering all of the images in advance ) might have hundreds of thousands or even over a million polygons .
Thus , game designers not only have to make models that look good — they have to make models that look good within fairly strict technical limitations .
Texture Mapping
The 3D model might have the shape of the image , but it is still a far cry from the vision laid out by the concept artist .
The 3D model needs to be painted , or else it would look like little more than a sculpture .
Often , the people who do the painting of a 3D model are separate from the 3D modelers .
These “ texture artists ” are responsible for creating images that are wrapped onto the 3D model , making them look like they ’re supposed to .
In theory , a texture map is just a 2D image that is wrapped onto the geometry of a 3D model — they could be created in any paint program , be it Photoshop or even the paint program that ships with Windows .
For textures of reasonably flat surfaces ( such as the side of a building , or the bark on a tree ) , that ’s usually adequate .
When you need to create a texture map for a more complex object — like an orc or a racecar — artists these days will turn again to products like Zbrush , which allows them to paint directly onto the surface of a 3D solid , rotating and turning the object as if it were a figurine .
Bump Maps
There ’s one problem with traditional texture maps : they can look “ flat , ” especially when applied to flat surfaces .
If you remember older video games ( or poorly funded current ones ) , you might have noticed that the cracks on walls look flat , more like decals pasted onto the sides of the surface .
That ’s because your brain expects things like cracks and creases to be lit differently depending on where you stand , and simply coloring a surface is n’t enough .
Modern games use a technology called bump maps .
A bump map is a special type of texture that assigns a height to each pixel , which impacts the way light is received by the surface .
For example , a pixel which has a negative height could act like a depression in the surface , swallowing up some of the light that is cast on it .
Using bump maps , it is possible to create realistic - looking cracks or bumps in the surface , allowing much greater detail to a surface .
This is just one of the ways that modern MMORPGs ( and videogames in general ) can add detail to an image without resorting to prohibitively complex 3D models .
Thus far , very few MMORPG titles are using bump maps , although they ’ve become common in modern FPS titles .
Physics and Kinematics
In addition to the visual depiction of a model , the designer also needs to define how the model interacts physically — the kinematics of a model .
This includes things like how an arm might move through a sword swing , how a particular weapon is gripped , how an unconscious body might flop onto the ground , how different parts of a skeleton move when you tug on a particular bone , and so forth .
The process of defining the skeletal connections in a model and how different objects attach and move each other is called “ rigging ” the model .
Usually , the model designers are the same people who develop the kinematics — but often , the job of animating the complete models within a scene is done by other content creators .
Beyond the individual models , 3D worlds are simulations of physical reality : objects have acceleration and movement .
Have you ever had a butterflies - in - the - stomach sensation while watching your character drop off a cliff ?
That ’s because the velocity is accelerating based on Newton ’s Law of Gravity , which our brains have evolved to interpret even when we only have visual cues .
Many MMORPGs use basic physical rules such as gravity and friction through a fluid ( for example , reduced movement while swimming ) .
Some games may offer physics for special environments : Vanguard includes directional water currents in rivers , and Guild Wars has floors with varying coefficients of friction , such as icy surfaces that are hard to gain or lose momentum on .
Few MMORPGs as of 2007 have implemented some of the complex physics models that have begun to appear in FPS games : destructible environments , parabolic artillery trajectories , debris that clatters around realistically and objects with realistic weight and density — but these are likely become part of a future generation of MMORPGs .
Animation & Composition
At some point , the content designers will have a rich set of models , objects , buildings , textures and environments to choose from .
There ’s still quite a bit of work to be done : someone needs to composite it into complete scenes .
This means placing objects on the map , creating terrain elevation maps , defining scripts to determine how creatures and players interact with them , etc .
In the world of FPS games , this is referred to as “ level design , ” ( there ’s no consistent term within MMORPG companies , so I ’ll call them the “ world designers . ” )
These people are usually a separate team from the model and texture artists .
They ’ll work closely with those who have designed the lore and concepts for the world ( often , they ’ll do much of this definition as well ) and integrate the content created by individual artists into the world that players will explore .
A certain amount of animation can be done “ by hand , ” but nowadays most of the animation that you see characters performing comes from motion capture libraries ( called “ Mocap ” for short ) .
During Mocap , a person wears a suit that is covered with various sensors , lights or markers ; they then perform real actions , such as fencing movements , dancing , or everyday activities such as sitting down in a chair .
The location of these sensors is tracked , and recorded as a set of coordinates within a computer .
These coordinates can then be mapped to the rigging of a model , and used to create a realistic 3D model of a person .
Using various animations , combined with transition poses ( for example , standing up and doing nothing ; or an aggressive combat stance ) allows a character to express a wide range of behaviors .
Content designers can string these together as part of scenes , define patrol patterns for a creature , or respond emotionally to a conversation .
Today , motion capture libraries are available from a number of sources that allows game designers to avoid recreating the same movements over and over — but certain motion capture ( for example , a distinctive dance within a game ) may still need to be recorded anew .
Particle Effects
Another important area of animation in an MMORPG is called “ particle effects . ”
This includes all the explosions , flashes of light , swirls of color and magic when a spell is cast , smoke plumes , fires , and so forth .
These are called “ particle effects ” because the animation consists of a large number of discrete particles , all of which follow predefined functions that define their trajectory , propagation , noise , color transformations , etc .
An MMORPG will need particle effects for many combat actions and spells .
Most 3D modeling programs include a particle system , and there are now specialized plug-ins available for things such as fire and liquid effects .
Pixel Art
Beyond all of the 3D art , an MMORPG includes a large amount of 2D art : this runs the gamut from the user interface itself , to things such as all the inventory icons for every item in the game .
In the industry , the people who create 2D art are usually called “ pixel artists ” because they paint these objects pixel - by - pixel , using a zoom - in tool within a paint program .
Sometimes , a 3D program might be used to do an initial rendering of these icons — and some artists may even draw or paint them using traditional media prior to creating a finished version within something like Photoshop .
Getting icons and miniature objects to look right is a challenge in that they not only have to look good — but also look memorable and recognizable at a small size .
It is a specialized skill , and good pixel artists are usually a different set of people from the model designers and texture artists .
Shaders
Another area of modern graphics programming is what ’s called a shader .
Video cards now include specialized , programmable hardware that allows a graphics programmer to write custom programs that alter how lighting and color transformations occur on various objects .
Originally , these were written in specialized assembly language — but now , programmers can utilize High - Level Shader Language ( HLSL ) to define these operations .
What can game developers do with shader programming ?
One example would be a scintillating color that is mapped to the surface of a magical weapon , complete with a lighting effect that causes the color to radiate onto other nearby objects .
Special effects like this are made possible because it is a lot faster for your video card to compute these effects in hardware ( within the GPU itself ) rather than in the software running in your PC .
When developers talk about shaders , there are generally two types : vertex and pixel shaders .
Pixel shaders can do things such as modify the lighting or color properties of an individual pixel , whereas a vertex shader can modify the geometry of an object .
Vertex shaders can do effects , such as deforming an object in strange ways or giving new ways of viewing a scene such as haze or rippling - water effects .
Differences Between FPS and MMORPG 3D
A lot of the what goes into designing a 3D world is the same between MMORPG and FPS games .
However , one big difference is the huge number of models and texture maps that exist within an MMORPG as compared to an FPS game .
Although many game computers today have more than a gigabyte of RAM , it ’s still a challenge to cache the various models and texture maps that a player sees on their screen .
In a given fantasy - themed MMORPG , there might be thousands of weapons and armor pieces that a character might wear , and it needs to be possible to quickly render the various appearances of characters regardless of who you might come across .
Client
All of the content ultimately needs to be displayed , and that is one of the jobs of what ’s called the client .
This includes a 3D engine for rendering the game ’s environment , as well as a user interface that allows you to do things like cast spells , shoot guns or manipulate inventory items .
The client talks to the server through a network protocol that consists of “ packets ” of information such as the location of objects , chat messages , and so forth .
The client is responsible for interpreting these packets and displaying the world to the player .
Client programs themselves do little or no interpretation of game mechanics in an MMORPG because doing so opens the door to hacking .
Instead , clients are the hands , eyes , and ears you use to interact with the servers .
Publishers now invest some effort in making it difficult to modify client programs , to prevent users from hacking them in such a way as to automate activities or grant unfair advantages over other players .
However , many modern MMORPGs contain “ modding features ” that allow users to hook into the client and add their own alterations or extensions in an approved way .
For example , World of Warcraft uses a lightweight programming language called Lua that allows players to build their own user interface extensions , but does not offer any methods for fully automating your character .
User Interfaces
The simplest aspect of the client — but often the hardest for developers to get “ just right ” is the windowed interfaces within a game .
This is all of the dialog boxes you interact with for common activities such as moving items around your inventory , assigning hotkeys to actions , etc .
There are two aspects to the creation of the user interface .
The first is programming all of the user interface components themselves , and the second is organizing the components into a framework that is easy and fun to use .
Although Windows computers come with a library of software that makes it possible to created windowed , mouse - driven interfaces , many games end up writing their own user interfaces from scratch due to the fact that these libraries ( a ) do n’t look enough like a game and ( b ) do n’t work well when combined with a 3D game engine .
It is fairly inefficient , but many games end up rewriting similar things ( including basic components , such as slider controls ) over and over again .
Microsoft has attempted to solve some of this by creating the Windows Presentation Foundation ( a feature of the Vista operating system ) , which makes it possible to use all of the 3D functions available in Direct3D side - by - side with 2D windowing features — however , games that require Vista are still quite far off as of 2007 .
In the meantime , developing the plumbing that makes possible a game ’s unique look - and - feel is an area that can consume considerable development resources .
3D Engine
With the exception of a few 2D or isomorphic MMORPGs , almost every modern game now includes what is called a 3D engine .
It is the job of the engine to take the mathematical description of objects , communicate them to your video card , and provide an animated world for you to experience .
Most MMORPG companies license a third - party engine , but even then they will frequently need to perform a lot of low - level modifications that can only be done by advanced graphics programmers .
Servers
The servers are the heart of any MMORPG : it is here that all of the rules are interpreted , and all the data on the location and movement of objects is maintained .
All of this work must be done within the servers and not the client , or else unethical players could hack their client software to give them advantages unavailable to others .
Most MMORPGs consist of a variety of different servers for providing different parts of the game experience .
Login servers record everyone ’s payment information and act as gateways that allow players to connect to the game servers .
After you give your username and password to a login server , your client is given an electronic “ admission ticket ” that lets your client access all of the other servers that are required during the course of your game .
Game servers control all of the actions within a particular area of the game .
These servers enforce all the game rules , activate skills and attacks , and record the location and movement of objects .
The movement of objects is usually recorded as a vector , meaning that motion is recorded as a combination of magnitude and direction — in other words , the server transmits information to all the clients in an area that various objects are moving in a certain direction at a certain velocity .
This works better than a system that transmits absolute coordinates ( which would look choppy , and require a large increase in bandwidth to update regularly ) but it does introduce other issues such as strange animations due to latency : for example , on a laggy connection , you might see a creature walk through a wall and then warp back to its original position .
The reason this happens is that the server had told your client that an object would continue on that path , but lag prevented you from getting the further update about the same object stopping or changing direction .
Another job of the server is what ’s called “ collision detection . ”
In other words , you need to detect if two objects have intersected with each other : for example , you need to stop when you hit a wall ( and some games might not allow creatures or players to pass through each other ) .
The job of collision detection sounds simple in concept , but in implementation , it requires a bunch of relatively complex matrix math .
The reason is that these are 3D worlds , and determining whether one object in 3D space has intersected with another requires a bit of math to figure out .
Precise algorithms are computationally expensive , so most games use an approximation — and even then , only detect a collision after the fact , and move objects back to compensate .
Poor collision detection can result in strange problems like the ability to jump through objects that should be impassable , or getting stuck inside terrain .
Because MMORPGs are large worlds , and because it would consume massive amounts of bandwidth to report to every client what happens with every object and event within the world , techniques have been created to divide the world into discrete units ( often called “ zones ” ) .
In games like WoW , this is done by allocating different servers to different areas of the game ( such as continents ) as well as separate servers for dungeon “ instances . ”
Vanguard , which features a “ seamless ” world , actually divides the continents into what are called “ chunks . ”
When different servers are used to maintain these different zones , they are often referred to as “ zone servers . ”
Chat servers provide communication between players .
Although players might be connected to different game servers depending on where they are in the virtual world , things such as a guild - chat or instant messaging needs to work across the entire game .
To handle this , most MMORPGs are designed so that you connect to a worldwide chat server regardless of where you travel .
From a technical standpoint , after you connect to a login server you are then connected to a chat server in the background , and then connected to a game server specific to your location .
Databases record all the information on your character ’s statistics and items and save them in a database so that you can come back to the game at any point in the future .
This data is stored in what ’s called a relational database management system ( RDBMS ) , the same sort of technology that is used to maintain things like banking information , electronic commerce systems , retail inventory systems , and so forth .
Today , software designers can choose between commercial products such as Oracle , Microsoft SQL Server , or open - source options such as MySQL .
Implementing a persistence system for a game involves defining a database architecture and then creating software to “ wrap ” the database for doing things such as saving a character or spawning a new item .
It ’s critical to design this system well , or the MMORPG will be plagued by item duplication problems , vanishing items or laggy item spawning .
Website integration :
It is becoming increasingly common for MMORPGs to expose some of their content to the World Wide Web .
This can be used to provide ladder and player ranking information , character profiles , guild information , and so forth .
Adding these capabilities requires a whole other area of expertise .
Designers will write server - side code to access the game databases ( often using popular Web development frameworks such as php or Java ) ; other developers will create the HTML and graphics used to present a crisp user interface .
In addition , many games are now packaging their data so that it can be reused on other people ’s websites as well , which means defining data in a language called XML ( for extensible markup language ) .
Patchers
MMORPGs are dynamic , changing games — and software updates happen regularly .
As a result , there are patching servers that contain updates to the game code .
Depending on the size of a game , this might need to update hundreds of thousands or even millions of clients in a month .
Patching servers are simple in concept : they contain all the code needed for a client , and are capable of delivering any of the individual files that have changed since you last updated .
However , implementing them to handle the massive demand that occurs around the time of a new patch requires considerable preplanning as well as a significant investment in server infrastructure .
Server Farms
How many computers does an MMORPG require ?
In 2006 , Vivendi reported in SEC disclosures that it maintained over 1,900 servers for WoW .
Aside from the software infrastructure , the task of designing and then operating a scalable server farm — with all the security , network and maintenance issues it entails — is a huge job in itself .
Game Design
Even if you have a great 3D environment , fantastic content and animation , a robust and friendly user interface and a server infrastructure that ’s ready to support all of it — you still do n’t have a game .
Creating a good game is well beyond the scope of this article , but to give you a sense of some of the central issues within an MMORPG , the designers need to think about things such as :
What are the objectives ?
What will give individual players as well as guild organizations goals to keep them interested in playing , month after month ?
What are the rewards and challenges ?
How do you reward the player quickly enough when they first start playing so that they fall in love , but do n’t overload them so that they become complacent and bored ?
What about the economy ?
How do you make the economy for money , items or whatever else the game is organized around vital and dynamic ?
How do you prevent runaway inflation , adequate outlets for spending , marketplaces for exchange ?
Lore : how can you make the background of the world , the characters , the plots compelling enough that people will find it interesting ?
Even if a person is not a traditional roleplayer , there is a certain amount of context , storytelling and emotional content that is vital to an MMORPG .
Without it , even the most jaded of players would find the world hollow and difficult to escape to .
Tactics and gameplay : are there enough options so that the player can have a satisfying experience , regardless of how they approach the game ?
Is it simple enough to learn , but complex enough that it cannot be mastered quickly ?
Is there enough there that players will be able to have active discussions about strategies and approaches to play ?
If you ’ve read the above , you ’ll be able to think about just a few of the questions that game designers ask themselves when designing an MMORPG ( or almost any game ) .
Quality Assurance ( QA ) & Testing
MMORPGs are living , breathing entities .
Most of them have frequent updates , be it new content or new features .
At the same time , MMORPGs are complex pieces of software that rival many of the most advanced enterprise software technologies — and as such , they need significant testing to make sure that updates are ready for use .
Often , players are invited to play on “ test servers ” before game updates are made live .
This is a good final stamp of approval , but there is quite a bit of testing that goes on even before test - server builds are released .
One of the major areas of testing that occurs before a game update is released is called regression testing , which is the process that confirms that previously working code still works the way it is supposed to .
Regression testing is usually performed by a combination of human testers ( people who go down a checklist and confirm that specific actions work as expected ) as well as automated testing software ( robot - like programs that invoke different operations , and systematically verify various outputs ) .
If you ’ve ever gotten a game update , and something that worked fine is suddenly broken , it is a sure sign that the company is n’t investing in good regression - testing .
QA Engineers are the people at game companies who design test suites and write test scripts — but do n’t automatically blame them just because broken code gets released .
These are complex programs with substantial testing needs , and it is often the game company ’s decision to underfund QA ( an all - too - common choice at many game studios ) .
Conclusion
MMORPGs are staggeringly complex ventures , involving skills that include a large variety of game designers , storytellers , 3D modelers , 2D artists , animators , user interface designers , graphics programmers , client / server experts , database architects , network gurus , QA engineers , and testers .
What does the future hold ?
As MMORPGs get even more complex , we might start seeing even more exotic jobs .
Perhaps we ’ll start to see MMORPG companies recruit for “ virtual economists ” or “ physics engine programmers ” in the near future — and in an industry as complex and fast - growing as this one , we can expect new innovations to drive even more advanced requirements into the virtual worlds we ’ve grown to love .
It ’s an exciting time to be either a player or a designer !
OAKLAND — Destined for American kitchens , planks of birch and poplar plywood are stacked to the ceiling of a cavernous port warehouse .
The wood , which arrived in California via a cargo ship , carries two labels :
One proclaims " Made in China , " while the other warns that it contains formaldehyde , a cancer - causing chemical .
Because formaldehyde wafts off the glues in this plywood , it is illegal to sell in many countries — even the one where it originated , China .
But in the United States this wood is legal , and it is routinely crafted into cabinets and furniture .
As the European Union and other nations have tightened their environmental standards , mostly in the last two years , manufacturers — here and around the world — are selling goods to American consumers that fail to meet other nations ' stringent laws for toxic chemicals .
Wood , toys , electronics , pesticides and cosmetics are among U.S. products that contain substances that are banned or restricted elsewhere , particularly in Europe and Japan , because they may raise the risk of cancer , alter hormones or cause reproductive or neurological damage .
Michael Wilson , a professor at UC Berkeley 's Center for Occupational and Environmental Health , said the United States is becoming a " dumping ground " for consumer goods that are unwanted and illegal in much of the world .
Wilson warned earlier this year in a report commissioned by the California Legislature that " the United States has fallen behind globally in the move toward cleaner technologies . "
The European Union , driven by consumers ' concerns , has banned or heavily restricted hundreds of toxic substances in recent years , invoking its " precautionary principle , " which is codified into law and prescribes that protective steps should be taken when there is scientific evidence of risks to public health or the environment .
Meanwhile , the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies have relied on voluntary steps from industries rather than regulations , saying the threats posed by low levels of chemicals are too uncertain to eliminate products valuable to consumers or businesses .
In the absence of U.S. regulations , some international corporations , including Hewlett - Packard , Dell , Mattel , Revlon and Orly International , have declared that all their products , no matter where they are made or sold , will comply with EU standards , the most stringent chemical laws in the world .
" We do n't operate to different standards in different parts of the globe , regardless of differing environmental standards , " said John Frey , manager of corporate environmental strategies at Palo Alto - based Hewlett - Packard .
But many U.S. and foreign companies do .
Some toys , nail polishes and other beauty products are made with plastic softeners and solvents called phthalates that the EU has banned as reproductive toxins .
Several of U.S. agriculture 's most popular herbicides and insecticides , including atrazine , endosulfan and aldicarb , are illegal or restricted to emergency uses in other countries .
And a few electronic items , including Palm 's Treo 650 smart phone and Apple 's iSight camera , were pulled off shelves in Europe this summer because of lead components but are still sold here .
Industry groups say their products have undergone rigorous reviews in the United States and are not only legal here but safe .
They say some governments , particularly the EU , have overreacted and banned chemicals with little or no evidence of a human health threat .
" Consumers can remain confident about using their cosmetics given their oversight by the Food and Drug Administration , the extensive research on their safety and long history of safe use , " the Cosmetic , Toiletry and Fragrance Assn. said .
The EPA has n't eliminated any industrial compounds since it sought unsuccessfully to ban asbestos 18 years ago .
Unlike EU policies , U.S. law requires the EPA to prove a toxic substance " presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment , " consider the costs of restricting its use and choose " the least burdensome " approach to regulate industry .
" The dumping problem is concentrated in a few product sectors .
But these sectors happen to be really ubiquitous in the everyday lives of Americans .
Chemical risks are being spread all over the country in ways that are invisible to consumers , " said Alastair Iles , an international chemical policy expert who was a research fellow at UC Berkeley and still works with faculty there on consumer issues .
Last year alone , China exported to the United States more than half a billion dollars ' worth of hardwood plywood — enough to build cabinets for 2 million kitchens , a sixfold increase since 2002 .
Though China sends low - formaldehyde timber to Japan and Europe , Americans are getting wood that emits substantially higher levels of the chemical .
One birch plank from China , bought at a Home Depot store in Portland , gave off 100 times more formaldehyde than legal in Japan and 30 times more than allowed in Europe and China , according to July tests conducted by a lab hired by an Oregon - based wood products manufacturer .
Formaldehyde exposure has been shown in human studies to cause nose and throat cancer and possibly leukemia , as well as allergic reactions , asthma attacks , headaches and sore throats .
With no government standards , monitoring or labeling , U.S. consumers cannot easily identify chemical - free products .
" I 'll guarantee you that no one tells a customer building a $ 75,000 kitchen that their cabinets contain plywood from China that will off - gas formaldehyde , " said Larry Percivalle of Oakland - based EarthSource Forest Products , a distributor that sells low - formaldehyde and sustainably grown wood .
In the wood industry , even though low - cost , chemical - free substitutes are available , much of the plywood , fiberboard and particleboard sold in the United States is manufactured with adhesives , or glues , that contain formaldehyde , said Michael Wolfe , a wood products consultant in Emeryville , Calif .
The only formaldehyde standard for wood in the U.S. is one that applies just to subsidized , low - income housing .
U.S. companies voluntarily meet it for all products , though it allows 10 times more formaldehyde than Japan 's standards .
California may step in .
The Air Resources Board is considering standards roughly equivalent to Europe 's for 2008 and Japan 's for 2010 through 2012 .
The air board estimates that one of every 10,000 Californians is at risk of contracting cancer from breathing average formaldehyde levels found in homes and offices .
" We have a problem that needs to be addressed , we have technology to do it , and there is no requirement for it to happen .
Nationally , no one is stepping forward , so we think this is an area where we can , " said Mike Scheible , the air board 's deputy executive officer .
Columbia Forest Products , which spent $ 8 million to switch all its factories to nontoxic glues made of soy flour , says it is being hurt by the lack of U.S. standards for wood .
" While I believe in free trade , I also believe that everybody ought to be held to the same standard , " said Harry Demorest , the Portland - based company 's president and chief executive .
" It 's particularly galling and frustrating in the Chinese case , when they 're taking our market with products that have high formaldehyde content when we know full well that they can produce it with lower formaldehyde . "
Despite its capital investment , Columbia , which is North America 's largest producer of hardwood plywood and veneer , has not raised its prices to compensate because the soy glues are as inexpensive as formaldehyde glues , Demorest said .
The state air board estimates that switching to formaldehyde - free glues like those required in Japan would increase the price of a sheet of particleboard from today 's $ 7 to about $ 9 in 2010 .
California 's proposal is opposed by nearly all wood producers , who say it could drive them out of business if they are forced to do what Columbia did .
" The entire industry is not ready to make this change .
Today we could not be competitive by changing resins , " said Darrell Keeling , a general manager at Roseburg Forest Products in Oregon .
Keeling said his company makes some low - formaldehyde products but most customers are n't interested because they cost more .
" Even though people talk green and think green , they wo n't demonstrate their commitment to it with their wallet , " he said .
" More regulation and more bureaucracy is not the best way to drive change . "
But selling products with risky chemicals to Americans while removing them for consumers elsewhere is shortsighted , said Robert Donkers , the European Commission 's Environmental Counselor in Washington , D.C .
" If companies decide to wait and see rather than innovate , they will lose the market , " he said .
" American consumers follow closely what is happening in other parts of the world .
So they can say , ' Hey , you make them in Europe , why do n't you sell them to us ? '
" Legally , you can still use these chemicals , but you 're not doing your company any favors . "
Prior to submitting my entry to a certain infamous contest , I discovered that even after reducing all possible identifiers to one or two characters , my source code was still far over the limit required by the contest .
Needing to make up something like a 30 % margin on my already insanely compressed code , I thought I was doomed .
After several days of on and off effort , however , I just squeaked in under the limit .
The ultimate limit is a count of 2048 characters excluding whitespace , or the characters { , } , or ; followed by whitespace .
The final version of my entry came in at 2017 such characters .
Today I ’m going to show you how to shrink your C source code like a real professional .
Pay careful attention , and you can put these skills in to use at your next job .
1
1 . Use short identifiers
This one may seem obvious , but it ’s the most effective if your code is n’t already using it .
C has 53 legal one - character identifiers ( yes , _ is a legal identifier too ) , and you should use every single one of them .
2. Optimize the use of short identifiers
If your program is large enough then you probably have more than 53 different identifiers in your program , meaning that you ’ll be forced to use some two - character identifiers .
For best effect , you want to spend your 53 one - character identifiers on the symbols that are used the most frequently .
To that end , I wrote a small python script that will tell you about underused short identifiers .
Pipe your program into its standard input , and as its standard output it will print a list of all identifiers in your application , sorted by frequency of use .
It will also print all legal one - character identifiers even if you are n’t using some of them .
Then you can rename things so that all single character identifiers are at the top of the list .
#!/usr /bin/python import re import sys def hasprefix ( str , prefix ) : return len( str ) >= len( prefix ) and str [ : len ( prefix ) ] == prefix def readin( f ) : str = '' for l in f.readlines ( ) : if not hasprefix ( l , ' # include ' ) : str += l return str def makedict ( str ) : dict = {} for c in ' _abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ' : dict[ c ] = 0 ident_re = re.compile(r " ( [ a - zA - Z_ ] ( [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ ] * ) ) " ) for match in ident_re.findall ( str ) : ident = match [ 0 ] if not dict .
has_key ( ident ) : dict[ident ] = 0 dict[ident ] = dict[ ident ] + 1 return dict def sortedarray ( dict ) : array = [ ] for k in dict. keys ( ) : array += ( ( k , dict[ k ] ) , ) array . sort ( lambda x , y : len ( x [ 0 ] ) - len( y [ 0 ] ) ) array .
sort ( lambda x , y : - x [ 1 ] + y [ 1 ] ) return array str = readin ( sys.stdin ) dict = makedict ( str ) array = sortedarray ( dict ) for item in array : print '%02d --> %s ' % ( item [ 1 ] , item [ 0 ] )
3. Reuse identifiers
You ’ve run out of precious one - character identifiers but you still need to save more space , what to do ?
Shadowing is your friend .
Any one - character function that is n’t called in the current function , or one - character global that is n’t used , can be reused as a local variable name with no ill effect .
If you want to take this further , you can directly reuse global variables for local storage as long as the types match , and you can be absolutely certain that nothing you call will manipulate that global .
This not only lets you reuse a name , but also saves on lengthy declarations .
4. typedef
Type names get used a lot , and they ’re pretty long .
Make them shorter with typedef .
Of course you have to pay for the typedef statement itself , but if the type name is used enough then this can easily pay off .
For example , the string typedef int i ; is 12 non-whitespace characters , but will save you 2 characters in each use of int , so you only need 7 uses of int in your code to make this a win .
5. #define
This is like the typedef tip , but more general .
Use #define to shrink common bits of code .
For example , if you use the typedef trick more than a couple of times , you can # define t typedef and save even more .
You can get even fancier and take advantage of macro arguments .
If you have a bunch of code that ’s similar but not identical , you can # define it to get it shorter .
For example , if you have a bunch of functions with the same signature , you can save on space :
# define f( n ) void n( int a , float b , char * c ) { f( q ) int a Local ; ... } f( r ) ... }
You can get really fancy using the ## preprocessor operator to glue strings together .
For example , here is a bit of code from an earlier version of my entry :
v D ( ) { tcgetattr ( 0 , &B ) ; A = B.c_lflag ; B.c_lflag &= ~ICANON & ~ECHO ; tcsetattr( 0 , TCSANOW , &B ) ; } v C ( ) { tcgetattr ( 0 , &B ) ; B.c_lflag = A ; tcsetattr(0 , TCSANOW , &B ) ; }
All of those tcget / setattr calls take up valuable space , and I can’t rename them because they ’re library functions .
And I only call each one twice , so there ’s not much gain with a #define on them .
But with a bit of cleverness I can make a pair of # define s that will cover all four calls , and cover much more than just the function names :
v D ( ) { # define O( x ) tc ## x ## etattr ( 0 , # define TD O(s ) TCSANOW , &B ) ; O( g ) & B ) ; A = B.c_lflag ; B.c_lflag &= ~ICANON & ~ECHO ; TD } v C ( ) { O(g ) & B ) ; B.c_lflag = A ; TD }
6. Avoid character constants
A character constant uses three characters in code .
But most characters have an ASCII value less than 100 .
Save one character per use by writing out the ASCII value directly instead .
Instead of ' A ' , write 65 .
This is a small savings but it can really add up .
7. Use - instead of !=
In nearly every situation , the != operator can be replaced with the – operator with no change in functionality .
This is not true when you have code that relies on the result of the comparison to be either 0 or 1 , if you ’re assigning the result to a variable of a type where a non -zero result might be converted to 0 , or if you ’re simply assigning the result to a variable of an incompatible type .
Again , you save one character per use .
8. Use & and |
In many situations , the use of && and || is unnecessary , and they can be replaced with their one - character bitwise cousins .
Be careful that you preserve the semantics of your program when doing this substitution , particularly if you use the advice in # 7 .
Bitwise or will always give you the same result , truth - wise , as logical or , but bitwise and will not ; use bitwise and only when you know that the truth values on both sides will always have at least one 1 bit in common .
If you ca n’t guarantee this then you may be able to get away with using the * operator , but beware of overflow .
You can take advantage of the fact that C’s comparison operators will always give either a 0 or a 1 as their result , so there ’s no problem in doing ( a < b ) & ( c > d ) .
9 . Use the ternary operator and short circuiting
? : is shorter than if / else and is equivalent in most situations , so use it when you can .
For situations without the else , you may also take advantage of the short - circuiting properties of && and || .
10 .
Adjust your constants
Using constants can help reduce code size by substituting a short identifier for a longer number .
Watch carefully how your constant is used .
If you discover that most code using the constant is immediately subtracting one from it , for example , you can simply subtract one from the constant itself , then modify the minority code to add one , saving valuable characters .
In the extreme case , you may discover that the manipulation drops a digit from the constant , making it use less space to simply inline the new , shorter number in your code .
Putting it into practice
To demonstrate these principles , I wrote a short calculator program .
It takes input on stdin in prefix notation , and prints the results of the calculations .
You can give it input such as + * 5 5 7 and it will give you the answer of 32 .
This original non-shrunk version is 411 significant characters :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < string .h> int getnum ( int c ) { int n = 0 ; do { n *= 10 ; n += c - ' 0 ' ; c = getchar ( ) ; } while ( c >= ' 0 ' && c <= ' 9 ' ) ; return n ; } int calc ( void ) { int c = getchar ( ) ; if ( c == EOF ) exit ( 0 ) ; if ( c == ' ' || c == '
') return calc ( ) ; if (c == '*') return calc ( ) * calc( ) ; if ( c == '+') return calc ( ) + calc ( ) ; if (c == '- ') return calc ( ) - calc( ) ; if (c == '/') return calc ( ) / calc( ) ; // read a number return getnum ( c ) ; } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { while ( 1 ) printf ( "
%d
" , calc ( ) ) ; return 0 ; }
By putting these principles into practice , I was able to shrink it to a mere 284 characters .
There was a certain loss of readability , but I ’m sure you will all agree that the tradeoff is well worth it :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < string.h > # define r return # define h c = getchar ( ) ; typedef int i ; i _( i c ) { i _ = 0 ; do { _ = _ * 10 + c - 48 ; h } while ( c > 47 & c < 58 ) ; r _ ; } i d( void ) { i h if ( c +
1 ) { r c - 32 && c - 10 ? # define o( x , y ) c == x ? d( ) y d( ) : o( 42 , *) o( 43 , + ) o( 45 , -) o( 47 , /) _( c ) : d( ) ; } exit ( 0 ) ; } i main ( i x , char **y ) { while ( 1 ) printf ( "

COLUMBIA , Mo. —
For a man with a truly curious profession , Robert D. Hall , 59 , has a relaxed way of talking about his work .
Dr. Hall , who studies insects and how they live off dead humans , is associate vice chancellor for research at the University of Missouri .
He is also a lawyer , a retired Army colonel and a forensic entomologist , meaning that he evaluates insect evidence to help solve crimes .
Think of him as Sherlock Holmes with a fly swatter and tweezers .
“ The interesting thing about forensic entomology , ” Dr. Hall said recently , “ is that if you ask insects the right question , they give an honest answer .
They ’ve got no motive to lie .
Forensic entomologists could be used to great benefit in more criminal matters than they are today . ”
Q. What exactly does a forensic entomologist do ?
A . We ’re applied biologists .
In criminal cases , whenever a dead body is found , law enforcement will immediately try to establish two things : the identity of the victim and their time of death .
Forensic entomologists will look at the insects on the corpse — their size , their origins , their species — to see if there are clues that might explain the death .
Greed is Good and Bad
Greed is typically considered a major source of evil that is the root cause for stealing , hoarding , plundering , and treason , just to name a few sins .
However , greed can be good , while other types of greed can be very bad .
For instance , greed is good , because it is the most important incentive for people to work hard , get a good education , start a business , or invest in a company .
This makes people productive and contributing members of society .
And in return , people are paid a salary , become more educated , and ( hopefully ) build wealth so that they can in return live a prosperous , more comfortable , and full life .
Unfortunately , this leads to three types of bad greed .
First , after some people have collected a large enough personal wealth , they retire .
Thus making these people no longer a productive member of society , who use more resources than they provide .
Sure , these people invest their wealth in stocks , bonds , real estate , and other financial investments ; however these people are selfishly idle when they could still be contributing more to society .
Of course not every retired person is able to work in the traditional sense , but they are still able to contribute .
For example , instead of playing golf with other retirees in Florida , retirees could help their children by babysitting their grandchildren or even teaching their grandchildren how to fish or knit a sweater .
In other words , it is alright to retire from work but do not retire from society .
If someone is physically and mentally able to contribute , do so .
A second form of greed is for people to continue collecting wealth even after they have far surpassed the amount of money that they need for the rest of their lives .
Some people leave so much inheritance that even their children and grandchildren can not possibly use all of it .
This is why some people , such as Bill Gates , his wife ( Melinda Gates ) , and Warren Buffet are donating most of their huge fortunes to charity .
They understand the virtue of generosity , instead of succumbing to greed .
I can only hope that I am capable of such charity .
Third and finally , greed sometimes drives people to do unethical , immoral , and illegal things in the pursuit of more money .
Greed is typically considered the accumulation of wealth for personal satisfaction .
It has no useful purpose except to become rich and to continue getting more wealthy .
It is a strong desire in each and every one of us that is extremely difficult to overcome .
Only through continuously contributing and donating to society can we find true rewards that are far greater than the illusion that greed provides .

The way people work has changed dramatically , but the way their companies are organised lags far behind , says Tim Hindle ( interviewed here )
FIFTY years ago William Whyte , an editor at Fortune magazine , wrote a book called “ The Organisation Man ” that defined the nature of corporate life for a generation .
The book described how America ( whose people , he said , had “ led in the public worship of individualism ” ) had recently turned into a nation of employees who “ take the vows of organisation life ” and who had become “ the dominant members of our society ” .
Foremost among the organisations that Whyte had in mind was the corporation , which he thought rewarded long service , obedience and loyalty quite as faithfully as did any monastery or battalion .
“ Blood brother to the business trainee off to join DuPont is the seminary student who will end up in the church hierarchy , ” he wrote .
The New York Times praised
Whyte for recognising that “ the entrepreneurial scramble to success has been largely replaced by the organisational crawl . ”
Half a century on , organisation man seems almost extinct , though occasionally he can still be spotted in Hollywood .
In “ The Hours ” , a 2002 Oscar - winning film , the actor John Reilly plays a character who lives in a 1950s Los Angeles suburban bungalow , just as Whyte 's organisation man lived in “ the new suburbia , the packaged villages that have become the dormitory of the new generation of organisation men ” .
Mr Reilly is waved off to work every morning by his young son and his faithful wife , played by Julianne Moore .
His shirt is white and his suit and tie are dark , broken only by the line of a white handkerchief in his breast pocket .
He spends all day in an office with the same small group of people and returns home each evening at the same time .
“ This is perfect , ” he says of his life over dinner one evening .
The company that used to be most closely identified with this way of life was IBM .
For many years its managers wore only dark blue suits , white shirts and dark ties , symbols of their lifetime allegiance to Big Blue .
It is some measure of the change that has taken place since Whyte 's day that today 50 % of IBM 's employees have worked for the company for under five years ; 40 % of its 320,000 employees are “ mobile ” , meaning that they do not report daily to an IBM site ; and about 30 % are women .
An organisation that was once dominated by lifetime employees selling computer products has been transformed into a conglomeration of transient suppliers of services .
Organisation man has been replaced by a set of managers much more given to entrepreneurial scramble than to organisational crawl .
This transformation has been brought about by a variety of changes in the environment in which businesses operate , particularly in communications technology , in the globalisation of production and sales , and in the large - scale shift of responsibility to outsiders for what were once considered a company 's core functions — via outsourcing , joint - ventures and other sorts of alliances that involve a loosening of control over vital inputs .
Whyte , who died in 1999 , would have enjoyed witnessing organisation man 's metamorphosis into “ networked person ” , a species that can now be observed in airport lounges , on fast inter-city trains and at motorway service stations .
Networked person is always on the move , juggling with a laptop computer , a mobile phone and a BlackBerry for e-mails , keeping in electronic touch with people he ( and increasingly she ) no longer regularly bumps into in a corridor .
Indeed , there may be no corridor .
These days , many employees besides IBMers no longer have a physical home base in a building provided by their employer .
Organisation man did bump into people in corridors , but he was cautious about networking .
In his world , knowledge was power , and he needed to be careful about sharing out his particular store of it .
He found comfort in hierarchy , which obviated the need to be self - motivating and take risks .
He lived in a highly structured world where lines of authority were clearly drawn on charts , decisions were made on high , and knowledge resided in manuals .
Networked person , by contrast , takes decisions all the time , guided by the knowledge base she has access to , the corporate culture she has embraced , and the colleagues with whom she is constantly communicating .
She interacts with a far greater number of people than her father did .
A famous 1967 study by Stanley Milgram ( which later became the basis for a film ) suggested that there were at most “ six degrees of separation ” between any two people in America , meaning that the chain of acquaintances between them never had more than six links .
According to more recent work along similar lines , that number has now fallen to 4.6 , despite the growth in America 's population since Milgram 's study .
Being able to keep in touch with a much wider range of people through technologies such as e-mail has brought everyone closer .
And yet despite the dramatic changes in the way people work , the organisations in which they carry out that work have changed much less than might be expected .
In an article in the McKinsey Quarterly last year , Lowell Bryan and Claudia Joyce , two of the firm 's consultants , argued that “ today 's big companies do very little to enhance the productivity of their professionals .
In fact , their vertically oriented organisational structures , retrofitted with ad hoc and matrix overlays , nearly always make professional work more complex and inefficient . ”
In other words , 21st - century organisations are not fit for 21st - century workers .
Mercer Delta , a consulting firm that specialises in “ organisational architecture ” , recently observed that “ the models and frameworks that shaped our leading organisations from the end of the second world war through the conclusion of the cold war are clearly obsolete in this new era of e-business , perpetual innovation and global competition . ”
The design of today 's complex enterprises , says Mercer Delta , requires an entirely new way of thinking about organisations .
The classic structure in which organisation man felt comfortable consisted of a number of business units that operated similarly but separately .
They were controlled by a head office that determined strategy and watched over its implementation .
It was a system of command and control in which everybody knew his place , made visible in the organisation charts that laid down the corporate hierarchy .
A surprising number of companies today still have much the same command - and - control structure that they had 50 years ago .
According to the Boston Consulting Group , what it calls “ the imperialist corporate centre ” is still the most common type of headquarters .
And companies that do decentralise decision - making and accountability often recentralise it again when they run into trouble .
Twenty years ago , Motorola , a co-inventor of the mobile phone , was a tightly centralised business .
Three men in its headquarters at Schaumburg , Illinois ( including Bob Galvin , the founder 's son ) , were in control of almost everything that went on .
As the company grew , they decided to decentralise .
But by the mid-1990s the company 's mobile - phone business was growing so fast that decentralisation made it impossible to control .
“ While the numbers are getting better , an organisation can be falling apart , ” says Pat Canavan , Motorola 's chief governance officer .
In 1998 the company laid off 25,000 people and repatriated control to the Schaumburg headquarters .
The trouble with silos
The main failing of the classic structure was that it impeded the spread of knowledge and limited the economies of scale that could be reaped .
Ideas and commands moved up and down from headquarters to the units , leading to the creation of vertical “ silos ” with very little communication between them .
Financial - service institutions were notorious for not knowing whether customers who signed up for one service were already customers for other services being provided by the same institution .
As firms became more global , they added what McKinsey called a “ matrix overlay ” to this structure .
Most famously associated with Philips , a Dutch electrical and electronics giant ( see article ) , this attempted to take more account of the different national markets in which a company was operating by superimposing geographical silos that cut across the traditional business units .
Such organisations have not commanded universal admiration .
In 1990 , in a paper published by the Harvard Business Review , Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher Bartlett , two academics , reported that matrix structures “ led to conflict and confusion ; the proliferation of channels created informational logjams as a proliferation of committees and reports bogged down the organisation ; and overlapping responsibilities produced turf battles and a loss of accountability . ”
Nigel Nicholson , a professor of organisational behaviour at the London Business School , called the matrix structure “ one of the most difficult and least successful organisational forms . ”
Messrs Ghoshal and Bartlett wrote in the past tense , suggesting that companies had escaped from the matrix corset .
But 15 years after the article was published , many are still trying to struggle free .
Gerard Fairtlough , a former CEO of Shell Chemicals and the founder of Celltech , a British biotechnology company , also suggests that companies are still being held back by their addiction to hierarchy .
In a recent book , “ The Three Ways of Getting Things Done ” , he points to alternatives to the hierarchical structure that many companies see as their only option .
“ You can't have a bunch of hippies running a plant full of explosive hydrocarbons , ” he says .
“ But would you rather have the plant operated by trained professionals , for whom pride in safe working is part of their personal identity , or by people who only work safely because they are afraid of the boss ?
The identification of discipline with hierarchy is a dangerous mistake . ”
Mr Fairtlough 's preferred alternative is something he calls “ responsible autonomy ” , a form of organisation in which groups of workers decide for themselves what to do , but are accountable for the outcome .
Clearly there is a need for new kinds of organisation that are more appropriate to modern working methods .
But there are many reasons why companies are not in a hurry to adopt them .

How Much Should a Web Design Cost ?
Every week , I get emails from potential clients who all want to know one thing :
How much for a design ?
Nine times out of ten , my answer causes them to run for the hills .
Scary thing is , based on industry buzz , my prices could actually be considered totally reasonable by comparison .
Do n’t believe me ?
Well , today you get the whole scoop — my prices , their prices , and my always - priceless editorial commentary on the subject :-)
My Prices
For the sake of argument , I ’m going to constrain today ’s post to blog design only .
When people email me and ask for a quote , I always follow the same process .
I visit their current site and determine the following :
The current CMS platform ( WordPress , MovableType , Drupal , etc. )
The scope of the site – how many unique styling elements will be required for specialty pages ?
The perceived complexity of the re-design .
Does this person want a graphical masterpiece with all kinds of bells and whistles ?
Generally speaking , there ’s not a whole lot of variance in these areas from blog to blog , so after checking out the site in question , I usually have a good idea of how much to charge .
Now , to answer the question you all want to hear …
How much is all this gonna run ya ?
At this time , blog designs start at $ 1500 .
This price is for a blog that has minimal graphical complexity , no customized icons , and no logo production .
What you do get at this price is rock - solid , hand - crafted , browser - tested CSS , XHTML , and simple ( but striking ) graphic design .
In most cases , bells and whistles like plugin support , unique page designs , and extra graphics push the price up into the $ 1800 - $ 2000 range .
From there , the price is largely dictated by page - specific CSS / XHTML production and custom graphic design .
It ’s totally conceivable that a pimped out blog could run as much as $ 3000 .
Rest assured , though , that it would be totally badass , and the recipient of the design would receive mad props for having such a killer online abode .
Their Prices
Based on my experience , I have reason to believe that about 90 % of you who just saw my prices thought , “ Gosh , that ’s awfully expensive ! ”
Well , you ’re right , but actually , you ’re wrong too .
You ’re right because $ 1800 is a decent chunk of change – for an individual .
You ’re wrong because companies throw this kind of bread around all the time .
They do so because they understand that crafting a brand holds a value that is oftentimes hard to measure in dollars and cents alone .
On top of that , companies typically have a monetary objective behind the launch of a new design , so to them , there ’s a foreseeable payoff .
Individuals , on the other hand , are oftentimes unable to see things in such a positive light .
Let ’s face it – most people do n’t make a sustainable ( or even decent ) income off of their blog .
Everybody wants a killer design , especially after seeing one that they lust over .
Problem is , nobody wants to pay for it .
At this year ’s SXSW , I attended a very informative roundtable discussion that focused on – what else ?
– blog design .
Naturally , the hottest topic of discussion was pricing , and the panelists freely gave out information regarding not only their prices , but also some info regarding industry pricing trends .
For instance , a company called The Blog Studio charges $ 3000 - $ 5000 for a blog design .
Some people thought this was quite high , but Peter ( who runs TBS ) was cool enough to break things down into their individual elements to explain pricing more thoroughly .
It ’s been nearly three months since SXSW , so I ’ll try and rehash things as best I can here .
The major elements of blog design include :
Graphical comps produced in Photoshop
Graphical splicing for optimal CSS / XHTML structure
CSS / XHTML production in standards - compliant fashion
Unique CSS / XHTML adaptation to CMS platform of choice
Bell - and - whistle functionality to meet client requirements
All of the steps highlighted above require a certain degree of expertise to be completed in professional fashion .
Unfortunately , people who want designs are oftentimes unfamiliar with the amount of knowledge required to pull all this off in seamless fashion .
Sometimes I think people see a design and think it ’s all just a matter of applying a “ look ” to stuff that ’s already there .
In reality , that ’s basically what ’s going on .
In practice , however , things are intensely more complicated .
And this is why you hire a professional .
Another person on the panel at the SXSW design discussion was the female member of a husband and wife design team .
While I do n’t remember her name , I certainly remember what she said about blog pricing .
$ 2500 and up , and this “ just really begins to cover the actual time investment ” required to deliver a complete , robust design .
Want another example ?
Javier Cabrera , a talented designer who ’s responsible for some really great stuff , charges $ 2500 as a base price .
How ’s my $ 1800 price tag sound now ?
Looks to me like I need to raise my prices :-)
Watch out for that curveball !
People like surprises .
Unfortunately , when those surprises include a hefty price tag , people hate them .
Here ’s why professional web designs are the curveballs of the site construction process .
Well , hey , let ’s look at the process first :
Buy a domain name : $ 10 Buy a hosting package : $ 60 / yr. with two years prepaid – $ 120 You set everything up , and then you realize you need a design because your site currently looks like 50,000 others out there .
Whoops .
The problem here is that when setting up a new site , newbies often think , “ $ 10 for a domain ?
Awesome , let ’s get started ! ”
Next , they get hit with the reality of hosting fees , and while they ’re a little bummed about having to pre-pay for two years in order to lock in that great price of $ 5.50 / mo. , they go ahead and kick down $ 100 - $ 200 to set up their hosting .
Their tab is already up around $ 200 , and now they ’re beginning to wonder if this web stuff is all it ’s cracked up to be .
Unfortunately , they get hit with a wicked case of design lust while browsing and getting acquainted with the blogosphere , and now they really want a hot design .
“ Should n’t cost too much , right ?
After all , look at all those cool designs out there ! ”
And then BAM !
They get slapped with the reality that a wicked design is going to cost them $ 1500 + , and they totally reject the idea , especially since the hosting fees were already a tough pill to swallow .
Talk about your curveballs .
Case study : my clients
My clients all have one thing in common .
They have a concrete , business - based reason for hiring me to design them a killer site .
Thus far , there have been no exceptions to this rule .
All of my clients are doing one of the following :
Using their site to sell a product
Building a subscription list for marketing purposes
Building links and increasing exposure to help with ad / referral conversion
Based on this information , I think it ’s fair to conclude that professional designs are really only open to the following people :
Those with a plan
Those with a lot of money
I never really thought of it this way until this morning , but it ’s definitely true .
Professional blog designs are a luxury item .
Look at it like this : plenty of businesses buy 60 ″ HD TV’s for their stores and displays , but only individual consumers who have money and really want a big , bad TV would ever actually kick down and buy one .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Most Americans are angry about " something " when it comes to how the country is run , and they are more likely than in previous years to vote for a challenger this November , a new poll suggests .
A majority of Americans surveyed -- and a higher percentage than recorded during the same time last year -- said things in the United States are going " badly . "
Among this year 's respondents , 29 percent said " pretty badly " and 25 percent -- up from 15 percent a month ago -- answered " very badly . "
By comparison , 37 percent described the way things are going as " fairly well , " and 9 percent answered " very well . "
Of these people , 76 percent said there was " something " to be angry about in the country today .
By comparison , 59 percent felt that way when polled in February .
( Watch Bill Schneider 's take on angry voters -- 1:40 )
Only 21 percent said they were " generally content " in the latest poll .
Nine percent said they considered the economy to be " very good , " a number unchanged from a June CNN poll .
But the number who considered conditions " somewhat good " dropped from 42 percent to 35 percent over the same period .
The number of respondents who consider the economy " somewhat poor " rose from 31 percent to 34 percent , and the number who called the economy " very poor " jumped from 16 percent to 22 percent .
A majority -- 55 percent -- said they are more likely to back a challenger in races on this year 's ballot .
Such anti-incumbent sentiment is higher than the 48 percent recorded as " pro-challenger " in a similar survey in 1994 , when the GOP took control of both houses of Congress .
Nonetheless , 48 percent said that , if most of the present members of Congress were replaced with new members , there would be no difference .
By contrast , 42 percent said such a scenario would change Congress for the better , and 7 percent said it would change Congress for the worse .
The results , based on a half - sample of 1,004 adult Americans polled by Opinion Research Corporation for CNN Wednesday through Saturday have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
More than 60 percent of those surveyed said government policies need either major changes or a complete overhaul , while 30 percent said minor changes were needed .
Only 7 percent said no change is necessary .
The economy topped the list of respondents ' concerns , with 28 percent calling it the most important issue when deciding how to cast their ballots .
Coming second was Iraq at 25 percent , followed by terrorism ( 18 percent ) , moral issues ( 15 percent ) and immigration ( 14 percent ) .
( Watch Bush dispute idea that Iraq is in civil war - 4:09 )
Democrats lead Republicans by a 10 - point margin , 53 to 43 percent , among likely voters asked which party 's congressional candidate they would support in November , and Democrats held a 56 - 40 lead on the same question among registered voters .
The survey has a sampling error of 3 percentage points among the full group and 4 percentage points among likely voters .
Nearly half of the respondents -- 49 percent -- said they considered the GOP the party of strong leadership .
But 56 percent said they considered the Democrats the party of change , with 49 percent considering them the more forward - looking party .

Place and Plasticity : Two Views on the Hippocampus Place and Plasticity : Two Views on the Hippocampus

Step right up to see the tiny horse .

The brain structure mildly resembling a seahorse .
The relatively large brain structure mildly resembling a ram 's horn .
Every time we think we get the hippocampus nailed down it squirms out of grasp .
Anatomically and functionally it can be lumped in with a larger structural formation referred to as the hippocampal formation , or it can be divided into hippocampal subregions based around curving cell layers : the CA ( cornu ammonis ) fields , 1 and 3 being the clearest and best understood , and the dentate gyrus .
There is too much to know about the hippocampus .
It is studied for its pattern completing and separating computational properties , its rhythmic electrical field potential oscillations , its deceptively simple trisynaptic wiring diagram , its role in modulation of the stress response , the birth of new neurons in the adult dentate gyrus , the plasticity of its synapses , the response of its cells to spatial information , and its role in autobiographical memory of events .
I will focus on the last two : spatial representation and episodic memory .
Both aspects are areas of ongoing research generating controversy and debate within the field , and they have significant overlap .
It may become apparent as we dig deeper that they are two sides of the same coin and that investigating each provides insight into the other .
Temporal Lobes and Temporal Gradients
The contemporary era of hippocampus research really kicked off in the 60s and 70s .
There were hints that the hippocampus might be related to memory before then , but a breakthrough came in 1957 , when patient HM , suffering from intractable epilepsy for 11 years , had large portions of his medial temporal lobe on both sides removed to eliminate the epileptic foci .
If you picture the brain as a boxing glove , the
Two major aspects of the hippocampus ' relation to memory arose from studies with HM and other patients like him .
One was the idea of memory taxonomy that separates memories that can be recalled as ' mental time travel ' returning to the spatiotemporal context where the experience happened .
This type of memory is referred to as episodic memory and contrasts with procedural memory , for instance , in which motor or coordination tasks are learnt .
HM would probably be able to learn to ski , but he would not remember the process of learning .
Memory taxonomy is not yet clear .
A lot of terminology has been invented , but because recollection is a subjective experience it is hard to assay accurately in humans and especially hard to test for in animals .
The second idea arising from HM 's deficits was that of a temporally graded retrograde amnesia .
The memories acquired more recently , in the years just prior to surgery were much more greatly affected than those from HM 's childhood .
This led to the idea that recently acquired memories spend some time stored in the hippocampus as a waystation before they take off to permanent storage sites in the synapses between various cortical neurons .
The literature nowadays is conflicted and disconnected regarding the idea of a temporal gradient .
It has taken a while to discover memory tasks that test the sort of memories we expect the hippocampus to handle .
A favorite is contextual fear conditioning , but it is still frustratingly complex .
A rat is supposed to learn about a context by combining all the information about its surroundings coming from different sensory processing areas into an index such that re-exposure to just a partial set of the initial context cues can reactivate the memory of the whole experience .
To be concrete , if the context smells like acetic acid , the light is red , and there is a fan blowing in the background , the rat might just need the smell to bring all the rest of the context flooding back .
In contextual fear conditioning , a rat learns to associated a context with shock , presumably via hippocampus to amygdala connections .
A temporal gradient for contextual fear conditioning was reported in 1992 by
The theory that the hippocampus is only a temporary memory storage site is called " systems consolidation " .
Remember how the hippocampus is supposed to pull together information from different sensory processing areas ?
In systems consolidation theory , the memory is rehearsed with those same areas until they get wired together and can reactivate the memory independent of the hippocampus .
There are many reasons to like systems consolidation theory , but there are complexities .
Here is one example .
Kim and Fanselow did n't lesion the whole hippocampus .
An alternative story to systems consolidation is the multiple trace theory .
Rather than moving the memory out of the hippocampus , the memory representation could become distributed in the hippocampus up and down the dorsal - ventral axis making it more impervious to small lesions .
This is a potentially devastating blow for systems consolidation theory , but the discussion continues .
New papers have reported temporal gradients for retrograde amnesia in other hippocampus dependent tasks in animal models .
Studies using activation markers and multi-electrode recordings are providing new evidence of post - training hippocampal - cortical communications and coordination especially during sleep .
Part of the reason the new multi-unit recording studies are so provocative is that they allow a strong link between our understanding of the hippocampus as a memory storage device and another major theory of the hippocampus : cognitive map theory .
Grid cells and Gridlock
Perhaps the best way to understand
O'Keefe and Dostrovsky provided the first observation of place cells in 1971 .
When they recorded electrical signals from the hippocampus of a rat as it explored an environment they found that some cells had a fairly low basal firing rate , but would fire much more rapidly while the rat was in a specific part of the environment .
There is a cell in your hippocampus that fires when you are standing at the foot of your bed and another for when you are in your shower .
Actually , the cells remap if the environment is distinguishable as an entirely new context , so you might have two separate maps for the bedroom and the bathroom .
O'Keefe and Nadel built on the idea that the hippocampus is responsible for encoding spatial information to create the theory of the hippocampus as a cognitive map .
They proposed that our perceptions help produce and are represented in relation to a spatial framework in the hippocampus which we use to figure out where we are and where we 're going .
In humans , the cognitive map is the framework for storing memory for events in a spatiotemporal context .
You could imagine , for instance , that your location is the anchor for your memory of events .
What 's the most important thing to establish at the beginning of a work of fiction ?
The setting .
The cognitive map theory is not without its critics and controversies , but I do n't want to get bogged down in it .
These are exciting times for place cell researchers .
A great deal of enthusiasm has surrounded the discovery by the Moser lab in Trondheim , Norway of
Grid cells solve the problem of navigation in a novel environment .
Place cells are consistent within a familiar enviroment , but it takes a little while for them to form their preferences upon exposure to a new room .
How does one keep track of position when you do n't have a map yet ?
A memory is more than just where you were though .
It also includes a sequential order of events .
Simultaneous recording of large numbers of place cells in the hippocampus has allowed the investigation of the sequential / temporal aspect of memory by way of patterns of spatial experience .
I will provide one example from earlier this year .
Another popular example of the special relationship between space and the hippocampus is the story of the London cabbies .
London cabbies have to memorize the spatial layout of the city to an incredible level of detail .
Imaging studies have revealed the hippocampus of a London cabbie is shaped differently than your average person ; some parts are bigger and some are smaller .
Greater volume differences are associated with more years of experience as a taxi driver .
The obvious implication is that learning and using all those map details really works out their space muscles , growing more cells or larger cells in the hippocampus , and reorganizing according to the demand .
This is n't entirely implausible since the hippocampus is one of only two confirmed sources of newborn neurons in the adult brain .
There are alternatives though : the simple act of driving in the city with the attendant stress , motor planning , and cognitive demands might affect the hippocampus .
A
Memory for places or places for memory ?
The discovery of place cells clearly indicated that the hippocampus represents where we are , but the discovery of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex reallocates a good - sized portion of that responsibility .
Why then are the cells that should be handling memory wasting their time representing spatial location at all ?
One possibility is that location is the framework in which we embed our memories .
A recent issue of the journal , Hippocampus , contained a collection of articles suggesting a strong correspondence if not isomorphism between the characteristics of place cells and memory .
Exploration of the hippocampus ' abilities continues .
I have not scratched the surface even in this mega - post .
The theories of the hippocampus as a memory storage device and a cognitive map are not mutually exclusive and may turn out to be one and the same .
I came to an interest in the hippocampus via a more philosophical route : considering the role of memory in the definition of the self and such , but there are plenty of noble non-navel - gazing reasons to delve deep into this structure as well .
The hippocampus shows signs of damage and deterioration early on in Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia , and the same recurrent excitatory connectivity so useful for memory storage may also provide the substrate for the electrical storms underlying epilepsy .
I hope you now have some more of the conceptual framework necessary for reading and evaluating new hippocampus articles , and we can talk about it some more when good studies come out .
Now make like a hippocampectomized rat and get lost !
The contemporary era of hippocampus research really kicked off in the 60s and 70s .
There were hints that the hippocampus might be related to memory before then , but a breakthrough came in 1957 , when patient HM , suffering from intractable epilepsy for 11 years , had large portions of his medial temporal lobe on both sides removed to eliminate the epileptic foci .
If you picture the brain as a boxing glove , the temporal lobe is where the thumb would be .
The medial temporal lobe is the part of the temporal lobe nearer to the middle of the brain , where the thumb touches the rest of your brainfist .
The hippocampus runs along the inner side of this lobe from thumbtip to thenar and , depending on the species might curve up to the first joint of the index finger .
When HM had his medial temporal lobe removed his epilepsy was cured , but his memory was severely disrupted .
Specifically , he could remember new experiences for a short time so long as he was n't distracted , and he could remember experiences form his remote past .
He was not capable of storing new long - term memories or recalling recent memories .
Two major aspects of the hippocampus ' relation to memory arose from studies with HM and other patients like him .
One was the idea of memory taxonomy that separates memories that can be recalled as ' mental time travel ' returning to the spatiotemporal context where the experience happened .
This type of memory is referred to as episodic memory and contrasts with procedural memory , for instance , in which motor or coordination tasks are learnt .

To be concrete , if the context smells like acetic acid , the light is red , and there is a fan blowing in the background , the rat might just need the smell to bring all the rest of the context flooding back .
In contextual fear conditioning , a rat learns to associated a context with shock , presumably via hippocampus to amygdala connections .
A temporal gradient for contextual fear conditioning was reported in 1992 by Kim and Fanselow , now a classic , highly cited paper .
They trained rats in this task and then lesioned the dorsal hippocampus at various times afterwards ( retrograde lesions ) .
The rats that received lesions a day after training forgot to be scared in the context , whereas rats that received lesions a month after retained their memory .
This is a perfect analog for the story of HM in rat years .
Recently acquired memories are more vulnerable to hippocampus lesions .
The theory that the hippocampus is only a temporary memory storage site is called " systems consolidation " .
Remember how the hippocampus is supposed to pull together information from different sensory processing areas ?
In systems consolidation theory , the memory is rehearsed with those same areas until they get wired together and can reactivate the memory independent of the hippocampus .
There are many reasons to like systems consolidation theory , but there are complexities .
Here is one example .
Kim and Fanselow did n't lesion the whole hippocampus .
An alternative story to systems consolidation is the multiple trace theory .
Rather than moving the memory out of the hippocampus , the memory representation could become distributed in the hippocampus up and down the dorsal - ventral axis making it more impervious to small lesions .
Nadel and Moscovitch have been major proponents of the multiple trace theory and recently reviewed the human memory literature , even questioning the original interpretation of HM 's deficits .
One issue is how to ascertain whether a memory is truly episodic or is merely semantic ( memory for facts that does n't require autobiographical recollection ; think rote memorization ) .
For instance , I can tell you from my semantic memory what Neil Armstrong said after his first steps on the moon , but when he tells you the same thing he is re-living an episode from his life in a way that requires a type of processing that the hippocampus is especially good at .
Using tests more sensitive to this distinction , HM has recently been reevaluated and found to have amnesia for episodic memory across his entire life .
This is a potentially devastating blow for systems consolidation theory , but the discussion continues .
New papers have reported temporal gradients for retrograde amnesia in other hippocampus dependent tasks in animal models .
Studies using activation markers and multi-electrode recordings are providing new evidence of post - training hippocampal - cortical communications and coordination especially during sleep .
Part of the reason the new multi-unit recording studies are so provocative is that they allow a strong link between our understanding of the hippocampus as a memory storage device and another major theory of the hippocampus : cognitive map theory .
Perhaps the best way to understand the cognitive map theory of the hippocampus is to look at a place field .
This is a two - dimensional map of an environment that some rat is exploring .
The line tracks the path taken by the rat during the rat and marks red where firing of a particular cell rises above some threshold .
Note that there is a bright red hotspot in the upper right hand corner .
You would call this the place field for the cell being recorded in this experiment .
O'Keefe and Dostrovsky provided the first observation of place cells in 1971 .
When they recorded electrical signals from the hippocampus of a rat as it explored an environment they found that some cells had a fairly low basal firing rate , but would fire much more rapidly while the rat was in a specific part of the environment .
There is a cell in your hippocampus that fires when you are standing at the foot of your bed and another for when you are in your shower .

What 's the most important thing to establish at the beginning of a work of fiction ?
The setting .
The cognitive map theory is not without its critics and controversies , but I do n't want to get bogged down in it .
These are exciting times for place cell researchers .
A great deal of enthusiasm has surrounded the discovery by the Moser lab in Trondheim , Norway of grid cells .
Grid cells are very similar to place cells , but they serve a different purpose .
They are found in the entorhinal cortex which is the last stop for sensory information being funneled down to the hippocampus .
Rather than firing in one specific place field , grid cells have a triangular - grid shaped receptive field .
Once again , it is easier to show than say .
Grid cells solve the problem of navigation in a novel environment .
Place cells are consistent within a familiar enviroment , but it takes a little while for them to form their preferences upon exposure to a new room .
How does one keep track of position when you do n't have a map yet ?
Zork fans know the answer .
If you went two spaces north and two spaces east , you can go two spaces southwest and get back to the room where the elf stole your jeweled key or whatever .
It 's called path integration .
You sum the vectors of your movements to add up to the total displacement from your starting point .
To turn this into a map of the white house with a boarded front door , you might start with a fresh piece of graph paper .
The regularly repeating structure of spatial representation in grid cells serves the same purpose .
They provide a framework for you to build a map inside .
A memory is more than just where you were though .
It also includes a sequential order of events .
Simultaneous recording of large numbers of place cells in the hippocampus has allowed the investigation of the sequential / temporal aspect of memory by way of patterns of spatial experience .
I will provide one example from earlier this year .
Foster and Wilson recorded from many place cells as a rat moved down a linear track like you or I would walk down a hallway .
They move at relatively constant rate in one direction and eat some food at the end .
The place cells that represented location during the previous trek down the hallway can fire action potentials while the rat is chillin ' out at the end , eating his reward , and they do it in a rapid meaningful sequence .
The cell closest to the end of the hallway kicks it off and the one at the beginning of the hallway is at the end .
These and other sequentially organized patterns in the hippocampus might bring the firing in close enough proximity to be characterized as coinicidental .
Coincidental firing is the first sign to the nervous system that maybe these two neurons ought to be hooked up to each other , so later when the memory of one portion of the hallway is recalled you are able to traverse across synaptic bridges to the rest of the house .
There are also hints that this sort of sequential replay may occur during sleep and coincide with activation of neocortical areas , providing links between sleep , memory , and systems consolidation theory .
Another popular example of the special relationship between space and the hippocampus is the story of the London cabbies .
London cabbies have to memorize the spatial layout of the city to an incredible level of detail .
Imaging studies have revealed the hippocampus of a London cabbie is shaped differently than your average person ; some parts are bigger and some are smaller .
Greater volume differences are associated with more years of experience as a taxi driver .
The obvious implication is that learning and using all those map details really works out their space muscles , growing more cells or larger cells in the hippocampus , and reorganizing according to the demand .
This is n't entirely implausible since the hippocampus is one of only two confirmed sources of newborn neurons in the adult brain .
There are alternatives though : the simple act of driving in the city with the attendant stress , motor planning , and cognitive demands might affect the hippocampus .
A recent update attempted to control for these issues by comparing cabbies who have to really know the maps to bus drivers who do the same amount of driving without the memorization requirements .
The volume differences hold up , and what 's more , taxi drivers had more trouble learning new spatial information .
This finding hints that there may actually be a limit to storage capacity for spatial information , which is not something we run up against day - to - day .
Of course , the caveat that correlation is not causation remains .
People with funny - shaped hippocampi might just have a predisposition to become cabbies and stick with it , but the study authors point to some evidence suggesting that initial spatial capabilities do n't correlate with hippocampus shape suggesting that this alternative is n't strongly supported .
The discovery of place cells clearly indicated that the hippocampus represents where we are , but the discovery of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex reallocates a good - sized portion of that responsibility .
Why then are the cells that should be handling memory wasting their time representing spatial location at all ?
One possibility is that location is the framework in which we embed our memories .
A recent issue of the journal , Hippocampus , contained a collection of articles suggesting a strong correspondence if not isomorphism between the characteristics of place cells and memory .
Sheri Mizumori provided an excellent introductory article profiling areas of overlap and distinguishing features of these two processes .
For instance , certain drugs affect memory and place field representation in the same direction , and place fields become more refined as rats gain more experience in an environment .
As a more concrete example , a study in 2003 reported changes in the response properties of place cells after fear conditioning .
After establishing the place field representation in exploring , the study 's authors delivered a tone paired with an aversive stimulus .
Afterwards , place cells became responsive to tone and location .
The cells of the hippocampus are capable of responding to more than just place , but place still held a primary role .
A cell could only fire in response to the tone if the rat was in its particular preferred location .
Exploration of the hippocampus ' abilities continues .
I have not scratched the surface even in this mega - post .
The theories of the hippocampus as a memory storage device and a cognitive map are not mutually exclusive and may turn out to be one and the same .
I came to an interest in the hippocampus via a more philosophical route : considering the role of memory in the definition of the self and such , but there are plenty of noble non-navel - gazing reasons to delve deep into this structure as well .

Raymond Chen has a blog post entitled
You do n't know what you do until you know what you do n't do where he writes
I 've seen a lot of software projects , and one thing I 've learned is that you do n't have a product until you start saying " No " .
In the early phases of product design , you 're all giddy with excitement .
This new product will be so awesome .
It will slice bread .
It will solve world hunger .
It 's designed for everybody , from the technology - averse grandmother who wants to see picture of her grandkids to the IT manager who is in charge of 10,000 computers .
It 'll run equally well on a handheld device as in a data center .
When I see a product with an all - encompassing description like this , I say to myself , " They have no idea what their product is . "
You do n't know what you do until you know what you do n't do .
And the sooner you figure out what you do n't do the better , because a product that promises to do everything will never ship .
In my five years at Microsoft , I 've seen a bunch of projects fail .
Some were public flame outs that are still embarrassing to mention today while others are private mistakes that you 'll never hear anyone outside the b0rg cube mention .
A few months ago I wrote a blog post entitled Top 5 Signs Your Project is Doomed and since then I 've considered a few more entries that should be on the list bringing the total to 10 .
The list below are common signs that a software project is doomed .
Meeting one or two of these criteria is n't necessarily the kiss of death but three or more and you might as well start circulating your resume .

Exclusive - Juhi Parmar on her daughter ’s reaction after she decided to step out to shoot amid pandemic : Samairra said ‘ I wo n’t allow you to go ’
By Nick Bryant
BBC News , Sydney
Jhyimy lives on a four - foot rock platform at the end of the beach
Caveman of Bondi
" I call this place the house with no walls and no roof , " says Jhyimy of his shanty - like dwelling , which offers stunning , panoramic views of the golden arc of Bondi .
" This is the front patio and the feeding table , " he says , pointing to a rock platform covered , wing to flapping wing , with hungry seagulls .
" The birds come along and , for the sake of a little bit of bread , give me a canopy of wings .
What more could you want ? "
Currently , the question has special poignancy .
For what Jhyimy wants most of all is permission from the local council to stay in a space that he has occupied for near - on seven years and where he has assembled his ramshackle home .
Jhyimy recites poems to passing Bondi tourists
To his fans , Jhyimy is the Caveman of Bondi , a rugged individualist who personifies Australia 's pioneering spirit .
But to Waverley Council , his main detractor , Jhyimy is an unwelcome blot on the landscape , an unhygienic nuisance who needs to be evicted .
The council has received complaints over the years from a number of concerned residents , worried that Jhyimy 's home is an eyesore and a health risk .
Soon , he could be forced to leave his beloved home and to pack up his paintings , comfy armchair , pots and open - air library of books .
Beach blessing ...
The Caveman of Bondi looks much as you would expect Hollywood to cast him : as a crusty castaway of indeterminate age .
There was a mob of predators feeding off the tourist public .
And I 'm glad to say that 's a thing of the past .
I 've discouraged them
Jhyimy Mhiyles
There is the thicket of unruly facial hair , which makes up his beard ; there is the jagged set of teeth , which look much like a scale - model of the coastline he inhabits ; and there are the Two Hats : today an Australian baseball cap and a swimming cap ; he always wears two .
An old - style Aussie larrikin , he speaks with the verve , colour and lyricism of a 19th - Century prospector .
Poetry is both his gift to the people of Bondi and his means of survival .
He recites his poems to passing tourists on the Bondi to Bronte cliff walk , much as a busker would rattle off a tune .
" I came to Sydney for the Olympics , to have a watch and to get some work .
The only accommodation I could afford was a cliff edge that no - one else was using .
It was a place of miscreants and people up to no sort of good after dark . "
Far from bringing the neighbourhood down , Jhyimy claims he has improved it beyond all recognition .
He casts himself as part vigilante , part one - man neighbourhood watch .
" With every second visitor who visited Bondi beach , there was a mob that would steal things and take a truckload of goods and valuables away at the end of every day of the year .
" Our visitors were spending all that money to come over to Australia , they'd go for a swim and then they find that their bags were nicked .
There was a mob of predators feeding off the tourist public .
And I 'm glad to say that 's a thing of the past .
I 've discouraged them . "
Listening to Jhyimy , you get a sense that he should be in the pay of the council , perhaps even its " employee of the year " , rather than being the target of its eviction process .
" When I arrived , there was n't much lawful activity down here , and there were n't many families down here .
Now it has totally changed .
Now we have visitors and tourists coming from everywhere to see the birds getting fed .
We 've managed to discourage the undesirable elements . "
... or bad example ?
Unsurprisingly , Waverley Council does not quite see it that way .
It 's not something we want to encourage .
What 's to stop an influx of backpackers coming to Bondi ?
George Newhouse , mayor
" We 're getting a lot of complaints from residents about the hygiene issue and the size of the camp and the smells and the general clutter , " says Mayor George Newhouse .
" There 's a fire risk , he 's had an explosion of a gas cylinder . "
The council says it has " worked tirelessly " to offer Jhyimy other accommodation , but he has stubbornly refused .
And it is worried that if Jhyimy stays , then others like him might flock to Bondi .
" It 's not something we want to encourage , " says Mayor Newhouse .
" What 's to stop an influx of backpackers coming to Bondi ? "
In some ways , the struggle evokes the Australian comedy classic , The Castle , in a which a blue - collar family fights for its treasured home against a faceless bureaucracy determined to expand the neighbouring airport .
Jhyimy refutes the council 's claims .
" My hygiene is a 100 % .
I warm up some water on the fire and have a bath or have a bath in the sea " - though he does admit that the theft of his facecloth has recently created problems on the fragrancy front .
" Couple of times I had my bag nicked and my face cloth stolen .
In revenge , I 'd go and visit people where the cloth went missing and would n't bathe for a couple of days so they could cop a whiff of it .
But I 've been brought up to keep myself intolerably clean and intolerably well dressed . "
As for staying in council accommodation , he balks at the suggestion , and says suicide is a better option .
" If I was put in the situation where I had to be moved along , it would be so much easier to move to the side of the cliff and take one step to the left .
" I 'm using four foot ( 1.2 m ) at the edge of a cliff at the end of the land .
Now if I 'm using up too much space doing that , then clearly there 's a need for me to start breathing open air . "
Until the American invasion in March 2003 , Mr. Makiya , an Iraqi - American born in Baghdad in 1949 , was the leading intellectual voice crying out for Western and Arab nations to topple Mr. Hussein .
He was a close friend of the Pentagon darling Ahmad Chalabi , and had the attention of neoconservatives .
Vice President Dick Cheney praised him on “ Meet the Press , ” and Mr. Makiya was one of three Iraqi - Americans who met with President Bush in the winter of 2003 .
Those were simpler days indeed , before the endless waves of car bombings , before the thousands of Iraqi and American deaths , before the descent into chaos and sectarian violence that has driven liberal idealists like Mr. Makiya into bouts of hand - wringing over a single inescapable question : what went wrong ?
Which brings us to Mr. Makiya ’s next book .
“ I want to look into myself , look at myself , delve into the assumptions I had going into the war , ” he said .
“ Now it seems necessary to reflect on the society that has gotten itself into this mess .
A question that looms more and more for me is : just what did 30 years of dictatorship do to 25 million people ? ”
“ It ’s not like I did n’t think about this , ” he continued .
“ But nonetheless I allowed myself as an activist to put it aside in the hope that it could be worked through , or managed , or exorcised in a way that ’s not as violent as is the case now .
That did not work out . ”
HERE in this two - story Victorian house on a quiet lane south of Porter Square , the thing that “ did not work out ” seemed very far away .
Mr. Makiya was awaiting the arrival for dinner of a former student of his at Brandeis University , where Mr. Makiya is a professor of Islamic and Middle Eastern studies .
While musing about Iraq , he admitted his inability to foresee the manifold shortcomings in the American project .

After the current ice storms left thousands without power , state Representatives Randy Terrill and Bill Nations believe Oklahomans may be open to using renewable sources of energy that can assist in a crisis and help moderate demands on more traditional power sources .
House Bill 1387 , by Terrill and Nations , offers consumers tax credits for installing solar energy equipment and small wind turbines .
“ This gives homeowners , farmers and businesses a helping hand by providing an alternative to high gas bills , plus it cuts down on air pollution by promoting clean air energy , ” said Terrill , R - Moore .
“ This bill is an answer to Oklahomans who pay extremely high bills and ensures lower gas bills in the future â€ “ plus it provides some protection against winter storm power outages . ”
Currently , Norman is home to Bergey Windpower Co. , the worldâ€™s leading supplier of small wind turbines .
President Mike Bergey said Oklahomans can now make good use of that “ Oklahoma wind ” by installing a wind turbine and radically reducing their electric and gas bills .
Within a few years of installation , he said owners could enjoy mostly free electricity .
House Bill 1387 gives consumers a non-transferable tax credit equal to 40 % of the total cost of installation for solar and wind energy systems including construction and equipment costs .
The 40 % credit can be carried forward for up to 10 years after installation .
“ By supporting this bill , Oklahomans can support home - grown manufacturers of wind power equipment and expand local markets , creating new jobs and boosting the economy , ” said Nations , D - Norman .
“ As the governor tries to make Oklahoma a leader in biofuels , both solar and wind power should also have stronger emphasis in the state .
I am glad to work with Rep. Terrill in this bipartisan effort . ”
Terrill said the initial cost of installation and equipment for renewable energy keeps many Oklahomans from taking that step .
However , he said the cost savings on electric and gas bills , plus the tax credits available through the bill , would more than offset the upfront expenses .
“ This legislation is a win - win situation for the consumer , for the environment and for the economy , ” said Terrill .
The results found that the reading skills of 12th graders tested in 2005 were significantly worse than those of students in 1992 , the first time a comparable test was given , and essentially flat since students took the exam in 2002 .
The share of students lacking even basic high school reading skills — meaning they could not , for example , extract data about train fares at different times of day from a brochure — rose to 27 from 20 percent in 1992 .
The share of those proficient in reading dropped to 35 from 40 percent in 1992 .
At the same time , the gap between boys and girls grew , with girls ’ reading skills more than a year ahead of those of boys .
In math , 23 percent of all 12th graders were proficient , but the exam had been revamped , so the results could not be compared to earlier years .
The new test has fewer questions requiring arithmetic , but more using algebra and geometry .
Some 39 percent of 12th graders lacked even basic high school math , meaning they could not , for example , figure out the length of a hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem .
At the same time , high school graduates in 2005 had studied more than their counterparts in 1990 , averaging 360 more hours of classroom instruction during their high school years , the transcript study showed .
Their grade point average was a third of a letter grade higher than in 1990 , and more students were taking foreign language and other courses aimed at preparing them for college .
Today ’s study also compared the transcripts of a smaller group of 17,400 students with their scores on the national assessment , and showed that students taking more challenging classes , like calculus , tend to score higher on the exam than students who take less rigorous courses .
Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and conflict ; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property ; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths .
~ James Madison , fourth president of the United States and primary Framer of the U.S. Constitution
Politicians and major media constantly tell us that oppressed peoples crave  democracy ,  and that only a democratic world will be free and peaceful .
Now President Bush has launched a campaign to bring freedom and democracy  to the world .
But are freedom and democracy the same thing ?
And will democracy imposed by force guarantee peace ?
Democracy , collectivism , and individualism
Consider the meanings of three key political concepts :
Democracy : that form of government in which sovereign power resides in the people as a whole , and is exercised either directly by them or by officers elected by them .
Collectivism : a politico - economic system in which the means of production and the distribution of goods and services are controlled by the collective , that is , the society or state considered as a group  e.g. , Nazi Germany and Communist China .
Individualism : the social theory which advocates the free and independent action of the individual person , as opposed to collectivist methods of organization and state interference .
In fact , democracy is much closer to collectivism than it is to individualism .
Like collectivism , democracy places essential political power with the group , rather than with the individual person  thus making everyones freedom subject to the passions of the mob or those with the most power .
What is democracy ?
Throughout the world , democracy is as often a cover for tyranny as it is a protection for liberty .
Many countries call themselves democracies  and have regular elections , yet systematically oppress their own people .
For example , Stalinist North Korea calls itself  the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and communist China calls itself the  Peoples Republic of China . 
Like the old Soviet Union , they have regular elections , elected legislatures , and even some choice of candidates .
However , its all a fraud .
Voting is mandatory .
The only party allowed to run candidates is the Communist Party .
Legislatures rubber - stamp the decrees of party bosses .
And anyone who objects strongly or tries to set up another party ends up dead or in a slave labor camp .
Many countries in Africa , Asia , and Latin America also now have multi-party democracies  but little freedom .
Vote fraud is massive , opposition candidates are often beaten or murdered by government thugs , and a small elite controls all power .
Citizens have little freedom , but lots of poverty .
What of Western democracies ?
Things are better , but far from free of corruption , fraud , and manipulation of voters .
Even in the United States , more and more people report their votes are not being counted .
Electronic voting makes fraud easy ( and nearly undetectable ) .
Congressional districts are gerrymandered to guarantee that one party always wins .
Third parties , such as the Libertarians and Greens , face virtually insurmountable obstacles , including oppressive ballot - access and campaign - finance laws .
Only Republicans and Democrats are allowed in most televised political debates .
And third - party election results are often not even reported by the media .
Whatever its virtues , democracy is not freedom .
As the 19th - century French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville warned in his classic Democracy in America , a democracy can be just as tyrannical as a dictatorship once the voters decide to vote themselves money from the treasury .
Democracy is a method of deciding who shall rule .
It does not determine the morality of the resulting government .
At best , democracy means that government has popular support .
But popular support is no guarantee that government will protect your freedom .
In a democracy , if most voters support freedom of speech , press , religion , association , and enterprise , their elected government will probably respect such freedoms .
But if voters prefer that governments impose a welfare state and confiscatory taxes , ban unapproved drugs , impose censorship , imprison critics , seize the property of unpopular groups , torture prisoners , and draft the young , a democratic government will probably grant those wishes also .
Conceived in liberty , not in democracy
Americas Founders were well aware of the evils of pure democracy and wisely made the United States a limited constitutional republic in which individual rights were strongly protected .
The word democracy  does not appear either in the Declaration of Independence or in the U.S. Constitution .
Instead , Article IV , Section 4 of the Constitution guarantees to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government . 
The difference between a constitutional republic and a democracy is the difference between liberty and slavery .
As Ira Glasser , former director of the American Civil Liberties Union , explains ,
Even in a democracy the majority must be limited in order to guarantee individual rights and personal autonomy .
If whites have more votes than blacks , they cannot be allowed to deny blacks their constitutional rights .
If men have more political power than women , that cannot permit them to deny women certain individual rights .
Winning an election should not permit the victors to assemble their votes and enact laws or govern in a way that strips those who lose of their liberty .
Electoral versus substantive rights
To understand why democracy does not guarantee freedom , it is essential to distinguish between electoral and substantive rights .
Electoral rights define your ability to participate in the election of some government officials .
Electoral rights give you some say in who governs .
They do not guarantee that elected officials will respect your freedom .
Substantive rights are the ability to control your own life and property .
They are the core elements of freedom .
Your substantive rights include your : ( 1 ) right to life , liberty , and property ; ( 2 ) freedom of speech and press ; ( 3 ) right to trial by jury ; ( 4 ) freedom to travel ; ( 5 ) freedom of religion ; ( 6 ) freedom to educate your children as you see fit ; ( 7 ) right to own and run your own business ; ( 8 ) right to defend yourself , including the right to own guns ; and ( 9 ) right not to be spied on by government .
The Declaration of Independence expresses this vision well :
We hold these Truths to be self - evident ; that all Men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness … .
Democracy is no guarantee of peace
Just as democracy is no guarantee of freedom , neither is it a guarantee of peace .
It is true that the relatively free democratic states are less likely to fight each other .
But democratically elected regimes frequently attack weak nondemocracies .
As Ivan Eland explains in The Empire Has No Clothes ,  The three greatest imperial powers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  France , Great Britain , and the United States  were democracies . 
Indeed , in the 20th century , the United States attacked more countries than any other nation .
Since the end of World War II , the United States has engaged in more than 200 armed conflicts , killing hundreds of thousands of civilians  waging wars or military actions in Korea , Vietnam , Panama , Grenada , Colombia , Haiti , Iraq , Afghanistan , Serbia , and Bosnia .
In nearly all of these conflicts , there was no threat to the United States .
It is clear from the history of Britain , France , Germany , and the United States , that democracy is no guarantee of peace .
Is democracy necessary for freedom ?
While democracy doesnt guarantee either freedom or peace , there are many historical examples of societies that didnt have either elections or legislatures , but in which peoples rights were strongly protected .
Examples include the American colonies before the Revolutionary War … the American West in the 19th century , where violence was one - tenth of what it is in large U.S. cities today … many cantons in Switzerland today , which have little government … and the nations of Andorra and Monaco .
In fact , for centuries much of the world had law and order without legislatures or elected rulers .
Instead they had what might be called free - market justice provided by traveling judges adjudicating disputes , with decisions enforced by local communities and sheriffs .
This nonelectoral legal system ( explained in the book , The Enterprise of Law , by Bruce L. Benson ) created what is today known as  the common law  thousands of collected decisions that provide the basis for law in America , Europe , and much of the free world .
The path to freedom and peace
Throughout the world , thugs and despots  some democratically elected , and some not  solemnly give lip - service to democracy  and freedom ,  while doing everything in their power to destroy them .
To have a free and peaceful world , we must create societies in which the inalienable rights of the individual person are again respected , and the powers of government are strictly limited .
That means ending confiscation of property without trial , secret arrests , imprisonment without conviction , and torture of prisoners .
It means abolishing sovereign - immunity laws , which exempt government agents from legal responsibility when they kidnap , steal , torture , or murder .
It means creating truly independent citizens  grand juries with the power to investigate and indict corrupt government officials and police .
And it means ceasing government spying on its own citizens and ending foreign invasions to impose democracy  by force .
No , democracy is not the same as liberty .
All too often , building democracy  has been used as a justification for destroying freedom .
To achieve a free and peaceful world , we must restore freedom and individual liberty , not democracy .

VIEWPOINT
Jeffrey A McNeely
Biofuels could end up damaging the natural world rather than saving it from global warming , argues Jeff McNeely in the Green Room .
Better policies , better science and genetic modification , he says , can all contribute to a greener biofuels revolution .
Europe intends to adapt Brazil 's experience with bioethanol
With soaring oil prices , and debates raging on how to reduce carbon emissions to slow climate change , many are looking to biofuels as a renewable and clean source of energy .
The European Union recently has issued a directive calling for biofuels to meet 5.75 % of transportation fuel needs by 2010 .
Germany and France have announced they intend to meet the target well before the deadline ; California intends going still further .
This is a classic " good news - bad news " story .
Of course we all want greater energy security , and helping achieve the goals ( however weak ) of the Kyoto Protocol is surely a good thing .
Little wonder that many are calling biofuels " deforestation diesel "
Send us your comments
However , biofuels - made by producing ethanol , an alcohol fuel made from maize , sugar cane , or other plant matter - may be a penny wise but pound foolish way of doing so .
Consider the following :
The grain required to fill the petrol tank of a Range Rover with ethanol is sufficient to feed one person per year .
Assuming the petrol tank is refilled every two weeks , the amount of grain required would feed a hungry African village for a year
Much of the fuel that Europeans use will be imported from Brazil , where the Amazon is being burned to plant more sugar and soybeans , and Southeast Asia , where oil palm plantations are destroying the rainforest habitat of orangutans and many other species .
Species are dying for our driving
The expansion of biofuels would increase monoculture farming
If ethanol is imported from the US , it will likely come from maize , which uses fossil fuels at every stage in the production process , from cultivation using fertilisers and tractors to processing and transportation .
Growing maize appears to use 30 % more energy than the finished fuel produces , and leaves eroded soils and polluted waters behind
If ethanol is imported from the US , it will likely come from maize , which uses fossil fuels at every stage in the production process , from cultivation using fertilisers and tractors to processing and transportation .
Growing maize appears to use 30 % more energy than the finished fuel produces , and leaves eroded soils and polluted waters behind Meeting the 5.75 % target would require , according to one authoritative study , a quarter of the EU 's arable land
Using ethanol rather than petrol reduces total emissions of carbon dioxide by only about 13 % because of the pollution caused by the production process , and because ethanol gets only about 70 % of the mileage of petrol
Food prices are already increasing .
With just 10 % of the world 's sugar harvest being converted to ethanol , the price of sugar has doubled ; the price of palm oil has increased 15 % over the past year , with a further 25 % gain expected next year .
Little wonder that many are calling biofuels " deforestation diesel " , the opposite of the environmentally friendly fuel that all are seeking .
With so much farmland already taking the form of monoculture , with all that implies for wildlife , do we really want to create more diversity - stripped desert ?
Others are worried about the impacts of biofuels on food prices , which will affect especially the poor who already spend a large proportion of their income on food .
Biotech boost
So what is to be done ?
The first step is to increase our understanding of how nature works to produce energy .
Amazingly , scientists do not yet have a full understanding of the workings of photosynthesis , the process by which plants use solar energy to absorb carbon dioxide and build carbohydrates .
Some environmentalists are worried that altered trees will cross - breed with wild trees , resulting in a drooping forest rather than one that stands tall
Biotechnology , its reputation sullied by public protests over GM foods , may make important contributions .
According to the science journal Nature , recombinant technology is already available that could enhance ethanol yield , reduce environmental damage from feedstock , and improve bioprocessing efficiency at the refinery .
The Swiss biotech firm Syngenta is developing a genetically engineered maize that can help convert itself into ethanol by growing a particular enzyme .
Others are designing trees that have less lignin , the strength - giving substance that enables them to stand upright , but makes it more difficult to convert the tree 's cellulose into ethanol .
Some environmentalists are worried that these altered trees will cross - breed with wild trees , resulting in a drooping forest rather than one that stands tall and produces useful timber and wildlife habitat .
In the longer run , biotech promises to help convert wood chips , farm wastes , and willow trees into bioethanol more cheaply and cleanly , thereby helping meet energy needs while also improving its public image .
Public stake
But that is not nearly enough ; bioenergy is too important to be left in the hands of the private sector .
Many of the social and environmental benefits of bioenergy are not priced in the market , so the public sector needs to step in to ensure these benefits are delivered .
An easy immediate step would be to mandate improved fuel efficiency for all forms of transport , beginning with the private automobile .
A 20 % increase in fuel - efficiency standards is feasible using current technology , and would save far more energy than Europe 's biomass could produce .
Biofuels : the next generation Governments also need to provide leadership in the form of economic incentives to minimise competition between food and fuel crops , and ensure that water , high - quality agricultural land , and biodiversity are not sacrificed on the altar of our convenience .
Calculations of energy return on investment need to include environmental impacts on soil , water , climate change , and ecosystem services .
The bottom line is that biofuels can contribute to energy and environmental goals only as part of an overall strategy that includes energy conservation , a diversity of sustainable energy sources , greater efficiency in production and transport , and careful management of ethanol production .

Matthias Horx , Trend - und Zukunftsforscher ( www.zukunftsinstitut.de; Foto : Südwestfunk )
Über Sinn , Nutzen und Gefahren von Computer - und Konsolenspielen gehen die Meinungen weit auseinander .
In einem dpa-Gespräch in Frankfurt hat Matthias Horx , der als einer der einflussreichsten Lieferanten wissenschaftlich untermauerter Zukunftsvisionen im deutschsprachigen Raum gilt , eine Lanze für das digitale Spielen gebrochen .
Der Gründer des Zukunftsinstituts in Kelkheim am Taunus , studierter Soziologe , früher Comic - Zeichner und Science - Fiction - Schreiber , " Die Zeit " - und Merian - Autor , liebt klare , provokante Worte .
Moderne Computerspiele schulen nach seiner Ansicht " die kognitiven Fähigkeiten , die wir in der Arbeits - und Wissenswelt des 21 .
Jahrhundert brauchen " .
Er setzt die Vielfalt dessen , was vom Spieler vor dem Monitor verlangt wird , ins Verhältnis zu dem , was bei klassischen Brett - und Kartenspielen gefragt ist , und meint : " Computerspiele sind in einer unglaublichen Art und Weise differenziert geworden , in einer Komplexität – dagegen ist jedes Schachspiel langweilig und dumm . "
Viele , so Horx , glaubten zu Unrecht , das Lesen sei dem digitalen Spielen überlegen .
" Da wird Kulturdünkel aufrecht erhalten .
Man möchte immer die alten Kulturtechniken behalten , und deshalb definiert man alle neuen erst mal negativ . "
Als Durchbruch bezeichnet Horx Blizzards Vielpersonen - Online - Rollenspiel World of Warcraft , das weltweit inzwischen von rund sieben Millionen Menschen , darunter etwa einer halben Million in Deutschland , gespielt wird .
Dabei ließen sich " Kooperation , Kampf um Konkurrenz , strategisches und taktisches Denken " lernen .
" Es ist das ideale Trainingsinstrument für die Fähigkeiten , die wir in Zukunft besonders brauchen : Kombinationsgabe , strategisches Denken und emotionale Intelligenz . "
Entscheidend seien die drei Ebenen des Spiels , das ganze Generationen fasziniere : " Psychologie , Anthropologie und Ökonomie .
In der Psychologie ist es das am höchsten entwickelte Rollenspiel aller Zeiten . "
" Diese drei symbolischen Tiefen machen es zu einem Anfang in eine Emigration in den virtuellen Raum " , sagt Horx und nimmt damit ein wichtiges Argument der Kritiker exzessiver Computerspielnutzung auf – die Gefahr der Flucht des Spielers aus seiner sozialen Wirklichkeit in eine Scheinwelt .
" Und es ist in der Tat die Frage , wie man damit umgeht .
Das dramatische Problem bei World of Warcraft ist das Zeitproblem .
Weil WOW einen regelrecht aus der Wirklichkeit entführt , ist es die größte Herausforderung , dem Grenzen zu setzen . "
So , wie viele Kritiker heutzutage Computerspiele für gefährlich hielten , habe das Lesen von Romanen im 16 .
bis 18 .
Jahrhundert als dekadent gegolten .
Auch als Kinofilme aufgekommen seien , habe man behauptet , die Menschen " verschwänden in Scheinwelten und könnten danach mit der Wirklichkeit nicht umgehen . "
Wenn Horx Spieleskeptiker kritisiert , kriegt vom Journalisten bis zur Kirche jeder sein Fett ab .
" Die Bedenkenträger sind vor allem die Medien .
Und dann gibt es immer eine Menge von Leuten , die ihre alten Privilegien gegen die Newcomer verteidigen wollen .
Das ist eine unselige Tradition . "
Und weiter : " Die Kirche hat ebenfalls versucht , Kulturtechniken zu dominieren – die Leute sollten Latein lesen und die Bibel studieren , alles andere galt als abwegig .
Dabei entwickeln sich neue Medien immer durch eine Art Verdauungsprozess .
Es kommt eine neue Technologie auf , man experimentiert damit , und dann lernen Menschen langsam , sinnvoll damit umzugehen . "
Über das eigentliche Spielen hinaus genießt bei Horx auch ein anderer vielfach skeptisch betrachteter Zeitvertreib hohe Wertschätzung : das Chatten .
Es ist nach Ansicht des Trendforschers eine " Erweiterung unseres kommunikativen Kosmos " .
" Die Idee , dass nur unmittelbare Gesicht - zu - Gesicht - Kommunikation das einzig Wahre sei , ist natürlich Unsinn .
Das können
Sie auch an vielen anderen Beispielen sehen wie dem Misserfolg des Videotelefons , das uns das Gegenüber viel zu nahe heranrückt . "
Die moderne Technik mache es gerade möglich , mit sehr viel mehr Leuten erst einmal lose Kontakte zu pflegen .
Das Konzept sei im übrigen gar nicht so neu – man denke etwa an frühere Brieffreundschaften .
" Es ist ein tiefes menschliches Bedürfnis , in Netzwerken und zunächst einmal auf Distanz zu kommunizieren – und erst dann auszuwählen , mit wem man sich näher und intimer beschäftigen möchte . "

" The insurgents had been observed gathering in Pakistan and had crossed the border prior to launching an attack , " Nato said in a statement .
It said Pakistan had helped monitor the fighters , who were then hit with artillery and air strikes .
The Afghan defence ministry earlier estimated 80 fatalities .
There was no independent confirmation of numbers .
A Taleban spokesman said those killed were civilians , not militants .
However , correspondents say there is very little civilian activity in the area of the attack .
Conflicting reports
The spokesman , Dr Muhammad Hanif , told Associated Press news agency that the figure of 150 Taleban fighters killed was " a complete lie " .
The battle took place in the Margha hills in Afghanistan 's Paktika province , close to the Pakistani border .
The BBC news website has learned that at least four bodies of local Wazir tribesmen have been taken to the Miranshah area of North Waziristan on the Pakistani side .
The Nato statement said two groups of Taleban were monitored and tracked as they crossed the border , and then attacked .
" Initial battle damage estimates indicate as many as 150 insurgents were killed , " it said .
While the defence ministry put the death toll at 80 , an Afghan commander , General Murad Ali , said only about 10 bodies were recovered .
He personally estimated the death toll at about 50 .
It is not clear why the figures differed so much and Nato did not say how it had arrived at the figure .
Gen
Ali only referred to one group of fighters crossing the border .
Meanwhile , Pakistan says its troops attacked pro-Taleban militants in North Waziristan .
It is not clear if there were casualties or if the operation was linked to the battle on the Afghan side .
It is the first raid by Pakistan 's military since a peace deal with militants in the area in September .
' Pakistani help '
Major Dominic
White , a spokesman for the Nato force in Kabul , told the BBC as far as he was aware there were no civilian casualties in the Paktika battle .
The death of civilians has been a major issue in Afghanistan , with Nato saying last week that its biggest mistake of the past year has been killing innocent people .
The alliance has been accused - including by President Hamid Karzai - of carelessness over civilian lives when attacking Taleban fighters .
Last month Nato said 80 militants had been killed in an operation in southern Helmand province , but the death toll was later reduced to eight .
If Nato 's account of the latest battle proves to be correct it will be a notable success for the alliance as they prepare to counter an anticipated spring offensive by the Taleban , says the BBC's Dan Isaacs in Kabul .
It is also significant , he says , that Nato officials said they had the close co-operation of the Pakistani authorities in monitoring the insurgents before they entered Afghanistan .
Pakistan 's Interior Minister , Aftab Sherpao , told the BBC it was a " classic case " of co-operation between Nato and Pakistani troops .
He did not say what operational role the Pakistani troops played .
The commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan , Gen David Richards , told journalists in Islamabad that increased Pakistani operations on the border had led to a reduction in Taleban activity towards the end of 2006 .
Afghan leaders have repeatedly called for Pakistan to offer more help in fighting the Taleban .
Paktika province borders the Pakistani tribal areas of North and South Waziristan , where Pakistan has signed non-aggression pacts with militants .
Afghanistan says this has allowed the Taleban to flourish and given them a base from which to launch an increasing number of attacks on its territory .
The original cartoons are on display in Tehran
The newspaper - Information - published six of the cartoons , which are on display in the Iranian capital , Tehran .
Several of the cartoons contrast the plight of the Palestinians with that of the victims of the Holocaust .
Editor - in - chief Palle Weis said he had thought carefully about publishing the cartoons and said it was not a stunt .
He told the BBC the cartoons accompanied a news story about the exhibition .
He said they were " tasteless but predictable " .
' Pretty harmless '
Another Danish newspaper , Jyllands - Posten , sparked the international row last year after it published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad , including one of him wearing a bomb on his head .
There were angry protests in Europe , the Middle East , and other parts of the world , in which at least 50 people died .
In response , a competition was organised in Iran inviting people to draw cartoons about the Holocaust .
Organisers said they were testing the West 's commitment to freedom of speech .
Information said it had decided to print the cartoons after consulting the main rabbi in Copenhagen .
" He said he had seen worse examples , " editor - in - chief Mr Weis told the BBC .
" They are tasteless but predictable ... they 're pretty harmless .
I do n't think they would be called great art . "
Skulls
One of the cartoons , by a Moroccan cartoonist , shows a scene bisected by the barrier being constructed in the West Bank by Israel .
On one side , a gravestone reading " Holocaust " and bearing a Star of David stands in the sunshine .
Underneath the ground is buried a single skull .
On the other side , it is night - time .
A gravestone here says " Sabra and Shatila " - a reference to infamous massacres carried out in Lebanon in 1982 by Lebanese Christian militiamen allied to Israel - underneath a Palestinian flag .
Underneath the ground are buried scores of skulls .
Mr Weis said he was not nervous about his readers ' reactions to the decision to print a selection of the cartoons .
He said an interview with the rabbi was published alongside the cartoons , and an editorial inside explained the decision .
" Our readers would be disappointed if we did n't print the cartoons , " Mr Weis said .
Stanislav Evgrafovich Petrov is arguably the most influential person who ever lived , although I had never heard of him until seeing this post on Cynical - C and this tribute .
Our story unfolds on September 26 , 1983 .
Lieutenant Colonel Petrov was the officer on duty at the Serpukhov - 15 bunker near Moscow with the responsibility of alerting Soviet command if there was any indication that the U.S. had launched a nuclear missile strike against the U.S.S.R .
The response , of course , would be massive retaliation , and the deaths of many millions of people .
Just after midnight , the computers indicated that an American missile had been launched .
Petrov was skeptical , since it would n't make much sense to just launch a single missile .
However , soon thereafter , the computer indicated that another four missiles had been launched .
To make a long story short ( see Wikipedia for more ) , Petrov decided that the multiple launches were still a computer error rather than a real attack , and declined to alert his superiors , putting the Soviet Union at risk if he were mistaken .
As it turned out , Petrov was right , and he had certainly averted an accidental worldwide catastrophe .
But he had disobeyed procedure in the process ; his superiors gave him a reprimand and reassigned him to a lower - profile post .
The entire incident was kept secret until 1998 .
Forget Easter , here 's a guy who deserves our thanks .
The question is : what would you have done ?
Presume that you were in an equivalent situtation , responsible for the defense of your country , a mission in which you believed with all your heart .
But you have no desire to have millions of people die unnecessarily .
How certain would you have to be that an attack was actually occuring before you would set massive retaliation in motion ?
Fifty - fifty ?
100 - 1 ? A million to one ?
Or would you never retaliate , knowing that your decision would lead to hundreds of nuclear warheads raining down on your homeland , and your mortal enemy presumably taking over the world ?
The companies , however , argue that testing just 20 cards does not provide an accurate picture of the card market , which generally uses higher security standards than the cards that were tested .
“ It ’s a small sample , ” said Art Kranzley , an executive with MasterCard .
“ This is almost akin to somebody standing up in the theater and yelling , ‘ Fire ! ’ because somebody lit a cigarette . ”
Chips like those used by the credit card companies can encrypt the data they send , but that can slow down transactions and make building and maintaining the payment networks more expensive .
Other systems , including the Speedpass keychain device offered by Exxon Mobil , encrypt the transmission — though Exxon came under fire for using encryption that experts said was weak .
Though information on the cards may be transmitted in plain text , the company representatives argued , the process of making purchases with the cards involves verification procedures based on powerful encryption that make each transaction unique .
Most cards , they said , actually transmit a dummy number that does not match the number embossed on the card , and that number can be used only in connection with the verification “ token , ” or a small bit of code , that is encrypted before being sent .
“ It ’s basically useless information , ” said David Bonalle , vice president and general manager for advanced payments at American Express .
“ You ca n’t steal that data and just play it back and expect that transaction to work . ”
While the researchers found that these claims were true for some of the cards they tested , other cards gave up the actual credit card number and did not use a token or change data from one transaction to another .
They also took data in from some cards and transmitted it to a card - reader in the lab and tricked it into accepting the transaction .
Mr. Heydt - Benjamin , in fact , was able to purchase electronic equipment online using a number skimmed from a card he ordered for himself and which was sealed in an envelope .
( None of the cards transmits the additional number on the front or back , known as the card validation code , that some businesses require for online purchases ; Mr. Heydt - Benjamin chose a store that does not require the code . )
Mr. Kranzley said the MasterCard - issuing banks decided how much security they wanted to implement , but said that with 10 million of the company ’s chip - bearing cards on the market , some 98 percent of them used the highest standards .
There 's a great discussion going on over at Jeff Atwood 's blog about Coding Smaller , modularizing properly , and refactoring often .
In the comments , Jae wishes that more apps were " modularized properly , " and I wholly agree .
He / she says :
I think a lot of projects are dived into too willy - nilly ( especially by neophyte / novice / hobbyist programmers ) with no pre-planning of what the thing should do and how to logically code it . [ Jae ]
I 'll use this comment , lifted from Jeff 's post , to kick of discussion here .
I think that pre-planning is part of it , but there 's only so much Big Design Up Front ( BDUF ) you can do .
More and more , as I work on larger and larger projects ( and product suites ) I realize that refactoring effectively and often is as or more valuable as pre-planning .
There 's lots of create Refactoring Tools out there , certainly Resharper and Refactor Pro leap to mind , that can help you improve your code , and to some extent , your design , with their dozens of refactorings .
Both also include some code analysis tools that illustrate hotspots in your files .
< confession >
At my company , sometimes I feel less like Chief Architect , and more like Chief Debugger or Chief Code Reader .
Sometimes I get to caught up in trying to read code in order to understand the big picture .
This is my own failing , as I often try to use a microscope when I need a telescope .
</confession >
While trying to improve design , manage dependencies and coupling within our product suite , I 've been leaning more and more on static analysis tools .
Some tools are pretty UI - free , like libcheck , a tool for managing the churn of the public " surface area " of a group ( or framework ) of assemblies .
There 's lots of tools out there for analysis of code , for many languages , all with good science behind them .
I remember doing some static analysis on C++ code back in the day , but until .
NET 's rich meta data , doing this kind of analysis was more a parsing exercise that created Excel spreadsheets of numbers - the data just was n't very accessible .
That , combined with the fact that a lot of .NET developers now never worked in a language before .
NET that enabled real solid analysis ( VBScript / ASP , VB , and I do n't remember a lot of MFC / C++ folks doing analysis like this ) means that perhaps a majority of .NET developers have n't been introduced to the power of tools like this .
I 've been spending time with NDepend more and more lately .
I used it a while back when it first came out , but version 2 is out and it 's giving me insight into my applications that I have n't had before .
One of the problems with applications like NDepend and static analysis apps is that they are couched in the complex or " inaccessible " language of Computer Science .
Many programmers have n't gone through a formal " CompSci " program and are n't interested in an analysis application with a steep learning curve .
Like PowerShell , the first 10 minutes of NDepend is the hardest .
It has to click first .
There 's the whole " what the hell am I looking at " process , often followed by the " screw this " declaration , followed by a quick uninstallation and a sense of " what happened . "
I 'm not going to even attempt to try to improve on , or replace , the good documentation that 's already up on the NDepend site .
One of the things that NDepend 's site has lots of is screencasts , do check them out .
What I 'd like to do is try to introduce some of the basics of the kinds of analyses that are possible to the average programmer or the architect who has n't considered this kind of analysis as an important part of the development process .
Additionally , I know that many of you are using FxCop as a code analysis tool .
I think that NDepend intersects FxCop in some ways , but presents the data in a totally different way , and allows you to drill in so much more deeply .
I can't use Corillian 's software for my example here , so I 'll use DasBlog , an ASP.
NET blogging engine with which I have some association , instead .
As seen in the picture below , you startup the NDepend Project application and either point it at your Visual Studio Solution , or just add your assemblies automatically .
Then you save the NDepend Project as an XML file , and hit the " Play " button ( the green arrow pointing to the right ) and NDepend launches it 's console app that chews for a while .
Next , you can either view an HTML Report - you can run the reports as often as you like and NDepend will keep a history of the reports .
Using a static analysis tool can be confusing because it tells you SO much information all at once ... trying to sip from the fire hose can be a challenge .
Let 's start by looking at the dependency diagram that was generated by the report .
These are easy to read when there is a small number of assemblies .
Those of you who use Reflector Add - Ins will recognize the library style as Peli's - in fact NDepend uses the same graphics library .
This graph is really the simplest thing that NDepend can tell you - it just scratches the surface of what this tool can do .
We can learn a few important things that we may or may not have known ( I did n't really grok at least ) about our application .
Let 's explore , for this example , the Custom Macro facilities in DasBlog and if there are design problems .
Note the " FooMacroPlugin " - it 's the sample plugin that shows how to write DasBlog Custom Macros .
Note that it depends on two assemblies .
This exposes very clearly a lameness in the DasBlog custom Macro model - largely my fault - in that it requires a reference to two different assemblies , but Web .
Core needs Runtime anyway .
We can also see later that it uses concrete classes rather than Interfaces , so it 's , frankly , a plugin model with problems .
If DasBlog had a formal Interface assembly with defined interfaces for interacting with the system we would see different linkage .
Now that we know that a custom macro links to to different assemblies , let 's take a look at exactly how linked the Macro dll is to the rest of the system .
We open up Visual NDepend and are barraged with a LOT of information .
This is a crazy busy interface , but in that is a great deal of power .
The interface is by and large modeless , and clicking in one area changes values in all the others .
In this screenshot I 've clicked on the intersection in the Dependency Matrix of the FooMacroPlugin and the Web .
Core assembly .
Note in the lower left corner there 's Plain English generated telling me " 1 method of the assembly FooMacroPlugin " is using 1 member of Web. Core . "
Looking along the horizontal I can see the number 1 , then 2 , indicating that Foomacro is using 1 method of the Core and 2 within the RunTime .
( The axis can be opened up by clicking the + sign to see more text )
Now I 'm getting a better idea of how linked my Macros are with my other two Assemblies .
I can left - click on the number 2 to see what two methods I 'm using in the Runtime .
A " boxes and arrows " diagram is generated telling me that my Macros ( there are two in FooMacroPlugin ) are calling into a property on the an Entry ( a blog Entry ) and getting the count of an EntryCollection .
Now I 'm starting to see what the impact would be if I were to refactor the Macro plugin mechanism in DasBlog , and I would repeat this analysis on a more complex Custom Macro , probably from the community .
Even better , I could drop in EVERY custom Macro I could find to get a really 20,000 foot view - a wide perspective - on how Macros are being used ... without reading the code .
NDepend really shines in it 's use of CQL - Code Query Language - an NDepend invention , but public spec .
Basically it 's SQL for Reflection .
I can write queries using this SQL - like syntax to ask questions about assemblies , types , methods , whatever within my solution .
Here 's some examples :
Detect Unused Methods :
WARN IF Count > 0 IN SELECT TOP 10 METHODS WHERE MethodCa == 0 AND !
IsPublic AND !IsEntryPoint AND !IsExplicitInterfaceImpl AND !IsClassConstructor AND !Is Finalizer
I ran this CQL query without the " TOP 10 " qualifier on some code on one project and found 292 methods that were n't being used .
Detect Overly Complicated Methods
WARN IF Count > 0 IN SELECT TOP 10 METHODS WHERE
( NbILInstructions > 200 OR
ILCyclomaticComplexity > 50 OR
NbParameters > 5 OR
NbVariables > 8 )
AND
//
Here is a way to avoid to take account of generated methods .
// Another way would be to use the SELECT METHODS FROM or SELECT METHODS OUT OF facilities .
!( NameLike " InitializeComponent " OR NameLike " Generated " )
Here 's a great one .
This gives methods that have over 200 instructions or a complexity of over 50 ( REALLY complex ) , or have too many variables or parameters , but includes a trick to exclude both generated code and that crap that the WinForms designer creates in InitializeComponent .
These are just some of the dozens of rules and examples that it includes .
I personally find writing this kind of CQL to be WAY more intuitive and flexible than writing FxCop rules / plugins .
If you select any CQL query , it runs instantly as you select it and the Tree Map at the top updates automatically , lighting up the result of the query .
The toolbox in the upper left corner shows the result of the query in a table .
You can then click on any of the methods and NDepend will open Visual Studio and take you there .
The TreeMap in the diagram below acts like a " heat map " showing the hot spots discovered .
The blue area on the left side of the map shows the methods that came back as a result of my query .
Above the TreeMap is a combo box that indicates what metric the TreeMap is using to determine the size of the squares .
In this screen shot I 'm using # of IL instructions so the larger the square , the more instructions .
I could use lines of code , or cyclomatic complexity , or whatever to find the " fat " parts of my application .
CQL queries can these can include " WARN " at the beginning so they can be used within a Continuous Integration build .
NDepend includes a NAnt Task and an MSBUILD Task , as well as stylesheets and plugins for Cruise Control .
NET so I can add constraints to keep our applications in line as changes are checked in .
The rules ( the CQL ) is really easy to read and the editor includes intellisense .
Another nice diagram that is produced by NDepend is the chart of Abstractness vs. Instability .
It says a lot , and it 's easy to take the data as a value judgement directed towards your code .
As if your assembly appears in Red , you 're a Bad Person .
The Y - axis indicates how Abstract your assembly is - that is , is it able to be extended without recompile .
The X - axis is instability .
Now , " instability " carries a value judgement in itself .
They are n't saying that stable is good and instable is n't .
Stable means that the public surface area of your assemblies " can't " change because there are a lot of assemblies that are dependent on it .
An instable assembly has fewer , or no , dependant assemblies upstream .
Take a look at Page 8 of this document on Principles of Package Design .
A number between 0 and 1 is assigned for each axis based on those equations and your assembly is plotted accordingly .
Here 's the trick in reading the chart :
If an assembly is very stable ( that is , lots of folks depend on it ) and it's not extensible ( no abstract classes , no virtuals , etc ) then you 're in the lower - left quadrant of the chart in the well - named Zone of Pain .
If an assembly is very abstract , very extensible , but no one depends on it ( it 's not really being used ) then it moves towards the Zone of Uselessness .
Notice how many of the assemblies are in the Zone of Pain ?
So many , in fact , that you can't even read the words Zone of Pain any more .
If you read the assembly names , you 'll see that the ones that have made their way over into that portion of the chart are most of the 3rd party assemblies we use .
This makes sense because these assemblies are Stable - lots of folks depend on them - and they were designed for some specific function , not for extensibility .
Over there are things like the SharpZip lib , the FreeTextBox , and SubText 's Akismet library .
Is it bad that there are libraries over there ?
It 's less something to panic about then it is something to have increased awareness about .
Charts like this can give you a lot of insight into how hard it would be to replace a 3rd party component if you needed , or just to extend one .
Here 's a screencast on doing an impact analysis on replacing a 3rd party component within NDepend itself .
We can also note that both the DasBlog Runtime and Web .
Core assemblies are edging their way over into the Zone of Pain .
That implies that more and more we are depending on those assemblies in unhealthy ways because they are n't well - factored for use by both the application itself and the Plugins .
All this equals opportunity to possibly modify our design .
I will point out , just as a bit of interest , that when Patrick and I ran this same chart on Corillian 's Voyager SDK - an SDK that has had more eyes on it , perhaps , than DasBlog - we had only one assembly in the " Zone of Pain " and none in the Zone of Uselessness .
We felt OK about that .
Wrap up
I 'm really just touching on the beginnings over what a good static analysis tool can do .
But you have to integrate a tool like this not only into your life , but into your build process and your company 's software development process .
You can't just drop the tool into your word and expect instant results .
If you have a fairly mature process - agile or not - and developers who are enthusiastic to this kind of very hard - numbers input , you can begin by integrating this data into your existing code reviews .
Start up a working group or study group to talk about what the information means - you do n't even need to take action , just talk amongst peers .
After your team starts to get a sense of where the metrics are not only taking them , but when to ignore the metrics and why , then you can start adding custom queries and warnings and integrating them into your continuous build .
NOTE : One last thing , to be clear .
I do n't know the guy from NDepend personally .
I did chat him on Skype to answer some of my more esoteric questions .
I 'm not paid for being a reviewer of this product , in this case I 'm just a massive FanBoy , much like I am about CodeRush .
Neither of them has ever given me a penny .
I 'm writing this because I want folks to think about their designs , not just up front , but all through the design ... before , during , after .
Think about complexity , think about supportability .
Realize that your code , your app , your suite is very likely more complex than can be held in your head , and if you take the time - both in your day , and scheduled into your project - to review your design , truly understand what 's going on , and use your analysis to make substantive changes to improve the quality of your company 's code .
Tools like NDepend or one of the many code analysis tools out there like Lattix , can really give you a great deal of insight and perspective on how your applications fit together , if you just take a few hours to get over the initial " hump of difficulty . "
Once I realized the depth and breadth of the information I was looking at it , I was like a kid in a candy shop .
It was the first time I discovered JetBrains dotTrace profiler - " and now I can see . "
Go check out NDepend .
There is a FREE / ACADEMIC version that you can try out and use on your Open Source apps , and the full Pro Version is about US $ 400 with steep discounts if you buy in quantity .
Most companies would only need 1 or 2 copies for a lead " code analyst " I think , so it 's reasonably priced .
Run it on your companies application and show your boss a few graphs - and explain what he 's looking at - and I 'm sure he or she will give you the money . ;)
I recommend trying to stay out of the Zone of Pain .
