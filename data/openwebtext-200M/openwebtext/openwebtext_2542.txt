What the $ 2 trillion stimulus package means for you and the economy
( CNN ) --
A woman who has been in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years was transferred to a private clinic Tuesday where she is expected to die -- ending what has been a lengthy and controversial legal fight .
A portrait of Eluana Englaro .
She has been in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years .
Eluana Englaro suffered irreversible brain damage in a car crash in 1992 , when she was 20 years old .
For years , her father has fought to have her feeding tube removed , saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter 's life .
Beppino Englaro says that before the crash , his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she did n't want the same thing to happen to her should she ever be in the same state .
Euthanasia is illegal in Italy , but patients have the right to refuse treatment .
It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die , because she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment , he said .
" We knew Eluana well , and we always thought of her as a champion of freedom , " her father said in October .
" She had clear ideas about her life and for her , life was about freedom -- not an obligation to live . "
A series of legal battles finally ended in November , when Italy 's highest court , the Court of Cassation , upheld a lower court ruling allowing Englaro to suspend his daughter 's treatment .

But although Englaro had cleared the last legal hurdle , the court 's decision sparked a new fight to find a hospital or clinic that would take out Eluana 's feeding tube .
Several clinics initially came forward to say they could do it , but the Italian health minister then issued a decree to remind them of their duty of care .
Under pressure to adhere to his decree , the clinics backed off .
Finally , a private clinic in the northeastern Italian city of Udine agreed to assist in Eluana 's case .
Monday night , Eluana was transferred from the church - run hospital in Lecco , north of Milan , where she had been kept alive to the Udine clinic .
A handful of protesters tried to block the ambulance carrying Eluana from leaving the clinic , one of them holding a banner reading , " Only thieves and assassins act at night . "
The case has been a controversial one in Italy , a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence .
Last Sunday , Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims that " euthanasia is a false solution to suffering . "
Tuesday morning , a top Vatican official was quoted in the Italian media saying , " Stop the killer hands . "
The Udine clinic says the removal of Eluana 's tube will begin in about three days , and the process of allowing her to die will take about 20 days .
Clinic officials gave police an outline of the specific steps they are going to take with Eluana during that time .
The outline adheres to the Cassation Court 's ruling , which required certain steps and conditions once Eluana 's feeding tube is removed .
Among the steps and conditions was a rule that no video or photography may be taken and that only certain people may enter the patient 's room .

Milo of Croton and the sometimes failure of inductive proofs
Ranjit Bhatnagar once told me the following story : A young boy , upon hearing the legend of Milo of Croton , determined to do the same .
There was a calf in the barn , born that very morning , and the boy resolved to lift up the calf each day .
As the calf grew , so would his strength , day by day , until the calf was grown and he was able to lift a bull .
" Did it work ? " I asked .
" No , " said Ranjit .
" A newborn calf already weighs like a hundred pounds . "
Usually you expect the induction step to fail , but sometimes it 's the base case that gets you .

Aaron and Christine Boring , the couple who filed a lawsuit against Google , claiming that the Street View service violated their privacy by publishing a photo of their house , have ended with empty hands and even more publicity .
The couple claimed that the road leading to their house was clearly marked as private , and that Google 's Street View vehicle has disregarded the sign and invaded their privacy .
They sought the images of their house taken off Street View , and over $ 25,000 in damages .
The U.S. District Court for Western Pennsylvania , however , has dismissed the lawsuit , claiming that the Borings " failed to state a claim under any count . "
Google 's view on the matter is that , unfortunately , " complete privacy does not exist " due to satellite imagery which does n't really care about " private road " signs .
They do , however , remove images from the service if you ask them nicely .

What ’s going on in Gaza now is pretty easy to understand if you think a little bit about the way military trends have been going in the past century - but you also have to be willing to take a cold look at how wars work these days , when there ’s no such thing as those “ purely military ” wars you WW II freaks dream about .
( There never really was , but that ’s another story . )
The Israelis attacked now because of two non-military cycles : the news cycle and the presidential cycle .
This was like a war by an astrologer : the stars had to be in exactly the right position before the Apaches could start blasting and the Merkavas could roll .
The most important cycle of all is the news cycle .
This war happened during international media dead week , between Christmas and New Year .
Ordinary people are drunk or hungover or snowed in , and the people who matter , the media players , are off in Cancun and Phuket , soaking up rum and sun with their blackberries turned off .
They ’re not going to bum out their call girls watching the news from Gaza .
And the Israelis wanted a time when everybody was distracted for a simple reason : asymmetrical war is n’t pretty .
That ’s the same reason they wo n’t let camera crews into Gaza .
To do this kind of war , you have to kill a lot of civilians , because the whole civilian / military distinction does n’t really apply .
If your neighbor is a mid-ranking officer in the military wing of Hamas , the best way to kill him is while he sleeps , before he can arm himself , deploy his men and maybe inflict casualties .
Thanks to years of excellent intelligence on Gaza , the Israelis know exactly who ’s where at pretty much any minute of any day .
And they have attack helicopters hovering over it non-stop , ready to send a Hellfire missile down to take out anybody who might help organize a counterattack .
But Gaza is the most crowded slum in the world , so when you send that missile into his tenement apartment at 4 am , it ’s going to kill him , but it ’s also going to kill his wife , their kids ( and Gaza has a huge birthrate ) and half the block .
That makes cold military sense but it does n’t look good on the news .
Of course you could send troops in , the idea being they ’re cleaner than missiles , but sending troops into a highrise slum full of people who hate your guts is not such a good idea if you ’re worried about casualties .
And like I ’ve said before , the IDF has one big weakness : they do n’t like to take casualties .
So naturally they did what they could to decapitate Hamas from the air first , then with artillery .
Besides , the idea that raids by infantry are less bloody than air strikes is pretty dicey anyway .
Troops get nervous , they start shooting , pretty soon the collateral damage bill is just as big as it would be with an air strike , only this way the raiding party suffers casualties too .
So it made perfect sense for the Israelis to step up their longterm policy of zapping Hamas cadres from the air , and to do it right now , while nobody ’s watching TV .
The other cycle is more of a gamble : the presidential cycle .
I ca n’t believe nobody ’s saying the obvious here : the Israelis want to do this now , once and for all , while Bush is still in office .
They know that Bush will let them do whatever they want .
Bush and Cheney are literally more extreme than about half of the Israeli electorate .
They ’ve never objected to anything Israel wants to do except when the Israelis wanted to talk to the Syrians .
As long as it involves blowing stuff up , Bush is guaranteed to be on their side .
So the planets aligned perfectly for Israel , not so much Age of Aquarius way as Zero Hour , last chance to blow up Gaza before Obama comes in .
Will Obama be more hardnosed with the Israelis ?
I doubt it .
Why would he ?
You ’re not supposed to say out loud that there ’s a big rich Israeli lobby , but everybody knows there is .
And more to the point , what ’s their counterweight ?
Who cares about the Palestinians , even in the Arab world , never mind DC ?
So there ’s a big net gain to any US politician who backs Israel and no reason at all to back their opponents .
So I do n’t see why the Israelis are so worried about Obama .
Still , a military planner ’s job is to be paranoid and the Israeli staff has decided that since Bush is a sure thing and the new guy is an unknown quantity , why not do it now ?
I ’ll tell you something else : Obama ’s people are cheering the IDF too , for the timing at least .
“ Dear IDF , Thank you for doing this while Bush is still around to take the heat !
Signed , Barack . ”
That ’s exactly what Obama meant when somebody asked him about Gaza and he said , “ Hey , we only have one president at a time ! ”
That tells you something else about this operation : it ’s likely to end before January 20 , 2009 .
Obama does n’t want his big inauguration party bummed out with pictures of dead Arab kids , so the IDF has this thing planned to end sometime in early January .
Of course planning is one thing , execution is another .
The IDF planned for a quick clean fight against Hezbollah in 2006 , but that ’s not the way it worked out .
This time the IDF will succeed , at least in the short term , and the campaign will go according to plan .
That ’s my guess anyway .
What we have here is Hamas getting a very hard lesson in why it ’s dangerous to pretend you ’re Hezbollah when you ’re not .
Hezbollah fought so well last time around that everybody started getting uppity , and the Israelis did n’t like it at all .
They were n’t getting respect .
They could n’t destroy Hezbollah , though ; the Hezzies are too smart , too big , too well integrated with the locals in Lebanon .
Hezbollah has all kinds of advantages that Hamas does n’t have , like great strategic depth , pockets of Shia support all through Lebanon , far from the IDF ’s reach ( unless they tried another fullscale invasion of Lebanon , a real bad idea ) .
So for more than two years now Israel has had to put up with Hezbollah sitting just over its northern border with a smug little grin on its hairy face , strutting on the rep it made back in 2006 - and there ’s not much the IDF can do about it .
14 - year - old Wisconsin student arrested for texting in class Jeremy Gantz
Published : Tuesday February 17 , 2009

This A 14 - year - old high - school student has the dubious distinction of being perhaps the first American ever arrested for texting in class .
The Wisconsin girl was charged with disorderly conduct last week after refusing to stop texting during her math class and then denying she had a phone , according to a police report .
" The School Resource officer at Wauwatosa East High School was asked to go to room 242 and remove a student who refuses to stop texting on her phone during class , " the Wauwatosa Police Department officer wrote in his report .
" The student [ name redacted ] ( w/f 6-23 - 94 ) is known to me and the administration based on prior negative contacts . "
It 's unclear what those earlier " negative contacts " were .
But what is clear is that the arresting officer gave the student a a $ 298 ticket for disorderly conduct and kept the Samsung , according to the report , which The Smoking Gun published in full Tuesday .
Wauwatosa East High School has a policy against texting during classes .
The situation would not have escalated if the student had followed the officer 's instructions , Wauwatosa Police spokeswoman Lt. Dominic Leone told the Milwaukee Journal - Sentinel .
" The arrest was more for her behavior than for the texting , " Leone said .
" All she had to do was put the phone away and that would have been that . "
Clearly , the student loved her Samsung Cricket .
She did n't give it up easily :
After repeatedly denying she had it to both her teacher , the school officer and the police officer , the phone was finally revealed after a body search by a female officer called to the scene , according to the report .
In his report , the arresting officer noted that he " had observed that the zipper on [ name deleted ] 's pants was down , " and that " she squirmed in her chair keeping her hands in her lap , " while he interviewed her .
After told she was being arrested for " not telling us the truth , " the officer writes that the girl said " she was not going to stand up to be searched . "
" These words alerted me with her zipper open and he [ sic ] refusal to stand up and be searched she was concealing the phone in her pants , " the officer wrote .
Later , the female officer " recover[ed ] a Samsung Cricket cell phone from the buttocks area of [ name deleted ] , " and the arresting officer claimed that the girl " was smiling and laughing as Paula told me where she recovered the phone . "
The student also apparently gave false phone numbers to the arresting officer , who wished to tell her parents what was happening .
" She gave me several numbers all being false by one or two digits wrong [ sic ] , " Officer Jeffrey S. Griffin wrote .
After her arrest February 11th , the student was suspended for a week  but apparently the time away from school was too much to bear .
The recalcitrant student received citations Thursday and Friday for trespassing on campus , the Milwaukee Journal - Sentinel reported Tuesday .
It 's possible , though uncertain , if the student 's arrest marked the first time high - school texting has led to an arrest .
It 's a difficult question to answer , since such arrests would appear in records as " disorderly conduct " or a similar charge , according to Leone .
The student is due to appear in court April 20th to deal with the misdemeanor charge .

LAHORE , Pakistan
When Abid Noor bids farewell to his wife before leaving for work each morning , he runs a mental check to see whether he has remembered everything - his briefcase , his watch , the lunch his wife has packed and a loaded AK - 47 .
The AK - 47 , or Kalashnikov as it is commonly called in Pakistan , is a recent addition .
“ I only began carrying it two to three months ago and now I do n’t leave home without it , ” said Mr. Noor , 40 , who works at the government ’s planning and development department in the northwest city of Peshawar .
Mr. Noor said he decided to travel armed after a friend , Muhammed Javed Afridi , was kidnapped by five masked men carrying AK - 47s , while driving home .
Another friend “ was working as principal of a school in Jamrud , and for no apparent reason he was shot dead one day as he was returning from work . ”
“ I think the police are doing the best they can but it ’s not enough , ” he said .
“ I need to try and save myself also . ”
It ’s hard to quantify the exact numbers of Pakistanis carrying arms .
Some estimates put the number of small arms in the nation of 172 million at more than 20 million , most of them unlicensed .
The United States has a far larger number of weapons per capita - 210 million privately owned firearms in a nation of 300 million , according to National Rifle Association , but these are licensed .
The North West Frontier Province , a haven for insurgents with a population of about 2 million , is thought to have more than a half - million illegal small arms and light weapons .
For years , guns have been signs of prestige for young men in Pakistan , especially in the rugged tribal regions and in the Punjab , where hunting is popular .
In Peshawar and surrounding areas , guns are routinely fired into the air to show respect and at weddings to symbolize celebration .
When President Asif Ali Zardari made a recent visit to the port city of Karachi , guns were fired into the air to welcome him .
But for young , middle - class professionals such as Mr. Noor , gun ownership is a recent phenomenon .
“ People are picking up guns because they feel there is no law and order in the country , ” said Islamabad - based defense analyst Ayesha Siddiqa .
“ The writ of the state is very weak and the police do n’t have the ability to protect its citizens .
As a result , security has become privatized . ”
Mr. Afridi , 35 , a reporter for a national newspaper , used to wave at the police on his way home from his office , where he frequently works late .
Then he was kidnapped , blindfolded and taken to a house where he was chained to a bed for 25 days .
“ They began negotiating with my family for ransom , ” he recalled .
“ They wanted 6 million rupees [ $ 80,000 ] . ”
Before his family could put together the ransom , Mr. Afridi managed to cut through his chains with a pair of scissors , climb onto the roof and jump to freedom .
“ After that day , I always have an AK - 47 with me , ” he said .
“ In fact , I usually have two : one for myself and one for the relative who is accompanying me . ”
Retired Brig .
Gen. Mahmood Shah , a former security chief of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , said increased demand had pushed the price of a Kalashnikov in Peshawar from about $ 200 to almost $ 900 .
“ With the growing Talibanization of the country , most people feel that it ’s each to his own , ” he said .
“ Having a gun makes everyone feel safer . ”
Guns do n’t provide protection against suicide bomb blasts ripping through the country but reflect concern at a rising crime rate .
In Rawalpindi , once considered a peaceful city , more than 288 people were killed last year compared with 219 in 2007 .
Across the country , nearly 12,000 homicides were reported from January 2008 to November .
Police said it was the highest toll in 10 years .
Lahore police Chief Farooq Mazhar Khan said his department has experienced a marked increase in complaints about illegal weapons .
“ It ’s like nothing we ’ve seen before , ” he said .
One reason is that obtaining a license for certain weapons is not easy in Pakistan .
“ Only the prime minister has the right to issue a license for a Kalashnikov , ” said Aftab Khan Sherpao , a former home minister in the North West Frontier Province .
“ For nonprohibited weapons such as shotguns and pistols , the provincial government can issue a license , which is only valid for that province . ”
The waiting time for a license can extend from months to years .
Still , the Interior Ministry issued almost 50 percent more licenses for pistols and handguns in 2008 than the previous year .
The most common way to purchase a gun is through connections , said Jehangir Shahzad , a journalist who covers these issues .
“ You know someone who knows someone and that ’s how you get a gun , ” he said .
“ The law and order situation has of course contributed to young people feeling like they need to pick up a gun , but it also has a lot to do with the impatience of our youth , ” said Asif Zulfiqar , a former police chief in Lahore .
“ They just do n’t want to wait for the police to do their work . ”
Mr. Afridi , who was given a temporary gun permit by police after his kidnapping , disagreed .
“ We ’re not picking up guns because we suddenly feel like doing so , ” he said .
“ We ’re picking them up because we are being forced to . ”

[ Shawn Stuart , Iraq War veteran , at a 2006 neo -Nazi rally in Olympia , WA . ]
Two years ago , the Southern Poverty Law Center ran a devastating report describing the infiltration of neo -Nazis into the ranks of the American military .
The Pentagon 's official response was steadfast denial of the problem .
The SPLC's David Holthouse just published a follow - up report , and found , predictably , that the problem is getting worse as the conflict in Iraq drags on :
A new FBI report confirms that white supremacists are infiltrating the military for several reasons .
According to the unclassified FBI Intelligence Assessment , " White Supremacist Recruitment of Military Personnel Since 9/11 , " which was released to law enforcement agencies nationwide : " Sensitive and reliable source reporting indicates supremacist leaders are encouraging followers who lack documented histories of neo -Nazi activity and overt racist insignia such as tattoos to infiltrate the military as ' ghost skins , ' in order to recruit and receive training for the benefit of the extremist movement . "
The FBI report details more than a dozen investigative findings and criminal cases involving Iraq and Afghanistan veterans as well as active - duty personnel engaging in extremist activity in recent years .
For example , in September 2006 , the leader of the Celtic Knights , a central Texas splinter faction of the Hammerskins , a national racist skinhead organization , planned to obtain firearms and explosives from an active duty Army soldier in Fort Hood , Texas .
That soldier , who served in Iraq in 2006 and 2007 , was a member of the National Alliance , a neo -Nazi group .
I observed at the time that one of the uglier aspects of the presence of neo -Nazis in Iraq would be the behavior of American soldiers among civilians there :
As Atrios notes , the SPLC report raises immediate questions about the kind of men we 're sending over to Iraq .
To what extent , really , does the spread of white - supremacist attitudes in the military bring about atrocities like the recent murder of a 14 - year - old girl and her family , or the Haditha massacre ?
It is n't hard to see , after all , attitudes about the disposability of nonwhite races rearing their ugly head in those incidents .
Sure enough , as Holthouse reports :
Earlier this year , the founder of White Military Men identified himself in his New Saxon account as " Lance Corporal Burton " of the 2nd Battalion Fox Company Pit 2097 , from Florida , according to a master 's thesis by graduate student Matthew Kennard .
Under his " About Me " section , Burton writes : " Love to shoot my M16A2 service rifle effectively at the Hachies ( Iraqis ) , " and , " Love to watch things blow up ( Hachies House ) . "
Kennard , who was working on his thesis for Columbia University 's Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism , also monitored claims of active - duty military service earlier this year on the neo - Nazi online forum Blood & Honour , where " 88Soldier88 " posted this message on Feb.
18 : " I am in the ARMY right now .
I work in the Detainee Holding Area [ in Iraq ] . … I am in this until 2013 .
I am in the infantry but want to go to SF [ Special Forces ] .
Hopefully the training will prepare me for what I hope is to come . "
One of the Blood & Honour members claiming to be an active - duty soldier taking part in combat operations in Iraq identified himself to Kennard as Jacob Berg .
He did not disclose his rank or branch of service .
" There are actually a lot more ' skinheads , ' ' nazis , ' white supremacists now [ in the military ] than there has been in a long time , " Berg wrote in an E - mail exchange with Kennard .
" Us racists are actually getting into the military a lot now because if we do n't every one who already is [ in the military ] will take pity on killing sand niggers .
Yes I have killed women , yes I have killed children and yes I have killed older people .
But the biggest reason I 'm so proud of my kills is because by killing a brown many white people will live to see a new dawn . "
The July 2006 report by the SPLC found this infiltration occurring at an alarming rate .
Neo - Nazis " stretch across all branches of service , they are linking up across the branches once they 're inside , and they are hard - core , " Department of Defense gang detective Scott Barfield told the SPLC .
" We 've got Aryan Nations graffiti in Baghdad , " he added .
" That 's a problem . "
The source of the problem , as the report explained , was the extreme pressure military recruiters were under to fill their recruitment quotas .
" Recruiters are knowingly allowing neo -Nazis and white supremacists to join the armed forces , " said Barfield , " and commanders do n’t remove them . . . even after we positively identify them as extremists or gang members . "
The military downplayed a neo -Nazi presence in the ranks , Barfield added , " because then parents who are already worried about their kids signing up and dying in Iraq are going to be even more reluctant about their kids enlisting if they feel they ’ll be exposed to gangs and white supremacists . "
One of the noteworthy aspects of this phenomenon is the increasingly military style of the Far Right in recent years , particularly the militias in the 1990s , who openly recruited veterans and current military members .
The two cultures have become increasingly enmeshed , as embodied by Steven Barry 's recruitment plan for neo -Nazis considering a military career as a way to sharpen their " warrior " skills .
The FBI 's assessment in the " White Supremacist Recruitment of Military Personnel Since 9/11 " report found that the numbers of identifiable neo -Nazis within the ranks was quite small ( only a little over 200 ) , but warned :
Although individuals with military backgrounds constitute a small percentage of white supremacist extremists , they frequently occupy leadership roles within extremist groups and their involvement has the potential to reinvigorate an extremist movement suffering from loss of leadership and in - fighting during the post - 9/11 period .
Looking ahead , current and former military personnel belonging to white supremacist extremist organizations who experience frustration at the inability of these organizations to achieve their goals may choose to found new , more operationally minded and operationally capable groups .
The military training veterans bring to the movement and their potential to pass this training on to others can increase the ability of lone offenders to carry out violence from the movement ’s fringes .
Military experience — ranging from failure at basic training to success in special operations forces — is found throughout the white supremacist extremist movement .
FBI reporting indicates extremist leaders have historically favored recruiting active and former military personnel for their knowledge of firearms , explosives , and tactical skills and their access to weapons and intelligence in preparation for an anticipated war against the federal government , Jews , and people of color .
...
The prestige which the extremist movement bestows upon members with military experience grants them the potential for influence beyond their numbers .
Most extremist groups have some members with military experience , and those with military experience often hold positions of authority within the groups to which they belong .
...
Military experience — often regardless of its length or type — distinguishes one within the extremist movement .
While those with military backgrounds constitute a small percentage of white supremacist extremists , FBI investigations indicate they frequently have higher profiles within the movement , including recruitment and leadership roles .
...
New groups led or significantly populated by military veterans could very likely pursue more operationally minded agendas with greater tactical confidence .
In addition , the military training veterans bring to the movement and their potential to pass this training on to others can increase the ability of lone offenders to carry out violence from the movement ’s fringes .
This problem does n’t involve only the Nazis , gang - bangers , and other violent personalities worming their way into the military .
It also affects the many more formerly normal , non-racist recruits who have been dragged into multiple tours of duty in Iraq , regardless of the psychological dangers of such treatment .
This includes many people whose evaluations have recommended they not be returned for duty but have been sent back regardless .
Thus the Timothy McVeigh Finishing School continues to operate .
This has the deadly potential to become a significant component of the predictable surge in far - right activity likely to manifest itself in the United States in the coming months and years , especially as Democrats and liberals expand their hold on power .
We run the risk of re-creating the conditions that arose in Germany and Italy after World War I : the presence of scores of angry , disaffected , and psychologically damaged war veterans , fed a steady diet of " Dolchstosslegende , " poised to organize into a political force aimed at " rebirthing " the nation and its heritage .
In our current situation , these veterans not only will have served with neo -Nazis amid their ranks , they will likely be faced with unemployment and a wrecked economy , eager for someone to blame and fully trained and capable of violent action .
SPLC Chief Counsel Richard Cohen has written another letter to the Defense Secretary pleading that the DoD take concrete steps to deal with this problem .
Here 's hoping he produces something other than denial this time .
The Adventures of Hockey Bear and Saxophone Walrus
Yesterday I saw two important Youtube videos : A walrus pretending to play the sax and a bear trying real hard to play ice hockey .
These two videos are not related EXCEPT that both feature animals doing human things and being awesome AND they probably both hate their lives .
That bear certainly seemed to hate his ill - fitting hat .
BUT
I think they should get together and be a team !
Maybe they can fight crime or something ?

A lot of people get annoyed with Austrian economists because they tend to be so dogmatic ( we prefer the term consistent ) and because they cloak their strictly economic claims with self - righteousness ( we prefer the term morality ) .
After a good Austrian bashing of the latest call to steal taxpayer money and waste it on something that will make a given problem worse , the stumped critics will often shout , " Oh yeah ?
Well do you guys have a better idea ? "
Now , in truth , someone does n't have to have a better suggestion in order to point out that a recommended strategy will exacerbate the situation .
If an allergic man has been stung by a bee , I do n't know what to do except rush him to the hospital and maybe scour the cupboards looking for Benadryl .
But I 'm pretty sure drawing blood from his leg , in order to inject it into his arm and thus " stimulate his immune system , " is a bad idea on numerous accounts — not least of which , is that I 'm pretty sure an allergic reaction means your immune system needs to calm down .
But the point is , if a bunch of guys hold the man down — he has to be forced to endure the procedure for his own good , do n't you know — I feel perfectly qualified in yelling , " Stop ! "
If you grasped that analogy , you can understand my feelings about anything Paul Krugman writes .
( All joking aside , I am pretty proud of the above analogy .
But to make it even more accurate , let ’s stipulate that a blind heroin addict , who has been convicted of manslaughter on three separate occasions , is the one entrusted with making the transfusion .
Naturally he will use one of his own needles for the procedure . )
An Austrian Recommendation for President Obama
In one sense , the critics are right when they ask , " Oh , so we should just sit back and do nothing and let the market fix itself ? "
Yes , that would be a perfectly good idea .
The whole reason we are in a recession in the first place is that the capital structure of the economy had become unsustainable due to the Fed 's massive credit expansion following the dot - com bust and 9/11 attacks .
Resources — most notably , labor — are currently idle , because the economy needs to readjust .
Overextended lines such as housing and finance need to shrink , while others need to expand .
( And no , I do n't know what those understaffed lines are ; that 's why we have a price system . )
Because Americans lived beyond their means for so many years , they now need to live below their means , consuming less while they rebuild their checking accounts and portfolios .
Given the diagnosis , we can be sure that efforts to borrow and spend our way back into prosperity , or massive bailouts of the banks and homeowners , are only pumping air into a flat tire with a gaping hole .
And Bernanke 's unbelievable injections of new funny money into the credit markets will only ensure that those failed institutions remain afloat , paralyzing true recovery in the loan market , and risking very large price inflation if Bernanke does not soon reverse course .
However , even though " nothing " would be much , much better than all of the alleged remedies being bandied about , the Austrians actually do have concrete proposals for President Obama .
The following list includes items that I would have endorsed even before the crisis , but inasmuch as they would definitely help things , I offer them with sincerity to the new administration .
One last caveat : I know there are many purists who read the Mises Daily , and will be aghast at my watered - down recommendations .
Yes , yes , I agree that the best thing would be for Obama , Pelosi , Reid , and all my friends to say , " You know , if you look at the history of this company , it always ends up wasting money and getting innocent people killed .
I think we should just quit and go volunteer at a church instead . "
But , if I said that as an Austrian recommendation , it would be dismissed as " unserious , " a very grave charge indeed .
Thus , the following list of recommendations are not politically impossible , just exceedingly unlikely :
Now , where to start cutting ?
Top 10 Countries by Military Expenditure , 2007
Eliminate the personal and corporate income tax .
Do n't put in a flat tax or a fair tax or a VAT or any other cute name for a very uncute process .
To make sure that individuals and corporations realize you are serious , blow up the IRS building .
( Have everyone vacate the premises first , of course . )
Tell all of the displaced workers that they have 9 months of full pay , plus whatever pension and health - care benefits they had contractually earned to that point .
If the workers get new jobs 3 days after being laid off from the IRS , that 's fine ; they still get their full 9 months ' pay .
But if they have n't found a new job after 9 months , tough .
Unfortunately , dismantling the Social Security system will have to wait .
( That means some of the IRS personnel would — sigh — have to be retained .
But they would move to a different building . )
Getting rid of the income tax will knock out much of the federal revenues , and taking out all payroll " contributions " would take us into the realm of " unserious . "
Note that in 2007 , even without the personal and corporate income tax , the federal government still took in more than $ 1 trillion in receipts .
The loss of some $ 1.5 trillion in annual tax receipts sounds absurd , but the actual figure would be lower , because of " supply - side " effects .
That is , the true stimulus to the economy from such an enormous tax cut would cause the revenues from other sources to grow .
So long as the federal budget were cut by , say , a trillion dollars , within a few years it would be in the black .
Reducing annual federal expenditures by $ 1 trillion sounds inconceivable , but it actually could be phased in .
The government has many assets that it could auction off into private hands , so that in the first year or two , the government could take certain programs and say , " This will have its budget cut by one - third over each of the next three years . "
The auction receipts would fill the gap until these phased - in reductions had fully occurred .
Some of the obvious auction items would be the oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( current value of about $ 35 billion at $ 50 / bbl oil ) , as well as all of the mineral deposits ( both onshore and offshore ) technically owned by the federal government .
It is difficult to come up with an estimate of how much the latter properties would fetch in an auction , since the proposals right now are for leasing extraction rights .
But since the Outer Continental Shelf is estimated to have some 86 billion barrels of oil , presumably the government could receive many hundreds of billions of dollars — and possibly trillions — from an orderly and staggered sale over a few years of the most lucrative ( and environmentally noncontroversial ) lands .
Eliminate the DEA and the SEC .
Since the SEC failed to catch Madoff , despite nine years of warnings , I think its $ 950 million annual budget is obviously a waste of money .
The DEA 's $ 1.9 billion budget in 2007 also strikes me as counterproductive .
Beyond the issues of violent gangs and judicial corruption , there is the fact that this is a recession and we need to cut costs .
If you 're afraid of your kid doing drugs , have a serious talk and then make him watch this movie .
And if he 's still keen on the idea , I 'm not sure the DEA is going to stop him .
( By the way , the DEA and SEC employees get the same deal as the laid - off IRS personnel . )
Cut the Pentagon budget in half .
In FY 2008 it was ( officially ) some $ 460 billion , so that cut alone would free up $ 230 billion per year .
This is n't an article about foreign policy , so we wo n't be specific about how the military could achieve such cuts .
But if you 're worried that the country would suddenly be overrun by Iranian tanks , the following chart should reassure you : Eliminate the Department of Education .
That would save $ 68.6 billion a year , based on its latest budget .
Does anyone want to argue that Americans are well educated ?
And incidentally , I was a college professor for a few years , so I can say from personal experience that there are way too many kids going to college .
If you think " everyone should get a college degree , " let me ask you this : Should everyone get a PhD ?
If not , then why a bachelor 's degree ?
The more kids crammed into the school , the harder it is to teach to the truly academic , and the less of a signal the diploma provides .
Plus , $ 68.6 billion is some serious money .
Cancel all the pending " stimulus " and other bailout packages .
Tell the Big Three that small is beautiful .
Tell the banks , " OK your ' short - term ' loan from the Fed has expired , here are your mortgage - backed securities back , and we 'll be taking our reserves .
Good luck to you .
This is a capitalist country , where you keep your earnings if you forecast well ( we just eliminated the income tax ! ) and where you go bust if you do n't realize real estate sometimes drops .
Have a nice day . "
Yes , this would cause some banks to immediately go bankrupt , but the big banks are n't doing anything now anyway .
The dreaded liquidation would actually wipe the slate clean so recovery could begin .
As it is , trillions of dollars in capital is now locked up in undead institutions that can't make new loans but wo n't mark their assets at true values , since they are insolvent .
And with the income tax being wiped out , the toxicity of these troubled assets would come way down .
Allow unrestricted immigration so long as the incoming folks had a secure job in which the employer ( a ) paid three years in advance on any state and local taxes that would accrue from the employment and ( b ) bought at least a $ 100,000 house for the immigrant and his or her family .
( Yes , yes , the last point is silly , but it will help sell the package . )
Abolish the minimum wage .
That — coupled with the elimination of the income tax — will take care of unemployment within 6 months .
The above steps are incomplete , and I 'm sure many readers will email me with snags in them .
Fair enough .
But I am confident that the above would make a heck of a lot more sense than letting blind heroin addicts borrow an extra trillion dollars to " stimulate " the economy .
The Internet is no doubt changing modern society .
It has profoundly altered how we gather information , consume news , carry out war , and create and foster social bonds .
But is it altering our brains ?
A growing number of scientists think so , and studies are providing data to show it .
What remains to be seen is whether the changes are good or bad , and whether the brain is , as one neuroscientist believes , undergoing unprecedented evolution .
Texting and instant messaging , social networking sites and the Internet in general can certainly be said to distract people from other tasks .
But what researchers are worrying more about are the plastic brains of teens and young adults who are now growing up with all this , the " digital natives " as they 're being called .
" My fear is that these technologies are infantilising the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights , who have a small attention span and who live for the moment , " said Baroness Greenfield , an Oxford University neuroscientist and director of the Royal Institution , in The Daily Mail today .
" I often wonder whether real conversation in real time may eventually give way to these sanitised and easier screen dialogues , in much the same way as killing , skinning and butchering an animal to eat has been replaced by the convenience of packages of meat on the supermarket shelf . "
Odd analogy , but one worth pondering .
Inevitable brain change
Every generation adapts to change , and the brain gets used for different purposes .
For ancient man there was the spear , the mammoth , and the rock to hide behind .
Agriculture changed the world , as did writing .
Then came gunpowder , the Industrial Revolution , radio , and TV dinners .
Man would never be the same .
Adapt or die , hiding behind a rock with no friends , no family .
The pace picked up .
Cell phones changed everything .
Smart phones made them seem quaint .
Our brains adapted .
I used to have dozens of phone numbers committed to memory .
Now that they 're all in my Blackberry ( and before that the Palm , going back a decade now ) I can remember only those I 'd memorized when I was a child .
I do n't even know my wife 's cell phone or work number .
I 'm not sure what all that brain capacity is being used for now , other than struggling to focus on writing columns like this while checking email several times and surfing from valid research sites to unrelated pages detailing the latest condition of Jane Goody , who I 'd never heard of until recently , to reaching for my hip when my stomach gurgles but I think my phone is vibrating ( a modern condition called phantom vibration syndrome ) .
But I digress .
And I 'm touching on the " Google is making us stupid " notion , written about last summer in the Atlantic by Nicholas Carr , who notes how he used to " spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose .
That 's rarely the case anymore .
Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages .
I get fidgety , lose the thread , begin looking for something else to do .
I feel as if I 'm always dragging my wayward brain back to the text . "
Carr blames the lack of concentration on a decade of being online .
But forget us old folks .
What about the kids , whose online use we , er , monitor ?
The Daily Mail article today points out that students tend no longer to plan essays before starting to write :
Thanks to computers and MS Word , they can edit as they go along .
I grew up learning to do an outline on paper before writing any essay or story , a habit that was reinforced in journalism school .
I rarely do so anymore ( though when the writing does n't go well , it 's still a great tactic ) .
Good or bad ?
I 'm not sure .
Change , yes .
Nowadays I think with my fingers , and my brain bounces around a lot more when I write , outlining on the fly .
Yet I worry about my children and what skills they 'll develop spending hours a day either on a computer , using a cell phone to talk or text or surf ( while driving ? ! ) or watching TV , and whether all that activity will enhance their well being , help them make lifelong friendships , find a mate , get a job .
Teens have always hidden out ( in the woods , under the grandstands , or in their rooms ) , but now , thanks to their various electronic social networks , a cell phone and perhaps a laptop tuned to Hulu , they can truly become hermits , harder than ever to coax out .
The dinner bell , long ago replaced with a shout down the hallway , has now given way to an evening SMS .
Learning experience
On the assumption that technological progress can't be stopped , the flip - side to the inevitable digitalization of life is the simple argument that kids need to learn new digital skills to survive and thrive in our fast - changing society .
Researchers at the University of Minnesota last year asked 16 - to 18 - year - olds what they learn from using social networking sites .
The students listed technology skills as the top lesson , followed by creativity , then being open to new or diverse views and communication skills .
" What we found was that students using social networking sites are actually practicing the kinds of 21st century skills we want them to develop to be successful today , " said Christine Greenhow , a learning technologies researcher at the university and leader of the study .
One example Greenhow gave : A student might take up video production after seeing a cool video on MySpace .
" Students are developing a positive attitude towards using technology systems , editing and customizing content and thinking about online design and layout , " she explained .
" They 're also sharing creative original work like poetry and film and practicing safe and responsible use of information and technology .
The Web sites offer tremendous educational potential . "
It 's up to educators [ and parents ? ] , Greenhow believes , to figure out how to leverage all this .
Evolution of a new human brain ?
Meanwhile , much more research needs to be done to determine if social networking sites , and the Internet in general , are good or bad for children and teens , or neither .
Studies going back to the late 1990s have flip - flopped on this as often as new social networking sites pop up .
For now , there are only hints and indications that all this change may indeed lead to young brains that work differently than those of previous generations .
But evidence is indeed mounting .
" We are seeing children 's brain development damaged because they do n't engage in the activity they have engaged in for millennia , " says Sue Palmer , author of " Toxic Childhood " ( Orion , 2007 ) .
" I 'm not against technology and computers .
But before they start social networking , they need to learn to make real relationships with people . "
Others think a profound evolutionary change is underway .
UCLA neuroscientist Gary Small thinks the dramatic shift in how we gather information and communicate has touched off a rapid evolution of the brain .
" Perhaps not since early man first discovered how to use a tool has the human brain been affected so quickly and so dramatically , " Small contends .
" As the brain evolves and shifts its focus towards new technological skills , it drifts away from fundamental social skills . "
( Can you keep up ?
That may depend in part on how your brain is wired .
People who welcome new experiences have stronger connections between their brain centers associated with memory and reward than people who tend to avoid anything new , scientists recently reported in the journal Nature Neuroscience . )
Small , author of " iBrain : Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind " ( Collins Living , 2008 ) , puts people into two categories : digital natives ( your kids ) and digital immigrants ( the rest of us who cope with varying degrees of success with all this ) .
The former are better at snap decisions and juggling lots of sensory input ; the latter are great at reading facial expressions .
" The typical immigrant 's brain was trained in completely different ways of socializing and learning , taking things step - by - step and addressing one task at a time , " Small says .
Interestingly , while Internet use causes changes in brain activity and wiring among people of any age , as a brain - scan study showed , the changes are most pronounced among digital natives .
As Small puts it , just searching the Internet " appears to engage a greater extent of neural circuitry that is not activated during reading — but only in those with prior Internet experience . "
For the sake of balance , perhaps we should require all children to learn how to skin and butcher an animal .

Reinforced cage handled it pretty well for something almost the size of a tin of baked beans .
Many of the individuals could have heard that triplets or quadruplets were born to a woman all at once .
But , the most fascinating fact is that a woman referred to as Nadya Suleman gave birth to 8 babies or octuplets in one go .
This is the reason she is named as octomom .
Listening to this most of the individuals were surprised and astonished of this miracle occurrence .
The main fascinating thing is this octomom already have six kids .
So totally she has about fourteen children of the age of eight .
This octomom topic became hot such that some people were excited that how can it be possible to give birth to 8 babies at once .
Few other people criticized that she wanted to have a big family in this manner and gave critics that this mom is a machine of baby making .
octuplets
Few mentions that this octomom is single and not employed .
Many people think that she is selfish that in order to have big family she gave birth to octuplets .
This octomom now finds it difficult to manage her finances as she has no job and there are fourteen children totally to take care of .
Before this the mom was a nude model and celebrity
This octomom is not independent financially and she was not able to take decisions that are productive .
She even fought with baby sitters who tried to guide and help her .
boxer .
Most of the people claim that she did all this for gaining attention from the people .
She was able to draw that focus on her but even criticized intensely .
What are the eight facts of this octomom ?
This octomom life is like a roller coaster ride as there are up and downs in any person ’s like , she also has many in her life mainly after being a mother of octuplets .
Let ’s know the facts of this octomom .
Before becoming into an octomom , this person began her career in the mental hospital and left it due to injury on the back .
She utilized the cash that she got from payments of disability for her treatments of in - vitro fertilization to give birth to 6 kids .
This mom was a graduate in development of adolescent and child care .
While being pregnant with 8 children , she went on to do masters .
The eight kids she was bearing were born to her through the treatments of IVF which were implanted as embryos by a physician .
It was totally twelve were implanted but resulted into octuplets .
This mom is a graduate in child care or development of adolescent .
So , she is now fully supporting the control of birth at an organization .
The octomom put different names that are biblical but all with similar middle name that is angel .
This mom never mentioned the actual father of this octuplets .
As she only said that her friend provided sperms which are utilized to produce embryos of about sixty that is seemed to be implanted to her by the doctor physician .
The octomom was also professional boxing celebrity as a little lived profession .
She also won AVN award which is similar to an Oscar award for the video of porn .
The house she purchased was under auction after this octomom gave birth to octuplets after she failed to pay her loan .
She has to live in the homes that are rented and even saving her home was dismissed because this mom did n’t do the whole paperwork of bankruptcy .
Thus , these are some of the facts of this octomom who gave birth to eight kids all at once .

It ’s fortunate that there are lots of ways to screw up concurrency because I ’ve still got a lot of these entries left . :)
Today ’s installment will cover one of the most common exceptions encountered with the collections library .
Collections from JDK 1.4 and earlier all use “ fail - fast ” iterators .
These iterators are designed to be valid until the original collection is modified .
At that point , they “ fail fast ” and will throw ConcurrentModificationException .
The most common way to encounter this is to remove elements from the collection while walking through the iterator .
[ source : java ]
List list = …
while ( Item item : list ) {
if( isOld ( item ) ) {
list.remove( item ) ;
}
}
[ / source ]
After the point where the first remove ( ) is called , the iterator is now invalid .
It ’s quite possible to test this with 0 or 1 item in the list and see no problem , but as soon as two or more items are in the list , this is guaranteed to throw a ConcurrentModificationException .
Of course , it ’s quite possible that the actual code is more complicated and the remove ( ) is separated through several method calls from the iteration .
Note the scenario above is single - threaded yet causes the error .
Stepping back a bit , we need to consider a couple possible reasons you might be doing this .
One is that you are actually in single - threaded code and need to modify a collection while iterating through it .
If so , then the best way to do this is by using methods on the iterator itself : [ source : java ]
List list = …
Iterator iterator = list.iterator ( ) ;
while ( iterator.hasNext ( ) ) {
Item item = iterator.next ( ) ;
if( isOld ( item ) ) {
iterator.remove ( ) ;
}
}
[ / source ]
This mechanism will not throw a ConcurrentModificationException as we are safely modifying the list through the iterator .
You can also use the more capable ListIterator if you happen to be using a list .
ListIterator lets you change the item under iteration and walk forward and backward through the list .
Another option you see frequently is to iterate through a copy of the list under iteration and remove from the original list .
Because two lists are being used , the iterator is not affected by the modifications to the original list .
[ source : java ]
List list = …
List listCopy ) {
if( isOld ( item ) ) {
list.remove( item ) ;
}
}
[ / source ]
Of course , copying has the large down - side of needing to copy the list , which is O(n ) and can be expensive if the list is large .
In general , for single - threaded use cases , removing through an iterator is far preferable to avoid the copy .
In a multi - threaded scenario , the copy technique might be better ( assuming the collection is properly synchronized ) to avoid modifying while iterating .
But an even better solution might be to use one of the concurrent collections in the java.util.concurrent package .
The collections in this package are designed for concurrency and they do not use fail - fast iterators .
Rather , they use other iterator styles that allow for concurrent modification ( and thus do n’t throw ConcurrentModificationException ) .
Collections like CopyOnWriteArrayList or CopyOnWriteArraySet use what is known as a “ snapshot ” iterator .
These collections internally switch to a new copy of the data when the collection is modified in any way .
Prior iterators that are walking over the collection see a “ snapshot ” of the data at the time the iterator was created .
In these data structures , writes are assumed to be rare and reads / iteration frequent so it is worth the cost of creating the copy on write .
Other collections , most notably ConcurrentHashMap , use what ’s known as a “ weakly consistent ” iterator .
Weakly consistent iterators actually allow you to iterate through the data while it ’s being updated .
So , some changes made during iteration will be see by the iterator .
Here “ some ” implies the “ weakly consistent ” part of the name .
This kind of iterator guarantees that you see all elements at the time of iterator creation and may see any changes made after creation .
One other important and related thing to mention is that using an iterator from a synchronized wrapper is NOT sufficient to address this problem .
For example this wo n’t work : [ source : java ]
List originalList = new ArrayList ( ) ;
… fill originalList … </ p>
// BROKEN
List list = Collections.synchronizedList(originalList ) ;
while ( Item item : list ) {
// stuff
}
[ / source ]
The problem here is that an iterator from the synchronized wrapper collection is NOT thread - safe or synchronized against the wrapped collection .
To maintain thread - safety , the javadoc notes that you MUST synchronize against the returned list when you iterate : [ source : java ]
List originalList = new ArrayList ( ) ;
List list = Collections.synchronizedList(originalList ) ;
synchronized ( list ) {
while ( Item item : list ) {
// stuff
}
}

Money Morning
Attention Baby Boomers :
If you are trying to sell your home , more than 30 % of you will have to bring money to the table .
And the combination of falling house and stock values means that the vast majority of people near retirement have accumulated little or no wealth , meaning they will be almost completely reliant on Social Security and Medicare to support them in their retirement years .
These are the findings of " The Wealth of the Baby Boom Cohorts After the Collapse of the Housing Bubble , " a report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research ( CEPR ) , a non-partisan research firm .
" The collapse of the housing bubble , which led to the current recession , has already destroyed almost $ 6 trillion dollars in housing wealth for homeowners , " said report co-author Dean Baker , who will testify today before the Senate Special Committee on Aging .
" This reality is compounded by the recent collapse of the stock market .
The result is that many baby boomers will only have Social Security and Medicare to rely on in their retirement . "
Updating an earlier paper on the topic and using more plausible projections for housing and stock values given the sharp downturn in both markets over the last eight months , the report outlines two other scenarios for Baby Boomers ' wealth in 2009 .
In the first , and worst - case , scenario , the median household wealth for late Baby Boomers ( ages 45 to 54 ) fell more than 45 % between 2004 and 2009 – from $ 150,500 in 2004 to just $ 82,200 in 2009 .
And if they took all the wealth they accumulated in their lifetime , Baby Boomers would still owe more than half of the price of a typical house .
According to the second scenario , the median household wealth for people between the ages of 55 and 64 fell by nearly 38 % between 2004 and 2009 – from $ 229,600 to $ 142,700 .
Though not particularly rosy , it 's enough for those households to cover about 80 % of the cost of their median home .
The CEPR report also says that for both age groups , those who have been renting in that same span will have more wealth in 2009 .
" Homeownership is not everywhere and always an effective way to accumulate wealth .
For those who owned a home in the last few years , the collapse of the housing bubble led to the destruction of much or all of their wealth , " the report said .
Placing Blame and Changing Policy
Like house values , 401 ( k ) and pension plans have been scorched by the global financial crisis .
Worldwide pension values fell from $ 25 trillion to $ 20 trillion in 2008 alone .
And in the 12 months after the U.S. stock market hit its record peak in October 2007 , more than $ 1 trillion worth of stock market wealth held in 401 ( k ) s and other " defined - contribution " plans was eviscerated .
Add individual retirement accounts ( IRAs ) to the mix , and the lost wealth is more like $ 2 trillion .
Allowing financial bubbles to run their course – which has been the Federal Reserve 's policy in the last decade – " virtually guarantees that tens of millions of people will reach retirement with little or nothing to support themselves other than their Social Security , " the CEPR report says .
The report also blames policymakers for not identifying the current bubble as far back as 2002 , and holds them responsible for drafting legislation that shieldes taxpayers from future downturns .
" These projections should highlight the importance of policies that combat financial bubbles , " the report says .
" While typical homeowners cannot be blamed for not recognizing the bubble , the economists and policy professionals who designed policies that pushed homeownership certainly can and should be blamed . "
[ Editor 's Note : Money Morning Associate Editor Mike Caggeso has been chronicling the fallout investors have been experiencing from the ongoing U.S. financial crisis , and has also detailed some repair strategies for investors ' pension and retirement plans .

How amphibians are harvested around the world
In pictures
Up to one billion frogs are taken from the wild for human consumption each year , according to a new study .
Researchers arrived at this conclusion by analysing UN trade data , although they acknowledge there is a lot of uncertainty in the figure .
France and the US are the two biggest importers , with significant consumption in several East Asian nations .
About one - third of all amphibians are listed as threatened species , with habitat loss the biggest factor .
But hunting is acknowledged as another important driver for some species , along with climate change , pollution and disease - notably the fungal condition chytridiomycosis which has brought rapid extinctions to some amphibians .
Absence of essential data to monitor and manage the wild harvest is a large concern
Professor Corey Bradshaw
The new research , to be published in a forthcoming edition of the journal Conservation Biology , suggests that the global trade in wild frogs has been underestimated in the past .
" Frogs legs are on the menu at school cafeterias in Europe , market stalls and dinner tables across Asia to high end restaurants throughout the world , " said Corey Bradshaw from Adelaide University in Australia .
" Amphibians are already the most threatened animal group yet assessed because of disease , habitat loss and climate change - man 's massive appetite for their legs is not helping . "
Amphibians are farmed for food in some countries but these animals are not included in the new analysis .
Exporting extinction Indonesia emerged from Professor Bradshaw 's analysis as both the largest exporter of frogs - 5,000 tonnes per year - and a major consumer .
Frogs are liquidised to make a " health drink " in parts of South America
This has raised concerns that it may soon experience the declines induced by hunting that have been seen elsewhere in the world , notably in France and the US , where species such as the Californian red-legged frog have crashed .
The researchers suggest that the amphibian trade may mimic the situation with global fisheries .
" Harvesting seems to be following the same pattern for frogs as with marine fisheries - initial local collapses in Europe and North America , followed by population declines in India and Bangladesh and now potentially in Indonesia , " said Professor Bradshaw .
" Absence of essential data to monitor and manage the wild harvest is a large concern . "
The researchers suggest establishing a certification scheme so exporters would have to prove that their animals had been hunted sustainably .
However , a large portion of the trade in amphibians for the pet trade is conducted illegally , and experts say customs officials in many countries are ill - equipped to spot and deal with illegal consignments .

Some sustainable and organic farming advocates are happy about the president 's choice for the No. 2 spot at the U.S. Department of Agriculture , Kathleen Merrigan .
" This amounts to a major win for organic , sustainable and local food advocates , since Merrigan is not only well - versed in these issues but has been a tireless advocate for them , " Samuel Fromartz wrote on his ChewsWise blog .
The Consumers Union also praised the choice .
" We would expect her to be a strong defender of USDA ’s organic standards , which have been under repeated attack for the last several years , " said Jean Halloran , director of Food Policy Initiatives at the organization .
And on Civil Eats , Paula Crossfield wrote , " While our fight is far from finished , we can all breathe a sigh of relief that finally the interests of eaters everywhere will have a voice at the USDA . "
Merrigan is now an assistant professor and director of the Agriculture , Food and Environment Program at Tufts University .
She has been administrator of the USDA 's Agricultural Marketing Service and helped develop the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 , which mandated national organic standards and a program of federal accreditation .
President Obama on Monday announced his intention to nominate Merrigan to be deputy secretary at the USDA .

After a man fell from a Japanese whaling ship into the freezing antarctic waters , the whalers have called off all operations while in search for the man ’s body .
[ social_buttons ]
Sea Shepherd , usually the arch nemesis of the whalers , offered to help find the body with their two small boats and helicopter , but the Japanese refused saying they would not require any help from an “ eco-terrorist organization . ”
Captain Paul Watson says that Sea Shepherd has ignored their request and has begun searching for the body with his two small boat crews and helicopter .
He also has promised not to interfere with any Japanese operations while they search for the body .
Unfortunately Sea Shepherd will not be able to help with the search for long as they will soon depart back to port to refuel .
They plan to dock in Tasmania due to its close proximity , but Japan has been petitioning Australia , Chile , and New Zealand to prevent the Steve Irwin ship from refueling .
Of course , the Japanese have an entirely different story to tell about the search for the missing whaler and say that the activists have been disrupting their search .

Unusual Red Glow Over Minnesota
Credit & Copyright : Tyler Blessing �
Explanation :
What in heaven 's blazes is that ?
When landing in Minneapolis , Minnesota , USA in 2002 , just before his flight ascended above cloud level in the early evening , passenger Tyler Blessing saw and photographed " huge curved sheets of glowing light extending from cloud to ground . "
The glow appeared unlike other unusual lights more typically seen , including crepuscular rays , anticrepuscular rays and the glory .
A leading possibility , mentioned initially by the photographer , is that the light sheets are setting sunlight scattered off of falling rain .
Alternatively , the phenomenon could just be a peculiar window reflection .
APOD readers , who have previously shown an impressive ability to pool their collective intelligence to create a better understanding of photographed sky anomalies , are invited to discuss this online .
It might help to know that EXIF data indicates that the image was captured on 2002 September 23 at about 8:07 pm in the evening ( local time ) , and that the camera was reported to be pointing north of west at that time .
The oval on the ground , visible in the lower right of the above image , is Canterbury Downs race track .

Considering how often I ’ve written about this topic in the past , I had some reluctance to return to it , fearing I would n’t have anything new or unique to say this time around .
But the right of free speech is once again under assault , and whenever that happens , I believe friends of liberty around the world have a moral duty to man the barricades and raise our voices against the barbarous fanatics who would take it away .
So , here ’s the story in a nutshell ( HT : Andrew Sullivan ) .
Johann Hari , the courageous freethinker and journalist whom I cited last August in “ Speak Boldly “ , wrote an editorial calling attention to another case of tyrannical Islamists seeking to suppress the right of others to criticize their barbaric practices .
It happened at the U.N. , where a bloc of Islamic nations successfully pushed through a resolution demanding “ respect ” for shariah law , with the shocking result that things like child marriage or the stoning of women can no longer be discussed by the U.N. Human Rights Council .
In response came Hari ’s editorial , Why should I respect these oppressive religions ?
Like his previous piece , it was an outstanding condemnation of irrational beliefs of all kinds , and a clarion call for the most basic of human rights .
Here ’s an excerpt to give you the flavor , though I highly recommend reading the whole piece :
All people deserve respect , but not all ideas do .
I do n’t respect the idea that a man was born of a virgin , walked on water and rose from the dead .
I do n’t respect the idea that we should follow a “ Prophet ” who at the age of 53 had sex with a nine - year old girl , and ordered the murder of whole villages of Jews because they would n’t follow him .
… a free society cannot be structured to soothe the hardcore faithful .
It is based on a deal .
You have an absolute right to voice your beliefs – but the price is that I too have a right to respond as I wish .
Neither of us can set aside the rules and demand to be protected from offence .
Yet this idea – at the heart of the Universal Declaration – is being lost .
To the right , it thwacks into apologists for religious censorship ; to the left , it dissolves in multiculturalism .
The hijacking of the UN Special Rapporteur by religious fanatics should jolt us into rescuing the simple , battered idea disintegrating in the middle : the equal , indivisible human right to speak freely .
A respected Indian newspaper , The Statesman , reprinted Hari ’s essay , explaining that they felt it was in accord with India ’s rich and venerable tradition of secularism .
You may be able to guess what happened next :
That night , four thousand Islamic fundamentalists began to riot outside their offices , calling for me , the editor , and the publisher to be arrested – or worse .
They brought Central Calcutta to a standstill .
A typical supporter of the riots , Abdus Subhan , said he was “ prepared to lay down his life , if necessary , to protect the honour of the Prophet ” and I should be sent “ to hell if he chooses not to respect any religion or religious symbol ?
He has no liberty to vilify or blaspheme any religion or its icons on grounds of freedom of speech . ”
Then , two days ago , the editor and publisher were indeed arrested .
They have been charged – in the world ’s largest democracy , with a constitution supposedly guaranteeing a right to free speech – with “ deliberately acting with malicious intent to outrage religious feelings ” .
I am told I too will be arrested if I go to Calcutta .
Once again , religious lunatics and terrorists have hijacked the marketplace of ideas and twisted the universal right of free speech into a right , possessed exclusively by themselves , to never be offended .
They demand legal protection from ever having to see or hear anything they disagree with , and because they ’re always willing to resort to violence if their demands are n’t met , even supposedly liberal , democratic governments give in to them with depressing frequency .
The de facto result is the censorship and suppression of freethinkers .
Meanwhile , we who are outraged by their vicious and savage creeds seemingly have no right to call upon the government to imprison them .
In a follow - up essay as brilliant as the first , Hari refuses to apologize , and slices swiftly through the flimsy excuses offered by these tyrants and their apologists :
These events are also a reminder of why it is so important to try to let the oxygen of rationality into religious debates – and introduce doubt .
Voltaire – one of the great anti-clericalists – said : “ Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities . ”
If you can be made to believe the absurd notion that an invisible deity dictated The Eternal Unchanging Truth to a specific person at a specific time in history and anyone who questions this is Evil , then you can easily be made to demand the death of journalists and free women and homosexuals who question that Truth .
But if they have a moment of doubt – if there is a single nagging question at the back of their minds – then they are more likely to hesitate .
That ’s why these ideas must be challenged at their core , using words and reason .
… Yes , if we speak out now , there will be turbulence and threats , and some people may get hurt .
But if we fall silent – if we leave the basic human values of free speech , feminism and gay rights undefended in the face of violent religious mobs – then many , many more people will be hurt in the long term .
Today , we have to use our right to criticise religion – or lose it .
Amen and hallelujah !
We need many more brave freethinkers like Hari – we need a thousand modern - day Voltaires willing to strike back against the evil tyranny of religious extremists , from Islam or from any other religion .
If the Indian government arrests one publisher for printing essays like this , we need a thousand more who are willing to reprint them .
We need to disseminate these ideas and criticisms into every corner of society , to shine a light on the barbarism of theocracy and call it what it is .
Words alone may seem a small thing against the darkness and savagery of fundamentalists – but the fundamentalists themselves must be afraid of them , for why else would they lash out with such fury ?
If free speech is circumscribed by the “ right ” of religious groups to be protected from offense , then it is an empty and meaningless freedom .
Any religious sect can stifle any speech , just by taking offense at what is said .
We as a species can never make moral progress if those laws shelter evil superstitions from the light of scrutiny and let them fester in the shadows .
That ’s why , law or no law , we freethinkers must speak out !
Letting fundamentalists and fanatics control the terms of the debate is a road that leads directly back to the dark ages .
If we ’re to take the high road that leads to a brighter and better future , we must never hesitate to name evil and unreason what they are , and never permit ourselves to be daunted or cowed .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Wall Street bank executives squirmed under a public scolding in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday over how they used $ 176 billion in bailout money without noticeably improving the battered economy .
“ America does n’t trust you anymore , ” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Michael Capuano told eight bank CEOs during a congressional hearing on the troubled bank bailout plan .
Lawmakers ’ remarks reflected public outrage over the economic crisis but the tone was more civil than the grilling last week by many of the same lawmakers of securities regulators over Bernard Madoff ’s alleged $ 50 billion fraud .
They demanded to know what the banks have done with the bailout money , given an ongoing credit crisis that has added to the country ’s deteriorating economy .
The CEOs , representing the titans of the once seemingly invincible capitalist society , argued that they had responsibly used billions in taxpayer dollars to increase lending , not to pay executives , lobbyists or shareholder dividends .
They all said they had received 2008 salaries ranging from $ 600,000 to $ 1.5 million and had not received bonuses .
All but one reported that their companies own or leased airplanes , prompting California Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman to advise them to give up the expensive aircraft .
“ You could sell them , ” he said .
Prodded by New York Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks on whether Americans deserved an apology for lax loan standards that fueled the now - collapsed debt bubble , only Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack spoke up .
“ I think the entire industry bears responsibility , and I ’m sorry for it , ” Mack said .
CONTRITE ENOUGH ?
More so than other lawmakers , Capuano expressed frustration .
“ You come to us today on your bicycles after buying Girl Scout cookies and helping out Mother Theresa and telling us , ‘ We ’re sorry , we did n’t mean it , we wo n’t do it again , trust us . ’
Well , I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks and they say the same thing , ” he said .
The CEO ’s struck a contrite tone , politely answering pointed questions with corporate aplomb .
“ I feel more like corporal of the universe , not captain of the universe at this moment , ” Ken Lewis , CEO of Bank of America , as he came under intense questioning from California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters .
Outside the House office building where the hearing took place , about a dozen protesters taunted Lewis .
“ Hey , Ken Lewis feel our pain , ” they chanted .
Wednesday ’s hearing came a day after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner failed to inspire market confidence over the government ’s financial bailout plans and sent stocks tumbling .
Democratic Rep. Barney Frank , chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee , opened the proceedings by telling the CEOs they needed to understand Americans ’ anger and frustration and cooperate with lawmakers willingly , “ not grudgingly , not doing the minimum . ”

New York Democratic Rep. Gary Ackerman said that in “ the real world , ’ people can not get loans to buy cars or homes or send children to college .
“ It seems to me and some of us that this money has n’t reached the street , that you have n’t loaned it out , ” he said .
Democratic Rep. Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania was equally baffled , telling the executives that if their banks did not use the money , “ Please find a way to return that money before you leave town . ”
South Carolina Republican Rep. Gresham Barrett said his constituents “ simply have not seen the evidence that the money you were given is working or making their lives better . ”

BONUS IRE
The CEOs reported they had forsworn bonuses for now .
“ I ’ve told my board of directors that my salary should be $ 1 per year with no bonus until we return to profitability , ” said Vikram Pandit of Citigroup Inc .
But Frank demanded why they needed bonuses at all when a good salary would do .
New York state officials say financial companies doled out $ 18.4 billion in bonuses last year .
“ At your level , why do you need bonuses ? ” Frank asked .
“ This notion that you need some special incentive to do the right thing troubles people . ”
“ It ’s complicated , ” Mack replied , citing the risks involved , the global nature of the banking business and the size of the companies .
“ If you gave me no bonus for the best year , I ’d still be here . ”
The executives also said they are embracing some of the reforms proposed for the badly crippled U.S. financial system .
Jamie Dimon , head of JPMorgan Chase & Co , said he is endorsing a proposal to create a systemic risk regulator to help oversee U.S. markets .
“ This would allow us to begin to address some of the underlying weaknesses in our system and fill the gaps in regulation that contributed to the current situation , ” he said .
“ We stand ready to work with you on the range of issues confronting the financial services sector and our economy . ”
The United States ’ economy , already in recession for a year , is facing its worst crisis in generations as banks struggle to absorb losses and resume lending .
“ It is abundantly clear that we are here amidst broad public anger at our industry , ” said Lloyd Blankfein , CEO of Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
Others testifying included Robert Kelly of Bank of New York Mellon Corp , Ronald Logue of State Street Corp and John Stumpf of Wells Fargo & Co .
JOBLESS AND TAXES JOBLESS AND TAXES Percentage of families receiving unemployment benefits that owed taxes on their benefits in 2005 : Income Affected by taxation Less than $ 10,000 11 % $ 10,000 - $ 15,000 40 % $ 15,000 - $ 20,000 47 % $ 20,000 - $ 25,000 54 % $ 25,000 - $ 30,000 57 % $ 30,000 - $ 40,000 70 % $ 40,000 - $ 50,000 84 % $ 50,000 - $ 100,000 95 % All 66 % Source : Congressional Research Service
These days , most workers would welcome even a small increase in their paychecks .
Still , a $ 400 tax credit probably is n't going to cause a lot of cash - strapped families to do a happy dance around the kitchen table .
Most workers will end up with an extra $ 8 a week .
But the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , which President Obama is expected to sign Tuesday , contains numerous provisions that could save you much more than that , depending on your circumstances .
Here 's a closer look at who stands to gain from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act : IN THE NEWS :
How will the $ 787 billion stimulus package affect you ?
• First - time home buyers .
First - time home buyers are eligible for an $ 8,000 tax credit .
And unlike the $ 7,500 credit enacted last year , this one does n't have to be repaid , unless you sell your home within three years .
The credit is available to taxpayers who buy a primary residence between Jan. 1 and Dec. 1 , 2009 .
The credit phases out for taxpayers whose AGI exceeds $ 75,000 , or $ 150,000 for married couples .
• New car buyers .
Purchasers of new cars and trucks will be allowed to deduct sales or excise taxes .
This is an above - the - line deduction , so you do n't have to itemize to claim it .
The deduction is limited to sales tax on purchases of up to $ 49,500 .
The deduction phases out for single taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $ 125,000 , and married taxpayers whose AGI exceeds $ 250,000 .
The amount you save will depend on your state sales tax rate and the price of your car or truck .
If your state imposes a 4 % sales tax and your car costs $ 40,000 , the deduction will reduce your adjusted gross income by $ 1,600 , says tax publisher CCH .
The deduction is limited to car and truck purchases made between the date the bill becomes law and Dec. 31 , says Tom Ochsenschlager , vice president of taxation for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants .
Congress " is trying to get people to buy cars right away , " he says .
The bill also expands a tax break for people who take public transit to work .
The bill allows employees to set aside up to $ 230 a month in pretax dollars to cover the cost of a bus , train or van pool , up from $ 120 .
Employees were already allowed to set aside up to $ 230 a month for parking .
If the employer subsidizes public transportation , employees can receive up to $ 230 a month without paying taxes on the benefit .
• Parents of college - bound students .
The bill contains a more generous tax credit for higher education than the existing Hope college credit .
Parents will be allowed to claim a tax credit of up to $ 2,500 a year to cover higher - education expenses .
The income phaseouts are also higher than those for existing higher - education tax credits .
Single filers with AGI of up to $ 80,000 can claim the full credit .
Married couples can have AGI of up to $ 160,000 and claim the full amount .
In calculating expenses that count toward the credit , parents and independent students can also include the cost of textbooks and other course materials .
That change could benefit students who attend community colleges or other schools with modest tuition rates , says Mark Luscombe , tax analyst for CCH .
Including textbooks will increase the amount of the tax credit these students can claim , he says .
• Unemployed workers .
If you 're not drawing a paycheck , you 're probably not worrying much about taxes .
But that mindset can get you in trouble , because unemployment benefits are taxable .
This stimulus package excludes the first $ 2,400 in unemployment benefits from taxes in 2009 .
Most jobless workers do n't have taxes withheld from their unemployment checks , so this wo n't provide an immediate increase in their income .
The change will , however , mean they wo n't have to scramble to come up with the money when they file their 2009 taxes .
The stimulus package could also make it easier for some unemployed Americans to continue their former employer 's health insurance coverage .
The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act , or COBRA , lets laid - off employees continue their former employer 's coverage for up to 18 months .
In the past , though , they were required to pay 102 % of the premiums .
The stimulus bill will subsidize 65 % of COBRA premiums for up to nine months .
The subsidy is limited to workers who were laid off between Sept. 1 , 2008 , and the end of this year .

If you run a lot of terminal tabs or scripts that all need to make OpenSSH connections to the same server , you can speed them all up with multiplexing : making the first one act as the master and letting the others share its TCP connection to the server .
If you do n't already have a config file in the .ssh directory in your home directory , create it with permissions 600 : readable and writeable only by you .
Then , add these lines :
Host * ControlMaster auto ControlPath ~/.ssh/ master-%r@%h : %p
ControlMaster auto tells ssh to try to start a master if none is running , or to use an existing master otherwise .
ControlPath is the location of a socket for the ssh processes to communicate among themselves .
The %r , %h and %p are replaced with your user name , the host to which you 're connecting and the port number — only ssh sessions from the same user to the same host on the same port can or should share a TCP connection , so each group of multiplexed ssh processes needs a separate socket .
To make sure it worked , start one ssh session and keep it running .
Then , in another window , open another connection with the -v option :
~$ ssh -v example.com echo " hi "
And , instead of the long verbose messages of a normal ssh session , you 'll see a few lines , ending
with :
debug1 : auto-mux : Trying existing master hi
Pretty fast .
If you have to connect to an old ssh implementation that does n't support multiplexed connections , you can make a separate Host section :
Host antique.example.com ControlMaster no
The GNOME desktop environment 's Epiphany Web browser has gained support for developing extensions with JavaScript .
This feature was implemented by integrating Seed , a new framework that leverages GObject - introspection to provide JavaScript bindings for the GTK + toolkit .
I wrote about Seed last month in a hands - on tutorial that demonstrated how to build a simple Twitter search tool with JavaScript .
Seed has continued to improve and is becoming more robust .
Version 0.5 includes many bug fixes and reduces the memory footprint for some applications .
Some new code examples have been added to the version control system , including some that demonstrate how to use the Clutter graphics library .
An improved version of my Twitter search client — with support for displaying profile images — is also included in the examples directory .
The examples ( and also the unit tests ) are a great place to start if you want to learn more about using Seed for your own applications .
One of the most intriguing potential uses for Seed is as an embedded scripting engine for facilitating application plugin development .
The first application to achieve Seed extension support is the Epiphany Web browser .
The feature landed in a recent revision and can be tested by compiling Epiphany from trunk with the - - enable - seed parameter .
Lead Seed developer Robert Carr wrote a blog entry on Sunday that explains how the Epiphany extension system works .
Scripts can hook into tab and window objects , manipulate the user interface , and bind functions to various events .
GObject - introspection made it easy for the developers to expose the Epiphany API through JavaScript so that it can be used by extension writers .
The scripts , and simple config files that include extension metadata , are placed in ~/.gnome2/ epiphany / extensions .
He has published a few sample extensions to help developers get started .
This kind of scripting capability has the potential to bring enormous advantages to applications .
It can be used for extensive user customization , rapid prototyping of new features , automated application testing , and a wide range of other uses .
The value of Seed is clearly being recognized by the GNOME developer community and it's possible that we could see it in other applications in the future .
California is on the brink of financial collapse .
Jennifer Steinhauer writes for The New York Times ,
The state , nearly out of cash , has laid off scores of workers and put hundreds more on unpaid furloughs .
It has stopped paying counties and issuing income tax refunds and halted thousands of infrastructure projects .
This crisis has many causes , but addressing it has been rendered nearly impossible by Republicans in the state legislature who block any form of tax increase .
Hilzoy says ,
They need three ( 3 ) Republican votes in each house .
They ca n’t get them .
And this despite the fact that the Republicans who have been negotiating have gotten a lot , including , according to the LATimes , “ tax breaks for corporations ” .
Really .
I am not making this up .
With the state budget $ 41 billion in deficit , Republicans held out for corporate tax cuts , and then are n’t even supporting the resulting bill .
Stopping building projects is costing Californians millions of dollars .
Borrowing money to keep the government going is going to cost Californians millions of dollars .
As the stimulus bill becomes law today , we learn that a number of Republican governors are lining up to support it .
It may be too little , too late for California .
But a number of other states , both red and blue , may be pulled back from the brink of disaster by federal dollars — in no particular order , New York , Virginia , Iowa , Tennessee , Missouri , Ohio , etc. etc .
Add your state here .
States are in trouble for a lot of reasons , but an immediate one is the loss of revenue by retailers .
City and state budgets are breaking all over America .
Florida Governor Charlie Crist , a Republican , explains ,
â€ œIt really is a matter of perspective , â€  Mr. Crist said in an interview .
â€ œAs a governor , the pragmatism that you have to exercise because of the constitutional obligation to balance your budget is a very compelling pullâ€ generally .
With Florida facing a projected $ 5 billion shortfall in a $ 66 billion budget , and social costs rising , the stimulus package â€œhelps plug that hole , â€  Mr. Crist said , â€ œbut it also helps us meet the needs of the people in a very difficult economic time.â€ 
And it appears Americans on the whole are glad Congress came through .
So , who ’s not happy ?
Well , we know , do n’t we ?
As there were n’t enough Republicans in Washington to provide fodder for the story the New York Times wanted to write – they simply took it on the road to those Republicans Governors who also happen to be the ones most hat in hand when it comes to Federal dollars .
Yep , quite a “ conservative ” bunch this crew .
Or so the Times would have one believe . … …
How about if the Feds did n’t suck the money out of states to begin with only to wastefully plow it back in ?
If you are wondering how the feds are sucking money out of states , read the comments to the rightie blog post linked above .
They ’ve noticed that poor New Jersey only gets back 70 percent of what it sends to Congress .
Yes , and this is something I ’ve written about in the past .
The wealthier , more industrialized states ( nearly all of which are blue ) tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in federal dollars .
Poorer , less industrialized states ( nearly all of which are red ) pay less in federal taxes than they receive in federal dollars .
In other words , for many years blue states have been carrying the load for red states that wo n’t pay for their own messes .
Now , if the conservatives who run the poor red states want to be real conservatives and stop grabbing money out of the hands of New Jersey taxpayers , I would n’t object .
Let the freeloaders in Mississippi pay their own bleeping taxes , heh ?
Of course , in the real world what would happen is that there would be a belt of states sunken into Third World style poverty by their idiot GOP state government , and this belt would stretch across the southeastern U.S. and reach up to the more rural western states .
And in the long run it would hurt the U.S. as a whole more than it would help .
Right - wing economic “ theory ” is destroying America .
It ’s doing a bigger job on us that al Qaeda could ever have dreamed .

( CNN ) -- Iceland 's ruling coalition resigned Monday , three months after the collapse of the country 's currency , stock market and several major banks , and following months of public protests , Kristjan Kristjansson , a spokesman for the prime minister told CNN .
Anti-government protesters in Reykjavik celebrate the resignations .
President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson officially accepted Prime Minister Geir Haarde 's resignation but asked him and other Cabinet members to continue in an interim capacity until a new government can be formed .
It was not immediately clear when that might happen , but last week Haarde -- citing illness -- said he would not seek re-election .
Monday 's developments followed weeks of demonstrations in the streets , and a weekend of meetings in government chambers as the two parties in Iceland 's governing coalition grappled with the financial collapse and its aftermath .
About 6,000 to 7,000 people demonstrated on Saturday calling for the government to step down .
Watch iReport of Saturday demonstration
Protests have been staged regularly since the collapse , but Saturday 's was one of the biggest to date , Kristjansson said .
Saturday 's demonstration was peaceful , he said , but riot police intervened during protests earlier in the week , using pepper spray and arresting some demonstrators .
Haarde announced Friday that he has a malignant tumor on his esophagus and would not run for re-election as chair of the Independence Party .
Senior government officials from the two parties that make up Iceland 's coalition government -- the Independence Party and the Social Democrats -- met Sunday to discuss the government 's future after the commerce minister resigned .
The minister , Bjorgvin Sigurdsson , said the government had failed to restore confidence in the three months since the financial crisis began in October .
In his resignation letter to the prime minister , Sigurdsson said he was taking his share of responsibility for the economic situation in Iceland .
But he also said that there were many more who shared responsibility , Urdur Gunnarsdottir , spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , told CNN .
No other officials were named .
Before resigning , Sigurdsson dismissed the head of the country 's financial supervisory authority , and he requested that the entire board of the agency resign .
The president will next meet with the leaders of Iceland 's political parties to find out what type of government they think should be formed .
Grimsson will then give the task of forming a new government to whichever party he feels best suited to do that .
The chosen party will then try to form a new coalition government .
If unsuccessful , the president will give the task to another party .
If all attempts of forming a new government failed , the president would call for new elections , Kristjansson told CNN .
Iceland 's financial system and currency collapsed in October after a series of bank failures , prompting the International Monetary Fund to intervene .
Iceland sought IMF help after its government was forced to nationalize three banks to head off a complete collapse of its financial system .
Trading on the country 's stock market was suspended for nearly a week , and inflation jumped to more than 12 percent .
The IMF announced in November it would pump about $ 827 million into the Icelandic economy immediately , with another $ 1.3 billion coming in eight installments .
Iceland 's Nordic neighbors -- the governments of Finland , Norway , Denmark and Sweden -- announced they would lend Iceland another $ 2.5 billion .
CNN 's Per Nyberg in London contributed to this report .

Slipping below the radar ( or under the short - term memory cap ) , the Democrats have already leaked a gun-ban list , even under the Bush administration when they knew full well it had no chance of passage ( HR 1022 , 110th Congress ) .
It serves as a framework for the new list the Bradys plan to introduce shortly .
I have an outline of the Brady 's current plans and targets of opportunity , I 'm working on getting that news out asap after these ban lists , probably be ready in the next few days .
It 's horrific .
They ’re going after the courts , regulatory agencies , firearms dealers and statutes in an all out effort to restrict we the people .
They 've made little mention of criminals .
Now more than ever , attention to the entire Bill of Rights is critical .
Gun bans will impact our freedoms under search and seizure , due process , confiscated property , states rights , free speech , right to assemble and more , in addition to the Second Amendment .
The Democrats ' current gun-ban - list proposal ( final list will be worse ) :
Rifles ( or copies or duplicates ) :
M1 Carbine , Sturm Ruger Mini-14 , AR - 15 , Bushmaster XM15 , Armalite M15 , AR - 10 , Thompson 1927 , Thompson M1 ;
AK , AKM , AKS , AK - 47 , AK - 74 , ARM , MAK90 , NHM 90 , NHM 91 , SA 85 , SA 93 , VEPR ;
Olympic Arms PCR ; AR70 , Calico Liberty , Dragunov SVD Sniper Rifle or Dragunov SVU , Fabrique National FN / FAL , FN / LAR , or FNC , Hi-Point Carbine , HK - 91 , HK - 93 , HK - 94 , HK - PSG - 1 , Thompson 1927 Commando , Kel - Tec Sub Rifle ;
Saiga , SAR - 8 , SAR - 4800 , SKS with detachable magazine , SLG 95 , SLR 95 or 96 , Steyr AU , Tavor , Uzi , Galil and Uzi Sporter , Galil Sporter , or Galil Sniper Rifle ( Galatz ) .
Pistols ( or copies or duplicates ) :
Calico M-110 , MAC - 10 , MAC - 11 , or MPA3 , Olympic Arms OA , TEC-9 , TEC - DC9 , TEC - 22 Scorpion , or AB - 10 , Uzi .
Shotguns ( or copies or duplicates ) :
Armscor 30 BG , SPAS 12 or LAW 12 , Striker 12 , Streetsweeper .
Catch - all category ( for anything missed or new designs ) :
A semiautomatic rifle that accepts a detachable magazine and has ( i ) a folding or telescoping stock , ( ii ) a threaded barrel , ( iii ) a pistol grip ( which includes ANYTHING that can serve as a grip , see below ) , ( iv ) a forward grip ; or a barrel shroud .
Any semiautomatic rifle with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds ( except tubular magazine .22 rimfire rifles ) .
A semiautomatic pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine , and has ( i ) a second pistol grip , ( ii ) a threaded barrel , ( iii ) a barrel shroud or ( iv ) can accept a detachable magazine outside of the pistol grip , and ( v ) a semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds .
A semiautomatic shotgun with ( i ) a folding or telescoping stock , ( ii ) a pistol grip ( see definition below ) , ( iii ) the ability to accept a detachable magazine or a fixed magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds , and ( iv ) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder .
Frames or receivers for the above are included , along with conversion kits .
Attorney General gets carte blanche to ban guns at will :
Under the proposal , the U.S. Attorney General can add any " semiautomatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military or law enforcement use , or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm , that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes , as determined by the Attorney General . "
Note that Obama 's pick for this office ( Eric Holder , confirmation hearing set for Jan. 15 ) wrote a brief in the Heller case supporting the position that you have no right to have a working firearm in your own home .
In making this determination , the bill says , " there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a firearm procured for use by the United States military or any federal law enforcement agency is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes , and a firearm shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event . "
In plain English this means that ANY firearm ever obtained by federal officers or the military is not suitable for the public .
That presumption can be challenged only by suing the federal government over each firearm it decides to ban , in a court it runs with a judge it pays .
This virtually dismisses the principles of the Second Amendment .
The last part is particularly clever , stating that a firearm does n’t have a sporting purpose just because it can be used for sporting purpose -- is that devious or what ?
And of course , " sporting purpose " is a rights infringement with no constitutional or historical support whatsoever , invented by domestic enemies of the right to keep and bear arms to further their cause of disarming the innocent .
If these near - total bans are n't enough , the most dangerous part may be the phrase " pistol grip " because : " The term ' pistol grip ' means a grip , a thumbhole stock , or any other characteristic that can function as a grip . "
In other words , any semi-auto long gun with a grip ( that 's ALL semi-auto long guns ) would be banned under the existing proposal .
It 's not clear what they hope to achieve by deceptively banning guns with grips instead of just calling to ban the guns -- even an idjit can tell it 's the same thing .
I did n't cover here all the magazine bans , transfer bans , dealer record - keeping and centralized reporting , and a host of nuisance details -- there will be time enough for that when the new lists are released soon : " As soon as President - elect Obama is inaugurated and the 111th Congress is sworn in , " according to Ms. Brady .
Congress is set to be sworn in on Jan. 6 , Inauguration Day is Jan. 20 .
No one expects the new proposal to be less abusive than the current one supported by the party of the Democrats .
Remember -- these bans were proposed when the congressional anti-rights crowd had no chance of success .
Now they are ready to run wild , or according to Sarah herself , " I have never been so confident . "
The " news " media has failed to report on any of this , preferring instead to blare that the incoming president supports the Second Amendment and commonsense ( sic ) laws .
To see the whole bill , go to http://thomas.loc.gov and search for HR 1022 , ( switch to the 110th Congress if the 111th has begun ) .
The excellent Firearms Coalition started by the late Neal Knox and now run by his family members makes these important points about the upcoming Judiciary hearings for AG nominee Holder :
" The Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee are all sworn enemies to the Second Amendment and are unlikely to be swayed at all by any firearms related arguments , but might hesitate to confirm based on Holder ’s participation in the pardons of 16 Puerto Rican terrorists and billionaire financier and arms merchant Marc Rich [ and perhaps the Elian Gonzalez abduction by federal agents Holder authorized ] .
Any letters to Democrats should focus on those issues .
" On the Republican side , Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the committee has never been a friend to gun rights , but he owes his reelection to NRA support and has expressed concern over the pardon issues .
Among the other Republicans , most are relatively reliable votes , but only Coburn has routinely taken a leadership role on Second Amendment matters .
All of them need to be pressed hard to do everything they can to block the appointment .

David Plouffe , it was announced today , will be " leading a campaign " for ride - sharing juggernaut Uber to convince lawmakers of its legality .
Originally published in the March 2009 issue , here 's Plouffe just after the biggest moment in his career .
When you have been to the moon , you can't come back to Earth and stand in line at Starbucks .
You can't order a coffee , and pay for it , and drink it beside someone wearing Sarah Palin glasses and a cruise visor .
The regression to mediocrity is stunning and sapping .
You would die inside .
After de-mooning , Buzz Aldrin got depressed and divorced .
He drank and he returned to the Air Force .
But the Air Force does n't fly to the moon ; it 's glad to clear the clouds .
Campaign consultant Paul Begala landed Bill Clinton the most powerful job on the ground .
That 's a moon trip , too .
Once , Begala sent Buzz Aldrin a fan letter .
What Begala wondered — because it 's the same question that bedevils the people who get other people elected president — is what you do after you come back down .
What in the world do you do now ?
" Buzz was the second man on the moon , and the guy comes back and he can't get out of bed in the morning , " says Begala .
" What the fuck do you do after you get on the moon ?
What the fuck do you do ? "
There is a picture of large - eared David Plouffe in his college newspaper .
It 's 1988 at the University of Delaware , and there 's a story on the student who , two decades later , would design a black man 's winning campaign for president that at its most linear was described by its opposition as " perfect . "
At its most cultish , it was " breathtaking , " " golden , " " justice . "
The seven - hundred - word article is about beer pong .
Plouffe and his college roommate were prolific .
" For two years , " says Barack Obama 's campaign manager , " that 's all we did . "
Classes , he was n't that into them .
He never graduated .
Today Plouffe , forty - one , is wearing a bargain - colored henley shirt and smiling into his grouper sandwich .
It 's a cold day in early December in Washington , D. C. , and Plouffe 's face has a windburned clean to it .
Life has become the whirlwind that happens when you have publicly done something very good , or bad .
His mouth becomes a cartoon shape when he smiles , a sunny crescent .
" You have to use a paddle , or you can use a saucepan , but where do you think the word pong comes from ?
It 's not just about the ball , " he says .
In fact , if you think it 's just about the ball , you 're missing most of the game .
An old college buddy says that Plouffe was far more skilled at the hanging out and drinking than at the game .
He also loved Roger Clemens and the Democratic party .
Originally from Wilmington , he cleaned chimneys and sold knives during college summers .
This is not the sort of man who looks as if he 's good at asking for money .
He 's calm and has a pent - up grin .
He says " Listen " a lot .
It 's moderately jarring .
It makes you think that what he 's about to say is essential , so come closer .
" Listen . "
But really it 's only a blinking cursor , a half beat of an inflection .
You might describe this shy middleman by not describing him .
He has a widow 's peak , which today has been gelled into rigid formation , and the teeth of a man who has never smoked a cigarette .
He 's small and lean and always seems to be folded into a gesture of lanky politeness , arms crossed , and legs .
He wears T - shirts under his button - down shirts , like the small boys in high school did to feign bulk with cotton .
On his first appearance on Fox News Sunday , he swallowed hard in between answers .
He looked thirsty .
He is a modest champion , puppy - loyal , and wholly inoffensive .
His friends and colleagues , both in and outside the party , unfailingly call him brilliant and kind and inspiring and inspired .
" If he wanted to go invent cold fusion , he 'd figure out a way to do it , " says Jim Messina , who ran the campaign 's budget and is now deputy chief of staff to Obama .
Others suggest that General Motors , bleeding America in Detroit , could clot the hemorrhage by popping Plouffe in as CEO .
Here at this lunch table , David Plouffe is soft - spoken , and he is quick .
He is nice to the waitress , but she is barely there , invisible on his radar , and the clang of the dishes and the laughter of lunchtime are inaudible .
He keenly concentrates on describing his strategy .
He is focused , meditative .
He is yours for this hour , because this is what he has allotted .
He is exact , and he is frank .
But also , David Plouffe is very quiet .
No , not quiet , because quiet is n't strong enough .
Try reticent .
David Plouffe is preternaturally reticent .
Some might even say secretive .
" He is such a guarded person , intensely private , " says David Axelrod , Plouffe 's partner and Obama 's campaign strategist and now senior advisor .
" The one thing I would say , if he ever invites you to a friendly game of poker , you should n't go .
You never know what 's going on in his head .
. . .
He 's got eyes that are like headlights , and you know that he 's taking in everything that he 's seeing . "
These are the qualities — the poker face and the hush , in the service of his also - quiet master — that helped him make winning Barack Obama the presidency look not just easy but preordained .
Yes , there was some luck to it .
A once - in - a - lifetime candidate , a fast - unspooling economy , a low point for national self - esteem , an opponent who , aside from a brief moment over the summer , was all but inept .
But still , it takes impossible talent to make it look so easy .
It takes genius and discipline .
A campaign - season 's worth of silence .
But David Plouffe has something else now .
Something that Aldrin lacked , something that eluded Begala and Carville and Atwater and even Karl Rove , who rode his success into the White House .
A magic beanstalk that will keep you on the moon , even while you 're back down at Starbucks .
David Plouffe has a list .
It was Plouffe ( rhymes with bluff ) who gathered the president 's unprecedented thirteen - million - name contact list , which has grown into a fulsome pulsing beast , and it is Plouffe who now owns it and keeps it under lock and key .
Plouffe sent those thirteen million people an e-mail in mid-November and they replied , Yes , I still want to be involved , and yes , David Plouffe , I 'll have house parties when you tell me to .
Here is who I am socioeconomically and socially .
I am boxers ; my next - door neighbor is briefs .
Now the president has instructed him to make that list a new lever of government .
No president has ever entered office with this much information .
The closest thing to it , Begala says , were direct - mail lists like Ronald Reagan 's back in 1980 .
But , he says , " it 's a different thing than Reagan writing , ' Send me thirty - five bucks if you want to fight the Commies . ' "
This list is granular .
And it is flexible and transferable to myriad media outlets — even those not yet invented .
Begala believes it could potentially " revolutionize progressive politics . "
The idea is a national operation , likely named Organizing for America , that will resemble Obama 's grassroots operation in reach and love .
It will be as finely tuned as the campaign behemoth and funded the same way — no money from third parties .
If Obama has a policy initiative he wants to push , or a message he needs to disseminate , or a gaffe he wants to bat down , he will call David Plouffe and Plouffe will unleash the many - million - mouthed dog , just as he did all across America for these past two years .
If you believe in Obama and in the need for change and for a new , streamlined , hyperlinked Democratic party , then this is a watershed idea .
It is a mechanism that could truly morph the power structure in Washington — waking up the unused , overslept public , as Plouffe successfully did on the campaign , and making an end run around lobbyists and interest groups .
But if you are part of the Old Guard — part of the pre-Obama DNC or a liberal interest group like the Center for American Progress or labor or the environmental lobby — which has spent years trying to figure out a way to rouse and organize the Democratic machine , then this new initiative might give you pause .
Because if Plouffe runs it like he ran the campaign , unless you join the ticket and stay on message , you will be left on the bench , asking Sarah Palin for a light .
It is a new Democratic take on the old Bush maxim : Either you will be with Organizing for America , or you will be against it .
" The outside groups are worried about being bulldozed , " says one well - placed Democratic source .
" The question is , is this shortsighted on behalf of Team Obama ?
This is the strategy they adopted during their campaign , which was no independent expenditures , no 527's , no outside groups .
They would be command central on messaging .
And it was a strategy that paid off . . . [ because ] everything went Obama 's way .
You can't count on that going forward . "
The fear is that the Obama machine will ignore any groups or messages not in sync with the administration .
Or worse , that if for some reason Organizing for America falters , there will be a vacuum .
Perhaps it 's a silly fear .
Misplaced .
I mean , just look at David Plouffe sitting there , courteously sipping his Diet Coke from a straw , talking about the right way to get a small white ball into a red cup .
He just got Barack Obama elected president .
You can trust David Plouffe .
The president sure as hell does .
President Obama is in Hawaii .
It 's a few weeks before he 's sworn in , and he is taking time from his family to confirm that Plouffe was not mostly lucky in getting him elected .
" I do n't buy it , " he says .
" If you just look at the mechanics of our campaign , how we raised money , how we turned out votes , how we managed the caucus process — all these pieces were incredibly complex , and we had to build it from scratch .
. . .
I 'm not sure there 's anybody [ else ] who could have done it . "
An aide has just said that this is one of the only interviews the president has allowed during his last vacation before taking office .
He would n't do this , they say , for anyone but David Plouffe .
This is why .
People love other people when they are behind the scenes and precisely brilliant there .
" David is a very unassuming guy , " says the president .
" He 's not flashy .
He 's not loud .
He does n't wear his brilliance on his sleeve .
He 's not trying to impress people .
But what I think people miss with David is how tough he is — somebody who 's very confident about what he knows , and he's able to stand his ground when he thinks he 's right . "
Fellow golden boy Axelrod was the professorial message .
The Socratic dude with the uncombed hair and the rambling intelligence who oversaw the sound and the vision , what Obama stood for and how he presented himself .
He was the David you knew , the one who pointed to the name on the side of the rocket and pointed to it again and read it to you backward .
Together the two winning Davids sit at a postelection symposium at Harvard in early December .
Here , the brains behind the McCain and Obama campaigns are gathered before an audience of bright kids so that the future may learn from the past .
They reconstruct what they did right while the losing side — McCain campaign manager Rick Davis and pollster Bill McInturff — defend what they did wrong to a crowd who cares only to hear from the winners .
Onstage Axelrod preens in tweed .
In the bright lights , he says the presidential election is an MRI for the soul .
He smiles when he uses the word nostrums .
Axelrod is the floppier David , who almost missed a plane because he forgot his briefcase at Joe Biden 's house , who got glazed doughnut stuck in his BlackBerry 's tracking ball .
Plouffe , meanwhile , sits boyishly .
He 's the meticulous David who charted the course for winning the electoral college from an unseen helm .
Plouffe would rather be with his map .
" I look at it on the computer all the time , " he says later .
" It 's kind of like my North Star .
They can never take that away from me .
I do n't think my wife would like it , but I 'd put that map up in every room of our house if I could . "
All day Plouffe chews carefully and entertains uninteresting bright - eyed questions .
In his pink tie , sandwiched between Axelrod and McCain manager Rick Davis , Plouffe looks the least like he wants to be there .
On the campaign , he had the reputation of hanging back in meetings and on conference calls , keeping silent unless he had something significant to say .
Spartan and purposeful .
You can see it here at one of the Harvard debates .
When the moderator says something about the gaucheness of the stage for Obama 's convention speech , Plouffe jumps in quietly but aggressively .
" It was n't that bad , " he says , and he does not smile and he uses the man 's name , throws it back at him , along with his question .
It 's his subtle justice .
Correcting missteps , protecting territory with a whisper and a light but certain shove .
It 's how Plouffe operated on the campaign .
If someone broke the hierarchy , if he disagreed with his supervisor and decided to take the matter straight to Plouffe , Plouffe would simply forward the e-mail back to the supervisor .
No comment .
No need .
Now get back in line .
Near the end of the day , on his way to the bathroom , he has n't walked five feet before he is webbed by the spindly arms of the political groupies , the shawled women law professors , and the puffy beat reporters , who piece together their meals from convention salads .
They stop him in his steady course , they grab his small elbow , Wait , wait , David Plouffe , David Plouffe .
Hi , do you know who I am ?
We worked together back in . . .
He slows , though he keeps his body in the direction it was going , so all he needs to do is turn his head a touch to deal with the interloper .
He smiles friendly as the baker , he lets his hand get lost in the folds of bodies .
No , he does n't know who you are , but he does remember working with you , because he 's a man who remembers everything .
He does n't like to do the smiling , hand - shaking , dead - eyed nodding , but he 'll do it .
It 's not what he was built for , but he does remember what it was like to knock on farm doors .
It was a grassroots fairy tale .
The notion of farmers in overalls standing in voter - registration lines , holding straw hats in callused hands .
It 's tangible and hardworking and Plouffe loves it : " You have this farmer who never voted Democrat in his life , and suddenly he says , ' Hey , know what , I never thought I 'd be voting for some black guy named Barack Obama from Chicago , but know what ?
I am . '
You ca n't put a price on that . "
Plouffe first met the farmers in the early nineties , when he would tool around Des Moines in his blue Dodge Colt with a cracked windshield .
He 'd been one of twenty - five guys whom field veteran Joe Hansen had hired to work on railroad heir Sam Beard 's Delaware senatorial bid , and in two weeks Plouffe became the boss of them all .
Hansen and Plouffe grew up there , in the sort of politics where you live off the land .
They saved pins and looseleaf , nicked paper clips from the dentist 's office .
Old ladies dripping red paint onto homemade yard signs .
" Plouffe outperformed everybody , by every metric , " says Hansen , a D. C. - based strategist and close friend who just came from breakfast at Plouffe 's place .
" In 1990 , when I moved back to Iowa and managed field organization for Tom Harkin 's [ reelection ] campaign , David got a job that was better than mine — so realize that in one cycle it went from me supervising him to him supervising me . "
Plouffe never returned to school to finish his final semester .
Instead and doggedly , he marked high - end territory across the nation , from facilitating an East Coast hard - nosed beat - down ( New Jersey in 1996 , where he managed Bob Torricelli 's victory over Dick Zimmer — which Plouffe proudly refers to as brass - knuckle time ) to Dick Gephardt 's deputy chief of staff job to the executive - director gig at the DCCC in 1999 , where he raised a record $ 95 million for House races .
A year later , he accepted a job with Axelrod 's consultancy firm ( which would become AKP&D Message and Media ) and went on to run Obama 's successful 2004 Senate campaign .
Finally , as campaign manager of Obama for America in early 2007 , Plouffe was charged with building an underdog campaign for president from virtually nothing — no money , one office , five staff members , and a few dreams from one 's father .
The main thing he knew was that there were no shortcuts .
His focus was on 270 , and every decision had to flow from there .
You had to get the job done .
He told Obama the same thing he told everyone who worked for him :
You have to be all in .
The president asked the manager , Are there shortcuts ?
And the manager said , No .
You get to work , and you stay there .
David Plouffe orders his lunch neatly .
He does not ask the waitress if his sandwich comes with fries or if his Diet Coke comes with lemon .
" Elections are all about numbers , " he says .
" You have to get a certain number of votes , delegates , you have to raise a certain amount of money , your strategy and budget have to be married to how many votes and delegates you 're trying to get . "
To get the numbers right , Plouffe broke down the country into sixteen separate campaigns — a different strategy for each battleground state — and gave each its own ground crew and press office .
His desk back in Chicago was the control center .
On the walls there were electoral maps in reds , blues , deeper blues .
But the helm and the center was the desk , a wood - laminate piece , neat and lap - topped and bolted to the floor .
Every morning he sat at that desk with a large to - do list that he parsed out to the to - doers .
He watched the scroll of e-mails — he says it was like a volcano , exploding in bold at the top .
" We 'd get the clips overnight , and I 'd read them all .
Hundreds of them .
That 's basically what it was like .
Wake up , reach for your BlackBerry , the way guys used to reach for their packs of cigarettes . "
He read everything and got on a call , then another , and another and another .
A rolling two - year conference call .
He looks tired when he tells you .
Because he came from a place where hard workers could barely afford the twenty - five - dollar donations they pushed across the hay bale , he immediately acquired the reputation of budget miser .
There was an Axelrodism that claimed that if you went to the bathroom , pulled out a paper towel , then went to pull out a second one , it would actually be a note that said , " See Plouffe . "
To find the voters and build a swarm of volunteers to help , he hired twenty - seven - year - old Joe Rospars and the rest of the former Howard Dean Web guys — now Blue State Digital — and made the most confident investment that a political campaign has ever made in the Internet .
He brought them up from the basements and into top - line meetings .
He told them , We have to beat Clinton .
She has the establishment support , she has this huge system of money - raisers , so we must create an alternative network .
Beside the gray walls and atop the gray pattern carpets , they enacted Plouffe 's vision .
These were futuristic people building small revolutions in a humdrum place .
They took the now - comparatively primitive Web-roots platform that Dean — along with his manager , Joe Trippi , and Web guru , Nicco Mele — first unearthed in 2003 and extended it .
There were more tools now .
YouTube .
Twitter .
More potential inputs .
They used them all and invented new ones .
Obama owned the Web because Plouffe believed in a few smart kids and let them go a little nuts .
But the meticulous managerial thing , according to the Blue State Digital guys , is that Plouffe still held those nuts in the palm of his careful hand .
Plouffe maintains there was no forerunner to this strategy , not really .
Not Dean or Trippi in terms of the Web , or Marshall Ganz , the famed Chavez farm - labor organizer turned Harvard professor , often ( erroneously , according to Plouffe ) cited as the brain behind the grassroots organization .
Because he never tries to convince you , you are more apt to believe him .
He says every situation was dynamic and that they got their plan from the people .
You talk to anyone who heard of David Plouffe before Election Day , and mostly it was because they got a few hundred e-mails from him , and they liked to see it as a personal thing .
On e-mail , he was chatty .
Conversationally , he asked for money .
The college kid who wired ten bucks of twelve - pack cash to Plouffe felt like he was saving the country with a few fast keystrokes and Dad's AmEx .
And yet Plouffe insists that to focus too much on the netroots is to overlook the pure fieldwork , which was essential to winning .
" You can't be too reliant on just technology in politics . . . knocking and phone calls is still the bread and butter . "
He smiles .
He likes the notion .
It 's how he started .
" It 'll be a long time before those new apps replace the old ones . "
The old application was a line of staffers and volunteers stretching down the fluorescent hall of Obama headquarters , past the great and daily newspaper wall in communications and out across America — each eager college kid , grandmother , and housewife , standing in their campaign T - shirt waiting for a " love note from David Plouffe , " in their words , so they might deploy their democratic energy .
He drew the most passionate , thousands of them , into two - or three - day Camp Obama training sessions .
Each team leader had his own job :
You are responsible for finding twenty volunteers .
You : fifty , a hundred , two hundred voters .
Call them .
Write the plan and then we 're going to track you .
Teams would report back with stats and the field directors would chart the cumulative info and they would know whether their " supervolunteers " were hitting their targets .
Plouffe , back at his desk , sat at the top of the pyramid , checking the checkers , glancing at the North Star on his wall , believing deeply in the prize , in the red , white , and blue of mostly blue .
" Do you realize that more than half those volunteers had never been involved in politics before ? "
David Plouffe is wide - eyed now , and leaning in .
" More than half . "
He emphasizes the final word to let the incredulity settle .
And then there is a moment — it 's almost imperceptible , and you almost wish you had n't noticed , because there is something agonizing about a private man showing public emotion .
But it happens .
His eyes tear up .
The soft - spoken , indefatigable general is talking about his troops and his eyes glisten .
Iowa , the grassroots effort , he says , rivaled election night .
Then quickly he shakes the chaff from his hair and recomposes .
Safely , he returns to his numbers .
This is the passion Plouffe rarely shows .
But from top - floor , eventful offices , people will gush about it .
The pep talks , for example .
" They would , at the end , make you wanna go run off a cliff with the guy .
He mixed a very hard edge with a sort of , I 'm imagining Barack Obama on Capitol Hill as the next leader . . . a sort of inspirational rhetoric , " says twenty - seven - year - old speechwriter Jon Favreau .
It was a centaur blend , the gruff , focused mug of the football coach and the graceful neck and confident purr of the golden orator .
The night they lost New Hampshire , Plouffe said to get everyone across the country on the phone .
In his uneventful and sure voice , he promised that he'd never been more confident and proud of everyone , and he ended it by saying : " Let 's go win this fucking thing . "
As much as he likes to inspire , he loves to win .
When Plouffe plays baseball , he is always the pitcher .
Like Roger Clemens , he is turned on by the hectic pulse of unmanageable jurisdiction , the notion of controlling a field with runners on every base .
The calm during the storm .
But the calm is only on the outside .
There is a deeper sense of competition and passion , and Plouffe takes it and he uses it , but he does n't show it , not even after the win .
Obama saw this in the lead - up to the Iowa caucus .
It 's when he realized he could trust Plouffe fully , and in the muck : " Plouffe was getting calls and e-mails all across the country , the newspaper reports saying that the campaign was over , and he was able to just keep us on a steady course and instill calm , and it showed me the kind of leader he could be in difficult times .
It 's always easy to be a campaign manager when things are going well , but when things are n't , that 's the real test .
He was , in his quiet way , able to maintain focus and confidence . "
" I'm a competitive person , " Plouffe says , without pride but forcefully .
His eyes and chin rise .
" Elections are nothing about doing well .
You win or lose , and I love to win , and it feels absolutely terrible when you lose .
We built something from scratch , " he continues , " and we beat Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
That 's like , uh , beating the L. A. Lakers and the Boston Celtics to win the championship . "
If he had lost , " I 'd have felt like I let the country down . "
To win the country , the manager took the risks .
" We always seemed to be better when we were up in the high water , " says Plouffe .
" Whenever we got safe , we stagnated .
We liked rolling the dice . "
This meant bleeding $ 25 million in North Carolina , $ 10 million in Indiana , $ 15 million in Virginia , just to keep McCain off balance .
It meant convincing Obama to move his convention speech outdoors , though Obama worried it might rain .
It meant convincing Obama to do a thirty - minute advertorial , even though Obama thought it was too risky so close to Election Day .
" Yes , it was high risk , " Plouffe says of the advertorial .
It 's hard to convince the man you work for to do something he 's unsure about .
Obama argued that the undecideds were already decided .
But Plouffe explained the statistics to him .
" Obama was not someone who understood numbers and states .
He was n't a political creature , " he says .
This was n't about undecided voters .
This was about the soft supporters who had recently swung .
" We have to hold them , " the manager told the candidate .
And the candidate relented .
Obama trusted Plouffe and Plouffe trusted himself , and Plouffe 's instinct was to look serene on the outside , while shrewdly gaming for angles within .
Yes , David Plouffe is a numbers genius and his round , blinking eyes dissected a country into a few rounds of Battleship , but he is more , even , than the man Obama calls his " most valuable player . "
He is Roger Clemens in the rain , down by two in the bottom half , stripping the ball hard and sure and a little to the left , knowing that even if this batter hits a homer , he will regroup and strike out the next twenty .
It is now early January .
There are Christmas trees on the curbs .
It 's cold and the end of a season and David Plouffe is in an airport .
He 's one of those men in the security line who has his shoes off ahead of time and in his hands , five people before he needs to .
He 's walking in thin black dress socks , and nobody knows he is important , only that he is not a pain in the ass .
David Plouffe is in an airport , three days after the president he got elected flew to Washington , D. C. , to take office .
But Plouffe is not going to Washington .
He 's leaving for a speaking engagement in Arizona .
It 's one of those things he 's been doing since he turned down Obama 's invitation to join the administration .
Obama pushed him , because , he says , " There is nobody I trust more . "
But Plouffe declined .
" He understood that I would need to spend some time on the outside , " says Plouffe .
" He also knew there was some value in having friends on the outside . "
For weeks , rumors of Obama 2.0 have been trickling out on the Internet .
The talk is of the next Obama - powered revolution .
Everyone in Washington knows that this slight man owns the e-mail addresses , but nobody is quite sure what he will do with them .
For the most part , he 's kept his head low and spent time with his family , his new daughter born two days after the election , and he has slowed down to half civilian .
There 's a book on the way about his campaign strategy , and he 's open to the possibility of corporate consulting .
He 's had dozens of offers .
But now , as the airplanes taxi outside , Plouffe starts to talk about another story .
A story about endless phone calls and meetings , some taken between diaper changes .
Plouffe could n't talk much about it , he says , because they were still working out the legal details .
And they needed to select who would be heading the DNC .
But Tim Kaine 's appointment became public three days ago , and so in a few weeks Plouffe will be sending out another one of his famous folksy e-mails and posting an announcement on YouTube , in which he 'll formally announce the new initiative .
Organizing for America , he says , was six weeks in the making .
In that time he spoke daily with Tim Kaine .
They studied how the Obama campaign machine functioned and read briefings on how it could be transformed into Obama 's governing machine .
Obama , he says , made clear that the mandate of Organizing for America was to push forward his agenda for change , not for reelection .
" I can assure you it is n't that way with Obama .
He sent that message out loud and clear , and I could not agree more strongly . "
The model they came up with will be an independent entity under the umbrella of the DNC , with a separate staff in Washington , its own structure and Web site , and field offices with technical staff and fieldworkers across the country .
Like the campaign operation .
Also like the campaign , Organizing for America wo n't accept any outside PAC or lobbyist money .
Instead , it will be funded solely from individual donors .
" Most of what this entity will be doing is building grassroots support for issues and politics , " says Plouffe .
" Let 's say there 's an energy effort , an energy plan , that the president and some of Congress would like to get passed .
People would get out there and talk to their neighbors and try to build support . "
Petitions , canvassing , phone calls , house parties .
David Plouffe will send out an e-mail or a video : America , we need your help .
The state field offices will go into action .
And the housewives will unsuckle themselves from Oprah and the college kids will put down their pong paddles , and together they will rise up and their voices will be heard .
The voice of David Plouffe rises now above the announcements and the suitcase wheels .
You can tell he believes this could be bigger than the campaign he just led , won , and loved .
This will be a direct link to the people who got Obama elected , a way to harness the grassroots power of thirteen million hopeful Americans who voted for change and have pledged to help Obama and Plouffe enact it .
Mitch Stewart , Obama 's Iowa caucus director , will serve as executive director , with Plouffe overseeing from afar with the freedom to come and go as he pleases .
But Plouffe will not be on the payroll .
He says they would n't pay him that much , anyway , plus he sees it as a way of passing the torch .
But also , " The DNC has a history of having people on contract , and our hope is that that tradition can come to an end . "
In other words , in the old DNC you could be a free agent , divide your time , come in as a pinch hitter .
Not anymore .
In the new DNC — in Organizing for America — you will work full - time for the DNC and Obama 's goals , or you will not work for them at all .
Unless , of course , you are the unpaid architect of the whole initiative .
Plouffe insists the initiative has nothing to do with reelection .
But by being part of the DNC , Organizing for America will be able to morph depending upon needs .
" Some people will want to help out in a Senate race in 2010 , " says Plouffe .
He means giving or asking for money on the Web site .
" We needed to have some entity to be allowed to have all range of possibility . "
Options .
David Plouffe , President Obama 's inside man on the outside , is giving the president options .
Of course , some people are scared of these options , especially if Plouffe and his team do indeed run Organizing for America in the same hyper - controlling way they ran the campaign .
To them , Obama 's talk of a " new politics " that excludes them — the very progressive advocacy groups they 've been building and nurturing since before David Plouffe cut his mullet — is a frightening affront .
They talk about an infamous finance - committee meeting last May , just as the long war with Hillary was winding down , when Obama 's national finance chair , Penny Pritzker , delivered a message :
Do not contribute to these groups .
The word was that anyone who works for or contributes to any independent - expenditure efforts could forget about working in an Obama administration .
Many such groups feared that Obama did n't have the stomach or the instinct to run a campaign against Republicans .
But they did .
They 'd spent years building their own machines and were ready to get in on the action with funding from some of the very people Pritzker was now admonishing .
And now the rookie and his Axelrod - and Plouffe - led posse was shutting them down .
Oh , were they pissed .
In the bars , they did n't hide it .
" It 's not the Democratic party anymore , " one highly placed Democrat said .
" It 's the Obama party . "
The president says one last thing about the manager before his handlers pull him off the phone .
He says he has no doubt of David Plouffe 's truth and faith , of his love of country .
Even over a crackly phone line the president sounds like hope distilled into something gluttonously drinkable , peach iced tea for a hot - day hangover .
David Plouffe does n't speak as eloquently as the president .
He does n't shine .
But he does believe .
What that belief can become remains to be seen .
The president 's impact and the manager 's execution , and the country 's will and work .
Even for Plouffe .
He 's the first to say that the real function and reach of Organizing for America wo n't be fully understood until it gets running .
Like the campaign , it is a living organism that will be ever - changing depending upon circumstance .
But the sketch is there .
And its potential impact could be utter and complete .
As for what happens if the money runs dry and the grassroots enthusiasm follows , or what becomes of all the old - line interest groups that have spent years working to mobilize progressive voters , or what happens if you have a Democratic message or pitch you want disseminated but without Obama 's approval — all that 's a bit unclear .
Listen , says Plouffe , quietly and forcefully .
Calm and competitive , wired together .
" My wildest hope is that the debate will move out of Washington " and onto the porches of America .
He says it with the earnest sincerity of the old patriotic ideal to which we float our flags .
He says it so you want to believe him .
And perhaps you should , because as quiet and reserved and calm as David Plouffe is , as many secrets as he seems to hold on to for himself alone , there is no doubting his conviction .
In Obama , in changing the way politics is conducted , in the potential to harness the power of the movement he built , and himself .
Somewhere , behind the face of a man who has never preened , you can be sure David Plouffe has already thought through the questions .
And he believes he has the answers .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Personal bankruptcy filings soared 40 percent in October and are expected to keep climbing as home values sink and individual debts balloon , the American Bankruptcy Institute ( ABI ) said on Tuesday .
U.S. dollar bills are displayed in Toronto March 26 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mark Blinch
U.S. consumers filed some 106,266 bankruptcies in October , up 40 percent from a year ago and up 20 percent from September .
“ We expect the numbers will continue to go up , ” said ABI Executive Director Samuel Gerdano .
“ It ’s the aftermath of the debt overhang that many households are facing , plus an inability to tap into home equity , which traditionally helped buttress home finances . ”
As consumers continue to struggle to pay their mortgages , car and credit card bills , the ABI predicted that filings this year are expected to rise to 1.1 million , a record since a stricter bankruptcy law took effect in late 2005 .
So far this year , consumers have filed more than 880,000 bankruptcy petitions , eclipsing 822,000 , the total for all of last year , the nonprofit education and research group said .
ABI used data from the National Bankruptcy Research Center in its report .
TOPPING 100,000
This is the first time that personal filings have topped 100,000 in a month since the U.S. Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection
Act took effect .
The law made it more difficult for an individual to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection , a filing that allows most debts to be forgiven .
Under the law , individuals must undergo a review to determine whether they have enough income to pay some portion of their debts .
Immediately after the act was passed , personal bankruptcy petitions dropped from about 2 million in 2005 to just 600,000 in 2006 .
The numbers include both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 filings .
Chapter 13 forces consumers to put some portion of their income toward debts .
Personal bankruptcies have been creeping higher since then , as consumers find themselves deeper in debt .
“ Things will only get worse , ” said Jack Williams , an ABI resident scholar .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China said on Sunday it had consistently respected the rules of the World Trade Organization and would work with the WTO on a suit lodged against it by the United States aimed at halting export subsidy programs .
The United States began legal action at the WTO on Friday to halt Chinese government subsidy programs to boost the sale of Chinese - branded goods around the world .
The subsidies benefit a wide range of Chinese industrial sectors , including household electronic appliances , textiles and apparel , a range of light manufacturing industries , agricultural and food products , metal and chemical products , medicines and health products , the U.S. Trade Representative ’s Office said .
The subsidies include cash grant rewards for exporting , preferential loans for exporters and payments to lower the cost of export credit insurance , the USTR said .
However , China ’s Commerce Ministry , in a short statement on its Website ( www.mofcom.gov.cn), said China respected the rules .
“ China has all along respected the rules of the WTO , and opposes trade protectionism , ” it paraphrased an unnamed official as saying .
“ China will deal with ( the suit ) in accordance with WTO rules . ”
The new case , which began with a formal request for dispute settlement consultations with China , comes just one month before the Bush administration leaves office on January 20 .
It will be up to the incoming administration of President - elect Barack Obama to decide whether to take the next step and request a dispute settlement panel , if the two sides can not negotiate a solution in the next 60 days .
The USTR action also came on the same day the White House announced a $ 17.4 billion government loan program to bail out ailing U.S. automakers , a step that itself raises questions on whether it violates WTO rules on industrial subsidies .
The U.S. trade deficit with China set a record $ 256.2 billion in 2007 , and could surpass that this year even with the recent slump in world trade .
The problem is that people have a bias against food stamps , because many ( most ? )
Americans think that people on food stamps are lazy , good for nothings that are unnecessarily on the public dole .
Thus , they chafe at the notion that food stamps are a good stimulus , even though economists ' analysis ( which look at the numbers and not the moral values of particular spending decisions ) indicates that they are the best stimulus .
The reason food stamps are good stimulus is clear : the money MUST be spent in a specific way ... on food ... which has a value chain that employs many people , and therefore that $ spent on food translates to more dollars all the way down the value chain , which are in turn spent on goods and services .
Use of food stamps also frees up the recipients other income for other , more discretionary , uses .
Those goods and services also have a value chain .
This is a very basic economic conept called " a multiplier " , which you learn in Macroeconomics 101 , a coourse which , unfortunately , most of the idiots whoa re ranting about this stimulus package have not taken .
So ... for the individual who suggested ( albeit sarcastically ) that EVERYONE should get food stamps ... that 's actually a great idea .
Rather than giving people tax cuts , which they can squirrel away in a bank or use to pay down debt , why not give everyone a debit card with a certain amount of value that they can only use on specified items .
Or even just food .
That would insure that ALL the money would be spent and therefore demand would be stimulated by each and every dollar in the package .
That would have been my approach to all of this .. a debit card for everyone ( employed or unemployed , rich or poor ) to provide immediate stimulus , plus infrastructure spending to fix our aging infrastructure to keep the stimulus momentum going for the next few years .
Oh and PS , to the same individual who accused people who are on unemployment of " sucking the government 's teat " , unemployment insurance is funded by employers , not by the government ( with the exception of extra funding being put into teh system by the feds as stimulus or to shore up the states ' unemployments funds ... many of which are broke from the unusually high demand . )
ANd PPS ... anyone who thinks it 's a happy little joy ride to be on unemployment is quite welcome to have my unemployment check in return for their job .
UNemployment does n't pay even 20 % of my non-discretionary monthly bills , which got considerably higher when I had to start paying for my own health insurance .
I have a 20 year work history and went to school at night for ten of those years ( have a BS , MS , and MBA ) so I could have a stable , good paying job .
I now spend 10 hours / day trying to find a new job in a market where ever major employer is either on a hiring freeze or laying people off and I 've seriously considered lying on my resuem to make me look less qualified so I could get hired for a job that pays $ 30 K / year less than what I had before .
If you 'd like to place a bet that I 'm more lazy than you , I 'd welcome that bet ... any day ... any time .

Earlier last week , an incident occurred in Wisconsin where a 14 year old girl was arrested by police officers after she was reported to the police by her school teacher for texting on her phone during class .
After the girl was caught texting by her teacher , she was requested to hand over her phone , but then refused to .
Instead , the girl argued back and continued to text during her class .
Frustrated at the situation , the teacher ended up calling the police , who then came to the school to question the girl .
After repeated denial of ever having a phone , officer Jeffrey S. Griffin , noticed that the girl had her pant zipper undone .
This lead officer Griffin to believe that the girl hid the phone in her pants .
Officer Griffin then requested for a female officer to come on location for a physical search .
After a frisk down , Officer Paula Roberson retrieved a Samsung Cricket cellphone from " the buttocks area " of the girl .
The girl then laughed at the situation , but was then arrested for lying to the police about not having a phone , as well as lying when the officers attempted to ask for the girl 's phone number .
After examining the phone , Officer Roberson found that the girl had used the phone during class to send a text message to her dad , and the phone itself belonged to her dad .
The 14 year old girl was charged with a misdemeanor with a bail of $ 298 and a mandate to appear in court .
The girl was not allowed to go back to school for several days , and would be charged with trespassing if she was found to be on school grounds during her suspension .
Do you think the teacher , officers and school went too far for a texting incident with a 14 year old girl ?
Or do you feel that justice was rightly served ?
Has technology gone to the point where things like SMS texting during school is considered criminal ?
Former manager Harry Redknapp lifted the cup in May Football 's iconic FA Cup trophy was dented when an over - enthusiastic child inadvertently knocked it off a table .
It was on display at Fratton Park , the home of 2008 cup winners Portsmouth , when the child jumped onto a stage , causing the trophy to topple over .
The club said it had been in the care of sponsors E.ON at the time , as part of the FA Cup Trophy Tour .
The FA was told of the dent and has let Portsmouth keep the cup before it is repaired on its return next month .
A statement on the Portsmouth FC website said : " Although the function was staged at Fratton Park , Portsmouth FC had no involvement in the organising or running of the event .
" The club contacted the FA as soon as they heard about the damage .
" The FA were happy for the club to keep hold of the cup but said that it could be returned to them to get fixed . "
A club spokesman said it was not uncommon for the trophy to be damaged and is regularly repaired by the FA upon its return every year .
The statement said Portsmouth decided to keep the cup to make sure that as many people in the city as possible had the chance to see the famous old trophy .
It has so far been to more than 65 schools , allowing over 22,000 children to have their pictures taken with the iconic trophy .

Crawling under the duvet and bingeing on Ben & Jerry ’s may be most women ’s reaction to heartbreak .
But Madonna Louise Ciccone is not most women .
Even on the day her multi-million - pound divorce from Guy Ritchie became final , it was business as usual for the Queen of Pop with a gruelling two - hour workout – same as every day , six days a week , every week .
Tracy Anderson knows this because she ’s been pretty much a constant at Madonna ’s side since the break - up , helping the superstar hone and refine the body she notoriously flaunted in a Louis Vuitton ad last week .
And personal trainer Tracy ’s not impressed by critics who responded to the 50 - year - old ’s crotch - flashing by saying : “ Put it away , grandma … you ’re too old ! ”
Unique insight
“ There are days when she does n’t feel good and days when she ’s having a hard time , but Madonna still works out for two hours whatever , ” says Tracy .
“ She ’s consistent and she does n’t ever make excuses .
Nothing has changed since the divorce , Madonna has n’t changed .
“ I never trained Guy and I would n’t want to , ” adds Tracy , 33 , who has a unique insight into the mind of the superstar singer , and is rightly proud of the famous body she helps sculpt .
“ Madonna will never look her age , ” she insists .
“ She does n’t even look half her age – she looks 19 .
“ I do n’t have to scream at her because she ’s so motivated .
She organises her time so she can train – she makes an appointment to do it and she keeps it , but two hours is the most she ever exercises in a day . ”
Madonna was recently described as “ half - starved ” but tiny , tanned Tracy claims that she eats well and even allows herself the occasional treat – sugar - and gluten - free , of course .
“ All my clients eat .
Madonna has a very healthy appetite .
She does n’t eat processed food , she ’s very conscious of the quality of the things she eats but she has treats – she loves cupcakes .
“ To say she is on a starvation diet is bull ****.
She burns a lot of calories .
“ She will never get fat .
Why would she let it go ?
She relaxes but she ’s smart , she knows that if she stops exercising she will have loose skin tone .
Why should we criticise someone who works hard , is consistent and gets results because they ’re smart with their time ? ”
Madonna shares
Tracy with one of her best friends , Gwyneth Paltrow , with Tracy helping relaunch Gwynnie ’s sexy new look last year .
But even glam Gwyneth struggled with Tracy ’s routines , which are based on dance aerobics , at first : “ She is the best role model because she could n’t dance at all when we started , ” says Tracy .
Yet Gwyneth must have got the hang of it .
Says the actress : “ Never did I imagine that in my 30s , after two children , I would be able to change my body to the degree I have .
It works , you will see results you never thought possible . ”
But it does n’t come without commitment .
There ’s no rest for either A - lister – no matter where they are in the world .
When she ca n’t be with them , Tracy trains them via a live video link .
“ We use iChat on our computers so we can see each other , ” she explains .
Tracy , who is 5ft and a super - skinny size 6 , also insists that Oscar - winner Gwynnie is a big eater .
“ She is a serious chef .
She makes the most elaborate meals – some I ca n’t even pronounce – but her pancakes are amazing .
She shares her recipes but they ’re very health - conscious .
“ All three of us could not live without my method , it ’s the key to being able to eat what we want . ”
Tracy is so proud of her A - plus star students that she begs both to flash more flesh .
Far from being horrified by Madonna ’s Vuitton ad , Tracy thinks we should all be giving her a big round of applause .
“ I say please show some skin – and show what a good job I ’m doing !
It ’s motivating for people to see them look so hot , ” she says .
Just jealous
“ I tell people to be thankful that Madonna is showing that it ’s possible to be ageless – people should applaud and celebrate that .
Anybody who criticises her is just jealous !
“ If you see her live she looks unbelievable , she ’s a one - off , but what puts people off is that she does it all with hard work .
It ’s not expensive creams or treatments . ”
Tracy was equally thrilled when Gwyneth paraded her pins while promoting Iron Man last year .
She says : “ I begged her to wear the tiny skirts , to show off .
I take credit for designing the body , but I give her credit for actually doing it . ”
Tracy developed her method following years of unsuccessful dieting – at the end of which she ’d gained two - and - a - half stone – and after being branded fat while at dance school in New York .
“ I ’ve always had a huge appetite , I go to restaurants just for the bread .
I could have blamed genetics as my dad is obese – he ’s 5ft 8ins and 21 stone – and I understand why people do when they ’ve worked hard and do n’t get a reward . ”
But for Tracy , her method was a fresh start .
These days the only downside of her fame is being snapped leaving training sessions , hot and sweaty , with her hair plastered to her head .
“ I ’ve had to get used to the walk of shame .
In London I had to walk between Madonna ’s house and the gym every day but we ’ve figured out a way to avoid it now . ”
The upside is that Tracy was able to take son Sam , 10 , and ex-husband basketball player Eric Anderson along as personal guests on Madonna ’s world tour .
Not bad for a woman whose dance teacher told her she ’d only ever be “ the teapot in Beauty And The Beast ” .
TRACY ’S TOP FIVE TIPS
( 1) Put an appointment in your diary six days a week to workout for an hour .
Whether you start exercising or not , make the appointment .
(2) If you have weight to lose , start by drinking green juice first thing in the morning – a blend of kale , spinach , chard , parsley , ginger and lemon .
( 3) Cut out all oil , spices and dairy – which cause bloating in women .
Stick to lean proteins like chicken and steak with lots of greens .
If you need a sugar fix , have sorbet or a frozen peach .
( 4) Learn a new dance combination from the DVD each week .
Practise the steps every day until you master it then move to the next .
Eventually you can do the whole DVD without even thinking about it .
( 5) The last step is the cardio work on a mat , which bolts all the muscles together to get them toned with great definition .
Then any surface fat will come off in days .

Stalin lives !
Taxpayers just pay Lamone 's salary -
It 's not like she actually works for the people .
We should trust or government officials as they trust the private voting machine vendors .
Those who count the votes really do decide everything - including when to end the interview !

Lamone looks VERY uncomfortable about being asked ANYTHING that gets to the heart of the matter .
Reminds me of a professor or an elected official who puts herself far above the pesky lowly " peons " who have the nerve to ask questions .
She is either in bed with Diebold ( Premier ! ) or just does n't want to let the truth out , or just does n't know .
All scenarios are frightening .
She claims great comfort with the scandal - wracked ITA system .
I guess she thinks we 're all morons drinking her Kool - Aid !

That 's a really interesting point ... these run on the executable code and therefore the source code is not available to them .
So , the question is , " Who provides the executable code ?
Diebold ?
The Republican party ? "
These machines are computers .
Come on , people , have you ever used a computer ?
You 're using one now .
Computers are dumb .
They have to be told what to do .
Have you ever pressed the icon for Internet Explorer and Firefox comes up instead ?
I do n't think so .
I would love to know the real numbers for our recent election .
The landslide must have been tremendous to counteract the " executable code . "

The woman being interviewed does n't know how software works .
The binary executables might as well be made from cake for all they tell you about the source code that compiled them .
If the source code tells the executable to ignore every other vote for X nothing in the executable code ( what ever that means ) would tell anyone anything at all about it .
I 'd say it 's a fair bet that Obama won considerably more votes if any of these tainted machines were used in the 2008 election .

That was a very interesting video .
Watching Lamone was a learning experience .
Lamone did not want to have her faith in the integrity of the source code shaken .
It was about to be .
At one point she looked like she was going to cry , when she twisted her head away and vehemently refused to entertain any doubt about the source code .
If she had used the brains in her head , I believe she would have had to entertain the doubts that the reporter was raising .
If she kept listening to the reporter 's questions , her brain would have had no choice but to work .
Rather than that , she simply ended the interview .
Brainwashing is a powerful tool .

I think she is right .
You test executable code not read source code to confirm the system is working right .
But ... I would much prefer a tablet computer with touch screen ballot that prints a completed paper ballot that is read by an optical scanning system .
I would also like to be able to add an identifying code to my voted ballot and have each printed ballot add a unique key which allows me to confirm my vote from a web site tied to the voting database .
After the election I could see how my vote was counted by entering the unique key and the website would return how I voted and my added identifying code .
No else would know my identifying code or the unique key .

I find it fascinating listening to officials answer questions like these ,
It 's a predictable pattern how they do the blame shifting game , oh the EAC and NIST , the Escrow , the this the that .
I remember the videos ( there were quite a few ) where Bowen had public comments , each time an election integrity person would come up their question about the machines were shown to be focused yet never answered .
Yet ( almost ) every time we'd hear an election judge this same pattern in these videos is followed , along with complaints about how it would be too expensive to use paper pencils and people instead of electronics .
Then we could visit say BlackBoxVoting .
Org and find the interesting video about the construction workers who started digging into King Co. , Washington elections and found all kinds of bad stuff going on behind the scenes .
Lots of agencies , lots of red tape , even changes in the law to hide stuff .
That regular Americans can and do show these technologies are vulnerable in cases , unvalidatable in cases , and even illegal in cases , is amazing in an of itself , but when these same regular Americans try to stop these activities they are met with locked doors , armed law enforcement , un- returned calls , monetary barriers , backdoor legislation , crammed legislation , bad legislation , blackouts in media , and a cold shoulder from most representatives , hardly any punishment for crimes or worse punishment of the wrong people for exposing and whistleblowing .
Even their websites are designed to not be friendly to feedback .
( A complaint I have had which I have not heard around here )
Forcing issues to be classified under pre meditated drop down lists , automated replies , no replies , bad searching / grep tools , proprietary formatted pdf's , doc's , which are not listed in searches , numeric coded documents vs. plain english filenames , etc .
You literally have to download every document to find what your after sometimes .
Some of this is not possible on a modem .
I was just talking about government websites , should we look at the errors on Diebold 's own website ?
I ain't even going to bother to look that up , you can find in the vast pile here on bradblog somewhere .
Which is another thing back to government websites again .
The data involved in this since these horrid machines were introduced has multiplied insanely , it 's not even proportional to growth for example on my own Secretary of State website ss.ca.gov , where " other business " was most of the website , now I would have to bet that electronic voting machine problems are the most of the website .
If these machines were outlawed nationally , all of that legal , technical , research , security crap could be deleted , and the people could again focus on " other business . "
Add in monetary barriers , non disclosure agreements , legal expenses , the lies , the media spin .
( Just when you think the media are going to crack open this pandora 's box , they stab us in the back again , under reporting , misreporting , outright lies , and blacklisting topics . )
And finally add in fast - tracking of the swearing in process via jet aircraft , recounts that are aborted , meaningless recounts , expensive recounts , candidates that quit , recounts that prove the wrong candidate is in office but no action is taken , no legislation or law to do the right thing and remove that person , jurisdiction problems , and the plethora of nonsense laws , terminology , operating procedures , results , feedback paths , each local precinct , state , city , county has across the nation .
You'd think these electronic devices would be nationally outlawed by now .
Common sense .
Instead we get more of them , so I do n't think it 's their brainpower that is at fault , it 's their rubber stamp that this activity is okay , and rarely punished .
They knowingly and willingly force voters harshly out into that dark night .
But as the video clearly shows , they do not like " shining bright lights . "
I doubt the interviewee would allow them self to be put into that situation again , I be she even has a security barrier , a phone tag barrier , a automated email barrier , a scheduling barrier , etc .
I could be wrong , but I doubt it .
Their insolence and arrogance is never punished , in fact they are now masters at manipulating live situations with public citizens into a domestic terror threats .
You ca n't ask a question when your locked up in solitary .
They also use timing as a weapon .
examples are :
Which day what document get 's released .
Which day laws take effect , which days things happen .
It 's all control .
And we are at a disadvantage .
They have pre-planned this , we always react after it 's too late .

... Chris said in comment # 7 ... " I think she is right . "
Then you are wrong .
" You test executable code not read source code to confirm the system is working right . "
Wrong .
You must have the source code , the exact build environment , and the exact same compiled executables using that build environment running in the machines used for voting ... and you can't be sure .
And electronic voting machines ( evms ) labor under an additional requirement not found in ordinary applications in that the input must not be able to be matched against the output i.e. the voter must not be able to be connected to their vote ... both to protect the vote and to protect the voter .
The source code is hundreds of thousands to millions of lines of code , depending on the evm ... and Windows , that paragon of security , adds millions of more lines of hiding places .
And Clint Curtis , Ed Felten etc etc rigged vote - flipping programs in just a couple of dozen extra lines of code .
The build environment ... the compiler and machine and exact settings used ... these also must be verified identical in all cases ... because there are clever hacks that can cause the source code to compile apparently clean on a certain test machine and yet compile with malicious code under different conditions .
As for just testing the binaries themselves ... all you know to test is what the people who sold you the binary told you to test .
You can try to probe for built - in weaknesses ... but where to start ?
And perhaps more importantly ... where to end ?
In the end you wind up effectively reverse - engineering the source code ... which is VERBOTEN !
And even if you had source , build environment , and compiled binaries under some fantastical control regime ( and I literally mean fantastic ) even then it all goes out the window when somebody sticks the first memory card in .
Hint : Lamone does not utilize any control regime ... much less a fantastic one .
Control is held , in ascending order of authority , by the voters , by the polling station pets , by the election bureaucrats , by the polling station techs , by the evm corporations , and above them all ... by whoever had access to the system last ( directly or indirectly . )
" But ... I would much prefer a tablet computer with touch screen ballot that prints a completed paper ballot "
This is workable , it still exposes the disabled to the malware hazards already discussed , but there 's currently no real solution to that .
" that is read by an optical scanning system . "
You are aware , are you not , that optical scanners were the first evm's to be publicly hacked in tests ?
" I would also like to be able to add an identifying code to my voted ballot And this again ... you 're not the first to venture this , and you will not be the last to venture this as it seems a simple answer to the problem ... but in many ways is the worst possible answer .
We , the electorate , cannot allow you to do this because it enables you to sell your vote ... whether or not you actually want to sell it .
To paraphrase my response to this suggestion in another thread :
Because you really , really do n't want that ...
Because you really , really do n't want Dick Cheney and every CEO on the planet able to know exactly how you just voted against their best interests .
Because you really , really do n't want to hear the following : " Nice family you have here .
Be sure to drop by my office with your receipt after the election . "
No .
Not unless you 're willing to put us and yourself and your loved ones at risk .
" No else would know my identifying code or the unique key . "
Until sufficient pressure is brought to bear ....

Betcha that would be enlightening .
I noticed this post : ECOALEX said “ I stoped voting at my precint Mt Ranch , because they segregate the voters by party affiliation .. ”
Let 's say they program one set of memory cards for Democrats and the other set for republicans .
If so inclined a poll worker or elections official could pocket one or two here & there .
Unless there 's a checks & balances procedure on the memory cards ...

" Executable code can be decompiled . "
But decompilation is reverse engineering the binary and that is why such things are strictly forbidden .
And decompilation still can't give you the original source code and current decompilers still leave large gaps where things like statically - linked Windows libraries are concerned .

This video and posting is really odd on a number of counts .
First of all , who was the interviewer ?
And who is Lamone leaning back and talking to ?
( A lawyer ?
Someone from Diebold ? )
Please instantiate .
Secondly , the interviewer 's opening comment was that Avi Rubin has " asked to examine the Diebold machines " , not the SOURCE CODE .
Her question then was " should independent computer scientists be able to view the machines actually as a show of voter confidence ? "
Lamone replied " that 's not my decision to make , I do n't HAVE the source code other than through an escrow agent ... "
But that 's NOT what the questioner asked --- she asked if the MACHINES could be reviewed .
It was Lamone who turned the discussion into being about SOURCE CODE , when it was originally about asking to review the MACHINES .
Then , there 's the whole misunderstanding about source code being a " layer underneath the machine code " that both Lamone and the interviewer misrepresented .
This interviewer does NOT know what she 's talking about or she would not have responded " right " when Lamone said " we have access to and can see all the executable code , that 's entirely different from the source code . "
It 's NOT right .
The executable code CANNOT be SEEN ( unless one looks at binaries , and MD does n't look at those either ) .
What they " examine " is the RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT , by performing blackbox testing .
Further more ,
If the interviewer really understood what she was talking about , she would not have parroted back Lamone 's INCORRECT assertion that the source code is the " layer beneath the executable code . "
The source code IS NOT A LAYER .
And finally , with regard to Brad's " good news " on this story --- please note that in NJ there is a state law as well as a court case that mandated paper ballots for 2008 .
Thanks to Governor Corzine 's extensions , NJ did n't see 'em in any of the 2008 elections , and there seems to be no indication that they 'll be put into place at any time in the future .
The lawsuit winds on , the law stands , but so do the paperless Sequoia DREs .
So , if you think a state law really means that MD will be getting paper ballots in 2010 , I suggest you do n't just wait around and see if it happens , but keep after 'em to make sure it DOES .

Why must you misrepresent otherwise interesting stuff ??
She did not " storm off " .
I agree with her that I would have ended the interview with annoying repeated questions about sourcecode .
The interviewer annoyed her and she said she was done .
Not a big story there .
Rebecca is right they needed to ask about review of executable .
For one thing , HOW DO YOU KNOW your executable matches the escrowed sourcecode ?
The ITA tells you ?
She talked about bugs and patches and fixes , but who is controlling all those changes get into the sourcecode ?
It is a faith - based system that the executables match anything .
And how is this QA person handling all the patches ?
Diebold says trust us we made this fix for this executable version ...
Ok .
Now , I wonder if the escrow people ever get that update .
And to anyone who thinks it matters what the legislation says , it turns out in America , there are no penalties for not complying with election law .
If an election administrator violates laws , such as not implementing required new system on time , there is no crime or penalty .
No one enforces anything , except for vendors who demand payment or else .
Election administrators violate HAVA all the time with voter purges or machine allocation or machine error rates .
Election administrators violate Federal Law all the time by destroying ballots or memory cards or election materials in federal elections .
Not only is it faithbased machines and software , but faithbased administration .
Has anyone even lost their jobs for violating HAVA ?
THe only people to lose their jobs are those that investigate their own systems .

( CNET ) -- Republican politicians on Thursday called for a sweeping new federal law that would require all Internet providers and operators of millions of Wi-Fi access points , even hotels , local coffee shops , and home users , to keep records about users for two years to aid police investigations .
U.S. Sen . John Cornyn of Texas , supporter of a bill that would require Internet user records to be saved for police .
The legislation , which echoes a measure proposed by one of their Democratic colleagues three years ago , would impose unprecedented data retention requirements on a broad swath of Internet access providers and is certain to draw fire from businesses and privacy advocates .
" While the Internet has generated many positive changes in the way we communicate and do business , its limitless nature offers anonymity that has opened the door to criminals looking to harm innocent children , " U.S. Sen .
John Cornyn , a Texas Republican , said at a press conference on Thursday .
" Keeping our children safe requires cooperation on the local , state , federal , and family level . "
Joining Cornyn was Texas Rep. Lamar Smith , the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott , who said such a measure would let " law enforcement stay ahead of the criminals . "
Two bills have been introduced so far -- S.436 in the Senate and H.R.1076 in the House .
Each of the companion bills is titled " Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today 's Youth Act , " or Internet Safety Act .
Each contains the same language : " A provider of an electronic communication service or remote computing service shall retain for a period of at least two years all records or other information pertaining to the identity of a user of a temporarily assigned network address the service assigns to that user . "
Translated , the Internet Safety Act applies not just to AT&T , Comcast , Verizon , and so on -- but also to the tens of millions of homes with Wi -Fi access points or wired routers that use the standard method of dynamically assigning temporary addresses .
( That method is called Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol , or DHCP . )
" Everyone has to keep such information , " says Albert Gidari , a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm in Seattle who specializes in this area of electronic privacy law .
The legal definition of electronic communication service is " any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications . "
The U.S. Justice Department 's position is that any service " that provides others with means of communicating electronically " qualifies .
That sweeps in not just public Wi -Fi access points , but password - protected ones too , and applies to individuals , small businesses , large corporations , libraries , schools , universities , and even government agencies .
Voice over IP services may be covered too .
Under the Internet Safety Act , all of those would have to keep logs for at least two years .
It " covers every employer that uses DHCP for its network , " Gidari said .
" It covers Aircell on airplanes -- hose little pico cells will have to store a lot of data for those in - the - air Internet users . "
In the Bush administration , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had called for a very similar proposal , saying that subscriber information and network data should be logged for two years .
Until Gonzales ' remarks in 2006 , the Bush administration had generally opposed laws requiring data retention , saying it had " serious reservations " about them .
But after the European Parliament approved such a requirement for Internet , telephone and VoIP providers , top administration officials began talking about the practice more favorably .
After Gonzales left the Justice Department , the political will for data retention legislation seemed to ebb for a time , but then FBI Director Robert Mueller resumed lobbying efforts last spring .
This tends to be a bipartisan sentiment : Attorney General Eric Holder , a Democrat , said in 1999 that " certain data must be retained by ISPs for reasonable periods of time so that it can be accessible to law enforcement . "
Rep. John Conyers , the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said that FBI proposals for data retention legislation " would be most welcome . "
Smith , who sponsored the House version of the Internet Safety Act , had previously introduced a one - year requirement as part of a law - and - order agenda in 2007 .
A 1996 federal law called the Electronic Communication Transactional Records
Act regulates data preservation .
It requires Internet providers to retain any " record " in their possession for 90 days " upon the request of a governmental entity . "
Because Internet addresses remain a relatively scarce commodity , ISPs tend to allocate them to customers from a pool based on whether a computer is in use at the time .
( Two standard techniques used are the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and Point - to - Point Protocol over Ethernet . )
In addition , Internet providers are required by another federal law to report child pornography sightings to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , which is in turn charged with forwarding that report to the appropriate police agency .
The Internet Safety Act is broader than just data retention .
Other portions add criminal penalties to other child pornography - related offenses , increase penalties for sexual exploitation of minors , and give the FBI an extra $ 30 million for the " Innocent Images National Initiative . "

I mentioned in an article last summer that most Israelis have solar water heaters on their rooftops , and thus they save a lot of energy during the summer .
In fact , the idea of heating the water in a boiler is not new , I had more than a dozen showers in my grandparents ’ backyard , during some hot summer days in my childhood .
One simple way of making water hot has been perfected by a blogger on thesietch.org , and it relies on a simple and easy to find piece of junk : an old refrigerator !
Other components are : wood , for making a frame , glass ( not plexiglass ) , hoses , a rubber door mat , a reflexive aluminum foil , scotch tape and glue , or silicon .
Eventually , you ’re going to need some screws .
Because it ’s black , the refrigerator radiator heats faster than other materials .
This also happens because of its tightness .
The inventors who made this “ instant ” solar water heater want to make another one , that transports the water by thermal convection and recycle it , until it reaches the desired temperature .
The entire solar water heater project costs less than $ 5 and can save you of a lot of electricity , reflected on your bill .
It ’s easy to do .

I had some sandbags in the backyard that I used in November during a rainy day .
I was moving them to a different spot when I heard the noise of the sand .
I thought that maybe I could try a new sound design technique so I bought some piezo film transducers and started to experiment with them .
The entire track is created only out of tuned sand tones .
No additional sounds or waveforms .
I emphasized the inner notes of the sand grains and mapped them on a sampler as a series of instruments .
The grooves are all played live with various techniques , including taping two piezo films to my fingers .

He woke as usual at 5 a.m. , swam a mile at the Y , read papers and was in the office at 7 for the senior staff meeting at 7:30 .
There was a meeting in the Situation Room about Afghanistan ; a leadership meeting ; a conversation with the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada ; a meeting with Senator Orrin G. Hatch , Republican of Utah ; budget meetings ; several conversations with the president .
Mr. Emanuel , in the interview , rejected any notion that he was reinventing himself for his new job .
But he is mindful , he said , that he must fit into a culture that was forged over two years on a campaign , “ a group that was part of a journey together . ”
Mr. Obama had settled on his fellow Chicagoan to be his chief of staff well before he was elected .
He was drawn to Mr. Emanuel ’s experience in both the White House and Congress and called him “ the whole package ” of political acumen , policy chops and pragmatism .
He is also a skilled compromiser .
“ He knows there is a time in this business to drop the switchblades and make a deal , ” said Representative Adam H. Putnam , Republican of Florida .
Mr. Emanuel initially resisted taking the job .
He came around after Mr. Obama insisted , saying these were momentous times and that the awesome tasks he faced required Mr. Emanuel ’s help .
The president - elect also assured Mr. Emanuel that the position would be the functional equivalent of “ a No. 2 ” or “ right - hand man , ” according to a person familiar with their exchanges .
After taking the job , Mr. Emanuel spent endless hours reaching out to lawmakers .
Mr. Reid gave out Mr. Emanuel ’s personal cellphone number , with Mr. Emanuel ’s blessing , at a caucus meeting of about 40 Senate Democrats this month .
( “ He seems to speak to every senator every day , ” said Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York . )
Mr. Emanuel has been equally solicitous of Republicans in Congress ( who also have been given access to Mr. Emanuel ’s private contact information ) .
On days he does not swim , he works out , and conducts business , at the House gym : 25 minutes on the bike , 20 minutes on the elliptical , 120 situps , 55 push - ups and many sweaty conversations with his former colleagues .
In a recent encounter there , for instance , with Representative Peter Hoekstra , Republican of Michigan , Mr. Emanuel secured his support for Leon E. Panetta to head the Central Intelligence Agency .
Indian parliament rushes through draconian “ anti- terror ” laws
By Deepal Jayasekera
29 December 2008
Barely three weeks after the Mumbai terrorist attack , India 's Congress Party - led United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) government pushed draconian new " anti- terror " laws through parliament .
Amidst an unrelenting din of hysteria over reputed " Pakistani - sourced terrorism , " all sections of India 's political establishment — including the Hindu supremacist Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena and the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) - led Left Front — unanimously joined with the Congress and its UPA allies on Dec. 17 to adopt the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Amendments Act 2008 and the National Investigating Agency Act .
The Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Amendments
Act 2008 introduces harsh amendments to the already draconian provisions of a similarly titled 1967 act , including doubling the time " terror " suspects can be held without charge and forcing accused in certain cases to " prove " their innocence .
The second bill authorizes the creation of a National Investigating Agency ( NIA ) akin to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
According to the Indian constitution " law and order " comes under the purview of the state governments .
However the new agency will have the authority to probe " terrorist acts " directly without the authorization of local state governments .
The National Investigating Agency
Act also establishes special courts to try terrorism cases .
Pressing for unanimous passage of the two bills in the Lok - Sabha ( the lower house of India 's parliament ) , Home Minister P. Chidambaram claimed the legislators had " captured the mood of the nation " by agreeing to set aside normal parliamentary procedures to rush through emergency , " consensus " legislation .
Chidambaram claimed that the bills were needed to confront the threat of " Jihadi - terrorism , " yet hypocritically urged the legislators not to look at the legislation through a " communal prism . "
While the UPA government and corporate media have claimed the bills are a response to the three - day commando - style attack on Mumbai in late November , the Hindu right and large sections of India 's security establishment have long been pushing for new powers for the state in the name of combating terrorism .
UPA Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh has himself repeatedly referred to terrorism — by which he means not just the bombings and commando raids mounted by Islamacist groups , but a whole series of national - separatist and Naxhalite ( Maoist ) insurgencies — as the greatest threat to the Indian state .
The hypocritical and reactionary character of the ruling class debate over terrorism is underscored by the fact that entirely excluded from discussion are the atrocities that the Hindu right , with the complicity of much of state apparatus , has perpetrated over the past two decades — most infamously in the wake of the 1992 razing of the Babri Masjid mosque in Ayodhya and the 2002 Gujarat pogrom .
In so far as there has been a rise of Islamicist terrorism in India , it has come largely in reaction to the Indian bourgeoisie 's connivance with , and sponsorship of , the Hindu right .
That the target of the legislation is far more than the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack and like atrocities is above all demonstrated by the sweeping definition of terrorism set out in the Unlawful Activities Act ( 2008 ) .
The multi-part definition declares guilty of a " terrorist act , " " Whoever does any act with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity , integrity , security or sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror or likely to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country " using any " hazardous substance " likely to cause injury or property damage or disrupt essential services ; or by using " criminal force " or threatening criminal force to " overawe " any public official ; or who seeks to compel the Indian government , any state or foreign government to do anything by detaining or kidnapping anyone .
The bill goes on to make it a crime liable to a minimum of five years and a maximum of life imprisonment to raise , collect , or provide funds , " directly or indirectly , " " likely " to be used to " commit a terrorist act . "
It also provides , according to an analysis carried out by Amnesty International , " no clear and strict definition of what constitutes ‘ membership ' of a ‘ terrorist gang or organization . ' "
This opens the door to the witchhunting of large numbers of people who support the objectives of an organization deemed by the Indian state to be terrorist , but who are in no way involved in violence .
The bill 's definitions of terrorism and support for terrorism provide the legal framework for the Indian state to greatly intensify its attempts to crush through state violence the ethno - separatist insurgences in Kashmir and the north - east and the insurgencies being mounted by several Naxalite groups .
( According to the Indian government , Naxalite insurgents are active in about 180 administrative districts or more than one - fifth of the entire country . )
The Naxalites are a retrograde , nationalist political tendency .
But they have been able to gain support in some of the poorest and most remote areas of India because of the tremendous agrarian crisis and because the mainline Stalinist parties , the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) and the Communist Party of India , have politically paralyzed the working class .
The Naxalite movement enjoys the support of a layer of students and has a network of support and cultural organizations , some of them patronized by well - known intellectuals and artists .
Such activities have now been criminalized and there is every reason to expect that the ruling elite will utilize these new laws to launch a dragnet against Naxalite - aligned groups and their supporters .
The legislation could also be invoked in the future directly against the working class , as almost any form of resistance to the state could be labeled a threat to the " unity , integrity , security or sovereignty of India . "
Sections of the corporate media have long denounced hartals ( political strikes ) and gheraos ( in which protesters surround and detain a government official or corporate boss ) as violent acts , based on " terrorizing " opponents .
Overturning of key juridical principles
Of no less importance is the fact that the legislation overturns longstanding juridical principles , laying the basis for further attacks on democratic rights .
Police are now empowered to arrest " terrorist suspects " and detain them for 180 days without filing any formal charges .
Under the 1967
Act the maximum period of imprisonment without formal charges was 90 days .
Foreign " terror suspects " or indeed almost any foreign national accused of entering the country illegally will have no right to bail .
Even for Indian nationals , bail will be difficult if not impossible to obtain , as it is subject to the consent of a judge of the special " terrorist " court .
The state is empowered to freeze , seize or attach funds and other financial assets or economic resources reputedly held by " suspected " individuals on behalf of terrorist organizations .
If a suspect is caught with " weapons , " the law will presume the accused is guilty ; in other words the burden of proof will be shifted from the state to the accused , thereby violating one of the most essential principles of civil liberty — " innocent until proven guilty . "
The special courts established under the National Investigating Agency
Act will try terror suspects in camera , denying the public knowledge of the proceedings and thereby greatly facilitating convictions on the basis of flimsy or concocted evidence .
The UPA government 's adoption of the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Amendments Act 2008 and the National Investigating Agency Act constitutes a further major shift to the right on the part of the Congress Party , the Indian bourgeoisie 's traditional party of government .
In July , the Congress - led UPA broke with the Stalinist Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) and its Left Front ( which had been providing the minority government with the parliamentary votes needed to remain in office ) , so as to press forward with the Indo - US civilian nuclear treaty and , more broadly , a " global , strategic " partnership with US imperialism .
In passing the twin " anti-terror " bills , the Congress is adapting and giving succor to the Hindu right .
In a communally - laced propaganda offensive , the official opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has long accused the Congress of being " soft on terrorism " because it wants to attract Muslim votes .
This Hindu communalist party , which was swept from the power by the Congress - led UPA in 2004 , has particularly lashed out against the UPA government for its repealing of the Prevention of Terrorism Act ( POTA ) , legislation the previous BJP - led government adopted in 2002 following a terrorist attack on India 's parliament and in the midst of a massive military mobilization and threats of war against Pakistan .
The Congress Party made much of its repeal of POTA after it came to power in 2004 , conceding that it was anti-democratic , had resulted in police dragnets in which large numbers of innocent people , especially Muslims , had been victimized , and had been used by various state governments to witchhunt political opponents .
The Congress Party has now come full - circle .
The new laws adopt the key elements of POTA , including long detentions without charges , a broad definition of terrorism , placing the burden of proof on the accused , and closed trials in special courts .
Only a few provisions are different .
Unlike POTA , the new law does not allow prosecutors to use " confessions " made to police officers .
( India 's police and security forces have an appalling human rights record , including routine use of summary executions and torture . )
The Times of India in its article entitled " POTA Back as New UAPA ? " concluded that the new legislation is indeed " old wine in new bottle . "
The BJP welcomes the Congress ' " U - Turn "
The Congress Party 's lurch to the right was acknowledged by BJP leader L.K. Advani , but he made sure to once again admonish the Congress for having repealed POTA and to demand even more repressive measures , such as making police - elicited " confessions " admissible in court .
Said Advani , " I can not express happiness but I express satisfaction today .
You have today admitted that the government was wrong for 10 years and will rectify mistakes .
You have woken up from Kumbhakarna 's sleep .
( Kumbhakarna is a character in a Hindu epic who is always in deep sleep . )
I want that you admit that you were wrong .
. . .
You attacked us as if we had committed a crime when we ushered in the Prevention of Terrorism Act ( POTA ) . "
Having lectured the Congress for having termed POTA as " anti-minority , " Advani concluded by proclaiming , " Today I am happy with your U - turn . "
The Congress - Party led UPA government has used last month 's Mumbai attack to ratchet up tensions with Pakistan , India 's historic rival , and thereby force it to cut off support for the anti-Indian insurgency in Kashmir , to divert popular attention from the fallout within India of the world economic crisis , and now to mount a sweeping attack on democratic rights .
In the process , the self - avowed " secular " Congress has joined hands with the BJP , while competing with the Hindu supremacists as to which party is the most resolute against terrorism and Pakistan .
The Congress has now leveled its own " soft on terrorism " charge against the BJP , repeatedly referring to a 1999 incident in which the BJP - led government of the time authorized the release of some Kashmiri separatists from prison in India to secure the release of hostages on a hijacked plane .
The attitude taken by Stalinist parties towards the new " anti-terror " laws has exposed their pathetic prostration before the Indian bourgeoisie and its state .
After proposing a series of amendments that were rejected by the united front of the Congress and BJP , the Stalinists joined with the government and the Hindu supremacists to adopt the two bills , thereby enabling the Indian state to claim that the legislation enjoys parliament 's unanimous support .
CPM MP Basudeb Acharia justified the CPM 's support for the formation of NIA by saying , " Initially , we were not in favor of a central investigating agency .
But from the kind of terror attacks the country is facing today it is clear that it cannot be handled by state governments .
So we support such an agency . "
The Stalinists ' initial reservations on the NIA were not based upon a principled defence of democratic rights , but instead arose from their longstanding attempts to woo various regional - based bourgeois cliques in the name of " state rights . "
Several state governments and regional parties had opposed the establishment of a federal " terrorist " agency , complaining that it violated the constitution 's division of powers .
However , such opposition rapidly dissipated in the face of a strong push from the dominant sections of India 's elite to use the Mumbai atrocity to streamline and strengthen the state apparatus .
The Indian corporate media has supported the new anti-terror laws , but their harsh provisions have caused some commentators to express concerns .
An editorial in the Hindu said the laws raise " serious concerns from a jurisprudential and civil rights standpoint , " especially the provision " that mandates special courts to presume that the accused is guilty under certain circumstances . "
However , registering its basic agreement with the new laws , the editorial concluded : " Terrorism needs to be fought , and firmly , through a number of measures , including beefing up the intelligence and investigative apparatus and the police force . "
International human rights groups have been more forthright .
Madhu Malhotra , Asia Pacific Program Deputy Director at Amnesty International , said : " While we utterly condemn the [ Mumbai ] attacks and recognize that the Indian authorities have a right and duty to take effective measures to ensure the security of the population , security concerns should never be used to jeopardize people 's human rights . "
Amnesty urged the Indian president not to proclaim the two bills law , saying that they violate international human rights treaties to which India is a signatory .
The Federal Reserve System faces a dilemma of its own creation : the doubling of the monetary base .
You can see it here .
The only thing that is keeping this from creating mass inflation is the decision of commercial bankers to deposit the bulk of this increase with the Federal Reserve .
The banks are not lending out this money .
Neither is the FED .
This money does not legally belong to the FED .
President Obama has said that banks that receive money from the Federal government as part of the bailout operation are going to be required to lend money .
As to how this is going to be enforced , he did not say .
Rep. Barney Frank insists that there will be specific legislation mandating that banks lend money to the public .
If the Federal government gets into the business of allocating bank loans , the results will be disastrous .
For a nice survey of the bad effects that such intervention will cause , read the article by Michael Rozeff , a retired professor of finance .
SUBSIDIZING EXCESS RESERVES
There is a reason why the banks are not lending money to the public .
Instead of taking the risk of lending , the banks are depositing hundreds of billions of dollars with the Federal Reserve .
Beginning last October , the Federal Reserve began paying low rates of interest on money above the legal reserve requirement that banks must deposit at the Federal Reserve System .
This new policy was not to go into effect until October of 2011 , but the banking crisis forced the Federal Reserve to speed up the legal timetable .
Congress , of course , did nothing .
Because the banks place their money with the Federal Reserve , this money is taken out of the fractional reserve process .
The Federal Reserve System does not lend this money to borrowers .
It is not part of the FED ’s balance sheet .
The FED keeps the money in reserve .
The banks were initially paid only 1.25 % for these deposits , and this was dropped to 1 % before October was over .
Because of the Federal Reserve ’s new target for the federal funds rate , which is now approximately 0 % , banks are not receiving any interest on the money they have on deposit with the FED .
Yet they have to pay interest to depositors .
So , the excess reserves are causing banks to hemorrhage money .
The money is safe , but the losses are guaranteed .
The banks have almost no money coming in as interest payments from the Federal Reserve , but they have money going out as interest payments to depositories .
This can not go on forever .
The new Administration understands that something is wrong .
Advisors know the banks are not lending .
They do not seem to understand why the banks are not lending .
They are not lending because bankers are fearful that they will not be repaid .
They are so terrified by this economy that they would rather put the money with the Federal Reserve System , receive essentially no interest , and suffer losses on interest paid to depositors .
They would rather lose a little money , month by month , then put their money at risk by lending it .
This gives some indication of just how bad the present economy is .
If bankers are afraid to lend money to senior American corporations for 90 days , and if they are afraid to lend money to the United States Treasury to buy long - term bonds , there appear to be no profitable opportunities for investors , either .
The banks are certainly not going to put the money in the stock market .
Why should you ?
They are afraid to put it in the corporate bond market .
I can hardly blame them .
They are afraid of doing anything with the money .
The Federal Reserve now faces a problem .
It faces a series of problems .
We need to understand the nature of the problems that the Federal Reserve is facing in order to understand what Federal Reserve policy is today .
A ZERO - BOUND ECONOMY
The Federal Reserve wants to avoid price deflation .
In the terminology of Keynesian central bankers , this is called a zero - bound condition .
We are now in that condition .
The federal funds rate is so low that banks ought not to be lending to the Federal Reserve .
Nevertheless , they are lending to the Federal Reserve at approximately one - tenth of 1 % interest .
They are not lending to the general public .
If the economy continues to contract , as Keynesian theory says it will contract if the banks do not lend , then prices will fall , and interest rates on Treasury debt will remain essentially zero at the short maturities .
This will make it difficult for the Treasury to get foreign investors to lend money to it .
The Federal government is facing a $ 1.2 trillion deficit , and foreign central banks are unlikely to lend to the Treasury at a quarter of a percent interest , the rate for 90 - day T - bills .
Foreign central banks are also saying that they no longer wish to lend on long - term T - bonds .
According to Keynesian economic theory , when interest rates fall to zero , increases in central bank purchases of debt obligations , which would otherwise stimulate the economy , no longer occurs .
Why not ?
Because banks refused to lend .
This stops the fractional reserve banking expansion process .
The economy stagnates .
Economic growth contracts .
Prices fall .
The process accelerates .
It is a downward economic spiral .
This is what Milton Friedman said caused the Great Depression .
Almost everybody today believes Friedman .
So , they are frightened that we have reached a situation where Federal Reserve expansion of the monetary base will not lead to an expansion of the money supply .
This means that the economy will continue to fall even faster .
AN EASY SOLUTION WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES
There is an easy solution to this problem .
The Federal Reserve knows exactly what the solution is .
Nobody mentions it .
The suggestion that the Federal Reserve would attempt it would probably bust the bond market .
The Federal Reserve would announce that , from this point on , all money deposited by banks as excess reserves will be charged a storage fee .
This fee could be 2 % .
Not only would banks not make any interest on the money deposited with the Federal Reserve , they would begin suffering a loss of 2 % per annum on the money held as excess reserves .
These losses would be in addition to the losses sustained by the banks because they have to pay interest to depositors .
The banks would find that the guaranteed loss of the combined payments would be so great that it would be safer to lend the money to the general public .
Banks would then start lending to corporations and to the Federal government .
They would certainly buy Treasury bills at a quarter of a percent per annum rather than holding excess reserves at — 2 % .
The Treasury would spend the money into circulation .
This money would then multiply through the fractional reserve banking process .
This would create another grim scenario for the Federal Reserve .
The Federal Reserve has more than doubled the monetary base since September 2008 .
This has been offset by the decline in the money multiplier , which has been caused by bankers ’ decisions to hold money as excess reserves with the Federal Reserve .
If the Federal Reserve begins charging a storage fee to banks that deposit excess reserves with the FED , the money multiplier will immediately reverse .
It will go back to something approaching normal .
At that point , the increase in M - 1 will begin to affect the economy .
There will be more money available for consumers to spend .
Some people are afraid that consumers will save money .
Why ?
Bad economic theory .
Thrift does not have any effect on the money supply in a fractional reserve banking system .
If one group of consumers saves more money , this does not affect the money supply .
These thrifty people will increase the amount of money that they have deposited at their local bank .
This does not change the monetary base .
When a small percentage of consumers stops spending on consumer goods and increases holdings of bank accounts or money market funds , this will have no effect on the total money supply .
It means that one group of consumers will cut back on spending , but it means that other groups of consumers will increase spending .
People who borrow money at a bank intend to spend it .
Maybe they are going to spend it on business activities .
Maybe they are going to spend it on consumer goods .
But they are going to spend it .
Nobody increases his debt in order to put it in a bank account .
Nobody pays a bank 7 % or 10 % per annum in order to put it in a bank account that pays 2 % per annum .
If he does , he is doing this only for very brief time until he spends the money .
FEAR OF PRICE INFLATION
Why has n’t the Fed adopted this policy of a penalty payment ?
I think this should be obvious .
Banking theory teaches that when the monetary base doubles , the money supply will double .
If the money supply doubles , consumer prices will also come close to doubling .
There will usually be a time lag , but the process is clear .
An increase in the monetary base , which is called high - powered money , multiplies through the fractional reserve banking system .
All schools of economic opinion agree on this point .
If the Federal Reserve is unwilling to impose a penalty payment on excess reserves , it is afraid that banks are going to do the rational thing : lend money to the general public .
It is clear that the Federal Reserve System ’s policy - makers are afraid that banks are going to do what banks are supposed to do with reserves : lend money to the general public .
The Federal Reserve is attempting to sterilize the increase of the monetary base , which it created .
Federal Reserve economists know that if banks start lending reserves that are being held the Federal Reserve beyond the 10 % legal limit , there is going to be mass inflation in the United States .
The Consumer Price Index will double .
Any additional spending by the Federal Reserve to prop up the Treasury bond market will be immediately reflected in an increase in M - 1 .
Long - term interest rates will soar .
The market for Treasury bonds will collapse .
At that point , the Federal Reserve will have to intervene and purchase Treasury bonds .
This will drastically raise interest rates on corporate bonds and mortgages .
The Federal Reserve is now trapped by its own policies .
It has dramatically increased the monetary base , and it does not want this money to be spent into circulation .
Federal Reserve economists understand the fractional reserve banking process .
They know that the only way that the M - 1 money supply will not match the doubling of the monetary base is for the Federal Reserve to impose an increase in the reserve requirement .
It has not done this .
Instead , it has paid a small amount of interest to banks to persuade bankers to see keep money on deposit with the Fed , which sterilizes the increase in the monetary base .
If banks begin lending money to the general public , the Federal Reserve will have to sell assets in order to offset the increase in its balance sheet , which is a result of the big bank bailouts and buying T - bills .
The problem is , the Federal Reserve is running out of Treasury debt certificates to sell .
The only asset that the Federal Reserve now holds in its balance sheet that can be sold at face value to the general public is Treasury debt .
There is no way for the Federal Reserve to unload the toxic assets that from the banks .
Furthermore , with the proposal of the so - called bad bank , which is one of those rare circumstances where the name given to it is appropriate for what the organization is , somebody has got to buy the toxic assets that are unloaded by the banks , so that the banks can get their balance sheets solvent again .
Who is going to put up the money to buy all of this debt ?
The Treasury can buy it , but then the Treasury then must sell a comparable amount of debt to the general public .
Who is going to buy that ?
Whoever does will invest money in a government - guaranteed bailout rather than in the private sector .
Kiss the recovery goodbye .
Once the banks get their balance sheets in good shape again , by unloading hundreds of billions of dollars of junk assets onto the bad bank , they will start lending again .
They will reduce their holdings of excess reserves at the Federal Reserve System .
At that point , the money multiplier will start multiplying again , M - 1 will grow dramatically , and we will be into mass inflation .
I do n’t mean 10 % or 20 % or 30 % price inflation .
I mean 50 % , 60 % , or 100 % per annum .
The vast increase of the monetary base , once it is translated into an increase in M - 1 , will create mass inflation in the United States .
That money will be spent .
Anyone who thinks the US Treasury will not send money to Social Security recipients , Medicare insurance programs , and all the other groups that are clamoring for bailouts , has been smoking something funny .
DELIBERATE POLICY
The reason why the banks are not lending is because a Federal Reserve policy has been established that pays banks not to lend .
But now that the expansion of the money supply has been so great that the federal funds rate has been dropped to a tenth of a percent , the Federal Reserve ’s plan to sterilize its own expansion of the monetary base is threatened by constant losses to commercial banks , because they have to pay interest on deposits .
Furthermore , the plan to sterilize the monetary base is also threatened by Congress and by the President , who insist that legislation is going to be passed which forces the banks to lend money .
People who are predicting price deflation , meaning significant price deflation of 5 % to 10 % per annum or more , operate on an assumption that the fractional reserve banking system no longer expands the money supply .
They are assuming that banks will not lend .
They are therefore assuming that the expansion of the monetary base which is already taken place is not going to be translated into an expansion of the money supply , because the Federal Reserve ’s program of asset sterilization by paying interest on excess reserves is going to be successful .
If success is defined as “ falling prices and a collapsing economy , ” success is not going to be allowed by the United States Congress and the Obama Administration .
They have made it clear that they are going to mandate that the banks lend .
As soon as the banks start lending , the fractional reserve banking process takes over , and the money supply will double .
I think we are beyond the point of no return .
I think the expansion of the monetary base by the Federal Reserve System cannot be sterilized much longer .
Congress is going to force the un-sterilization of bank reserves .
The Federal Reserve System can do this on its own authority , simply by imposing a penalty payment on excess reserves .
This is not rocket science .
This is simply a matter of the Board of Governors passing a new rule that imposes a 2 % , 3 % , or 4 % penalty payment on excess reserves .
If I understand this , you can be certain that Federal Reserve officials understand this .
You can also be certain that Ben Bernanke understands this .
If Bernanke and the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors have refused to impose such a penalty payment , there is a reason for this .
It is the same reason that the Federal Reserve began paying interest on excess reserves last October .
The reason is clear : the Federal Reserve is terrified by its own policies .
It knows exactly what is going to happen , once banks lend excess reserves into the general economy .
It does not matter one way or the other who gets the money .
It can be the United States Treasury .
It can be large corporations .
It can be people borrowing money to buy real estate .
It can be any or all of these recipients of money .
The public is willing to borrow whatever the banks are willing to lend at some interest rate .
Contrary to John Maynard Keynes , the money will be borrowed , and the money will be spent .
My belief is that the banks will pull money out of excess reserves , either because they are forced to by the Federal government or because the Federal Reserve System begins imposing a penalty payment on excess reserves .
Why would the FED do this ?
In order to forestall Congress .
Also , in order to escape the zero - bound crisis that Keynesian economics says is the result of central bank policies that lower interest rates to zero .
The thought that nobody in the general public is willing to borrow money at 1 % or 2 % is ludicrous .
Tens of millions of Americans have credit cards , and they pay 10 % , 15 % , or more on these cards .
Americans will rush to buy houses if they can get mortgage rates at 2 % or 3 % .
The idea that the interest rate does not balance the supply and demand of credit is so utterly ludicrous that it takes a Ph.D. in economics to believe it .
This idea has been a dominant idea among economists all over the world ever since Keynes wrote the General Theory .
It is a preposterous concept , and it is universally held .
This is why economists throughout America are now clamoring for more bailouts by the Federal government .
This is why they are demanding that the Federal government spend the money on anything and everything in order to make certain that the money gets spent by consumers .
CONCLUSION
The case for price deflation rests on one primary idea : banks will not lend , even though they have reserves to lend .
So far , this has proven to be the case .
Banks are keeping excess reserves with the Federal Reserve , thereby refusing to lend money to the general public .
Congress is not willing to accept this much longer .
Neither is the Obama administration .
So , the Federal Reserve System is going to have to fish or cut bait .
It is going to have to decide whether or not it is going to subsidize the banking system : the decision of bankers to hold reserves with the Federal Reserve , thereby sterilizing the expansion of money that the Federal Reserve has produced since last September .
I do n’t think the Federal Reserve wants either outcome .
On the one hand , it is terrified by the zero - bound economy that it has created .
On the other hand , it is terrified by the thought of what the expansion of the Federal Reserve ’s monetary base will do the money supply , and from there do to consumer prices .
I feel their pain .
I prefer not to .
We are all going to feel a great deal of pain over the next few years .
The basis of this pain is already in the monetary pipeline .
The relevant question now is this : “ How soon will the FED decide to un-sterilize its monetary base ? ”
This raises a practical question : “ What can a small minority of investors do to beat the rush to the lifeboats , before they fill up ? ”
The majority will not be able to escape the sinking ship of state .

Police also seized a handgun and a shotgun .
Anglemier says the seized marijuana was worth $ 500 to $ 600 .
The Carls , both 31 , have 3 - year - old twin boys , placed in the protective custody of the Oregon Department of Human Services .
The couple face charges of marijuana possession and delivery , frequenting a place where drugs are used , child neglect and endangering the welfare of a minor .
-- The Associated Press
America 's biggest banks were battling to head off an investor rout ­following fears that their battered finances would need a further boost from the US government .
Bank of America saw its share price slump 20 % at one point before closing down 18 % at $ 8.32 , while Citigroup dived 18 % and closed down 15.5 % at $ 3.83 .
The falls wiped out the gains the two banks had made since a faltering recovery began in November .
Bank of America was locked in ­discussion with US treasury officials ­following its request for a loan .
­Meanwhile , Citigroup is expected to report its deepest quarterly deficit yet , after suffering net losses for four consecutive quarters .
The prospect of further write - downs on toxic assets held by the banks and a collapse in profits were blamed for the near panic selling in New York early in the session .
But the wider market recovered later in the day on hopes the seriousness of the situation would prompt further US ­government intervention .
Speculation about a pending Senate vote on ­authorising the remaining $ 350 bn ( £ 238bn ) from the government 's financial bail - out fund helped the Dow close up 12 points at 8212 .
Concerns that the US banking system was in bigger trouble than politicians and regulators had previously thought sent UK bank shares tumbling , dragging down the FTSE 100 index 1.4 % to 4121 .
Lloyds TSB plunged to its lowest value since 1989 following successive days of share price falls .
The bank , which officially absorbs HBOS on Monday , crashed 11.69 % to 103p .
Barclays was also hammered by a wave of selling to finish the day at 130.4 p , down 8.23 % .
HSBC , which is believed to be under pressure to raise further capital , slipped 7 % to 567p .
The share price falls posed a problem for Gordon Brown , who may be forced to bring forward plans for further rescue measures .
Proposals to package toxic assets into a single " bad bank " are not currently thought to be on the agenda , it is understood the Treasury is considering offering to underwrite a ­proportion of bank assets to prevent the need to raise further ­capital .
The ­insurance policy would be paid for by the banks , but would avoid the need for the government to increase its share - holdings , which exceeds 50 % in the case of Royal Bank of Scotland .
Ministers are keen to avoid full nationalisation of any bank , preferring at least a veneer of private - sector involvement .
But continued speculation that nationalisation is a real prospect in the US and the UK , coupled with what is in effect a freeze on dividend payments as a price for further government funds also ­worried investors , many of whom have hung on to their holdings through the worst of the credit crunch and were hopeful of a recovery later this year .
Economic data in recent days showing the US and Europe faced a long and deep recession appeared to be at the heart of the decision by investors to sell bank shares .
Analysts said hopes of a recovery in the latter half of the year were hit by figures showing sharp declines in manufacturing output and services coupled with rising unemployment .
A prolonged recession would delay any recovery in the value of assets held by banks , in particular property , which is expected to continue falling this year and possibly into next year .
Without a recovery in asset values , banks would be forced to make further write - downs .
Citigroup is expected to hive off riskier businesses as part of a rescue package , while Bank of America could be forced to sell parts of Merrill Lynch , the investment bank it bought last year .
Citigroup could create a " bank within a bank " to contain its worst - performing assets in an effort to protect the rest of the operation and allow a revival in lending .
Unwanted assets worth as much as $ 600 bn – a third of its asset base – could be ringfenced , according to US reports .
Nick Parsons , chief strategist at the capital - markets house NabCapital , said : " Many investors held firm last year and saw their investments decline by 30 % or 40 % .
They have learned from that and when they see a longer recession looming they are more prepared to sell . "
" EPDM coatings does not retail in stores .
This insures that product is not setting on shelves ageing and allowing you to get direct from factory product .
Also we pass the saving onto you cutting out the middleman ! "
Liquid Roof is the liquid version of a popular synthetic rubber that 's revolutionized roof leaks repair .
Years ago , rubber rolls were the go - to method for waterproofing roofs .
Unsurprisingly , liquid is much easier to work with .
It easily fills cracks and has the ability to work in tiny areas that could n’t previously be reached .
Liquid Roof is also much more diverse and can be used on recreational vehicles as well as structures .
It does n’t matter what type of material is used to create the roof .
Fiberglass , wood and metal is all complementary to Liquid Roof .
When used in conjunction with an undercoating , it can even be used with asphalt - based coatings and built - up roofs .
Liquid Roof for Leaks Repair - Choosing Wisely Liquid Roof helps extend the life of your roof .
However , it also does more than that .
It can improve the looks of your home or vehicle — and increase the market value .
Of course , it also seals roof leaks and helps deflect heat .
EPDM is renowned for working with a number of materials , which makes it an ideal choice for most homes and RV roof repair .
EPDM and Liquid Roof are almost chemically identical
Provides a seamless finish
Deflects light and heat

100 % one - coat process
Immediately waterproofs surfaces
Withstands “ ponding ”
Reduces noise from rain
Proven to beat urethanes , acrylics and elastomers
Works on nearly all surfaces EPDM Cost vs. Others
There ’s— literally — nothing like Liquid Roof .
It ’s been featured in a number of industry publications including Roofers Exchanged and Fine Home Building Magazine .
It protects surfaces from UV rays and harsh weather .
The application is a breeze and only requires a brush or roller .
Liquid Roof was designed for the roofs of homes and RVs , but can be applied to many other surfaces for roof leaks repair .
Keep in mind that Liquid Roof only cures , or “ sets , ” when temperatures are 55° F or higher .
It ’s possible to apply the product when temperatures are below that number .
However , the product will only continue to cure when temperatures reach that point or higher .
Both Liquid Rubber and Liquid Roof boast a 6 months shelf life as long as the catalyst is n’t mixed .
Roof leaks repair is a problem that every homeowner or RV owner will have to address .
However , it does n’t have to be expensive or difficult .

Not all roof leaks repairs are created equal .
You might be doing the exact same job — but wo n’t get nearly the same results without EPDM products .
EPDM is ozone and UV resistant .
It ’s also flexible , which reduces any chances for cracking .
EPDM literally goes with the flow and will contract or expand depending on temperatures .
Many other products can crack or bubble , especially in regions with four distinct seasons or harsh winters or summers .
Not long ago , a congressional earmark for zebra mussel control would prompt mocking recipe suggestions from spending critics outside the Midwest .
After years of talk , the Great Lakes should now get their due .
Congressional advocates from both parties have sought the billions necessary to repair decades of damage and neglect .
It 's a regional job , too big for any one state to finance -- Michigan has 3,200 miles of freshwater shoreline -- and should fall to the federal government .
Events are converging to make that happen .
Unlike a debate over aid to the Big Three that zinged Michigan , the discussion involves eight states that have a stake in a sustained effort to restore and protect the Great Lakes .
President Barack Obama -- from the Great Lakes state of Illinois , of course -- co-sponsored such legislation in the Senate and has promised " aggressive action to implement a comprehensive restoration plan . "
And there 's a long list of regional environmental work that can start right now , a key rationale for the $ 825 billion ( and counting ) economic stimulus plan drafted by House Democrats .
With the money and political will apparently in place , Rep. Vernon Ehlers , R - Grand Rapids , once again has introduced legislation that defines the Great Lakes as a treasured national resource .
Similar legislation is co-sponsored by Carl Levin , D - Detroit , in the Senate .
The biggest piece would commit $ 20 billion over the next five years for waste and stormwater infrastructure .
Michigan 's share would approach $ 900 million , lakes advocates say , creating an estimated 40,000 jobs .
Strengthening the Great Lakes Legacy
Act , moreover , would commit $ 150 million annually to all eight states over the next decade for cleanup of contaminated sediment in rivers that feed the lakes .
Additional federal dollars would go to restore coastal and interior wetlands that filter pollutants .
Research to combat invasive species would be funded , and Ehlers ' bill calls for ballast - water management rules .
For all the national pounding Michigan has been taking , along with chronic job loss and now a double - digit unemployment rate , one fact remains :
The Great Lakes are as important to Michigan 's economy as they are to Michigan 's identity .
According to a 2006 Brookings Institution study , an investment of $ 25 billion in the Great Lakes region would generate more than $ 80 billion in economic benefits .
By itself , restoration wo n't nearly make up for the staggering loss of 356,000 manufacturing jobs this decade .
But the environment remains a major element required to turn Michigan into the state it should be .
Smart .
Forward - thinking .
An attractive place to live .
A destination state .
" In the past , we relied on the lakes for industrial activity .
In the future , Michigan 's economy will increasingly depend on the Great Lakes for the quality of life they provide , " says a restoration plan produced this month by Lt. Gov. John Cherry 's panel .
" What other state can claim the breathtaking beauty of both a sunrise dawn over Lake Huron and a picturesque evening sunset in the western sky above Lake Michigan ? "
On the beaches of Chicago , a few blocks from the South Side neighborhood where President Obama lived for 20 years , the sunrises are pretty spectacular , too .

Cheryl Holdridge : ' Mouseketeer Cheryl ' Has Died 1944 - 2009 ( Video )
Cheryl Holdridge 1944-2009
' Mouseketeer Cheryl '
was an actress best known for being one of the original Mickey Mouse Club cast members .
The 64 year old died on January 5 , 2009 of lung cancer .
Mouseketeer Cheryl joined the original Mickey Mouse Club in the spring of 1956 .
She was a member of the ' Red Team ' , the most visible and popular of the Mouseketeers .
The original cast included Annette Funicello , Doreen Tracey , Tommy Cole , Darlene Gillespie , Bobby Burgess , Cubby O'Brien , Karen Pendleton , Lonnie Burr and Sharon Baird .
After the show ended she returned to high school and graduated in 1961 .
She was cast in two episodes of Leave It to Beaver in 1959 and later played the recurring role of Wally Cleaver 's girlfriend Julie Foster .
Her television career kicked into high gear in 1960 when she appeared on over twenty different shows , including The Rifleman , My Three Sons , Bewitched , Bringing Up Buddy and The Dick Van Dyke Show .
In later years , she made a cameo appearance in a 2000 feature film , The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas .
In 2005 she appeared at Disneyland for their 50th anniversary celebrations .
Holdridge 's first husband was sportsman and athlete Lance Reventlow , son of Barbara Hutton .
He died in a plane crash eight years after they were married .
Her second husband Manning J. Post was a major figure in Democratic politics in California .
He died in 2000 .
Neither marriage produced children .
Holdridge was a long - time supporter of environmental causes and charities .

Alcohol - related psychosis is a secondary psychosis that manifests as prominent hallucinations and delusions occurring in a variety of alcohol - related conditions .
For patients with alcohol use disorder , previously known as alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence , psychosis can occur during phases of acute intoxication or withdrawal , with or without delirium tremens .
In addition , alcohol hallucinosis and alcoholic paranoia are 2 uncommon alcohol - induced psychotic disorders , which are seen only in chronic alcoholics who have years of severe and heavy drinking . [ 1 ]
Lastly , psychosis can also occur during alcohol intoxication , also known as pathologic intoxication , an uncommon condition the diagnosis of which is considered controversial . [ 2 , 3 ]
In chronic alcoholic patients , lack of thiamine is a common condition .
Thiamine deficiency is known to lead to Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome , which is characterized by neurological findings on examination and a confusional - apathetic state .
Korsakoff psychosis ( or Korsakoff amnesic - or amnesic - confabulatory state ) refers to a state that memory and learning are affected out of proportion to other cognitive functions in an otherwise alert and responsive patient . [ 4 ]
Alcohol is a neurotoxin that damages the brain in a complex manner through prolonged exposure and repeated withdrawal , resulting in significant morbidity and mortality .
Alcohol - related psychosis is often an indication of chronic alcoholism ; thus , it is associated with medical , neurological , and psychosocial complications .
Alcohol - related psychosis spontaneously clears with discontinuation of alcohol use and may resume during repeated alcohol exposure .
Distinguishing alcohol - related psychosis from schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders through clinical presentation often is difficult .
It is generally accepted that alcohol - related psychosis remits with abstinence , unlike schizophrenia .
If persistent psychosis develops , diagnostic confusion can result .
Comorbid psychotic disorders ( eg , schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders ) and severe mood disorder with psychosis may exist , resulting in the psychosis being attributed to the wrong etiology .
Some characteristics that may help differentiate alcohol - induced psychosis from schizophrenia are that alcohol - induced psychosis shows later onset of psychosis , higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms , fewer negative and disorganized symptoms , better insight and judgment towards psychotic symptoms , and less functional impairment . [ 5 ]
Alcohol idiosyncratic intoxication is an unusual condition that occurs when a small amount of alcohol produces intoxication that results in aggression , impaired consciousness , prolonged sleep , transient hallucinations , illusions , and delusions .
These episodes occur rapidly , can last from only a few minutes to hours , and are followed by amnesia .
Alcohol idiosyncratic intoxication often occurs in elderly persons and those with impaired impulse control .
Unlike alcoholism , alcohol - related psychosis lacks the in - depth research needed to understand its pathophysiology , demographics , characteristics , and treatment .
This article attempts to provide as much possible information for adequate knowledge of alcohol - related psychosis and the most up - to - date treatment .
Case examples
Case 1 : A 37 - year - old white male infantryman stationed in Iraq arrived at a field hospital complaining that his superior officer placed poisonous ants in his helmet .
His face is covered with excoriations from persistent scratching .
On further examination , he is stuporous and has mildly slurred speech , tremor , and mint odor to his breath .
Later his troop leader mentioned that his Humvee was littered with empty bottles of mouthwash and that the man has been reprimanded for falling asleep at his post .
After a night of rest , he discussed his excessive use of mouthwash in place of alcohol , which is the only available form of alcohol in Iraq .
Case 2 : At 5 pm you are asked to consult on a 44 - year - old white female who is 2 days postsurgical hysterectomy .
She is complaining of rabbits running across the room and demands the nurses stop intruding " every minute of every hour . "
She is tremulous , disoriented to time and place , and irritable .
A review of her laboratory data shows an elevated gamma - glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) and slightly elevated liver function test values .
White blood cell count is normal .
Urinalysis is normal and blood alcohol level is 0.01 .
Her medications , which were held prior to the surgery , included acamprosate 666 mg three times daily and clonazepam 1 mg 4 times a day .
Her sister later informs the nursing staff that this woman is usually on her fourth Manhattan cocktail by this hour of the day .
By now , we are used to hearing about our carbon footprint , but there ’s another term that ’s entering our environmental consciousness , and that ’s our water footprint .
Water footprint is the amount of water consumed either directly ( from our household usage ) or indirectly ( consumed during the production of goods and services that we use . )
photo by ezioman
“ Everyone understands that water is essential to life .
But many are only just now beginning to grasp how essential it is to everything in life â€ “ food , energy , transportation , nature , leisure , identity , culture , social norms , and virtually all the products used on a daily basis . ” – World Business Council for Sustainable Development ( WBCSD )
Do you know what your water footprint is ?
Water footprint can apply to individuals , families , businesses , cities , and nations , and the calculation also indicates the volume of water polluted over time due to the impact of industry or lifestyle .
There are several components to a water footprint : blue water , green water , and gray water .
Blue Water :
The volume of freshwater taken from ( or evaporated from ) the world ’s surface and groundwater .
Green Water : Water evaporated from water stored as soil moisture .
Grey Water ( a.k.a. greywater , gray water , etc. ) :
The amount of water polluted through the production and consumption of goods and services .
This volume also includes the amount of water necessary to dilute the pollutants to a level that maintains water quality standards .
There ’s another term relating to water footprint , which can apply to individuals , businesses , nations , or goods and services : Water - neutral ( similar to the term relating to carbon footprint , carbon - neutral ) .
Water neutral applies when the negative effects of water use ( or footprint ) have been reduced , mitigated , or offset .
Water offsets can be in the form of reclaiming the waste or gray water used , or funding an efficient water use or storage project off - site .
If you want to calculate the water footprint of your family or business ( and I certainly hope you do ) , use the Water Footprint Network ’s calculator and then take the steps necessary to reduce or offset your water usage .
Be sure to check out the water footprint of common consumables , such as coffee , beef , etc. while you ’re there .

Update : 2 pm CST : I 've rewritten most of the post to reflect the current status .
So , I made some Darwin artwork that parodies the famous Shepard Fairey Obama poster .
People started to find out , perhaps mostly due to a post on Pharyngula .
I had planned on selling the artwork on t- shirts and posters , and after a hasty setup , I now do indeed have a Zazzle storefront where you can purchase these fine Darwin wares .
Things to know about the merchandise :
All profits will be donated to NCSE .
As I 'm writing this , already over $ 130 $ 250 $ 550 $ 700 $ 1300 $ 4000 $ 8000 has been raised .
$ 8000 has been raised .
You can change the style and color of the shirts before ordering .
I have n't sampled the products from Zazzle before .
I hope the quality is good -- I have only heard good things about Zazzle unlike CafePress .
If you order something , let me know how it turns out .
No , I did not use one of those online Obama - poster - generators .
This was drawn by hand as a vector graphic so it will look good at any resolution .
Anyway , here are the designs :
PS : Yes , that long quote is not a Darwin quote but a Darrow quote .
Oh well , I think it is a great quote .
Note :
The commenters below are asking about the storefront , not because they are illiterate , but because the comments were left before the storefront was open , and I have updated the post since then .

An executable operational semantics for Python
The following article gives a taste of the work that I ’ve done for my master ’s thesis at the University of Utrecht under the supervision of Andres Löh .
If you are interested , feel free to have a look at the source files .
Introduction
Programming languages are often specified only in an informal manner ; in the available documentation , the language behaviour is described by examples and text .
Only the implementation , a compiler or interpreter , describes the exact semantics of constructs .
Python is no different .
It is described by an informal manual and a number of implementations .
Notably the original implementation CPython and PyPy , an implementation of Python in Python .
No systematic , formal descriptions of its semantics are available .
We developed a formal semantics for a comprehensive subset of Python called minpy .
The semantics are described in literate Haskell , which are compiled to an interpreter as well as a formal specification .
Rewriting an abstract machine
The operational semantics are defined by state transitions of an abstract machine .
A machine state consist of a heap Θ , an environment stack Γ , a control stack S , and an instruction ι.
State transitions are defined by rewrite rules that transform the machine state .
These rewrite rules have the following shape .
The heap represents the memory of the abstract machine .
It is a mapping of addresses to values .
Many different kinds of values are stored on the heap , for example integers , strings , lists and objects .
Even the environment is partly stored on the heap .
The environment Γ consists of a stack of addresses , which correspond with the scoping blocks that have been entered .
The addresses point to mappings on the heap , which in turn map variables to addresses .
The control stack is a stack of continuation frames , i.e. , frames that indicate what to do next .
One of the traditional functions of a control stack ( also known as call stack ) is to store the return pointer of a function call that is being executed .
The instruction is the abstract equivalent of a program counter .
The instruction can be a piece of a program , such as an expression , statement , or a complete block .
But , for example , when an expression has been evaluated it can also hold the resulting address .
Executing an assignment
To show what the rewrite rules look like we will have a look at the semantics of variable assignments .
Starting with the execution of a variable assignment statement x = e ; as instruction , a heap Θ , an environment Γ and a stack S .
The state is rewritten to a new state that is virtually the same , except that a stack frame x = o is pushed onto the control stack and the expression e is the new instruction .
The circle o in the new stack frame indicates that the expression which place it took , will be evaluated .
Once the expression has been evaluated , we end up with a state that has an address instruction a , a stack the assignment frame on top , an environment stack with an address γ₁ on top .
The address γ₁ on top of the environment stack points to the variables bound in the current scope .
In the new state , the mapping that contains the bindings is changed to include the new assignment .
The environment stack however , remains unchanged .
The top stack frame is removed and the result of the assignment statement is None , or rather an address pointing to None .
The changes to the heap are not very intuitive , so let us be more precise : the existing environment mapping bound at γ₁ is overwritten with the old mapping Θ ( γ₁ ) that itself has been extended with the mapping [ x → a ] .
The notation of Θ ( γ₁ ) represents the lookup of γ₁ on the heap Θ .
The circled addition operator extends the mapping on its left hand side with the mapping on its right hand side .
If the both sides of the circled addition operator have a mapping of the same variable or address , the right hand side takes precedence .
Literate programming
The semantics of minpy are described in literate Haskell , a syntax extension of Haskell that allows us to mix Haskell and LaTeX code in the same file .
The Haskell compiler GHC will , when confronted with a literate Haskell file , simply ignore all the Latex code .
Latex however , is not natively aware of the literate Haskell code , but can be instructed to include the Haskell code verbatim in the document .
To exploit the advantages of LaTeX typesetting , we preprocessed the literate Haskell sources with lhs2TeX .
This tool transforms Haskell source code into a nicely formatted LaTeX equation .
It handles horizontal alignment across multiple lines of code and allows us to customize the transformation through simple macros .
In order to hide all traces of Haskell from the formatted rewrite rules , we have pushed lhs2TeX to its limits .
To achieve the current results we introduced an additional preprocessing stage , implemented by a simple Perl script .
Furthermore , we had to accept certain restrictions on the Haskell vocabulary and adhere to a number of coding conventions .
For example , every state has to be on a single line to get proper alignment .
Some rules do not even fit on a 30 ″ monitor .
The resulting source code is nevertheless quite readable , especially when compared to any equivalent LaTeX code .
For instance , the above rule for variable binding is defined by the following code .
rewrite ( State ( heap ) ( envs :| : env_1 ) ( stack :| : AssFrame x ) ( BwResult a ) ) = ( state ( heap <+> [ env_1 |-> get heap env_1 <+> [ x |-> a ] ] ) ( envs :| : env_1 ) ( stack ) ( BwResult a_None ) )
Note that , while compiling the document requires several steps , GHC can still compile the source code in a single step .
This allows us to experiment with the semantics , while ignoring the presentation .
The interpreter
The sources of the thesis and some supporting code that implements a parser , pretty printer , and an interactive interpreter , can be compiled by the Haskell compiler GHC to produce an interpreter .
Like the interpreter of CPython , this interpreter has both a command - line modus and the ability to interpret files .
The following example shows a session of the interpreter in its command - line modus .
First , we declare the factorial function in a single function definition statement .
The statement is immediately executed if parsing succeeds .
Next , we call the factorial function without an argument , which results in a TypeError exception .
Finally we call it with a correct argument and exit the interpreter .
gideon@gideon - desktop :~$ minpy >>> def fac( x ) : ... if x <= 0 : ... return 1 ... else : ... return fac( x - 1 ) * x ... >>> fac() TypeError >>> fac( 4 ) 24 >>> exiting minpy
All this will be more than familiar to a Python programmer , except for the rather meager error message .
The minpy interpreter can also print a trace of the abstract machine revealing any changes after every rewrite step .
This has proven to be very useful when debugging the semantic rules .
The interpreter , and by proxy the semantics , was systematically tested by a test suite written in pure Python , or actually , minpy .
Executing the suite with CPython results in only one failed test , as it is the reference for our semantics .
Our interpreter still fails for 13 tests .
Scope of the semantics
As mentioned in the introduction , minpy includes a significant number of Python constructs .
Functions , generators , objects and classes , operators , exceptions , if , while , for , exec , and import statements are supported , although most only in a simplified form .
Class declarations , for instance , must always specify the bases of the class .
Currently , minpy does not have any garbage collection , support for concurrency or foreign functions .
It should also be noted that , while minpy does support multiple inheritance , the implementation of metaclasses is still incomplete .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts renewed his call for higher judicial pay on Wednesday , warning of long - term damage to the fabric of the courts .
Chief Justice John Roberts says federal judges were denied cost - of - living allowances .
In his annual year - end report , Roberts noted judges ' salaries have declined over the past two decades when measured against inflation , causing many judges to leave the bench for more lucrative jobs in the private sector .
Roberts , 53 , and other judges have said a crisis in the administration of justice could result if the bench cannot attract " judges who are the best of the best . "
" I must renew the judiciary 's modest petition : Simply provide cost - of - living increases that have been unfairly denied , " wrote Roberts .
" We have done our part -- it is long past time for Congress to do its . "
The last time judges received a substantial pay increase was 1991 , but they have received periodic increases designed to keep pace with inflation .
The chief justice noted his colleagues again were denied a cost - of - living allowance this year .
Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid , D - Nevada , insisted the increase be included in the auto bailout legislation considered in December , but it was dropped after some lawmakers objected .
Roberts complained that every federal employee , including all members of Congress , received a cost - of - living allowance this year , except for judges .
Lawmakers ' cost - of - living allowance increase was 2.8 percent , or $ 4,700 .
Congressional salaries are roughly on par with those of district court judges .
House and Senate committees earlier this year approved a 30 - percent pay increase for the federal judiciary , but Congress as a whole has not acted on the proposal .
Some members of Congress are cool to the idea of higher pay for federal judges , who are among the highest paid federal employees .
They also enjoy lifetime job security , and can retire at 65 with full salary after 15 years on the job .
Sen . Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said the judges were " rightfully dismayed that they were not even accorded a cost - of - living adjustment this year . "
" I share their disappointment and will continue working to enact the needed legislation to provide that adjustment , " he said .
Leahy lamented that his own bill on judicial compensation , which he said would have made up for the lack of cost - of - living allowances in previous years , failed to pass the House or the Senate , even though both Judiciary Committees reported the bill out .
" As the economic crisis has deepened , it will be harder to enact this measure , but these adjustments are no less important , " he said .
Higher pay has long been a crusade for Roberts and his predecessor , William Rehnquist .
Recent year - end reports have contained more pointed criticism of congressional inaction , but Roberts ' comments this year were relatively muted .
As chief justice , he has administrative oversight over the entire federal court system .
He is also the highest paid federal judge .
" The legal issues in today 's global , technology - driven economy are increasingly complex , and judges must respond with wisdom and skill acquired from study , reflection , and experience , " said Roberts .
" The government must attract and retain the finest legal minds , including accomplished lawyers who are already in high demand , to join the bench as a lifelong calling . "
Roberts proudly noted belt tightening in the federal courts , which submitted a budget calling for no new spending .
The third branch of government only makes up two - tenths of one percent of the $ 3 trillion annual U.S. budget .
He called that " miniscule . "
All About John Roberts ( Chief Justice ) • Judiciary • Patrick Leahy • Harry Reid
[ Pat Burns , communications director at Taxpayers Against Fraud ] put me in contact with John Wilke , senior investigative reporter for the Wall Street Journal 's Washington bureau .
Mr. Wilke and I would become friends over the next three years .
Unfortunately , as eager as Mr. Wilke was to investigate the Madoff story , it appears that the Wall Street Journal 's editors never gave him approval to start investigating .
As you will see from my extensive e-mail correspondence with him over the next several months , there were several points in time in which he was getting ready to book air travel to start the story and then would get called off at the last minute .
I never determined if the senior editors at the Wall Street Journal failed to authorize this investigation .
Barron's
Mr. Markopolos said that in December 2005 , he contacted a reporter at The Wall Street Journal , resulting in a number of phone calls and emails .
Mr. Markopolos said he thinks that senior editors prevented the reporter from the newspaper 's Washington bureau from flying to Boston to meet and discuss the Madoff issue .
A spokesman for Dow Jones & Co. , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , declined to comment on Mr. Markopolos 's statements .
Entirely possible , I guess , as not every tip goes that far up the ladder .
But then he says :
" Just look at the people the Journal has done tough stories on , " Steiger recalled .
" People that were much bigger than Madoff .
We would have loved to have done the story . "
A bombshell is buried in Harry Markopolos ' prepared testimony to a House panel today : he contacted the Wall Street Journal on the Bernie Madoff fraud three years ago , and the newspaper did nothing .
It seems that the Journal missed an opportunity to achieve one of the biggest scoops ever , win a Pulitzer Prize and all that other good stuff -- and extinguish the biggest fraud in financial history .
Markpolos says as follows : According to his timeline , he contacted the Journal in December 2005 .
The emails to which he alludes can be found here
At another point in his testimony , Markopolos pays the Journal the ultimate non-compliment by lumping together the newspaper with the lunkheads at the SEC , saying , " Unfortunately neither the Wall Street Journal nor SEC were inclined to even pick up a phone and dial any of the leads I provided to them .
" Amazing , huh ?
Not to me .
As I pointed out in Wall Street Versus America , in the mid-1990s " a few traders tried to arouse the interest of the Journal in the inside details of Mob infiltration of Wall Street firms -- and the Journal , after some initial interest , did nothing .
" Back then , the traders went to a highly regarded Journal reporter .
No point in mentioning his name , because the fault , as with Madoff , was apparently with his editors .
However , Markopolos ' experiences with journalists were n't all quite so dismal .
He contacted Michael Ocrant , a reporter at MAR / Hedge , who ran his own article on Madoff in 2001 , several days before the more widely reportedarticle on the same subject .
Greg Newton , now writer of the terrific Naked Shorts blog ( which alluded to the Journal 's failure yesterday ) , was publisher of MAR / Hedge at the time .
But back then Markopolos did n't have all the information he had developed by 2005 , which he was willing to give to the Wall Street Journal on a silver platter .
UPDATE ( 11:20 a.m. ) : Markopolos just raised the issue of his contacts with the Journal at the hearing , saying " I believe that senior editors of the Journal respected and feared Mr. Madoff " and would n't let him " get on the plane " and meet with him on the fraud .
So I guess the cat is out of the bag , unless the media continue to ignore this intriguing aspect of the Madoff story .
Would my alma mater and the WSJ 's competitor , Business Week , have done any better ?
In 2000 - 2001 , with longtime finance editors Seymour Zucker and Bill Wolman on the job , I 'd say definitely yes .
They were tough as nails , and had the guts to tackle such a story .
It 's the editors who count in such situations at least as much as reporters .
That cuts both ways .
Whenever I proposed a tough article at the magazine , these two gents always had to wage World War III in order to get it printed .
Some editors at BW , even at the highest levels , hated investigative stories ( until a month or two after they were published .
Then they 'd love 'em ! ) .
Seymour and Bill retired in 2001 , and I do n't really know whether their successors as of 12/2005 would have had much appetite for a complicated story like this with a high - visibility , respected target .
My gut instinct is that the reaction would have been the same as at the Journal .
UPDATE : The Journal , to its credit , mentions Markopolos ' testimony concerning the paper in its online story today : Former Journal managing editor Paul Steiger told Editor & Publisher that he " does n't recall " an approach from Markopolos .
I agree with him until he says " We would have loved . . "
The Journal was approached by the same whistleblower who caused members of Congress to scream at the top of their lungs at SEC officials yesterday , and nothing was done to pursue the story .
I think that readers of the Journal deserve a better answer than that . ©

World biggest pool
Biggest swimming pool in the world is located at The hotel San Alfonso del Mar in Chil .
It covers more than 20 acres and clear water transparent to a depth of 35 meters and holds 66 million gallons of water .
Building tooks 5 yers and cost nearly USD 2 billion and the annual maintenance is USD 4 million .
What is most interesting to me about this pool , is that hes just few steps from the ocean 🙂

Funambol Unveils Its Open Source v8 MobileWe Sync Software
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 10 , 2009
Today , Funambol , a provider of open source push and mobile sync software , officially introduced the next generation of its MobileWe platform .
Funambol 's v8 MobileWe software looks a bit different from its predecessors , and with good reason .
This release sports a new AJAX web portal and integrates some very visual features .
The new portal was designed to better facilitate syncing PIM ( contact and calendar ) data , email and multimedia files between mobile devices , the internet , and desktop computers .
Those who are familiar with Funambol 's software likely picked up on the other new feature from that last sentence :
The v8 MobileWe software supports image syncing between devices .
The new release will also feature enhanced smartphone clients for Windows Mobile , Blackberry , Android , and Symbian phones , enhanced support for a number of additional SyncML phones , and continuous Google and Yahoo ! import capabilities .
Funambol 's v8 MobileWe is scheduled for release in the second quarter of 2009 , but Funambol will be giving sneak previews at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week .
One of the most appealing things about Funambol -- in addition to , and because of its openness -- is its ability to get devices to connect and exchange information regardless of platform .
As Funambol continues to foster its support business , its free portal , and its developer community , it could make it that open source mobile services are n't seen simply as " the alternative " -- it could be that open source will become the industry standard .
If you 've never done it before , the idea of building a computer from the ground up can seem very intimidating — but it 's one of the most satisfying projects a tech enthusiast can take on .

Update :
We 've got a much larger , more detailed , and up - to - date guide on building your own computer here .
This article has some great reasons on why you might want to build over buy , but when it comes time to get your hands dirty , check out our new guide for the step - by - step .

Being more of a software gal than a hardware geek myself , I was the only Lifehacker editor who had never built a PC from scratch .
So when I needed a new PC late last year , I took the plunge and built my custom system .
I 'm so glad I did — the project turned out to be one of my proudest accomplishments of 2008 .
If you 've cracked open your PC before to install a new hard drive or TV capture card , but you 've never built a whole new system from the ground up , it 's not as difficult as you might think .
Here are my notes for first - timers who want to build instead of buy their next computer .
Why Build Instead of Buy
" But computers are so cheap these days , " you say .
" Why waste the time and energy building your own system when you can get a great machine fully assembled and shipped to your door ? "
That 's a great question .
Building your own PC will not save you time .
It might save you money , but that 's not even the best reason to do it .
For me , it was a fantastic hands - on educational experience .
It gives me a deep sense of satisfaction every single day when I press the power button on my tower , watch it light up , and know that I plugged in the wire that goes from that light to the motherboard .
Building your PC takes the mystery out of what 's going on inside that black box you spend hours on per day .
Advertisement
There are other good reasons to build instead of buy , too .
With your own build you can customize your system just how you like and make your perfect media center or gaming machine .
You can save money if you already have some parts ( though see my warnings on the dangers of a " Frankenbuild " below ) .
Upgrading your PC in the future becomes easier and cheaper since your parts are n't tied to a particular manufacturer .
With a custom build you can do fun stuff like overclock your CPU and get more bang for your buck , or install OS X where it was never intended to run .

In short , building your own PC makes you feel like a badass .

What You 're Getting Into
Do n't get me wrong , though : building a PC ( for the first time especially ) takes research , time , gumption , patience , and a willingness to deal with several WTF moments .
If you 've never cracked a PC's case and installed parts , like a new hard drive or a video card , start there first .
If you 've got that experience under your belt , you might think that building a new PC is just a matter of snapping together a few parts .
It is , but building from the ground up takes much more than an hour or two .
My build took two full days , one online order , one returned motherboard , two trips to Fry's , one condescending sneer from a sales associate when I asked a newb question , and one trip to Radio Shack .
If that sounds like a lot , well , it was , and there were moments in the process when I wished I 'd just bought a Dell .
But when it finally all came together , all the sweat makes the results even sweeter .

Where to Start : Researching and Buying Your Parts
You scared off yet ?
No ?
Good .
Let 's get down to it .
There are a gadzillion articles on the internet about building your own PC , but many are way out of date , or just do n't get specific about what exactly you should buy .
When I had to start researching what parts to purchase , of course I turned to savvy Lifehacker readers to help me out .
Several readers mentioned Ars Technica 's excellent system buyer 's guide , which breaks down exactly what parts you 'd want for one of three levels of computer : a " budget box , " a " hot rod , " or a " God box . "
The 2008 guide published last fall ; make sure you use the most recent one when you start your research .
I started by plugging parts from Ars ' " hot rod " system list into Newegg to get a sense of price and see if there were any deals , coupons or upgrades .
In the end I did n't use Ars ' exact recommendations , but it was an awesome , up - to - date , jumping - off point .
Advertisement
Your research into parts is the most important stage of the process .
For first - timers it can be bewildering , and you will have questions .
Just keep reading , take notes , consult with forums or sales associates , and remember that if you make the wrong purchase you can always return it for the right one .
In the photo to the left you 'll see my build 's case , motherboard , power supply , CPU , and RAM .
( I had a video card , DVD drive , and a hard drive from an old machine I planned to use in my new build . )

See this entire comment thread for more resources on deciding what parts to buy for your budget .

Get Down and Dirty
Once you 've got your hot little hands on all the parts you need , the real fun begins .
There are two stages to your build : the hardware stage , and the software stage .
Adam 's already covered how to install each individual hardware component .
Here 's the list :
Once you 've got everything plugged in and mounted inside your case , leave the case sides off and plug in your keyboard , mouse , monitor , and power , and press the On button .
This is the moment of truth .
The first time you see the lights come on and the system setup appear on - screen , you 'll feel like you 've just arrived at the top of Mount Everest .
Advertisement
If the machine does n't power on , or there 's no video signal , or the keyboard does n't work — just unplug everything and check your connections .
It took me a few hair - pulling , teeth - gnashing attempts to get my new build to boot properly .
If it does n't work the first time , take a breath , unplug it all , and try again .
Do n't cry ; that wo n't help .
Once you 're into the machine 's BIOS setup , key around and make sure the motherboard recognizes your DVD or CD drive and your hard drive .
You 'll need those working in order to install your operating system .
Everything there ?
Now set your boot sequence to check your optical drive first .
Insert your operating system 's disc into your CD or DVD drive , and restart the machine .
Now your operating system 's setup will launch on boot , and you can install away .

In the meantime , blast very loud rock music , strut about the vicinity , arms upraised , and revel in your greatness .
Mistakes I Made That You Can Avoid
When you build your first PC , keep a few things in mind I wished I 'd realized before I started .

Beware of the " Frankenbuild . "
A great way to save money on your new PC is using parts that you 've already got around .
But I was overly optimistic about what items from my very old Dell tower would work in my new system .
I assumed my hard drive would work ( it did , but it was an IDE drive , which I wound up replacing with a faster SATA model ) , I hoped my video card would work ( it did n't ) , and I thought my DVD drive would work ( it did ) .
In the end I wound up buying parts I thought I 'd be able to reuse , so my total price was n't as low as my initial estimate .

Expect mishaps .
I bought the wrong motherboard .
Well , not the wrong one , but one that did n't have a FireWire port , which I wanted .
Well , I had a FireWire card , but it did n't fit into the motherboard .
Anyway , I figured all this out after I installed the CPU , which meant I had to remove it from the board , break the thermal compound seal , and ship the motherboard back .
When I got the new motherboard and reinstalled the CPU , because the thermal compound left there did n't work anymore , the machine would start and within 10 seconds overheat and shut itself off .
Next thing you know I 'm scraping hardened thermal compound off the CPU with Goof Off and a credit card

Do n't do that .
Open and read the full - on manual that comes in the box with every single one of your parts .
If you 're not sure about something said manual includes , do your research before you plug anything in .

I wrongly assumed I 'd be able to finish my build in a day , but it took two whole days and stressed me out because they were work days .
Do n't build a new PC when you 're on deadline or otherwise pinched for time .
Give yourself a whole weekend and a clean and spacious work area that you can leave filled with packing debris and electronic parts strewn about for a few days .

Two weeks ago , Netflix and LG unveiled their recent HD love child – a new TV that can stream HD quality content from Netflix without a set - top box .
There will be no need for a bulky box that sits among the orgy of DVRs , DVD players , VHS players ( God forbid ) and stacks of unorganized DVDs that are waiting to be scratched to the point of being unreadable .
There will simply be a TV and an Ethernet jack – simplicity worthy of an Absolut Vodka ad brandishing their token slogan “ In an Absolut World . ”
It is this sort of ingenuity that has thrust Netflix to the forefront of the DVD rental business .
In 12 short years , Netflix has grown its customer base to 8.2 M subscribers and leads all online retailers in customer satisfaction .
This innovative drive towards excellence begs one question : “ Why is Blockbuster failing ... miserably ? ”
Below , is a closer look at Blockbuster ’s 5 biggest foul - ups .
Ignorant complacency – Winston Churchill once said “ However beautiful the strategy , you should occasionally look at the results . ”
Blockbuster should have paid attention in history class .
While a solid brick and mortar ( B& M ) strategy carried them through the nineties , it was a strategy that did not leave them flexible to react effectively to changes in the marketplace .
Blatant disregard to Gen - Y – Advancements in content delivery equate to higher efficiencies for consumers .
If Echo Boomers are enamored with streamlining their lives , then a business needs to be responsive and work to fulfill those wants / needs in order to be successful .
Trying to force - feed Echo Boomers a B&M solution to their media needs just wo n’t cut it .
Poor customer satisfaction - Blockbuster is to late fees what Bono is to crazy sunglasses .
No matter what else the biz / person may do that is positive , all the consumer can focus on is those darn sunglasses .
One foot in – One foot out - Kudos to Blockbuster for FINALLY attempting to take on Netflix a couple years back with their Total - Access program .
The only problem is - there ’s a greater probability of getting drunk off O’Doul ’s than Total - Access actually posing a threat to Netlix .
The reasoning : Blockbuster is still trying to dominate the B&M biz while trying to launch a movies - by - mail biz model simultaneously , effectively neglecting both children - someone should contact child welfare services .
Reactive business Environment -
It took them 9 years to develop an internet - based DVD subscription service to compete with Netflix !
Need I say more ?
Edited by FerFAL to add :
Thanks Don for the interesting comment .
In my experience motion sensors , ( WELL placed and distributed ) , with a properly programmed alarm are a combination pretty much impossible to defeat .
As always machines hardly fails , human error is the most common cause .
What you need to do is make sure that the main panel is also covered by motion sensors .
The most common problems in my experience are :
1 ) Going cheap on the motion sensors .
Buying ones of low quality is a common mistake .
Also wanting to save money and not covering a certain area .
That area will be picked clean .
Robbers somehow end up knowing what ’s protected and what ’s not .
2 ) Improperly placed sensors .
3 ) Sensors set to a very low level of sensitivity , or too far away .
Usually the real effective range they have is just ½ of what the manufacturer swears by .
4 ) Also telling employees about the password .
Very common mistake .
Leaks like these end up in robberies .
5 ) Another common one is thinking robbers will just run away as soon as the alarm goes off .
Many times they do nothing , that ’s why the alarm should call you and the cops .
6 ) Occasionally they cut the phone lines and this is pretty effective and smart .
But you can prevent this by having it connected to a hidden cell phone .
7 ) They sometimes brake or disable the siren or bell .
Preferably you ’ll have two , at least one of them well hidden .
As you say , it should not be a reason to stop being alert , but I find it to be a good layer of security , specially for when you are not home .
Dog post coming up soon :)

Don Williams said ...1 ) I do n't like security systems -- they and security companies lure you into dropping your guard by giving you the ILLUSION of security .
In reality , there are ways to bypass many of them .
An unpleasant surprise when you get home .
2 ) I do n't want to discuss details on the internet , but magnetic contact switches , for example , can be detected with a stud finder or compass and compromised with a strong magnet ( holds switch closed while door with security magnet is opened . )
There are special contact switches made which can't be compromised in this matter .
They have an internal switch on a seesaw balance beam which will close an alarm switch if subjected to any magnetic field other than the one for which they are precisely calibrated .
3 ) Any security system is rigid -- not intelligent and not adaptive -- and hence vulnerable to attack .
I 'm not saying to not get one -- they are better than nothing -- but do n't think they are infallible and try to learn something about their shortcoming so that you can distinguish between a good security company and one that 's just taking your money .
4 ) Plus , if you get a security system , be sure that each sensor has a resistor where it connects to the two wires leading to the alarm box -- so that someone can't simply bridge the two wires with a short ( allowing a sensor to go off without the alarm box recognizing it . )
Also , do n't use the security system 's standard resistor -- thieves can find out what it is and use one to short the connecting wires .
Rather , split the resistence up into two resistors -- put one resistor at where the two wires connect to the alarm box and put the other resistor at where the sensor connects to the two wires .
5 ) A good dog -- trained to NOT accept food from strangers -- is better if kept behind closed doors .
In difficult times , of course , it can be tough finding food for the dog -- although a good little lapdog like Paris Hilton 's chilahua is just as good as a Rottweiler when sounding an alarm .
A dog and security system together give multiple layers of detection -- but the security system has to allow you to turn off interior motion sensors in areas where the dog is roaming at night .
6 ) Another thing to be aware of is that lots of lockpicking info is available on the internet .
There are some locks made ( Medeco , Abloy , etc ) which are essentially impossible to pick .
Ever the average lock can be made much harder to pick by having the locksmith install special pins .
7 )
Finally , look at the ENTIRE perimeter around your house .
Our cheap stick frame houses in the USA have walls which can be cut through with an axe no matter how strong your front door is .
Sliding deck doors can be lifted up out of their frames .
And some thieves come in through the ROOF / Attic -- which bypasses first floor alarms .
A number of security companies do the business equivalent of selling a condom with a hole in it .
May be a small hole -- may work some of the time .
But when it fails -- uh oh .
And some companies do the equivalent of selling a condom with SEVERAL holes in it .
A prominent Muslim scholar in Saudi Arabia has warned that those using alcohol - based biofuels in their cars could be committing a sin .
The warning was issued by Sheikh Mohamed Al - Najimi , a member of the Islamic Fiqh Academy , an institute that studies Islamic jurisprudence for the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , an international group with a permanent delegation to the United Nations .
According to the Al Arabiya News Channel , an international news outlet based in Dubai , United Arab Emirates , Mr. Najim directed his warning to Saudi youths studying abroad .
Al Arabiya notes that Najimi stressed that this warning was not an official fatwa , or religious edict , just his personal opinion .
Najimi added that the issue " needs to be studied by the relevant religious bodies . "
Ethanol , a common type of biofuel , is made of the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages , and its production is similar to that of hard liquor .
Plant matter is fermented using yeast , and the result is distilled to increase the concentration of alcohol .
Fuels with high concentrations of ethanol – the most common being E85 , a gasoline blend with 85 percent ethanol – can be used in flex - fuel vehicles , which make up more than seven million of the roughly 250 million passenger cars and trucks on America ’s roads .
Most gasoline sold in the United States contains about 10 percent ethanol .
The fuel is more common in many Latin American countries , particularly Brazil .
In addition to beverages and biofuels , ethanol is a widely used in industry for its properties as a solvent and an antiseptic .
It 's a common component of perfumes and paints .
The chemical is also necessary in the production of vinegar – one of the Prophet Muhammad 's favorite seasonings .
The Koran prohibits consumption of alcohol in three separate verses that were written over a period of several years .
The first mention occurs in 4:43 , in which Muslims are told that they must not pray while intoxicated .
A verse written later – 2:219 – says that in wine and gambling " is great sin , and some profit , for men ; but the sin is greater than the profit . "
Finally , in 5:90 - 91 , intoxicants and gambling are called " an abomination " and " Satan 's handiwork " :
Satan 's plan is ( but ) to excite enmity and hatred between you , with intoxicants and gambling , and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah , and from prayer : will ye not then abstain ?
This admonition is waived in the hereafter , apparently : Many passages in the Islamic holy book describe heaven as having rivers of wine .
Ironically , it was Muslim chemists who introduced distillation to the West .
The process of distilling pure ethanol from wine was perfected by 8th - and 9th - century Persian chemists , who used it to create perfumes and eyeliner .
Their writings were translated by European scholars in the 12th century , and the process was used to make potable spirits .
The word " alcohol " is itself of Arabic origin .
Twelve years ago , Irving Weissman discovered a treatment that might have saved the lives of thousands of women with advanced breast cancer , but pharmaceutical companies were n't interested in developing the therapy .
Though that interest is finally being reignited , Weissman does n't pull any punches .
" I hate to say I told you so , " he said .
break Weissman , a professor of pathology and developmental biology at Stanford University , spoke Wednesday and Thursday as part of the Columbia University Department of Religion 's Bampton Lecture series .
The lecture series is modeled after a centuries - old Oxford series of the same name , and invites famous authorities in their respective fields to give talks on various issues of interest to the religious community .
In Wednesday 's lecture , Weissman laid out the conceptual foundation of his work — that stem cells are rare , self - renewing , and can regenerate body tissues .
Weissman repeatedly expressed frustration that while many of his discoveries seemed to hold remarkable potential for life - saving treatments , commercial or regulatory hurdles have prevented his scientific research from benefiting human beings .
One example is Weissman 's mid-'90s research on type I diabetes , in which he demonstrated the ability to fully cure type I diabetes in mice using stem cells .
But even though the experiments avoided political controversy by using so - called adult stem cells , which do not come from embryos , Weissman ran into a road block when pharmaceutical companies refused to sponsor clinical trials .
The therapy went nowhere .
Weissman implied that the pharmaceutical companies had put profit over principle , preferring to keep diabetes sufferers dependent on costly insulin than to cure them once and for all .
" He [ Weissman ] has a long history of being at the forefront of his field , " Arthur Palmer , professor of structural biology at Columbia said , remarking that Weissman has never been afraid to challenge scientific orthodoxy .
One example of this iconoclastic streak is Weissman 's outspoken disagreement with recent reports that adult stem cells can be " reprogrammed , " obliviating the need for the more powerful embryonic stem cells .
Weissman geared his presentation to a lay audience , only occasionally drifting into jargon .
Jaffer Kolb , who was visiting his sister at Columbia , enjoyed Weissman 's talk .
" I have no science background , " he said , " so I was afraid I would have a hard time .
But it was really easy to follow . "
The presentation left some audience members with questions .
Susan Doubileg , a Columbia alumna , wondered if Weissman 's results were as conclusive as presented .
" If they were so useful , why were n't they picked up in other countries ? " she asked , referring to Europe 's less restrictive stem cell regulations .
Nonetheless , Palmer cautioned against dismissing Weissman 's research .
" He 's been right a lot in the past , " he said .
Weissman 's final two lectures are scheduled for Jan. 27 and Jan. 29 , from 5 p.m. -7 p.m. in IAB 1501 .

The 1937 Bugatti gathered dust in a garage for 47 years .
Pic Bonhams
A classic Bugatti car , which gathered dust in a Tyneside garage for almost 50 years , may fetch up to £ 3 m ( $ 4.35 m ) when it goes under the hammer .
Relatives of reclusive Newcastle doctor Harold Carr found the 1937 Type 57S Atalante in a garage after he died .
Now the classic car , thought to be one of just 17 built , is to be sold by Bonhams in Paris next month .
It was originally owned by Earl Howe - first president of the British Racing Drivers ' Club .
Dr Carr , a former army surgeon , left the contents of a lock - up garage to his family when he died in 2007 .
As well as the Bugatti , his nephew also discovered a classic Aston Martin , and a Jaguar E - type in the lock - up .
The nephew , an engineer from Newcastle , said : " We just ca n't believe it .
" Of course we 're delighted and we 're going to make sure the money is shared out among the family .
It 's a wonderful thing to leave . "
Only 17 Bugatti Type 57S Atalantes were built .
Pic Bonhams Earl
Howe took delivery of the sporty two - seat Atalante after it was completed in 1937 and kept the car for eight years .
After Earl
Howe sold it , it changed hands a couple of times before Dr Carr bought the car in 1955 from Lord Ridley , a member of the Northumberland gentry .
He drove the car for the first few years , but in 1960 it was parked in his garage where it remained until his death .
James Knight , international head of Bonhams ' motoring department , said : " I have known of this Bugatti for a number of years and , like a select group of others , had n't dared divulge its whereabouts to anyone .
HAVE YOUR SAY I inherited a 100 year old ring that has been in my family for generations .
Its monetary value is probably quite low , but its the only family heirloom I have N Moose , Stratford upon Avon , United Kingdom " It is absolutely one of the last great barn discoveries .
" The Atalante is incredibly original and , although she requires restoration , it is ' restoration ' in the true sense of the word .
" It offers a truly rewarding project to the new owner - who will join a select list of distinguished owners - to play such an integral part in bringing this wonderful motor car back to life . "
The car has a remarkably low mileage with an odometer reading of just 26,284 .
The Bugatti 57S is a highly coveted car by collectors , with at least four thought to belong to the Musee Nationale de L'Automobile in Mulhouse , France .
Others remain in the hands of private collectors .

An Extensive , But Not Comprehensive , Look At Finding Files
The Problem
Finding files can be a tricky business .
If you have a number of different directories where your files can be stored , how can you open a particular file as quickly as possible .
The standard find - file interface is pretty good if you ’re already in the correct directory as it will do tab completion on anything you have already typed in similar to how a decent shell will .
ido improves this interface .
If you enter part of a filename that has already been seen , even if it is in a different directory it will be offered to you .
I enable flex - matching so that ido will match files containing the characters which have been entered anywhere so long as they are in the correct sequence .
e.g. eod will match hello - world .c.
( ido - mode t ) ( setq ido - enable - flex - matching t ) ( setq ido - create - new - buffer ' always )
I understand that icicles does even better here , enabling you to filter out matches but as I ’m not ( yet ) using it myself , I ca n’t say much more about it .
If you need more help in finding your files , what other options are there ?
Bookmarks
I had n’t heard of Bookmarks before I saw a a post on them recently .
I use them in conjunction with directory aliases .
From the emacs manual :
Bookmarks are somewhat like registers in that they record positions you can jump to .
Unlike registers , they have long names , and they persist automatically from one Emacs session to the next .
The prototypical use of bookmarks is to record “ where you were reading ” in various files .
Filecache
Sacha Chua wrote a post about navigating your source tree using ido and filecache .
I ’m not sure what additional benefits
filecache offers over vanilla ido as ido finds files in other directories too .
Tags
The traditional way for finding function definitions is with Emacs Tags .
Once you have generated the tags file you can go from call site to function definition with M-. ( find - tag ) .
When I go on holiday I leave a link to the current method I am working on in an orgfile .
Then when I come back , I can click on the current work link and press M-. and I ’ll be right back where I left off .
[ [ SomeClass : : SomeMethod ] [ Current Work ] ] * Work Projects *** A Specific Project SomeClass :: SomeMethod
Some notes about what I was doing ...
I set the tags file so I do n’t need to find that file .
( setq tags - file - name " / path/to/tags / file " )
( require ' ido ) ( require ' dired ) ( defconst * web- top* " ~/websites " ) ( defun web ( path ) ( concat * web - top* path ) )
dired - dirs is an associating list mapping aliases to directories .
I need to use ( list ... ) to construct it so that ( web ... ) expands correctly .
( defconst * dired - dirs * ( list ( cons " mrc- theme " ( web " / blog/mrc/wp-content/themes /mrc " ) ) ( cons " mrc- pages " ( web " / pages /mrc " ) ) ( cons " webtest " ( web " / test " ) ) ) ) ( defconst * dired - aliases * ( mapcar ( lambda ( e ) ( car e ) ) * dired- dirs * ) )
dired - open - alias uses ido-completing - read to choose between the aliases I defined earlier .
( defun dired - open - alias ( &optional alias ) ( interactive ) ( unless alias ( setq alias ( ido - completing - read " Alias : " * dired - aliases * nil t ) ) ) ( if ( and ( stringp alias ) (> ( length alias ) 0 ) ) ( let ( ( pair ( assoc alias * dired - dirs * ) ) ) ( if pair ( dired ( cdr pair ) ) ( error " Invalid alias %s " alias ) ) ) ( error " Invalid alias %s " alias ) ) )
I really like f2 as a prefix key .
The default binding is related to two - column mode , which I never use , and you can use it without pressing shift , ctrl or alt .
I have this defined in my - defaults.el ( which probably is n’t strictly necessary but at least it names the prefix map ) .
( defvar f2 - prefix - map nil ) ( setq f2- prefix - map ( make - sparse - keymap ) ) ( global - set - key [ f2 ] f2-prefix -map )
< f2 > d calls up the list of directory aliases .
( global - set - key ( kbd " < f2 > d " ) ' dired-open-alias )
I.O.U.S.A. Misses Point Moviegoers should save $ 12.50 , buy gold and avoid taxes

The American empire , like the Roman one , is heading for a fall , and an out - of - control government deficit is one of the reasons .
However , destruction by deficit is not fait accompli , if Peter Peterson , David Walker and the Concord Coalition have anything to do about it .
Peterson and Walker like their government after all .
Peterson was United States Secretary of Commerce and Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations , and is the Senior Chairman of the politically connected private equity firm , Blackstone Group .
Walker was Comptroller General of the United States and head of the General Accounting Office .
The Concord Coalition is an organization founded by the late former Sens. Paul Tsongas ( D - Mass . ) and Warren Rudman ( R - N.H. ) , along with Peterson .
Concord added former Sen. Bob Kerrey ( D - Neb. ) in 2002 .
Not exactly a confederation of anarcho - capitalists .
I had high hopes for the documentary film I.O.U.S.A. , because it was conceived of , co-written and executive produced by Agora Financial ’s Addison Wiggin , co-author with Bill Bonner of the excellent book Empire of Debt .
When the movie finally started , the opening credits even indicated that the documentary was based on the book .
I wish .
Bonner and Wiggin wrote that the purpose of empire was to show that the United States is headed for trouble .
And ,  their burden is only to show that the people making important policy decisions are morons and frauds . 
I.O.U.S.A. shows that the United States is in trouble all right , but instead of politicians and central bankers being outed as crooks and mountebanks , the likes of Bill Clinton and Paul Volker are treated as heroes .
Ex -Fed Chair Alan Greenspan is made to look like an idiot by Ron Paul in one clip and by comedian Jon Stewart in another , yet the filmmakers continually go back for sound bites from him and ex-Fed governor Alice Rivlin as authority figures .
The film even claimed that one Federal Reserve mandate is to keep inflation low .
Good grief , the Fed creates inflation .
Empire of Debt cited gold 23 times , government debt 19 times and David Walker only once , Stephen Fairfax noted on the LewRockwell.com blog .
But the movie made no mention of gold and makes David Walker out to be the nation ’s savior .
I.O.U.S.A. is essentially a buddy - movie with Walker and Concord ’s Executive Director Robert Bixby hitting the road to alarm Americans into holding their elected officials accountable .
So there are plenty of scenes in the car , in the banquet rooms and being interviewed by local TV stations that do n’t air their story .
Interspersed amongst these action sequences are person - on - the - street interviews that make the point that the average Joe and Jane do n’t know or care about the goings on with the government budget .
If billionaire Warren Buffett has his way , the great unwashed and uninformed will pay the $ 12.50 they saved by not seeing the movie to the government in taxes .
After I.O.U.S.A. concluded , CNBC ’s Squawk Box honey Becky Quick moderated a panel of wise ones live from Omaha , led by Tout TV ’s favorite guru , Buffett .
The panel assured everyone that government Ponzi- scheme Social Security would be there when they retire .
The Cato Institutes ’ freedom - loving chairman William Niskanen even thinks people should be forced to save for retirement .
Bill Novelli , CEO of AARP , believes the five guys on the panel could solve all of the country ’s problems .
And more than one panelist blamed everything on partisanship in Washington .
If our representatives in this great republic could just learn to get along , everything will work out fine , was the claim .
After all , America has faced greater challenges and triumphed .
But by far the most annoying was the Omaha Oracle , who continually piped in that the budget deficits are n’t that big a deal , but that trade deficits are , and that future generations of Americans will live better than the present generation , as long as Americans will pay enough in taxes to keep this good American thing going .
We are lucky to be born here , according to Buffett , but he is unhappy that he pays a lower tax rate than his cleaning lady .
No doubt she is , too .
The main message of the film — that , by the way , was purchased by The Peter G. Peterson Foundation last month — is that all of this debt will swamp our ship of state ,  and that the trade deficit will lead to less leverage in matters overseas .
So , pay more taxes , and urge your congressman to decrease government spending .
Instead , moviegoers should spend their time reading Wiggins and Bonner ’s book , buying gold and avoiding taxes .

Although developer Bethesda has neither confirmed nor denied the rumor according to which The Elder Scrolls 6 might be hitting the game market in a few years , many excited fans already took to the Internet to speculate about how the game might be .
The rumors about the launch of the next installment in Bethesda ’s beloved game series initially started last year , but quickly died down due to lack of official statements on the part of the renowned developer .
However , with Microsoft ’s Project Xbox Scorpio being set to hit the console market soon , the rumors have been revived , and now we ’re all hoping that The Elder Scrolls 6 will come with both VR support and multiplayer mode .
These are the two most talked about possible new features that Bethesda ’s elusive game will have , if we were to believe what people are saying on forums .
However , it ’s very important to remember that these are just rumors , and should not be taken at face value .
After all , anyone with a keyboard can start spreading speculation about anything on the Internet these days .
That does n’t mean that everything you hear is necessarily true , so take everything with a grain of salt .
Bethesda is known to already have a great number of games currently in development , so maybe The Elder Scrolls 6 is completely out of the books so far .
As far as the developer ’s priorities go , they do n’t seem to be in any kind of hurry to put out a sequel for Skyrim , everyone ’s favorite game over the last years .
But would n’t it be great if they did so ?
If The Elder Scrolls 6 will be as awesome as people want to believe it will , then we ’re surely in a for a treat .
Hopefully Bethesda gives an official statement soon .

Hugo Chavez want to say something about Bush !
As much as people like to deny it , there is something about a negative album review that can sway the public consciousness .
A bad review in the right publication can seal an album 's fate as a bargain bin throwaway before it even has a chance .
Often times , the harsh criticism is more than warranted .
Not everything can be a gem .
But every once in awhile , the critics get it wrong .
Horribly , horribly wrong .
For example ...
5. Gene Clark - No Other No Other was former Byrds songwriter Gene Clark 's masterpiece .
Released in 1974 , the album was a departure from the stark acoustic sounds of his previous , relatively unsuccessful , solo records .
Everything was lined up for No Other to be a commercial breakthrough .
Clark had spent over a year working on the songs before recording them .
He was signed to Asylum Records , at the time an absolute breeding ground for successful singer - songwriter types .
The album should have been huge .
Back Then ...
The response to No Other from critics was less like Clark delivered a bad album and more like he delivered the anti-christ .
The album made extensive use of overdubs and studio techniques to produce a sound that was foreign to most listeners .
Because of this , the album was decried as bloated , pretentious and overproduced .
But when Fleetwood Mac employed the same studio and performance techniques a year later on their self - titled album ( and on the follow up , Rumours ) it was hailed as a masterpiece .
Gene Clark was unfortunately a bit ahead of his time .
In 1976 , No Other was deleted and would not be released again for almost 25 years .
The fallout all but destroyed Clark 's career .
And Now ...
These days , No Other is almost universally hailed as a lost treasure .
There is some debate about Clark 's state of mind during the writing and recording of the album .
Depending on who you ask , he was either tripping on mescaline the whole time or he was stone sober .
Whatever the case , Clark 's newfound experimentalism made for the most compelling work of his career .
The songs themselves , when taken as individual parts , are n't in and of themselves Clark 's best ever .
He was the strongest songwriter in The Byrds and there is some absolute gold out there .
But as a cohesive piece of work , No Other is undeniably epic and absolutely essential listening .
4. The Rolling Stones - Exile On Main St. The Rolling Stones Exile On Main St. is an epic roots - rock goldmine .
It features some of their most beloved hits ever ( " Tumblin ' Dice , " " Sweet Virginia , " " Happy " ) and a ton of lesser known gems ( " Rocks Off , " " Torn and Frayed " ) .
Listening to it now , it 's hard to imagine there was a time when it was n't absolutely adored by everybody .
But you 'd be surprised .
Back Then ...
Commercially , Exile ... was a smash right out of the gates .
But the critical response was far less enthusiastic .
It was viewed as a bloated , ragged record that found the Stones resting on their laurels and not challenging the listener with anything new .
Some even accused the band of just replaying the same song 18 different ways .
Basically , Exile ... was seen as a placeholder .
In the words of Rolling Stone reviewer Lenny Kaye , " the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come . "
And Now ...
In the years since its initial chilly critical reception , Exile On Main St. has grown considerably in status .
The fans always loved it , but the critics eventually came around also .
Pick a greatest - albums - of - all - time list and there is a good chance you 'll find Exile ... on it .
In 1998 , Q Magazine ranked it number 42 on their list of the greatest albums of all time .
Even Rolling Stone , as they are often apt to do , went back on their initial dismissal of the record .
On their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time , Exile On Main St. was number seven .
3 . The Ramones - The Ramones
It 's almost impossible to accurately state what kind of influence The Ramones have had on , not just punk , but popular music in general .
They were punk before anyone knew what it was .
Their songs , almost always less than three minutes long , emphasized raw rock power and feeling and fun over technical proficiency .
And people ate it up .
Eventually .
Back Then ...
The initial reaction to The Ramones music was , basically , non existent .
Their debut album did n't even crack the Billboard top 100 .
As for the critics , reviews tended to be neutral at best , if the album was even reviewed at all .
With most everything else on this list , you can dig up some vintage reviews to get a feel for what people thought back then .
A vintage Ramones review , on the other hand , is hard to come by .
Lester Bangs dug them though .
Take that for whatever you will .
And Now ...
It 's common knowledge these days that The Ramones debut stands as one of the most pivotal moments in music history .
It 's pointless to try and run down all of the ways that record has influenced modern music .
When the topic turns to greatest punk records ever , it 's rarely mentioned outside the top five .
On Rolling Stone Magazine 's now infamous list of the top 500 records ever , The Ramones clocked in at number 33 .
That 's some rarefied air .
2. Black Sabbath - Paranoid
Not every band can claim to be responsible for starting an entire genre of music .
But when it comes to the pioneers of heavy metal , it 's hard to argue against Black Sabbath .
On Paranoid , their second album , the band unleashed some of their greatest songs ever .
" Iron Man , " " War Pigs , " " Paranoid , " it 's all pretty deadly stuff .
And in the midst of hippie movement , a band that represented something completely different was bound to appeal to a lot of people .
Right ?
Back Then ...
Absolutely they did .
Black Sabbath 's first two albums were commercial smashes .
Unfortunately , none of those buyers worked for music magazines .
The rock media was unspeakably harsh when it came to Black Sabbath , dismissing them in some cases as " bubblegum satanists . "
Ouch .
In Nick Tosches ' Rolling Stone review from 1971 , he spends about 1,500 words dismissing the band while not once mentioning their name , the album or any of the songs on the album .
No bias there , folks .
And Now ...
You do n't need me to tell you that Paranoid is one of the greatest metal albums ever .
You already know that .
Everybody knows it .
But if you do n't , let today 's rock critics tell you .
AllMusic 's Steve Huey sums it up best ... " Paranoid defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history . "
Even Vibe Magazine , generally known for covering rap and R&B music , included Paranoid on their list of essential albums of the 20th century .
Word .
It was a tough decision for me .
Should I head home for Thanksgiving at home with the family , or stay in the dorm for the long weekend ?
It 's a tougher decision that you might imagine .
At school , I 've got fat pipes of broadband and no one telling me to stop playing the Xbox 360 for four days .
At home I have to endure a dial - up connection and become the tech support guru for the entire family .
You see my dilemma ?
I have n't seen my parents for two months .
I suppose I should go home .
I missed out leveling my Night Elf for this ?
I thought as I chewed on the dry turkey my mom always makes for Thanksgiving .
" Should be a good game today , " said my dad .
" Cowboys versus the Packers is always a good one . "
Ugh , football , and not even on an HD set .
When would my parents emerge from the Dark Ages ?
I smothered my turkey in cranberry jelly and gravy , hoping the next bite would n't feel like chewing leather sandpaper .
Dad said , " Did mom tell you we got a new computer ? "
" What ?
I told you to tell me when you were going to buy something new , so you would n't get a piece of crap HP again , " I said .

Your Gateway to Health , Strength , and Muscle
THE Community Center for Self - Resistance Exercise
The exercises described herein are bona - fide strength - gaining , muscle building exercises , all of which require no equipment and can be performed virtually anywhere at any time .
You could do them all at once , which would require your setting up a routine that you would faithfully adhere to , or you could spread them out throughout the work day , as I do .
If you choose to spread out your exercises , be sure to do all of the exercises for one group of muscles at a time .
For example , when I get to work and am waiting for my computer to load , I go through all of the chest exercises .
Background
I once lifted weights five mornings a week for twelve straight years .
One morning I just was n’t inspired go through my routine , and ended up stopping altogether .
For the next four years I got absolutely no exercise whatsoever , and then one day I took a hard look at myself and was n’t too happy with what I saw .
All my weight had traveled south and consolidated around my waist .
My arms , shoulders , and chest had become flabby and had shrunk considerably in size .
I decided it was time to get back into shape and to rebuild the physique I had once been proud of .
With a Herculean effort I renewed my morning workouts , and within three months I was just about back to where I once was .
The problem was that the enthusiasm of previous years just was n’t there and it took every ounce of resolve I had to get through the routines .
The workouts also began leaving me feeling fatigued .
I kept up my morning routine for six months until , finally , I felt the need to give it a rest .
Well , I was n’t about to give up all that I had worked so hard for , so I decided to make a study of alternative forms of exercise that would be as close as possible to the effectiveness of weight lifting .
I scoured the Internet picking up ideas from a great number of sources .
I experimented with various exercises , integrating those exercises I found to be effective into a routine I was developing .
Armed with my knowledge of body building , I was able to identify the most effective exercises , and I was also able to develop exercises of my own .
In fact , about thirty of the exercises found in this program I created myself .
The end result is that I have put together the most efficient and effective weightless workout routine I possibly could .
The best part is , I no longer have to get up in the wee hours of the morning to do a workout .
I just integrate my exercises into my work day at the office , leaving me with free time and a lot more energy throughout the day .
How I Developed My Program
In developing my program , I adhered to the following guidelines : I would either adopt or develop only the best of the best .
There are only so many hours in a day and no one has the time to waste on exercises that do n’t produce maximum results .
.
There are only so many hours in a day and no one has the time to waste on exercises that do n’t produce maximum results .
The main focus of the exercises would be geared towards building muscle – exercises that challenge muscles to the max and force them into growth .
As much as possible , I have duplicated the movements of weight - lifting .
I do n’t have much use for exercises that “ tone ” , which , I ’ve concluded , is a code word for next to useless .
The exercises would require no equipment and could be performed while either standing , sitting , or utilizing a wall , allowing me to exercise virtually anywhere at anytime .
This makes the program ideal for people who can't get to a gym or cart weights around ; people who travel , students , military personel .
You can take Zen - in - the - Art with you on vacations .
Keeping all of the above in mind , I set about carefully analyzing each muscle group – neck , shoulders , chest , back , arms , forearms , abdomen , and legs – and came up with series of exercises for each muscle group that would cover the full range of movement and target the muscles in each group from an effective range of angles , resulting in full development .
After having spent months developing , adding to , and refining my program , I am now satisfied that it is the most comprehensive and effective weightless bodybuilding program that exists , and it has certainly turned out to be much more effective than anything I could have hoped for !
Do these exercises really work ?
Absolutely !
I know that these exercises really work for for the simple reason that any significant form of resistance applied to muscles will cause them to strengthen and grow , and I have proven to myself just how effective these exercises truly are .
I had approached all of this with the hopes that I would be able to maintain , to a lesser degree , a size and musculature that would be produced by lifting weights .
To my great astonishment , these exercises have actually improved my physique !
My muscles feel hard and pumped , as though I had been lifting weights .
My arms are as big as ever and rock hard , my shoulders have become more defined , and my back has actually broadened .
I 've also discovered a very different kind of concentration involved in Self - Resistance exercise - a sort of mind and body becoming one .
The exercises are divided into three types –
Isometric , Isotonic and Stretch
Isometric – Pushing against an unmovable object .
When performing isometric exercises , you should not rush into them and immediately start pushing as hard as you can .
You should feel your way into them , concentrating on the muscles they are building , working your hands into just the right grip , gradually increasing resistance until you are at maximum effort , and then holding the exercise for 10 seconds .
Holding the exercise for any longer than 10 seconds has no further effect .
When you feel ready to push an isometric to maximum effort , first take in a deep breath and then push , releasing your air in a slow , steady rush as you hold the isometric .
Isotonic – Involving movement for a given number of repetitions .
For these exercises , you will be using either your body weight or self - resistance - pitting one limb against the other , with one limb acting as a moveable resistance to the other limb .
Because you have to let up with the resistance limb to allow the other limb to move , the onus is on you to make it as difficult on yourself as possible .
You have to really focus on these exercises and feel each repetition all the way through , feeling the muscles being worked , imagining yourself to be moving an almost impossible amount of weight .
Concentrate .
Again , take in a deep breath of air at the start of a repetition , and then release the air while performing the repetition .
Stretch - Isolating and contracting muscles .
When performing these exercises , stretch with every fiber of your being .
Feel what the benefit of a good stretch to the max does for your muscles , as well as for your sense of well - being .
Breathing
I can't overemphasize the importance of proper breathing , not only for the exercises , but in your daily life , as well .
Breathing is , literally , the breath of life , and deep breathing will keep you healthy and will aid in curing what ails you .
Deep breathing is a key factor in building muscle .
Have you ever been engrossed in doing something and then you suddenly take in a deep breath of air ?
That 's your body telling you thay you 've got to get some air circulating .
So , pay attention to the proper breathing technique as described above .
Also , the first exercise described in this program is a deep breathing exercise , and this is the one exercise you should do everyday - a couple of times a day , if you want to .
When you walk , walk at a quick gait .
Get the blood circulating and get the lungs forcefully pulling in air .
Breathe deeply !
How often should these exercises be done ?
Because of the intense nature of these exercises - forcing your muscles to work at maximum performance - each exercise needs to be performed only once in a day with a day 's rest in between .
In fact , a day 's rest in between the same exercises is crucial .
There is a very definite physiological reason for not doing the same exercises every day .
When you perform an intense exercise , you are actually breaking down muscle cells .
Afterwards , blood begins rushing into your muscles , carrying nutrients and rebuilding those muscle cells , making them bigger and stronger than they were before .
This is why nutrition is so important when following a fitness program .
This process generally takes 48 hours to complete itself .
In truth , it is during this period of recovery that your muscles actually grow in size and strength .
By doing the same intense exercises daily , you are not allowing your muscles sufficient time to recover and you will soon wear out , not to mention not making much in the way of gains .
I do the upper body exercises on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays , and then the leg exercises on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays .
One set of ten repetitions is all that is needed for the self - resistance exercises .
For the body weight exercises , do one set of as many repetitions as you feel you can handle .
The deep breathing and stretching exercises can be done daily if you choose to do so .
If the mood strikes , it certainly wo n’t hurt to do some or all of the stretching exercises a couple more times in a day .
You can pick and choose .
I find myself doing most of the stretching exercises a few times a day , simply because I feel an urge to do so .
SETS - You can do sets if you choose to .
In otherwords , do an exercise once and then repeat it .
This applies to the isotonic exercises only .
You could select a few choice exercises and do a second set of each one .
For example , if upper arm development is of primary interest to you , you might want to do a second set of TR - 6 and BI - 2 ( in the Arms category ) .
If you do this , then perform the related isometrics only at the end the second set .
Performing isometrics more than once or holding them for longer than 10 seconds has no further effect .
Consistency is the key .
By integrating these exercises into your daily routine and performing them faithfully week after week , and month after month , your muscles will dramatically strengthen and grow !
Why Zen ?
Zen is the Oriental philosophy , or more accurately , the state of being , of total control .
It is the ability to perform tasks effortlessly .
For example , a Zen Archer can place an arrow in its mark without conciously attempting to do so .
The physical task of drawing the bow , aiming , and letting fly the arrow becomes irrelevant as the Zen master , the arrow , and the target become as one .
Anyone who shoots a good game of pool knows this heightened state of being .
In this same manner , performing these exercises becomes as much an exercise in mind control as it does a physical activity .
As you do these exercises more and more , you will develop an inner memory of how these exercises should feel when performed to maximum effectiveness .
Rather than consciously applying pressure with the resistance limb , you will be able to virtually let it go limp , thinking of it as a ' dead weight ' , and it will virtually take on a life of its own , becoming an object almost impossible to lift .
You will also find that your ability to focus will become more and more acute , and thinking your muscles into further growth will become as much a part of the exercises as the physical aspects of the exercises , themselves .
Because you are using your own body to develop your own body , the whole routine becomes as much an exercise in meditation as it is an exercise in building muscle .
If this aspect of Zen and how it relates to exercise interests you , there is an on - going , informative discussion in The Forum .
Final words
If you have come across my site and are inspired to adopt my routine , I wish you well and hope these exercises are just what you were looking for .
As in any exercise program , you will begin to see results within the first two weeks , and then it generally takes about three months before you begin to see a real transformation .
If you have always wanted to build yourself up but never got around to it because of time constraints or a lack of desire to " pump iron " , or a hesitation at investing in expensive equipment , then this routine may suit you to a tee .
I can say with confidence that these exercises will , over a period of time , add inches to your arms , chest , shoulders , and legs .
Best of luck !

In contrast , dealing with the nation ’s energy problems ranked sixth in the poll  just behind education and social security  with 60 percent of voters endorsing it as a top priority .
The declining interest in global warming and other environmental issues might be unsurprising at a time when Americans face far more imminent threats to their jobs and homes .
“ Strengthening the nation ’s economy ” was the top - ranked concern of voters in the Pew poll .
A relatively cool year and a harsh winter in North America and Europe have not helped , inspiring some commentators and a small cluster of scientists to make skeptical remarks about “ global cooling . ”
Social scientists say that environmental concerns are often the first to fall off the table when any more immediate threat surfaces .
Andrew Kohut , the president of the Pew Research Center , said a similar pattern was seen in the Pew poll after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , when second - tier issues faded in voters ’ minds .
“ Concern for terrorism overshadowed all else , ” Mr. Kohut said .
The public ’s waning interest in global warming poses a challenge for Mr. Obama , who emphasized climate change throughout his campaign and pledged to seek a cap on emissions in the United States of heat - trapping gases , led by carbon dioxide , which come mainly from burning coal and oil .
Such a cap , even if it includes various mechanisms intended to ease the cost , would by design raise the price of energy coming from those fossil fuels , which still underpin the American and the global economies .
Mr. Obama ’s political foes have already seized on the cooling of public concern .
Marc Morano , the communications director for the Republican minority on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , has been sending out e-mail alerts , sometimes several a day , highlighting stories on winter weather and other surveys suggesting a shift in public attitudes .
Massachusetts has ordered a tire chain to charge Bay State residents a 5 percent sales tax on their purchases in New Hampshire in an unprecedented move that could have huge implications for consumers and other merchants .
Town Fair Tire Centers , which is based in Connecticut but has six shops in New Hampshire and 25 in Massachusetts , is fighting back with a lawsuit now before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that accuses the state of violating the US commerce clause .
If Massachusetts prevails in the case , which is likely to be heard next month , it could drive up costs for consumers and retailers such as Best Buy and Sears that sell expensive home appliances and other goods in New Hampshire , which does n't have a state sales tax .
It also could mean millions of dollars in new tax revenue for the Commonwealth as it faces a $ 1.1 billion budget deficit , according to tax analysts .
" This is a first - of - its - kind case , " said Fred Nicely , general counsel of the Council on State Taxation , a nonprofit trade association of multistate corporations engaged in interstate and international business .
" There 's huge ramifications to the entire retail community . "
To others , it 's a case of " Taxachusetts " striking back at the " Live Free or Die " pride of New Hampshire .
The Granite State has long lured Massachusetts residents over the border to enjoy tax - free shopping .
New Hampshire Governor John Lynch has even gotten involved , kicking off a campaign one year to persuade Bay Staters to head north so they do n't have to cram all of their shopping in when the Commonwealth decides to hold a three - day " sales tax holiday . "
The idea that Massachusetts consumers can't enjoy a tax break is n't sitting well with the locals in this troubled economy .
Just last week Governor Deval Patrick proposed taxing alcohol , candy , and soda , and raising taxes on hotels and meals .
" People are free to buy their tires wherever they want at the best price , " said Erin Willet of Lunenburg , who routinely drives 20 miles to Nashua , N.H. , to avoid tax on household items and big ticket purchases like appliances .
" If Massachusetts does n't like it , then they should have predictable tax - free holidays so that people can plan their shopping to take advantage of it . "
The Town Fair Tire legal battle dates back to 2003 , when the Massachusetts Department of Revenue audited the three New Hampshire stores Town Fair Tire operated at the time , after receiving evidence that Bay State residents were driving up to buy tires and having them installed at the chain 's shops .
The auditors identified 313 sales made to Massachusetts consumers , based on invoices that included Commonwealth addresses and in some cases telephone numbers .
The state 's tax authorities say the records demonstrate that Town Fair Tire knew the customer intended to use the goods in the Commonwealth , and therefore should have charged a 5 percent " use tax " - essentially a sales tax for items purchased for use or storage in the Bay State .
Those taxes then would be given to Massachusetts .
Following the audit , Massachusetts authorities assessed the company about $ 108,947 in tax , penalties , and interest related to the sales .

This image of Comet Lulin , taken on 28 January , merges data from Swift ’s Ultraviolet / Optical Telescope ( blue and green ) and X - Ray Telescope ( red ) .
The comet ’s tail extends off to the right , while a cloud of oxygen and hydrogen atoms extends far Sun -ward of the comet .
At the time of the observation , the comet was 160 million km from Earth and 185 million km from the Sun ( Image : NASA / Swift / U of Leicester / DSS / STScI / AURUA / Bodewits et al . )
This image of the comet , which is green because of poisonous cyanogen and diatomic carbon gases in its atmosphere , was taken through a 14 - inch telescope on 1 February ( Image : Jack Newton , Arizona Sky Village )
A space telescope that usually studies the most powerful explosions in the universe has set its sights on an approaching comet .
Its observations at ultraviolet and X - ray wavelengths should help reveal the comet ’s composition , structure and its interaction with the solar wind .

Comet Lulin , which was discovered in 2008 by astronomers at the Lulin Observatory in Taiwan , will make its closest pass near Earth on 24 February .
At that time , it will come within 61 million kilometres , or 40 % the Sun - Earth distance , from our planet .
Amateur astronomers have been watching the approaching comet , which is bright enough to be visible with the naked eye from dark sites ( see this image taken by Jack Newton ) .
Now , NASA ’s Swift space telescope , designed to study cosmic explosions called gamma-ray bursts , has released an image of the comet .
‘ Quite active ’
The icy body is shedding gas and dust as it nears the Sun , whose ultraviolet light breaks apart the comet ’s water molecules into hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl ( OH ) molecules .
Swift ’s Ultraviolet / Optical Telescope ( UVOT ) , which can detect the hydroxyl molecules , found that they fill a cloud more than 400,000 km across .
“ The comet is quite active , ” team member Dennis Bodewits of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said in a statement .
“ The UVOT data show that Lulin was shedding nearly 800 gallons of water each second ” – enough to fill an Olympic - size swimming pool in less than 15 minutes .
Farther from the comet , solar ultraviolet radiation also breaks up hydroxyl molecules – into oxygen and hydrogen atoms .
“ The UV will [ teach ] us about the composition of the comet , ” Bodewits told New Scientist , adding that such studies are interesting because comets might have brought water to Earth several billion years ago .
Glowing wind
Studying the comet in X - rays reveals how it interacts with the solar wind , a stream of charged particles from the Sun .
That ’s because positive ions in the solar wind steal electrons from neutral gases , such as hydroxyl , that they hit .
Since the stolen electrons are in an excited state , “ this makes the solar wind glow when it interacts with a comet ” , says Bodewits .
The observations could lend insight into why Mars has such a thin atmosphere .
“ The Earth is lucky because we have a magnetic field that protects us from most of the solar wind , ” he continues .
“ But Mars , lacking such a shield , might have lost its atmosphere because of the interaction with the solar wind . ”
Jenny Carter of the University of Leicester in the UK , who is leading Swift ’s studies of the comet , says the team plans to continue its observations .
“ We are looking forward to future observations of Comet Lulin , when we hope to get better X - ray data to help us determine its makeup , ” she said .
“ They will allow us to build up a more complete 3D picture of the comet during its flight through the solar system . ”
MOSCOW  Violent protests over political grievances and mounting economic woes shook the Latvian capital , Riga , late Tuesday , leaving around 25 people injured and leading to 106 arrests .
In the wake of the demonstrations , President Valdis Zatlers threatened Wednesday to call for a referendum that would allow voters to dissolve Parliament , saying trust in the government , including in its ability to deal with growing economic problems , had “ collapsed catastrophically . ”
For years , Latvia boasted of double - digit economic growth rates , but it has been shaken by the global economic downturn .
Its central bank has spent a fifth of its reserves to guard against a steep devaluation of its currency , the lat , and experts expect a 5 percent contraction of the country ’s gross domestic product in 2009 .
Salaries are expected to fall substantially , and unemployment is expected to rise .
The violence followed days of clashes in Greece last month over a number of issues , including economic stagnation and rising poverty as well as widespread corruption and a troubled education system .
In Bulgaria on Wednesday , separate riots broke out in the capital , Sofia , after more than 2,000 people  including students , farmers and environmental activists  demonstrated in front of Parliament over economic conditions , Reuters reported .
Emacs has a few mechanisms for choosing which major mode is selected when you find a file .
auto - mode - alist determines the mode from the file extension , e.g. you might want to load a c++ mode for a file named a.cc .
interpreter - mode - alist chooses a mode depending on the first line of a file .
If a file begins with #!/ bin/sh you probably want to choose shell - script - mode .
I worked on a code base where the extensions used a variety of capitalization .
The perl scripts could be .
Perl , .perl , . PL , . Pl or .pl and there were numerous other extensions .
It is fairly easy to make a regular expression to match all of these but I thought it warranted a helper function .
I want '( pl perl ) to transform to \.\( [ Pp ] [ Ll ] \ | [ Pp ] [ Ee ] [ Rr ] [ Ll ] \ ) \' .
The basic technique is to make a character class with the upper case and lower case version of each character in the string .
We also accept a symbol on the input in order that the caller does n’t have to add double quotes to every element .
( mapconcat ( lambda ( c ) ( let ( ( c ( upcase ( char - to - string c ) ) ) ) ( concat " [ " c ( downcase c ) " ] " ) ) ) ( symbol - name s ) " " ) )
This code converts 'pl to [ Pp ] [ Ll ] .
We want to handle a list of extensions so we can cope with permutations of .pl or .perl .
We therefore surround the previous mapconcat with the following .
( mapconcat ( lambda ( s ) ... ) l " \\ | " )
The final part of the function adds the appropriate prefix and suffix to make the regex work in auto - mode - alist .
( defun file - extensions ( l ) ( concat " \\. \\ ( " ( mapconcat ( lambda ( s ) ( mapconcat ( lambda ( c ) ( let ( ( c ( upcase ( char - to - string c ) ) ) ) ( concat " [ " c ( downcase c ) " ] " ) ) ) ( symbol - name s ) " " ) ) l " \\ | " ) " \\ ) \\ ' " ) )
I added a wrapper function to marry the regex to the major mode .
( defun ext - mode - map ( extensions mode ) ( cons ( file - extensions extensions ) mode ) )
And now you can simply specify your mode mappings like this :
( add - to - list ' auto - mode - alist ( ext - mode - map '( pl perl ) ' cperl- mode ) )

GAZA , Jan 29 ( Reuters ) - Israeli warplanes bombed an open area in the southern Gaza Strip early on Thursday , shortly after militants fired a rocket at Israel , witnesses and the Islamic movement Hamas said .
An Israeli military spokesman confirmed the attack , saying it had targeted a weapons production site , in response to the rocket fire at Israel .
There were no immediate reports of any injuries from the attack which witnesses said damaged a metal foundry in the town of Rafah , along the Gaza Strip border with Egypt .
The air strike was at least the second time Israel has bombed Gaza since a Jan. 18 halt to a 22 - day offensive .
Israel bombed tunnels on Wednesday it says were used to smuggle weapons from Egypt into Gaza , a day after Gaza militants killed an Israeli soldier in an explosion along a border fence .
When I was younger I absolutely loved going outdoors and making snowmen each winter when the big snows would hit .
Now I find it a bit more of a nuisance , but I still am just as big a fan of snowmen .
This year I have stumbled upon some of the cutest snowmen yet , and they 're all Totoro !
Seeing these really makes me want to make snowmen of my own favorite anime mascots .
Stephan Sol made his Totoro back in 2006 , OneFishTwoFishRedFishBluFish made their 3 1/2 foot tall Totoro in February of 2008 , and the newest Totoro was created just days ago , though I 'm not 100 % sure on who actually did the creating .
Either way , all of these Snotoro 's are absolutely brilliant !
What about you guys ?
Have you done any snow sculpting of your own yet this winter ?

Sweeping claims made in courtrooms about fingerprints , ballistics , bite marks and other forensic evidence often have little or no basis in science , according to a landmark report released Wednesday by the nation ’s leading science body .
The National Academy of Sciences report called for a wholesale overhaul of the crime lab system , which has become increasingly crucial to American jurisprudence .
Many experts said the report could have a broad impact on crime labs and the courts , ushering in changes at least as significant as those generated by the advent of DNA evidence two decades ago .
But the substantial reforms would require years of planning and major federal funding .
In the meantime , the findings are expected to unleash a flood of new legal challenges by defense attorneys .

“ This is a major turning point in the history of forensic science in America , ” said Barry Scheck , co-founder of the Innocence Project , an organization dedicated to exonerating the wrongfully convicted .
He said the findings would immediately lead to court challenges .
“ If this report does not result in real change , when will it ever happen ? ” Scheck asked .
The Los Angeles County Public Defender ’s office plans to use the National Academy report to file challenges on the admissibility of fingerprint evidence and is reviewing cases in which fingerprints played a primary role in convictions , officials said .
Separately , the Los Angeles Police Department has been reviewing 1,000 fingerprint cases after discovering that two people were wrongfully accused because of faulty fingerprint analyses .

The academy , the preeminent science advisor to the federal government , found a system in disarray : labs that are underfunded and beholden to law enforcement and that lack independent oversight and consistent standards .
The report concludes that the deficiencies pose “ a continuing and serious threat to the quality and credibility of forensic science practice , ” imperiling efforts to protect society from criminals and shield innocent people from convictions .
With the notable exception of DNA evidence , the report says that many forensic methods have never been shown to consistently and reliably connect crime scene evidence to specific people or sources .
“ The simple reality is that the interpretation of forensic evidence is not always based on scientific studies to determine its validity , ” the report says .

For example , frequent claims that fingerprint analysis had a zero error rate are “ not scientifically plausible , ” the report said .
The scientific basis for bite mark evidence is called “ insufficient to conclude that bite mark comparisons can result in a conclusive match . ”
Recent cases of CSI gone awry have underscored the report ’s urgency .
In the cases of the 232 people exonerated by DNA evidence , more than half involved faulty or invalidated forensic science , according to the Innocence Project .
Margaret Berger , a professor at Brooklyn Law School and a member of the panel , explained : “ We ’re not saying all these disciplines are useless .
We ’re saying there is a lot of work that needs to be done . ”
Said U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Harry Edwards , co-chairman of the panel : “ There are a lot of people who are concerned , and they should be concerned .
Forensic science is the handmaiden of the legal system .
. . .
If you claim to be science , you ought to put yourself to the test . ”

Although the panel ’s recommendations are not binding , they are expected to be influential .
Among the recommendations :
* Create a new federal agency , the National Institute of Forensic Science , to fund scientific research and disseminate basic standards .
* Make crime labs independent of law enforcement .
Most crime labs are run by police agencies , which can lead to bias , a growing body of research shows .
* Require that expert witnesses and forensic analysts be certified by the new agency , and that labs be accredited .

* Fund research into the scientific basis for claims routinely made in court , as well as studies of the accuracy and reliability of forensic techniques .
Those recommendations have been cautiously embraced by leading associations of forensic scientists , which in 2005 helped convince Congress that the study was necessary .
“ You ca n’t continue to do business in 2009 the way you did in 1915 , ” said Joseph Polski of the International Assn. for Identification , whose members include examiners of fingerprints , documents , footwear and tire tracks .
“ We knew there would be things in there we ’d like and things we did n’t like . ”
Many forensic scientists were hesitant to criticize the report for fear of seeming resistant to testing and scrutiny .
But there were some delicate complaints .

“ It ’s not the science of forensic science that is in need of repair , I think ; it ’s how the results are interpreted in the courtroom , ” said Dean Gialamis , head of the American Society of Crime Lab Directors , who was quick to add that his group welcomed the recommendations .
The report was hailed by many defense attorneys , scientists and law professors , who for years have been raising scientific and legal challenges .
“ The courts were highly skeptical of experts and resistant to hearing their arguments , ” said Simon A. Cole , a professor of criminology at UC Irvine who has often testified for defense teams about the limitations of fingerprint evidence .
“ I feel like I ’m Alice coming out of the rabbit hole and back into a world of sanity and reason . ”
The report had harsh words for the FBI Laboratory and the National Institute of Justice , the research arm of the Justice Department , which have shown little enthusiasm for exploring the shortcomings of forensic science .

“ Neither agency has recognized , let alone articulated , a need for change , ” the report states , adding that they could be subject to pro-prosecution biases .
Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. signaled in comments to reporters shortly before the report was released that he would take its concerns seriously : “ I think we need to devote a lot of attention and a lot of resources to that problem . ”
Prosectors on the front lines , however , were more skeptical .
“ I know the defense is probably starting bonfires , but this should not in any way shake up anyone ’s confidence in forensics , ” said Paula Wulff , manager and senior attorney of the DNA Forensic Program of the National District Attorneys Assn .
She called the recommendations a “ Cadillac of aspirations , ” and expressed doubt that they would be followed given the poor state of the economy .

All sides , however , agreed that the report signals an aggressive reentry of scientists into issues that for decades have fallen to lawyers , judges and juries to resolve .

BBC News , Baghdad
Abu Ghraib , the Iraqi prison which became notorious for detainee abuse by US forces in 2004 , is being officially re-opened in a new incarnation .
It has been handed over to the Iraqis and renamed Baghdad Central Prison .
The site has been extensively renovated , with upgraded facilities and amenities , including a hospital , rest rooms and visiting rooms .
Work is continuing on the prison , which will eventually be the city 's main jail , holding about 12,000 inmates .
Initially , only one of its four sections will be used .
There are already about 300 prisoners there to test it out and , once the prison has been officially inaugurated , that figure will rise to 3,500 .
Torture allegations
Along with the change of name , the Iraqi justice ministry is trying to change both image and reality , billing it as a model prison , open to random inspection by the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations .

Under the new status of forces agreement with Iraq , the prisoners are being released at a rate of about 50 a day .
Those against whom there are pending charges will be handed over to the Iraqis as the Americans withdraw .
There is much concern over the conditions in some Iraqi jails , where there is acute overcrowding and allegations of abuse and torture .
American officials say the detainees they hand over are only going to prisons run by the justice ministry and which are up to international standards .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 29 ( UPI ) -- The Peanut Corp. of America has recalled all peanuts and peanut products processed at its Blakely , Ga. , facility since Jan. 1 , 2007 .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the expanded recall includes all lots that begin with the number 7 , 8 or 9 of dry and oil roasted peanuts and peanut butter , paste , meal and granules .
Previously , PCA announced a recall of only peanut butter and peanut paste .

The Georgia PCA plant , which sells its products to institutional and industrial users for service in large institutions or for further processing by other companies , has been identified as the source of a Salmonella outbreak that has resulted in the death of eight people and more than 500 cases of illness .
PCA does not sell peanuts or peanut products directly to consumers in stores .
The recalled products were distributed in the United States , Canada , Haiti , Korea and Trinidad .
FDA investigators have alleged the company 's own tests identified the presence of Salmonella contamination 12 times in two years , yet the company did nothing to prevent the products ' sale for use in making various brands of crackers , cookies , energy bars , ice cream , cereal , candies and dog food products .
In the wonderful Bird by Bird , Anne Lamott talks about the incredible , ripping pain she felt after having her tonsils removed .
All she wanted to do was chug pain killers and let the stupid thing heal , but , Anne 's doctor gave her some advice that she found as unbelievable as it was painful : he told her to chew some gum .
Turns out that , as with a lot of injuries , the entirely sensible impulse to protect and baby a wounded area was the opposite of what Anne actually needed in order to fix the problem .
So , by enduring the excruciating pain of chewing gum for just a few minutes , the muscles in her throat suddenly unclenched , and Anne 's pain went away forever .
The advice Anne wanted was n't the advice she needed .
And , like we all eventually learn , the best advice you 'll get in life hurts like hell at the time .
Because it has to .
And , maybe that 's part of what what bugs me about all the " tips . "
Today , the web is littered with sites pumping out a high volume of advice on every conceivable topic .
And a lot of the pathological patrons of these sites will tell you that a daily surfeit of snack - sized information helps them with what they really need in order to be successful and happy in life -- to be better at their job or to be a well - rounded person or to become a more talented programmer .
I do n't doubt for a moment that the right tip at the right time can make all the difference in the world .
And I have certainly been both a ( reformed ) producer as well as an ardent consumer of " tips , " by any definition of the word .
But , here 's the problem :
In more instances than we want to admit , tips not only wo n't ( and can 't ) help us to improve ; they will actively get in the way of fundamental improvement by obscuring the advice we need with the advice that we enjoy .
And , the advice that 's easy to take is so rarely the advice that could really make a difference .
A tip is like ... what ?
A little scrap of a map .
Not only is it not the actual destination , but the part you can hold in your hand will only make sense when you understand its place in a much bigger picture .
So , sure , you might get a kick out of gazing at the pretty colors and reading the funny names to your cat , and , heck , once you 've collected enough little maps , you may even start fancying yourself a gifted cartographer .
But , never for a minute start fantasizing that being a map collector means you 've visited all the locations on those pieces of paper .
If you ever decided to attempt them , your actual travels would very much benefit from a competent ( and whole ) map of where you 're heading , but it necessarily requires movement , change , and enduring potentially long stretches in which you 'll have to find your own bearings in three tip - free dimensions .
At their best , " tips " are a fine way to incrementally improve a process that you 're already dedicated to practicing on a regular basis .
And , in that context , tips work .
For example , a tip on your golf swing may be very useful if you 're already playing three times a week and hitting a bucket of balls after work every day .
But a subscription to a magazine about taekwondo will only be as useful as your decision to drag your fat ass into a dojo and start actually kicking people .
Over and over .
Otherwise , you 're just buying shiny paper every month .
In my opinion , the problems with tip culture on the web are many , not least the evidence that most of the page - view - obsessed poopers of online tips seem to have zero real interest in solving any problem beyond their own need to generate repeat traffic from dazed information tourists .
But , the common problem of all tip fixations traces back to a misunderstanding of how anybody ever got great at doing anything .
We can't get good at something solely by reading about it .
And we 'll never make giant leaps in any endeavor by treating it like a snack food that we munch on whenever we 're getting bored .
You get good at something by doing it repeatedly .
And by listening to specific criticism from people who are already good at what you do .
And by a dedication to getting better , even when it 's inconvenient and may not involve a handy bulleted list .
If this strikes you as fancy talk , may I suggest that you approach the woman in your life who most enjoys sexual intercourse , and , in the nicest way possible , ask her whether she 'd prefer to have congress with :
a confident partner who has had a long career of safe and mutually - satisfying romps with a range of people who liked different things ; or , a 50 - year - old virgin who likes reading blogs about sex tips .
You know the answer , and so does she .
There 's probably more than one reason that poor # 2 is still just a well - read dilettante , but a strong candidate for the top spot would be how he 's allowed his ardor for acquiring " tips " to take the place of getting started in the actual , complicated , and sometimes very confusing craft of making ladyparts happy .
You should and will consume the web however you please , and if scanning lists of tips is a relaxing pastime for you , I 'm the last person to begrudge you your fun .
But , it 's time to stop pretending that practical expertise at anything can take place in an RSS reader .
Next time you find yourself staring at another re-packaged post about all the " resources " for becoming great at whatever you 're theoretically excited about , ask yourself for specific evidence -- things you can point to that you 've done or made -- that reflect the improvement all those thousands of tips and resources brought you .
If you can shut me down with a hundred satisfied lovers , a pile of well - kicked opponents , or a passport full of countries you 've walked through : well , more power to you and the tips that helped you get good .
But , if the countless , dreary hours of resource - hunting and tip - scarfing have primarily produced more RSS subscriptions and a giant ass print on your couch , maybe it 's time to stand up , and start chewing some gum .
The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed MNC banks to charge hefty interest up to 49 % on defaulted credit card payments , ending the respite that lakhs of card holders have had since September last year when the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission capped the penalty at 30 % .
The SC stayed the apex consumer forum ’s directive to banks not to charge more than 30 % interest on defaulted payments on credit card purchases .
The SC had last year refused to heed the appeal of banks against the NCDRC ’s order .
A Bench comprising Justices B N Agrawal , G S Singhvi and Aftab Alam on Tuesday suspended the relief to card holders on a plea by a coalition of foreign banks — Citibank , HSBC , American Express and Standard Chartered — that their business was suffering immensely because of the “ unwarranted ’ ’ cap on the quantum of penal interest .
Ironically , the plea of banks may have been allowed because of a lapse by the very same NGO ‘ Awaz ’ that was instrumental in getting the NCDRC order pegging the penal interest at 30 % last year .
Though the bench had issued notice to the NGO four months ago , it has yet not put in its response , possibly helping the court to see merit in the argument of the banks that no penal interest rate , they were only following the guidelines issued by the RBI .
The banks teamed up to apprise the apex court of their compulsions to charge between 36 % to 49 % interest on defaulted payments on credit cards .
“ No bank as a credit card issuer would charge undue interest rate as , apart from the regulatory framework that applies , the market would not sustain the same by reason of competitive force , ’’ Citibank said .
In its application , filed through counsel Rupinder Suri , it said facility of credit cards could be availed of without any interest for a certain stipulated period and it was only after the expiry of that period that penal interest was levied on default of payments .
“ The credit card holder is aware of the same at the time of applying for it .
It is also relevant to note that credit card transactions de facto constitute unsecured credit availed of , ’’ the bank said justifying the high interest rate permitted by RBI on defaulted payments .
The July 7 , 2007 order of NCDRC had ruled that “ charging of interest rates in excess of 30 % per annum from credit card holders by banks for the former ’s failure to make full payment on the due date or paying the minimum amount due , is unfair trade practices . ’’
It had also said that penal interest could be levied only once for the period of default and should not be capitalised while terming the practice of computing interest on monthly basis as “ unfair trade practice ’ ’ .
The banks justified the high interest rate on default payments by credit card holders by listing as many as 27 factors that included even the SMS alerts it sends to the card holders .
For Australian tourists travelling to Thailand , there have been warnings about terrorist threats and political instability .
But nowhere has the travel advice contained warnings about fatal jellyfish stings .
One Australian man is working hard to change that after his son was nearly killed by a box jellyfish while the family was holidaying at a Thai beach .
Last summer , Andrew Jones took his young family on a holiday , but his four - year - old son Lewis was stung will swimming off a small beach .
As Mr Jones explains , things quickly became the stuff of nightmares .
" All of a sudden he stopped and screamed a really horrible scream .
I never heard it before and I never want to hear it again , " he said .
" So I just raced out into the water and pulled him out onto the beach and he was absolutely hysterical and it was really only - it took a little while to register that it was in fact a jellyfish .
" We had a pretty traumatic time from that moment on to try and firstly save his life , as he ran in to a spot of bother .
He went straight into cardiac and respiratory arrest . "
A quick - thinking chef from a nearby resort threw vinegar on the four - year - old 's wounds .
It saved the little boy 's life .
Mr Jones says he would never let his family swim off the north Queensland coast because of fears of stingers , but he had no idea the waters around Thailand were just as dangerous .
" The horror of it was the fact that we knew nothing about there even being box jellyfish in this area ; there 's no signage , obviously this is Thailand , " Mr Jones said .
" But there 's no warnings from anybody there that they might be around , whereas you see lots of warnings in places like Queensland and the Northern Territory .
" The box jellyfish is renowned to be the most venomous creature on the planet and when it wraps its tentacles around a little four - year - old , it can cause some serious damage .
So in actual fact he 's lucky to be alive . "
Raising awareness
Since then , Mr Jones has launched a dedicated campaign to make the beaches of Thailand safer .
He has travelled back to Bangkok , holding meetings with the Thai Government , local scientists and consular officials from Australia and other big tourist nations .
He says his biggest hurdle in raising awareness of stingers has been a massive resistance from tourism operators , worried about the bad publicity .
" Several years earlier in 2002 , a Melbourne man had been stung and actually died on Koh Samui and the authorities there actually tried to cover this up , " Mr Jones said .
" There were signs put up on the beach warning tourists of the problem , but all the local operators pulled those down because they did n't want any affect on tourism and that seems to be generally the attitude . "
But last year , Mr Jones teamed up with jellyfish expert Lisa Gershwin and the pair have made real progress .
As the curator of Natural Science at the Queen Victoria Museum in Launceston , Dr Gershwin says the key has been knocking down cultural boundaries that made fatal jellyfish stings go undetected by Thai authorities .
" I do n't think it 's that they [ are ] ignoring the problem .
I think it 's that they simply did n't know , " she said .
" Most of the people getting stung in Thailand are either fisherman in little villages and they do n't require death certificates and there 's kind of a cultural thing that if you get killed by the ocean , it 's because you pissed it off .
" So there 's these cultural beliefs and local customs that do n't really make jellyfish fatalities something reportable . "
- Based on a story aired on Saturday AM , January 31 .
Over the next 24 hours , officers questioned the Thornleigh taxi driver and his aged - care worker wife , patted them down and searched their luggage before sending them to a detention centre in a caged van .
They were then taken to a hotel with other detainees at 2.30 am to sleep with armed guards by their bedside before being woken at 4.30 am and put on a flight back to Sydney .
Despite being Australian citizens and having valid visas to enter the US , the family members claim they were singled out because of their cultural background , having immigrated from Bangladesh four years ago .
" They treated us like terrorists , " Mr Rabbi said .
" We are Australian citizens .
Why did they have to keep us in a detention centre ?
Why did they have to lock up my kids ? "
Mr Rabbi says that when he explained he was in the US to visit his father , the officers threatened him .
Despite producing the family 's $ 6400 return tickets , dated February 5 , he says the officers accused him of attempting to illegally stay in the US .
" They were very angry , " he said .
" They threatened us and they said if you keep talking like that you 'll be in big , big trouble . "
The family , tired and hungry after their 18 - hour flight from Sydney to Los Angeles via Melbourne , were given minimal food and drink during their time at the airport .
" We were given no food , apart from a few biscuits , " Mr Rabbi said .
A request to meet Mr Rabbi's father , whom he has not seen for three years , was also denied .
" I told them that this is probably the last time I can see him before he dies , " he said .
" They did not listen to me .
They said , ' You must go back to your country . ' "
A spokeswoman for the US consulate - general in Sydney said US Customs and Border Protection authorities reserved the right to refuse entry to the US .
Wrestling legend Verne Gagne , who climbed to fame as a likeable giant of the ring and helped launch Hulk Hogan and former Gov. Jesse “ The Body ” Ventura to stardom , is under police investigation in the death of a fellow resident at a Bloomington care facility .
Gagne , 82 , threw Helmut R. Gutmann , 97 , to the floor Jan. 26 , breaking his hip and injuring his head , according to Gutmann ’s family .
Gutmann , an accomplished cancer researcher and violinist who fled Nazi Germany in 1936 , was treated for his injuries but later was hospitalized again .
He died Saturday .
Gutmann ’s daughter , Ruth Hennig , said the two men had been in a public lobby of the Friendship Village memory loss unit , near the nurse ’s station , when Gagne grabbed her father .
“ I do n’t know what precipitated the attack , if anything , ” Hennig said .
“ All I know is that Verne Gagne lifted my father off the floor and then threw him down to the ground , and that caused him to crack his hip . ”
Police were not called to the facility after Gutmann ’s fall .
But Bloomington Police Deputy Chief Perry Heles said his department opened an investigation into an incident at Friendship Village after being contacted by an adult - protection agency .
He said he could not elaborate on details because there have been no arrests and no complaint .
Gagne suffers from Alzheimer ’s , while Gutmann , who could recognize his wife and children but not his grandchildren , suffered from dementia and short - term memory loss , said Hennig , executive director of a charitable trust in Boston .
She said Gagne had pushed her father in a previous incident , but there were no injuries .
“ I do n’t blame him , in the sense that I know he ’s not fully responsible for what he did , ” Hennig said .
“ But on the other hand , I know that my father would still be alive today if they had n’t had this altercation . …
I ’m more sad than I am angry . ”
Gutmann ’s wife , Betty Gutmann , who declined to comment , resides in an independent living area at Friendship Village .
Kay Miller , a spokeswoman for Life Care Retirement Communities Inc. , which runs the facility , said she could not comment because of federal rules governing patient confidentiality .
Gagne ’s son , Greg Gagne , described the incident as a terrible accident .
He referred all other questions to the family attorney , Julian Hook , who did not return calls .
Verne Gagne and his wife could not be reached for comment .
A native of Robbinsdale , Gagne sidestepped opportunities to play professional football in the 1950s after graduating from the University of Minnesota .
He instead became an alternate for the U.S. Olympic wrestling team and then a longtime presence in professional wrestling circles .
In 1960 , he formed the American Wrestling Association with a stable that eventually included Hogan and Ventura .
With Gagne as sole owner , the association toured civic centers and dominated televised wrestling in the 1960s and ’70s .
He became known as one of the more extroverted and approachable figures of professional wrestling , a self - made superstar who rose from poverty .
His mother died when he was 14 , and he lived in a hotel during his senior year in high school , supporting himself by mopping floors at a beauty salon .
“ He had nothing when we were married , ” his wife , Mary Gagne , told the Pioneer Press in 1981 .
By the 1980s , his Minneapolis - based wrestling circuit had franchises in Hawaii , Chicago , Denver , Milwaukee , San Francisco and Omaha , Neb. , as well as Toronto and Winnipeg , Manitoba .
He retired from the ring in 1981 , reportedly a millionaire , but struggled to keep the company afloat .
Gagne and the American Wrestling Association filed for bankruptcy in 1991 .
Hennig said her father received excellent care at Friendship Village , where had lived in the memory care unit for two years .
Gutmann , who was Jewish , left Nazi Germany and made a name for himself in Minnesota as a scientist and musician .
Gutmann served as a captain in the U.S. Army ’s Chemical Warfare Service , according to his family , and spent 40 years as a research scientist at the VA Hospital in Minneapolis .
He taught at the University of Minnesota , and his cancer research led to the publication of 120 papers in professional journals .
His daughter said he played violin for 12 years with the Bloomington Symphony Orchestra , and when he no longer could hold the strings correctly , he switched to piano .
Before his fall , he had been scheduled to play piano last month at the Minnesota Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Bloomington , which he helped found in 1966 , the Rev. Don Rollins said .
“ At 97 , he lived a really good long life , ” Hennig said .
“ He was , on the whole , healthy for most of it .
But it was a shock and regrettable that his life came to an end in the way that it did .
He was in pain , and he was extremely disoriented while he was in the hospital . ”

Obama ’s new foreign policy team prepares escalated bloodletting in Afghanistan and Pakistan
By Patrick Martin
24 January 2009
In a series of meetings and public appearances Wednesday and Thursday , and with the first military strikes of his administration , President Barack Obama has given a clear signal that he plans intensified bloodshed in Afghanistan and Pakistan as the US escalates its military intervention in Central and South Asia .
Missiles fired from unmanned Predator drones struck two targets inside Pakistan Friday morning , killing at least 18 people .
As is always the case with such exercises in remote - controlled murder , US officials claimed they were targeting Al Qaeda , although even US media accounts admitted that the majority of those killed were local residents .
Three missiles struck the village of Zharki in North Waziristan , killing ten people , of whom five were described by US " security sources " as Al Qaeda militants .
A few hours later , another missile hit a house in South Waziristan , killing eight people whose identities were not known .
The strikes were the latest in a series of more than two dozen such attacks since last August , and Pentagon officials said they had carried out the attacks under existing authority from the outgoing Bush administration , while keeping the new president fully informed of the action .
The death toll from the missile campaign , according to Pakistani government figures , numbers at least 263 people .
Even US government officials claim only a handful of those killed had any ties to Al Qaeda or the Taliban .
The attacks on sovereign Pakistani territory are blatant violations of international law , which the regime in Islamabad protests verbally , while continuing to accept billions in US subsidies to the country 's military .
Obama and his newly confirmed secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , staged what amounted to a political rally at the State Department Thursday , at which they announced the appointment of two new US pro-consuls to the region .
Former senator George Mitchell is to reprise his role from the Clinton administration as the US envoy to the Middle East .
Former UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke is special US representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The different titles reflect different roles .
Mitchell has been given responsibility for reviving and supervising negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , as well as between Israel and neighboring Arab states .
His job is strictly diplomatic .
Holbrooke is to work with the US - backed regimes in Afghanistan and Pakistan , as well as the US military command in Kabul , to coordinate joint action against Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
He is not labeled an " envoy , " according to the State Department , because he will have input into military policy as well as diplomacy , and because he will not be negotiating with the Taliban — a rebuff to pleas for such talks by Afghan President Hamid Karzai and some European countries .
Clinton called the two appointments " a loud and clear signal ... that our nation is once again capable of demonstrating global leadership . "
Obama said the two would " convey our seriousness of purpose " in both areas .
Mitchell chaired the negotiations in Northern Ireland that led to the 1998 Good Friday agreement , under which the IRA disarmed and Irish Republican politicians have joined the provincial government .
He later chaired a commission on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict whose report , delivered in April 2001 , was ignored by the incoming Bush administration because it called for a freeze on Israeli settlements on the West Bank .
Israeli officials , and particularly the right - wing Likud Party , which is favored to win the country 's February 10 parliamentary elections , have openly expressed their distrust of Mitchell , who is partially of Lebanese - American ancestry ( his mother was a Maronite Christian ) .
Mitchell 's appointment cannot disguise the fundamental policy of US imperialism in the region , which makes use of the Zionist regime as its military spearhead against the Arab masses .
Both Obama and Clinton , to whom Mitchell will report , have made clear their support for the 24 - day Israeli onslaught on Gaza , in which more than 1,300 Palestinians lost their lives , and over 5,000 were wounded .
The selection of Holbrooke is even more ominous , since he has long served as one of the most ruthless representatives of American imperialism , going all the way back to his early days in the Foreign Service in Vietnam .
He came to public notice as the leader of the US diplomatic team at the 1995 talks on the crisis in the former Yugoslavia , held in Dayton , Ohio , that concluded with a US - imposed settlement in the civil war in Bosnia .
In his encouragement of ethnic cleansing by the Croatian regime of Franjo Tudjman , which drove a quarter million Serbs out of the Krajina region of southern Croatia in a 1995 offensive , Holbrooke could deservedly face war crimes charges .
He later boasted , in his memoir of the Dayton talks : " Tudjman wanted clarification of the American position .
He bluntly asked for my personal views .
I indicated my general support for the offensive ... I told Tudjman the offensive had great value to the negotiations .
It would be much easier to retain at the table what had been won on the battlefield than to get the Serbs to give up territory they had controlled for several years . "
Holbrooke was fully aware at the time of the Dayton talks that the Croatian Army was carrying out atrocities against the Serbs , and was later quoted saying , " We ‘ hired ' these guys to be our junkyard dogs because we were desperate .
We need to try to ‘ control ' them .
But this is no time to get squeamish about things . "
He will now seek to find new " junkyard dogs " to do the dirty work of American imperialism in south and central Asia .
In his remarks at the State Department rally , Obama reiterated his concern over what he called a " deteriorating situation " in both Afghanistan and Pakistan , " a region that is " the central front " of the struggle against terrorism .
This language , echoing George W. Bush 's description of Iraq , underscores the new administration 's commitment to military subjugation of the Afghan population and wider attacks on the Pakistani population of the border region , largely Pushtun - speaking and linked by tribal ties to the majority Pushtun population in Afghanistan .
Clinton said that Holbrooke 's mandate would be to " coordinate across the entire government an effort to achieve United States ' strategic goals in the region . "
These goals have little to do with the remnants of Al Qaeda hiding out in the mountains along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
The real focus of the intervention , under Obama as much as under Bush , is to establish the United States as the principal power in the oil - rich region of Central Asia .
The renewed focus on military problems in Afghanistan was signaled as well by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who has been retained in his position during the transition from Bush to Obama .
He told a press conference Thursday that US goals in Afghanistan had been " too broad and too far into the future .
We need more concrete goals that can be achieved realistically within three to five years , in terms of reestablishing control in certain areas , providing security for the population , going after al - Qaeda , preventing the reestablishment of terrorism . "
There is mounting anxiety in the Pentagon over the viability of US supply lines to Afghanistan , especially if the force on the ground is doubled , as Obama plans .
Two - thirds of US supplies go through Pakistan and convoys through the Khyber Pass to Afghanistan have come under repeated attacks .
General David Petraeus , the former Iraq commander who was promoted to head the US Central Command , with responsibility for war planning throughout the region , recently completed a trip through Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan and Kyrgystan , seeking agreements on expanding US supply shipments through those countries .
He reported on his findings to the Obama White House on Wednesday .
According to a report in the New York Times January 22 , another major concern of US military authorities in Afghanistan is the strengthening of Taliban influence in the southern provinces around Kandahar , patrolled now mainly by British , Canadian and Dutch troops , who are spread thinly through a vast area .
The Times reporter noted worriedly : " It is perhaps in Kandahar , one of the provincial capitals , where the lack of troops is most evident .
About 3,000 Canadian soldiers are assigned to secure the city , home to about 500,000 people .
In a recent visit , this reporter traveled the city for five days and did not see a single Canadian soldier on the streets .
The lack of troops has allowed the Taliban to mount significant attacks inside the city . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Senior Republican senators warned on Sunday their party was unlikely to back President Barack Obama ’s economic stimulus bill without changes to cut waste and to ensure the nearly $ 900 billion package promptly boosts the faltering U.S. economy .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he doubted the economic stimulus bill can pass the Senate in its current form .
He said the bill needs to “ put lead on the target immediately ” with a specific focus on the housing sector and tax relief .
“ If we ’re going to spend anywhere near this ... it needs to be timely , temporary and targeted , ” he told CBS ’s “ Face the Nation . ”
“ Let ’s fix housing first .
That ’s what started all of this , ” the Kentucky senator said of a recession triggered by the U.S. housing sector meltdown that has spread economic gloom around the world and has cost millions of American jobs .
McConnell offered a Republican plan to provide government - backed , 4 percent fixed mortgages to credit - worthy home buyers , saying it could save them an average of $ 5,600 a year .
A senior Democratic senator said the plan had merit .
The Senate is expected to take up consideration of the Democrats ’ stimulus bill this week after the House of Representatives approved a smaller $ 825 billion bill last week without the support of a single Republican .
Congress is rushing to meet a mid-February deadline set by Obama for enacting the legislation aimed at lifting the economy out of a 13 - month - long recession .
Some of the controversial projects in the huge U.S. economic stimulus package are seen as valuable bargaining chips in winning support from skeptical Republicans .
The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate , Richard Durbin of Illinois , said Democrats were open to Republican amendments to the stimulus package .
“ We ’ve said to them , ‘ We ’re open about this .
Come to us with your ideas , if you want to make changes and offer amendments , ’ ” Durbin said on “ Fox News Sunday ” .
Democrats now control 58 seats in the Senate and are leading in one undecided race .
Under the Senate rules , 60 votes are needed to overcome any procedural hurdles raised by Republicans .
MAJOR CHANGES NEEDED ?
Another top Republican , Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona , said he saw support for the stimulus bill eroding and said “ major structural changes ” were needed to win Republican support .

“ You have to start from scratch and reconstruct this , ” Kyl , the No. 2 Republican in the Senate , told “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Kyl said the proposed bill , with a price approaching $ 900 billion , “ wastes a ton of money . ”
He took issue with items in the bill , including a $ 500 tax rebate , the creation of dozens of new government programs and transfers of cash to states .
Republicans sought not to delay the bill , but wanted “ huge amendments that would redirect it ” to address the housing industry collapse and provide tax relief measures , Kyl said .

McConnell urged Obama to “ get a hold of these Democrats in the Senate and the House ... and shake them a little bit and say , ‘ Look , let ’s do this the right way . ’ ”
Senate Democrats were receptive to amendments to boost infrastructure spending and to impose stricter oversight of the $ 700 billion bailout program for banks and Wall Street known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , said Durbin .
Senator Charles Schumer of New York said he and fellow Democrats had been listening to their Republican critics -- and had dropped , for example , $ 200 million to fix up the National Mall and millions of dollars for family planning .
“ This will pass with Republican votes , because it ’s a good package , and because we will make some changes around the edges , ” he told CBS ’s “ Face the Nation . ”
Schumer said Democrats were open to exploring Republicans ’ ideas on housing , including the government - backed mortgage plan for home buyers .
But he said these issues should be handled by the remaining TARP money .
Democrats agreed with Republicans that the stimulus bill in its current form does not include enough spending on infrastructure , including transportation , he said .
“ The worry here is that we get into a deflationary spiral downward and no one knows how to get out of that , ” said Schumer , who warned that the last time that happened was the Great Depression .
The House bill was estimated to cost $ 825 billion , but might be closer to $ 819 billion when accounting for its future impact on the deficit .
The Senate bill , with different tax components , would come close to $ 900 billion .
I first noticed Al Jazeera on a mission to the Palestinian territories in 2002 .
Every home I visited was tuned to Al Jazeera , all the time .
Even the children watched it .
When I watched with the help of my Arabic speaking hosts , I realized that this was television with a difference .
It told stories from the ground up .
In addition to generals and politicians , we heard from and saw ordinary people and the conditions of their lives .
And for my Palestinian hosts , it was the only place they could find out what was really happening in the Middle East .
As a teacher , the documentary Control Room gives me the opportunity to show my students just what real journalism that afflicts the comfortable and comforts the afflicted looks like .
Like thousands of other North Americans , I found Al Jazeera English on the Web invaluable during the recent Israeli assault on Gaza .
They were the only English language network with reporters in Gaza and , besides , it was the only TV news I could stand to watch .
So when I heard that Al Jazeera English was applying to be on cable in Canada , I could n't wait to find out how I could help .
I went to hear Tony Burman , my old boss at the CBC and now Managing Director of Al Jazeera English , speak in Toronto on February 17 .
Tony 's no radical but he 's always been an honest and courageous journalist .
When CBC Newsworld decided to run a full day of programming about violence against women on the tenth anniversary of the Montreal Massacre , I remember that Tony stood up against the hysterical attacks by right - wing media without budging an inch .
The most interesting part of Tony 's talk was not his assurance to the audience of mostly Canadian journalists and journalism students that Al Jazeera holds to journalistic ethics similar to the CBC and the BBC , or that it is widely watched in Israel or even that Al Jazeera is at least as controversial with Arab heads of state as it is with the U.S. government , but rather his explanation of the vision of Al Jazeera English and its unique role as an international broadcaster without a home base .
" The introduction of Al Jazeera English comes at a special time in the 21st Century , " he said .
" Power is shifting .
In historical , even epic terms , the ground is moving beneath our feet . "
Quoting Fareed Zakaria , he continued , " We are moving into a post - American world , one defined and directed from many places and by many people . "
This is what Zakaria calls the " rising of the rest . "
Al Jazeera English has more journalists covering Africa than any other international news channel , correspondents throughout Asia , more coverage of South America than any of their competitors , more than 150 staff in Washington , D.C. and they hope to open a bureau in Canada this fall .
And of course AJE ( as they call themselves ) has " pride of place " all over the world for its Middle East coverage .
" The goal is far more revolutionary . " says Burman .
" We simply want people to understand the full story , not a narrow one .
Every angle .
Every side .
Regardless of the consequences . "
According to Burman , they are trying to let the world report on itself .
Judith Marshall , an international solidarity activist from the United Steelworkers , told me that she watched AJE the last time she was in Africa and was stunned at the difference of watching television news without a Northern bias .
The goals of AJE are :
* To provide independent and impartial news for a global audience
* To bring the perspective of the South to the forefront of public policy debates
* To give voice to the voiceless
* And to tell truth to power , holding them accountable regardless of the consequences
Al Jazeera English is the kind of global television news we need in this country and it 's going to be a fight .
It should be a simple question of freedom of the press but the last time the CRTC imposed such onerous conditions on the potential broadcaster of Al Jazeera Arabic that no cable station would run it , in 2003 .
The Canadian Jewish Congress has already announced its opposition despite the high praise for Al Jazeera English almost everywhere , including Israel .
Make sure that Canadians are not denied truly global television news .
Go to www.iwantaljazeera.ca and write your cable operator to ask for AJE .
Then stay tuned for the CRTC hearings and make your voice heard then as well .
We need Al Jazeera English in Canada and together we can make it happen .

For a party as dispirited as his , Mr. Steele is certainly something of a tonic .
The enthusiastic reception that greeted his elbows - out acceptance speech was a marked contrast to days of meetings that until that point had bordered between morose and laconic .
Yet while there are benefits to having a party leader who is given to a bit of showmanship  he will have little trouble getting bookings on the Sunday talk shows  there are arguably some risks here .
When he spoke to Republicans on Saturday , he did something that some of his more cautious predecessors might have avoided :
He set down out three markers to judge him by this year .
His three big targets , he announced , were the upstate New York Congressional district left vacant when Representative Kristen Gillibrand was tapped to replace Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey .
“ I ’m in the business of winning elections , ” he said .
That New York Congressional seat , a relatively conservative district that had only recently gone Democratic , seems like a prime target for the Republican Party .
Virginia and New Jersey are more problematic , and Mr. Steele could find himself wishing he had not bet on a trifecta come November .
Most significant , though , is where Mr. Steele placed himself in the debate about how aggressively the Republicans should resist Mr. Obama and his financial stimulus plan .
Mr. Obama ’s aides , who have conspicuously resisted getting drawn into the fight Mr. Steele is trying to pick , described the remarks as an attempt by Mr. Steele  who is viewed by some conservatives as not being conservative enough  to shore up his standing with his base .
Mr. Steele is taking over his party at what could prove to be an historically pivotal moment .
A Gallup Poll released last week found that 36 percent of respondents identified themselves as Democrats , compared with 28 percent who said they were Republicans .
That is the largest lead Democrats have enjoyed in that poll since 1983 .
And Mr. Obama ’s popularity cuts across party lines .
“ The American people are patient to turn this thing around , ” said David Plouffe , who was Mr. Obama ’s campaign manager .
“ What they are not patient for is more of the same Washington politics .
The real danger here  particularly for those who supported the economic policies responsible for getting us here  is to not be part of doing all you can to dig this country out of this economic hole .
You seem to be sailing directly into the headwinds of where the American people are . ”
If the economic plan passes Congress without significant Republican support and then does little to help the economy over the next two years , Mr. Steele ’s combative style could help conservatives build a case for a return to power .
If the economic plan pays off , though , many Democrats suggest that he may find himself sharing blame for a miscalculation that could set the Republican Party back for a long while to come .
Writing this column really scares me because I wonder whether everything else in the media is as shamelessly , venally , manipulatively , one - sidedly , selectively reported on as the things I know about .
But this week the reality editing was truly without comparison .
On Tuesday the Telegraph , the Independent , the Mirror , the Express , the Mail , and the Metro all reported that a coroner was hearing the case of a toddler who died after receiving the MMR vaccine , which the parents blamed for their loss .
Toddler ' died after MMR jab ' ( Metro ) , ' Healthy ' baby died after MMR jab ( Independent ) , you know the headlines by now .
On Thursday the coroner announced his verdict : the vaccine played no part in this child 's death .
So far , of the papers above , only the Telegraph has had the decency to cover the outcome .
The Independent , the Mirror , the Express , the Mail , and the Metro have all decided that their readers are better off not knowing .
Tick , tock .
Does it stop there ?
No .
Amateur physicians have long enjoyed speculating that MMR and other vaccinations are somehow " harmful to the immune system " and responsible for the rise in conditions such as asthma and hay fever .
Doubtless they must have been waiting some time for evidence to appear .
This month a significant paper was published by Hviid and Melbye in the December 1 issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology .
They examined 871,234 children in a Danish birth cohort , comparing asthma in those who had MMR against those who did n't .
MMR - vaccinated children were massively and significantly less often hospitalised with an asthma diagnosis , and used fewer courses of anti-asthma medication than unvaccinated children .
This " protective " effect of the MMR vaccine was more pronounced for hospitalisations with severe asthma diagnoses .
Those results are n't just incompatible with an increased risk of asthma following MMR vaccination , they actually support the hypothesis that MMR vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of asthma in young children .
Tick , tock .
And most astonishing of all is the tale of " the Uhlmann paper " , or the " O' Leary paper " .
This came out in 2002 and claimed to have found evidence of vaccine measles virus in tissue samples from children with autism and bowel problems , to massive media acclaim .
As I 've said previously , two similar papers , by Afzal et al and D'Souza et al , in 2006 found negative results on almost the same question , and were unanimously ignored by the media ( even though D'Souza actively went out of his way to show how O'Leary et al got false positives ) .
Stephen Bustin is professor of molecular science at Barts and the London .
He examined the O'Leary lab for the court case against MMR , as an expert witness for the drug company defendants .
The case collapsed , and he was unable to discuss his findings .
Then he was called to give evidence in the American " autism omnibus " case against the vaccine .
The anti-vaccine movement did their best to prevent this .
They knew what he had found : it appears to be incontrovertible evidence that the lab was detecting false positives .
Now Bustin has finally been able to write about what he found in O'Leary 's lab .
He published this month .
Nobody who covered the original O'Leary paper has written about it .
Not a soul will .
Measles cases are rising .
Middle class parents are not to blame , even if they do lack rhetorical panache when you try to have a discussion with them about it .
They have been systematically and vigorously misled by the media , the people with access to all the information , who still choose , collectively , between themselves , so robustly that it might almost be a conspiracy , to give you only half the facts .
Today , I have merely given you some small part of the other half , and next week I will move on : but know that nobody else has .

Repeat after me : I hereby resolve that , in the new year , I ...
1 . Will not get into arguments with other geeks about the age - old PC vs. Mac or Windows vs. OS X vs. Linux questions , because nobody ever wins religious debates .

3 . Will keep an open mind about the new Star Trek film and not prejudge it based on trailers that , let 's face it , were probably assembled by some Hollywood PR people who are n't real Trek fans — why , they 've probably never even been to a convention !
I will further remember that eliminating prejudice is one of the tenets of the Federation .

PHILADELPHIA –
If you ever argued with your mother when she told you to get some sleep after studying for an exam instead of pulling an all - nighter , you owe her an apology , because it turns out she 's right .
And now , scientists are beginning to understand why .
In research published this week in Neuron , Marcos Frank , PhD , Assistant Professor of Neuroscience , at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , postdoctoral researcher Sara Aton , PhD , and colleagues describe for the first time how cellular changes in the sleeping brain promote the formation of memories .
" This is the first real direct insight into how the brain , on a cellular level , changes the strength of its connections during sleep , " Frank says .
The findings , says Frank , reveal that the brain during sleep is fundamentally different from the brain during wakefulness .
" We find that the biochemical changes are simply not happening in the neurons of animals that are awake , " Frank says .
" And when the animal goes to sleep it 's like you 've thrown a switch , and all of a sudden , everything is turned on that 's necessary for making synaptic changes that form the basis of memory formation .
It 's very striking . "
The team used an experimental model of cortical plasticity – the rearrangement of neural connections in response to life experiences .
" That 's fundamentally what we think the machinery of memory is , the actual making and breaking of connections between neurons , " Frank explains
In this case , the experience Frank and his team used was visual stimulation .
Animals that were young enough to still be establishing neural networks in response to visual cues were deprived of stimulation through one eye by covering that eye with a patch .
The team then compared the electrophysiological and molecular changes that resulted with control animals whose eyes were not covered .
Some animals were studied immediately following the visual block , while others were allowed to sleep first .
From earlier work , Frank 's team already knew that sleep induced a stronger reorganization of the visual cortex in animals that had an eye patch versus those that were not allowed to sleep .
Now they know why .
A molecular explanation is emerging .
The key cellular player in this process is a molecule called N - methyl D- aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) , which acts like a combination listening post and gate - keeper .
It both receives extracellular signals in the form of glutamate and regulates the flow of calcium ions into cells .
Essentially , once the brain is triggered to reorganize its neural networks in wakefulness ( by visual deprivation , for instance ) , intra- and intercellular communication pathways engage , setting a series of enzymes into action within the reorganizing neurons during sleep .
To start the process , NMDAR is primed to open its ion channel after the neuron has been excited .
The ion channel then opens when glutamate binds to the receptor , allowing calcium into the cell .
In turn , calcium , an intracellular signaling molecule , turns other downstream enzymes on and off .
Some neural connections are strengthened as a result of this process , and the result is a reorganized visual cortex .
And , this only happens during sleep .
" To our amazement , we found that these enzymes never really turned on until the animal had a chance to sleep , " Frank explains , " As soon as the animal had a chance to sleep , we saw all the machinery of memory start to engage . "
Equally important was the demonstration that inhibition of these enzymes in the sleeping brain completely prevented the normal reorganization of the cortex .
Frank stresses that this study did not examine recalling memories .
For example , these animals were not being asked to remember the location of their food bowl .
" It 's a mechanism that we think underlies the formation of memory . "
And not only memory ; the same mechanism could play a role in all neurological plasticity processes .
As a result , this study could pave the way to understanding , on a molecular level , why humans need sleep , and why they are so affected by the lack of it .
It could also conceivably lead to novel therapeutics that could compensate for the lack of sleep , by mimicking the molecular events that occur during sleep .
Finally , the study could lead to a deeper understanding of human memory .
Though how and even where humans store long - lasting memories remains a mystery , Frank says , " we do know that changes in cortical connections is at the heart of the mystery .
By understanding that in animal models , it will bring us close to understanding how it works in humans . "

The world as the brain sees it .
Optical " polar " maps of the visual cortex are generated by measuring micro-changes in blood oxygenation as the left eye ( left panel ) or right eye is stimulated by bars of light of different orientations ( 0 - 180 degrees ) .
The cortical response to each stimulus is pseudo - colored to represent the orientation that best activates visual cortical neurons .
If vision is blocked in an eye ( the right eye in this example ) during a critical period of development , neurons no longer respond to input from the deprived eye pathway ( indicated by a loss of color in the right panel ) and begin to respond preferentially to the non-deprived eye pathway .
These changes are accompanied by alterations in synaptic connections in single neurons .
This process , known as ocular dominance plasticity , is enhanced by sleep via activation of NMDA receptors and intracellular kinase activity .
Through these mechanisms , sleep strengthens synaptic connections in the non-deprived eye pathway .

One of the most charming contrasting color effects you can get in photography is by using infrared .
An easy way to understand near - infrared light is to think of it as the color of the rainbow next to red , a color that is invisible to the human eye .
But near - infrared is not the same as thermal imaging .
One of the most charming contrasting color effects you can get in photography is by using infrared .
An easy way to understand near - infrared light is to think of it as the color of the rainbow next to red , a color that is invisible to the human eye .
But near - infrared is not the same as thermal imaging .
Because everyday objects reflect infrared in proportions that differ sharply from that of visible light , the tonal relationships are wildly unexpected .
Such near - infrared techniques used in photography give subjects an exotic , antique look .
Green vegetation becomes white , whereas human skin becomes pale and ghostly .
The resulting images look alien .
Digital cameras use CCD and other similar sensors to capture infrared images .
Although all digital cameras available on the market are sensitive to infrared light , they are equipped with infrared - blocking filters .
The main reason for this is that consumer cameras are designed to capture visible light .
But sometimes these filters are used together , giving very interesting in - camera effects like false color , wood effects etc .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
To start with infrared photography , all you need to have is
A digital camera that is sensitive to infrared light .
A visible - light blocking filter ( e.g. a Wratten 89B filter ) Image - editing software , such as Photoshop .
Near - infrared images straight out of the camera do not always look good and are usually not as dramatic and beautiful as normally captured images .
Hence , a lot of post - processing is done to enhance these images .
Some techniques used in post - processing are equalization , focus shift , small aperture , light leaks , digital false color , halo , etc .
Below , we present a selection of over 40 beautiful infrared images .
Some of these images have undergone heavy post - processing , and all of these examples display the names of the photographers , along with links to their websites .

My MidemNet Presentation : Trent Reznor And The Formula For Future Music Business Models
from the cwf -+- rtb-=-$ $$ dept
Connect With Fans ( CwF ) + Reason To Buy ( RtB ) = The Business Model ( $ $ $ $ )

But in order to continue doing so , we need your support .
We offer a variety of ways for our readers to support us , from direct donations to special subscriptions and cool merchandise — and every little bit helps .
Thank you .
– The Techdirt Team
Embedded here is the 15 minute ( trust me , it goes by quickly ) presentation I did at MidemNet on January 17th in Cannes , France .
If you 're reading via RSS or another site like iGoogle , click through to see the full presentation .
Sorry it took so long to get the video up .
There were a few minor technical difficulties .
Anyway , the presentation garnered an interesting reaction and a whole series of fascinating discussions over email , in person and over the phone since I presented it , and while I do n't want to repeat what 's in the video , I did want to discuss a few points raised by the presentation .
The core of the presentation is the following simple " formula " that is the basis for making money in the music business ( and , I 'd argue , many other businesses ) in the digital era :
There are many artists -- famous and not so famous -- who have been making use ( on purpose , or not ) of this formula to create successful strategies for building up a stronger fan base , creating wonderful new works of art , distributing them out to the communitygetting paid for it at the same time .
What made Reznor so interesting as a case study was the fact that he 's done it so many times in so many different ways that he , by himself , represents a great example of how you can approach this simple formula in an infinite variety of creative ways .
One of the issues I 've had in discussing recording industry business models is that we always hear excuses for why a , b or c wo n't work .
" Well , that guy can make money selling t- shirts , but this guy 's fans are n't t- shirt types . "
" That guy will sell concert tickets , but this guy does n't like to perform . "
" Maybe some fans will pay upfront , but people are so greedy that most will just free - ride . "
It 's all excuses .
They all want a simple model that everyone can follow , but the point here is that while the model itselfsimple , executing on any business model is difficult .
It 's about applying that " simple model " in a variety of different creative ways -- which Reznor has done time and time and time again .
Hell , I could n't even include all of the examples of Reznor 's successes in this single presentation , let alone successes by other musicians who havedifferently -- but all of whom connected with fans ( CwF ) and then gave them a realto buy ( RtB ) .
A second point that needs to be discussed is that areason to buy ( RtB ) is a .
Too often we 've seen musicians or other content creators think that there is some sort ofto buy .
And , so they put something out with a price tag , but without doing a very good job convincing fans why they should buy .
There was no real reason -- and then they seem to lash out at their fans for hurting them .
The fault , however , lies with the musician ( like any business ) who failed to give a proper reason to buy , and falsely assumed that fans had some sort ofto buy .
If an artist believes there 's an obligation to buy , fans will often educate the artist very quickly .
One final point on this is the last question that people often raise : why should the musician be involved in any of this ?
Should n't they just be creating music .
There are two answers to this .
First , this is exactly where arecord label , agent or manager can come in and be quite helpful .
Let the musician create the music and let the " business guys " focus on applying this business model .
Second , however , is that due to the way the industry is these days , the musicianneed to be somewhat involved .
You can not connect with fans if you 're in seclusion .
If you do n't want to make the effort to connect with fans , then that 's fine : you wo n't have that many fans .
It 's a choice you make .
That said , there are tremendous opportunities allowed by new technologies , new communities and new methods of communicating today .
They all enable better ways to connect with fans , and better ways to offer real reasons to buy .
Those who look at the past and complain about what 's been lost need to turn around and look at the vast open fields of opportunity in front of them .
There 's a lot more music to be made , a ton of new fans to make very , very happy -- and , yes , through it all , an awful lot of money that can be made as well .
You just need to stop worrying about what was lost and recognize all there is to be gained .

The Apple iPhone ; the perfect 3G mobile phone which combines top of the line mobile communications technology , an integrated iPod and fast internet connectivity - well almost perfect .
Unfortunately , and much to the disappointment of many iPhone users , Apple neglected to include a direct print application on the iPhone and therefore printing photographs , web content and contacts lists is incredibly low tech for such a high specification mobile phone .
You have transfer your data from the iPhone to your computer and then print as you would any other resident data file .
Well there is some good news : 3 companies have recognised the need for wireless printing from the Apple iPhone and have produced some relatively good applications .
In direct competition with HP ’s iPrint Photo is River Past Corporation ’s Air Photo .
This app also enables wireless printing from your iPhone , however it is capable of printing to any available printer .
In addition to this obvious advantage over the HP product is the ability to have full control over the printer settings .
Air Photo will also automatically rotate the photograph for printing and you can also scale and crop photographs prior to print - all from your iPhone .
The major drawback with Air Photo is that you need to install both a server and client application .
The server application is installed on your computer which is connected to your printer , and the client application is installed on your iPhone .
It may sound over - complicated and effort intensive but it is actually very easy to install and once the applications have been installed , no further action is required .
You simply select the photograph you want to print on your iPhone and the application will automatically assign the print job to an available printer on the network .
As with the HP iPrint Photo application you are only able to print photographs and not web pages or any other data , however the fact that you can print to any available printer and it gives you cropping and white space control does make this a winning wireless print application .
This application can be purchased for just $ 1.99 from the App Store .
Before parting with your money though , also check that your operating system is compatible .
Windows XP or Vista is recommended for PC users and OS X 10.5 ( PPC and Leopard ) for Apple Mac users .
2. HP iPrint Photo
There was much excitement when HP announced the launch of their HP iPrint Photo application , which was developed specifically for the iPhone and the iPod Touch .
With this app iPhone users could now print their photographs directly from their mobile phone , without having to transfer the photographs to a computer first .
The application is available for free and can be installed from the App Store , which can be accessed directly from your iPhone or iPod Touch , and it can also be accessed via iTunes on your computer .
HP iPrint Photo enables users to print 4×6 inch photographs directly to a compatible HP inkjet printer .
The application is easy to install and as it makes use of Apple ’s Bonjour technology , allowing it to automatically detect any compatible printers on your wireless network so there is no additional setup required .
In order to use HP ’s iPrint Photo application , your iPhone or iPod Touch firmware must be version 2.0 or later and you must have an HP compatible printer .
This is a very handy application to have on your iPhone .
The download and installation process is easy and it only takes a matter of minutes and you are able to print out borderless 4×6 inch photographs .
The print quality is excellent and the whole printing process is faster than expected .
There are a few minor gripes however as you can only print 4×6 inch photographs and there are no low HP cartridge warning messages .
A slightly more disappointing factor is that only photographs can be printed wirelessly .
If you want to print web pages or your contacts list then you still have to follow the low tech route of transferring your files to a computer .
Overall the HP iPrint Photo application is reliable , efficient , simple to use and well worth downloading onto your iPhone .
Oh , and did I mention that it is also free !
One wireless printing application that has taken the iPhone world by surprise is the aptly named ‘ Print ’ .
Created by EuroSmartz , this application is said to be able to print photographs ; web pages and contacts over cellular and Wi-Fi networks .
Utilising a similar technology to Air Photo , both a server and a client application have to be installed before you can print from your iPhone using the Print app .
The application is also independent of the printer which means that you can print to any available printer on the network .
The only requirement is that the computer ’s operating system is either Windows XP or Vista for PC users and OS X 10.4 of OS X 10.5 for Apple users .
EuroSmartz also claim that the latest version of the software , Print & Share , is capable of printing emails , although they stress that the emails need to be accessed directly through the application due to interface restrictions on the iPhone ’s built - in Apple mail application .
Although the setup of Print can be slightly tricky and it does cost more than Air Photo , at $ 2.99 , this application is definitely worth having if you want to print more than just photographs wirelessly from your iPhone .
Even though Apple have yet to include printer drivers in the iPhone , and rumour has it that there wo n’t be for some time yet , at least these 3 wireless printing applications address some of the frustration for those iPhone fans who want the print functionality .
Whether you want to print just photographs or if you want to print out web page content , these 3 sound applications will not disappoint you .
When Derek Johnson was interviewing candidates for a marketing job at his tech company , one applicant arrived in a business suit .

Mr. Johnson believed the job candidate was presenting a false image of himself .
The suit , he felt , was tantamount to a lie .
Mr. Johnson is 22 -- an entrepreneur who dropped out of college when it got in the way of running Tatango , which enables groups to blast text and voice messages to their members .

The dean of California 's newest law school is suing this seaside community over its treatment of the homeless .

The remains of the 9/11 killers are now held in deep freeze
The £ 30 million CSI - style probe has taken seven years .
Flesh or bone from 13 of the 19 Al Qaeda terrorists who flew passenger jets into the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington have now been identified .
In the most intense crime scene investigation in history , scientists sifted through a mountain of concrete dust , buckled iron and shattered glass to find what was left of the terrorists .
The final tally was 24lb of burnt flesh and shattered bone .
A combination of dedicated FBI detective work and the brilliant skills of forensic scientists eventually put names to the fragments by matching them with DNA traces discovered at the terrorists ’ hideouts .
A £ 30 million CSI - style search through rubble took seven years
The high temperatures generated as the jet fuel exploded meant many of the 2,974 victims and some of their killers were all but atomised in the attacks .
Only 300 whole bodies were ever recovered .
When rescue workers first entered the ruins of the 110 - storey World Trade Center in New York they were confronted with two million tons of rubble that had been incinerated by 11,000 gallons of aviation fuel blazing at 2,00C .
The debris was taken to a special clearing site on Staten Island for forensic examination .
Somewhere deep in an FBI complex in Virginia , a locked steel freezer carries all that is left of nine of the hijackers who carried out the attack on the Pentagon and brought down Flight 93 in Pennsylvannia .
Another secret building in New York holds the charred bone fragments of four of the fanatics who attacked the World Trade Center .
The glass containers are under 24 - hour armed guard as Amer–ica still tries to come to terms with the enormity of the 2001 atrocities and the ramifications of keeping hold of the body parts of killers hailed across the Middle East as martyrs .
The FBI and coroner ’s office staff are holding on to the remains while the 9/11 inquiry stays open , but eventually it may be left to the President - elect Barack Obama to decide their fate .
Although neither the terrorists ’ families nor their countries of origin have asked for the body parts to be repatriated , America is split over what to do .
Some believe the remains should be treated with respect .
But many of the families of the victims say the killers should be left for eternity under lock and key .
Although the FBI has been able to name and release photographs of all the terrorists , the agency is refusing to reveal which of the men ’s remains it has recovered .
Of the 10 who took part in the attack on New York , ringleader Mohammed Atta is the most recognisable but it is not known whether he is one of those whose body parts were recovered .
The fact that any remains were identified from the carn–age of Ground Zero is testament to the skill and dedication of Robert Shaler , who was head of New York ’s Department of Forensic Biology at the time .
In the days after 9/11 he promised the victims ’ fam–ilies that he would try to separate what was left of the hijackers from the people they had killed .
Initially , Professor Shaler , 66 , thought his 100 - strong team would only be able to identify remains larger than a thumb .
The team eventually ana–lysed 21,743 fragments , some no bigger than a fingernail , and were able to put a person ’s name to 12,595 parts .
The families of more than 1,622 of the dead have been reassured that at least some of their loved ones ’ remains can be given a funeral .
The authorities were able to confirm who died using DNA provided by relatives .
Professor Shaler said : “ They did not want the terrorists mixed in with their loved ones .
These people were criminals and they did not deserve to be with the innocent victims .
No one knows what will happen , but I do n’t think they should be buried on American soil . ”
Kurt Horning , whose 26 - year - old son Matthew died in the New York attacks , said : “ It would be sadly ironic if the hijackers ended up being properly buried or sent to a Muslim country when many of the remains of the victims are buried in a garbage dump . ”
NICOSIA ( Reuters Life ! ) - Authorities in northern Cyprus believe they have found an ancient version of the Bible written in Syriac , a dialect of the native language of Jesus .
An undated handout photo released to Reuters February 6 , 2009 shows an ancient manuscript which authorities in northern Cyprus believe is an ancient version of the Bible written in Syriac , a dialect of the native language of Jesus .
The manuscript was found in a police raid on suspected antiquity smugglers .
Turkish Cypriot police testified in a court hearing they believe the manuscript could be about 2,000 years old .
Experts were however divided over the provenance of the manuscript , and whether it was an original , which would render it priceless , or a fake .

The manuscript was found in a police raid on suspected antiquity smugglers .
Turkish Cypriot police testified in a court hearing they believe the manuscript could be about 2,000 years old .
The manuscript carries excerpts of the Bible written in gold lettering on vellum and loosely strung together , photos provided to Reuters showed .
One page carries a drawing of a tree , and another eight lines of Syriac script .
Experts were however divided over the provenance of the manuscript , and whether it was an original , which would render it priceless , or a fake .
Experts said the use of gold lettering on the manuscript was likely to date it later than 2,000 years .
“ I ’d suspect that it is most likely to be less than 1,000 years old , ” leading expert Peter Williams , Warden of Tyndale House , University of Cambridge told Reuters .
Turkish Cypriot authorities seized the relic last week and nine individuals are in custody pending further investigations .
More individuals are being sought in connection with the find , they said .
Further investigations turned up a prayer statue and a stone carving of Jesus believed to be from a church in the Turkish held north , as well as dynamite .
The police have charged the detainees with smuggling antiquities , illegal excavations and the possession of explosives .
Syriac is a dialect of Aramaic - the native language of Jesus - once spoken across much of the Middle East and Central Asia .
It is used wherever there are Syrian Christians and still survives in the Syrian Orthodox Church in India .
Aramaic is still used in religious rituals of Maronite Christians in Cyprus .
“ One very likely source ( of the manuscript ) could be the Tur - Abdin area of Turkey , where there is still a Syriac speaking community , ” Charlotte Roueche , Professor of Late Antique and Byzantine Studies at King ’s College London told Reuters .
Stories regarding the antiquity of manuscripts is commonplace .
One case would be the Yonan Codex , carbon dated to the 12th century which people tried to pass off as earlier .
After further scrutiny of photographs of the book , manuscripts specialist at the University of Cambridge library and Fellow of Wolfson College JF Coakley suggested that the book could have been written a good deal later .
“ The Syriac writing seems to be in the East Syriac script with vowel points , and you do not find such manuscripts before about the 15th century .
“ On the basis of the one photo ... if I ’m not mistaken some words at least seem to be in modern Syriac , a language that was not written down until the mid-19th century , ” he told Reuters .
If Modules have one property that Classes envy it would be their ability for dynamic inclusion in an inheritance chain .
Using Object2 module , however , we can gift our Classes ( and Objects ) with identical functionality .
How to use :
require ' object2module ' class MyClass def hello_world puts " hello world ! " end end o = Object.new o.extend MyClass.to_module o.hello_world #=> " hello world ! "
Since including and extending ‘ modulified ’
Objects is likely the aim of a user , two functions are provided for this purpose .
gen_extend ( ) and gen_include ( ) are generalizations of the ordinary extend ( ) and include ( ) methods and are capable of including / extending Objects and Classes as well as Modules .
require ' object2module ' class MyClass def hello_world puts " hello world ! " end end #using gen_extend o = Object.new o.gen_extend MyClass o.hello_world #=> " hello world ! " #using gen_include class Fren gen_include MyClass end Fren.new.hello #= > " hello world ! "
How it works :
Object2 module works by first creating an IClass for the Class in question and setting the T_MODULE flag .
It then recursively converts superclasses of the Class to IClasses ( up to but excluding Object ) creating a modulified version of the inheritance chain .
In the case of Objects the same process is followed as above except it begins with the eigenclass of the Object .
Download :
Install the gem : sudo gem install object2module
git project : http://github.com/banister/object2module/tree/master

The Gentoo Qt maintainers have been doing a fantastic job of getting cutting edge Qt software into shape with the qting - edge overlay .
I 've been running Qt 4.5 since beta1 and am pleased with the direction it is going .
Recently the devs bumped the Arora ebuild to version 0.5 .
Arora is a lightweight browser based on Qt and WebKit .
I must say , I am impressed .
This browser is lightning fast .
The interface is pleasing , yet minimalist .
You get all the benefits of recent WebKit , and the nice cross-platform nature of Qt .
It feels much faster than Konqueror4.2 , and the recent WebKit engine means better compatibility .
It works with all the sites I 've thrown at it so far and performs great on the Acid 3 test .
All in all it reminds me of Firefox 's early days .
Very mean and lean .
Firefox 3.1 beta2 has served me pretty well , so I do n't think I 'll abandon it yet , but WebKit browsers are becoming quite compelling .
The WebKit devs are also pushing some interesting new ideas out with CSS animation .
This example gives Flash - esque falling leaves .
Maybe we will see less reliance on Flash in the future with the new video / audio tags and work such as this .
It would be nice to move presentation back into structured [ X] HTML and CSS , which is portable , easier to parse , and light weight .
If you are on Gentoo , bump to Qt 4.5rc1 and take a look easily ( both are in portage ) :
emerge - av arora
I 've seen it hit Fedora Rawhide recently as well .
Only one problem : icon is a bit conspicuous :-P

Is this
American General Finance ( AGF ) and Yosemite Insurance Company ( owned by AGF ) practicing fraudulent loan and insurance practices .
Complaints also filed with the Better Business Bureau and the State of Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Services .
I believe that there are many consumers like me being treated in this dishonest matter by them and that a class action lawsuit should be pursued .
Received a car loan from American General Finance .
During the signing of the loan you can pay extra per month and receive insurance on the loan if you become unemployed .
The insurance company is Yosemite Insurance Company which is owned by American General Finance , thus there is a serious incentive for the company to not pay out on unemployment insurance claims where they make your monthly payment for you .
I keep waiting and waiting for my claim to be paid .
They keep stalling and / or asking for additional information for the claim to be processed .
This technique is an attempt to defer costs associated with unemployment claims paid out .
I imagine that there are a very large number of people attempting to get their claims approved because of the state of the economy .
Since they stall intentionally your credit rating goes down the drain as you wait for them to finally payout the claim .
I am now going on months .
Not only has my credit been affected but they are threatening to repo the vehicle which the loan is on .
They are doing this despite the fact that there is a unemployment claim pending !
Following is a letter which I sent to American General Finance / Yosemite Insurance Company .
Many letters with information was sent to both American General Finance and Yosemite Insurance Company before the letters noted below .
This is just one of MANY letters I have sent them .
Lynn A McCallister
Claims Department
Yosemite Insurance Company
Dear Lynn McCallister :
I received your letter dated January 14 , 2009 requesting additional information on my claim # on account # requesting additional information .
Please be advised that I am considering legal action against both Yosemite Insurance Company and American General Finance for the delay of payment on my claim .
This well documented delay , which I believe is intentional , has affected my credit rating .
I submitted EXACTLY what was requested of me by American General Finance for continuation of payment on this claim .
I submitted a continuation of claim form and then oddly enough was requested to fax this again to American General Finance hence this was received by them on two occasions .
I then was told I needed a new initial claim form which I had already filled out at the beginning of my claim filing .
It appears that there was some confusion by both Yosemite and American General Finance ; regardless my account status should not have suffered because of this .
With the continuation form , which was sent to American General Finance twice , I also included my claim information from the State of Michigan Unemployment Office .
This cites the benefit dates and amount of unemployment paid .
Now it appears that Yosemite needs additional information , thus further delaying the payment on my account .
In fact , I was told by Darcy at the Portage office of American General Finance that I had to make a payment on my account since there was still a delay in my claim being paid in a prompt manner .
Following this letter is four pages of detailed information which should satisfy your request for additional information .
I am demanding that my claim be paid IMMEDIATELY retroactive to the time of Yosemite 's last payment to my account .
By immediately I mean TODAY .
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter .
Respectfully ,
---------------------------
And yet another letter sent .
Lynn A. Mc Callister
Claims Department
Yosemite Insurance Company
601 N.W. Second St
P.O.Box 159
Evansville , IN 47701- 0159
Dear Ms. Lynn A. Mc Callister :
I spoke with Cathy yesterday ( 01/27/09 ) and she informed me that you were STILL working on my claim .
I am sure that you remember from my letter faxed to you ( 01/19 ) and my local American General Finance office that I was going to take the delay by both Yosemite and American General Finance seriously .
My wife was informed on 01/27/09 that if a payment is not received by us THIS Saturday that there would be repossession actions taken on my vehicle .
Having a repossession action taken with this seriously outstanding claim is a horrible business practice and is subject to litigation .
There should be no reason that my claim could not be paid today other than by motivation to further delay payment of my claim .
Again , I am asking that my claim be paid immediately !
It is my understanding that your supervisor Diane Briggs is going to call me today I look forward to this call .
Paid monthly through American General Finance is a significant amount of money for the unemployment insurance .
I can only assume two possible scenarios as to why my claim has not been paid yet :
1. This delay is intentional as a means of deferring costs to Yosemite at the consumer 's expense .
2. Yosemite is not staffed according to current demands and / or incompetent management .
It is very clear that both Yosemite and my local American General Finance Office - coupled with their District Manager - did not take my first letter seriously .
Please note that I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau against both Yosemite Insurance Company ( owned by AGF ) and American General Finance .
I have also filed a report with the consumer advocacy group and media powerhouse RipOff Report against both Yosemite and AGF .
I pray that this will not have to be taken even further and that my claim will be promptly paid TODAY .
Enough is enough this is getting ridiculous !
Respectfully ,
Robert

" I do n't know , I loved trying to run in and nick Sachin Tendulkar out , you know .
I did n't want to come in and bowl medium pace and all that .
Just was n't so appealing … "
" … But maybe now that the IPL is around … "
And then Dion Nash laughs .
The laughter is throaty , it comes from somewhere inside .
Just like his bowling , which came from deep within .
Talking about " the strongest and the hardest " thing he ever did - to retire from cricket - he brings in humour with philosophical ease .
It is tough to be philosophical about such a retirement .
Nash gave up in May 2002 , at the age of 30 , with 93 Test wickets and no centuries .
A special talent had gone unfulfilled .
A special talent of running in hard and springy , bowling fast , getting the ball to move away .
A special white - line fever , which transformed him into a " bit of a mongrel dog " , as Gavin Larsen says in his book .
If you watched Nash bowl from square - on , you could see him fly before he delivered .
For a moment or two after letting the ball go , he would be almost parallel to the ground .
Nothing was held back .
It was a breathtaking sight .
But the Nash back could n't bear the burden of the prodigy , breaking down every time he looked like putting together a considerable string of games and taking his game to the next level .
Finally it became too much .
" As hard as it was , it was pretty obvious , " he says .
Nash knew he would have to become " something less and drag " if he wanted to play more .
He announced himself to the world with 11 wickets and a fifty at Lord 's in 1994 .
Incidentally he was in the squad because of an injury to Chris Cairns , and in the XI because of one to Danny Morrison .
" Sometimes it works for you and you get an opportunity at someone else 's expense , " he says .
" Sometimes it works against you … more often than not it has worked against me . "
Nash can laugh about the biggest mistake he made in his career , smoking pot during the infamous tour of South Africa in 1993 - 94 .
He now sells bottled water called " 420 " , which is also a colloquial term to do with marijuana culture .
But the seriousness of the issue is not lost .
" New Zealand cricket was set back from that tour , " Nash says .
" The team splintered in many ways after that and it took a lot of time for us to recover .
" Personally I was disappointed with myself for what I had done .
And this was the first time I had suffered an injury and had to leave the tour .
It was a halt to my progress as a cricketer .
When you are hot and everything is going your way , you want to keep playing . "
In that time of crisis , one of his best traits showed .
Nash was among the only three New Zealanders to have admitted to the act .
" There 's been a lot said and done about it , but it 's not my job to tell on others .
Everybody had their own choice . "
Nash lost his contract and had to work at bars and cafés to earn a living as he tried to make a comeback .
" It was a little humbling . "
The fallout of the tour was a coach , Glenn Turner , who could be overbearing at times .
The problems Turner and Nash had with each other were documented extensively then .
It made for a delicious disagreement : a coach who was a great player and wanted to do things his way , and a young , charismatic bowler who cared not for reputations and was just coming to terms with injuries that would become part of his life .
" I did have injury troubles through that period , and I think Glenn felt that at times there were other things going on with me .
" When you first have a back injury - at least my experience is this - I really did n't know quite what was wrong .
I could run , I could jump , I could dive .
The moment I tried to bowl there were problems .
It 's hard enough to explain to yourself .
To get a coach or manager to understand it is even harder . "
To get the rest of the world to understand is harder still .
When he broke down during the county season in England in 1996 , the scans did n't show anything .
The English media called it a problem of the head and not the back .
" Initial bone scans did n't show much , and that was frustrating , " Nash says .
" I had to go home and it was n't until I had an MRI scan that we came to know of a collapsed disc and the true nature of the injury .
All of a sudden it became apparent that it was a pretty major injury . "
In his first match back after a two - year layoff , Nash almost pulled off an improbable win with the bat .
Chasing 301 in Brisbane against South Africa , New Zealand were 124 for 6 in the 31st over .
Nash 's good friends Chris Cairns and Adam Parore brought them close with quick half - centuries before Nash started the final charge .
With seven required off two balls , he slashed Shaun Pollock towards the third - man fence .
The ball hit the boundary rope on the full and was called four .
Off the last ball , Lance Klusener took a brilliant catch on the boundary .
The previous hit had landed where the rope overlapped itself , presenting a wider target .
It would have been six had the ball carried even a centimetre further .
The story of his life .
Nash can laugh about that too .
" Is n't it funny , though ?
We were only chasing 300 that night , and we batted at nine an over for 20 overs , and now this is what you do .
Back then it was amazing .
Now it 's just what you do . "
That match could have been the comeback of the summer , but the title had to go to Nash alone .
With Cairns and Nash in the side , New Zealand went from strength to strength , all the way to the World Cup Semi Final .
After New Zealand lost to Pakistan in a " shocking " display , he stayed distraught for a long time , sitting immobile and alone in the change room .
" I am a bit of a bad sport at that , " Nash says .
He could either be competitive and give it his all or bother about niceties .
He was once accused of intentionally tripping up Steve Waugh , forcing him to retire hurt .
He also once received a 13 - day ban for " unacceptable behaviour " during a domestic game .
The upward swing , though , continued for both Nash and New Zealand , as they followed the World Cup with their first series win in England .
" Good things came out of it [ the World Cup loss ] , and it kickstarted 18 months of special cricket , " Nash says .
The stress fracture revisited after that .
Six months later he made another comeback , only to be sent back home from Zimbabwe .
The back was playing up again .
He played as a batsman alone for Auckland before starting to bowl in January 2001 .
By June he was ready to bowl in internationals again , in a tri-series in Sri Lanka .
He remembers the first time back .
" You are like , ' Please god , let me get through this over . '
It 's a huge relief when you go off the park in one piece .
But that goes on for quite a while , until you get confidence back in the body .
People who have n't been through that do n't quite appreciate it .
For a lot of the time you are playing with fear and worry .
It 's quite tiring , all that worry .
And that 's before you even know who you are bowling to . "
His figures in the comeback match were 6 - 0 - 13 - 3 , and his victims were Rahul Dravid , Virender Sehwag and Hemang Badani .
The bad luck did n't stay away too long .
Nash was on his way to Pakistan for the one - day leg of New Zealand 's tour there when a bomb blast outside the team hotel resulted in the cancellation of the series .
Then came the next step in his comeback , a return to Tests , in Australia , where he had never played Tests .
And boom , he strained his abdomen - despite which he helped New Zealand avoid follow - on , with an unbeaten 25 .
There was a remarkable comeback in the second innings , and New Zealand drew the match , with four wickets in hand and only 10 runs required for the win .
Just why did he kept getting injured ?
Does he have a theory ?
" We have a short summer , and a short season because of that , " Nash says .
" It 's really only four months , maybe less , in terms of genuine summer .
Grounds are very soft .
We just do n't play the weight of cricket that other countries play : England , Australia , India , South Africa play vastly more cricket .
" In my first year of county cricket I bowled something like 800 overs .
Before that I do n't think I had bowled 800 overs in my career .
Then I got to India - my body did n't even remember how to bowl . "
He chucked on that India tour .
" My body could n't coordinate to bowl .
It was a strange thing .
I started getting there , but my timing was gone .
Yeah , I started chucking , but not fast .
I could n't coordinate , and halfway through I had to try and rush , and it came out really slow .
If you want to chuck , at least you want to throw it really fast . "
A mixed action did n't help either .
" By the time you are 12 your action is cast , " Nash says .
" Certainly by the time you are 22 , it 's too late to change it .
Rather than messing with a guy 's natural action , maybe get the guy more balanced .
There will probably be biomechanists out there up in arms against that comment .
But you are better off bowling with what 's naturally working for you and trying to fine - tune that .
You 're bowling at 140 and swinging it away , bowling with your natural action .
You can't change that and still expect that wonderful art . "
Nash 's art was granted us for too brief a while .
His injury passed the torch to a fellow New Zealander , Shane Bond , who caught the imagination of the world .
As for Nash , yet another comeback followed , when he made it back to the team for the VB Series .
In the first final , which New Zealand lost , he fell while batting and injured his hip , and then worsened the injury by trying to bowl .
That was February 2002 .
Nash tried to recover for the next three months but finally gave up , not wanting to be a lesser player .
A career that had become synonymous with near - misses had ended .
" Maybe I am philosophical , " Nash says .
" We had some wonderful victories , but I think the ones that you do n't do so well in , I enjoy those memories just as much .
" When I look back , even though I did n't have a long , illustrious career , I am really proud that I can say I won my share of matches .
I also got in positions where I could have won and I did n't .
You learn a lot from them too .
Those are wonderful lessons in life that other people may never get the chance to learn . "
And then the tricky question comes up .
Did he underachieve , given his talent , or did he overachieve despite the injuries ?
Mr Philosopher has an answer : " If I had n't had injuries , I should have done a lot more .
But I think my injuries stopped me from doing that . "
And then he laughs .
The saga continues 200 years after Ripley sacrificed herself for the sake of humanity .
Her erstwhile employers long gone , this time it is the military that resurrects the one - woman killing machine through genetic cloning to extract the alien from within her , but during the process her DNA is fused with the queen and then the aliens escape .
Now Ripley must decide where her allegiance lies .
Celtic Jewelry Symbols and Meanings
source : here
It is easy to spot and distinguish a piece of Celtic jewelry in a wide range of different pieces of jewelry in your local jewelry shop .
Most , if not all , of these pieces of jewelry would often have the same kind of designs .
This is not to say that designers of various pieces of Celtic jewelry are extremely limited in their ideas .
Rather , the main reason as to why jewelry pieces have been classified as Celtic jewelry is primarily because of the various meanings these design elements have .
It is also for this sole reason why certain Celtic jewelry pieces are also only worn and given during certain occasions .
Here are some of the most common Celtic jewelry symbols used and their corresponding meanings .
The Celtic Cross
Because of its religious connotation , the cross has always been considered to resemble faith and Christianity .
In the case of the Celtic cross , the four different arms of the Celtic cross stand for the four different elements of the earth .
These are earth , wind , fire and water .
The cross itself symbolizes the connection and the unity of the four elements .
This is further accentuated by the circle that surrounds the Celtic cross .
As such , Celtic jewelry pieces that include the Celtic cross as its primary design pay tribute to the various elements of the earth , which according to ancient Celtic tradition , are the very same elements that have resulted to everything on earth to exist .
Celtic Spirals
Next to the Celtic cross , spiral designs are the most popular designs used in a variety of Celtic jewelry pieces .
Generally speaking the spiral design symbolizes the development of life from birth until death .
Going deeper , the way how the spiral design has been constructed in the different Celtic jewelry pieces provides a twist to this general meaning .
For example , a spiral that spins in a clockwise fashion symbolizes life that began during the winter season .
This is because the winter sun is depicted by the clockwise turn .
If the design of the Celtic jewelry piece shows two spirals circling in opposing directions , this depicts balance in life between good and evil .
Rope Designs
Pieces of Celtic jewelry use the rope design to complement Celtic crosses and spiral symbols to symbolize continuity .
It is for this reason that many designers of different pieces of Celtic jewelry would often use the rope design for rings and bangles as opposed to earrings and necklaces .
Knot Patterns
This particular design is a common favorite for many wedding and engagement rings .
Usually , knot designs in Celtic jewelry come in either one or two knots .
The knot design symbolizes togetherness , loyalty and unison .
Oftentimes , these are used alongside with spiral Celtic designs .
When designers select to use knot patterns with spiral designs , these are crafted in such a way that the design does not appear to have a beginning and an end .
This is to symbolize eternity and infinity , whose symbol coincidentally resembles that of a knot with no beginning and end .

The key to escaping from a straitjacket is to create extra space inside the jacket while it ’s being put on so you can move your arms around enough to undo the buckles .
As the jacket is being put on , cross your arms and grab a handful fabric with your dominant hand , keeping a firm grip on it .
Without being too obvious , fill your lungs with air as the jacket is being buckled and keep the muscles in your torso as rigid as possible until the straps are secure .
Once the jacket is buckled , release your breath so the fabric hangs loose .
Now that you have room to move , hunch your shoulders over to make yourself as small as possible and carefully uncross your arms .
Pull your head through the gap between your shoulder and elbow .
You should now be able to move your arms freely and unbuckle the straps of the jacket .
To learn how to use your teeth to help you unbuckle the straps of the straitjacket , keep reading !
One of Germany ’s most dangerous sex offenders has been released from prison – despite experts saying it is only a matter of time before he rapes again .
More scandals Anna Huck Davis Bizarre sex scandal teacher arrested Anna Huck Davis , a mother of four from America , is the latest scandalous teacher to be shamed for having sex with a pupil - also the son of her partner !
Adolf J. , 37 from Hessen , was jailed for ten years for brutally raping two women and abusing a girl .
But due to a bizarre medical condition , the sex offender does n’t feel remorse , has no inhibition levels and ca n’t stop his sex drive .
The damage came about after part of Adolf ’s brain was damaged after a car accident when he was 14 years old .
Since then , the part of his brain which is responsible for controlling his sexual drive , inhibitions and his ability to decide right and wrong and show remorse does not work .
An investigator said : “ He is like a machine , he ca n’t control his feelings . ”
In 1994 , sicko Adolf abused a 10 - year - old by photographing her naked .
In 1998 , he raped an 18 - year - old girl in his car , tortured her with a foldable spade and urinated in her mouth .
A month later he locked a 28 - year - old woman in his house , threatened her with a knife , raped her and abused her with dildos .
Sex beast Adolf J. was sentenced to ten years behind bars – but the jury underestimated the danger of the man who ca n’t control his evil thoughts , and did n’t put any conditions on his parole .
The rapist is now free to roam the streets again .
One expert said Adolf had ‘ pseudo - psychopathic tendencies ’ and that there is a “ very high chance ” he will commit another sexual offence again .
Even the judge uttered a chilling statement as Adolf was released : “ For us he is a very dangerous man .
We have a very bad feeling about this . ”
Ilsa and Lisa Klinghoffer , whose father , Leon , was shot and thrown from a cruise ship by Palestinian terrorists in 1985 , wrote a letter to the editor asking why The Times was referring to Lashkar - e - Taiba , the shadowy group that apparently orchestrated the Mumbai attacks , as a “ militant group . ”
“ When people kill innocent civilians for political gain , they should be called ‘ terrorists , ’ ” the sisters said .
Susan Chira , the foreign editor , said The Times may eventually put that label on Lashkar , but reporters are still trying to learn more about it .
“ Our instinct is to proceed with caution , not rushing to label any group with the word terrorist before we have a deeper understanding of its full dimensions , ” she said .
To the consternation of many , The Times does not call Hamas a terrorist organization , though it sponsors acts of terror against Israel .
Hamas was elected to govern Gaza .
It provides social services and operates charities , hospitals and clinics .
Corbett said : “ You get to the question : Somebody works in a Hamas clinic  is that person a terrorist ?
We do n’t want to go there . ”
I think that is right .
Ethan Bronner , the Jerusalem bureau chief , said , “ Our general view is that the word terrorist is politically loaded and overused . ”
But he said that sometimes , “ when a person ’s act has been examined and its intent and result clearly understood , we call him a terrorist . ”
Thus , a front - page story last July called a Lebanese man about to be exchanged for two dead Israeli soldiers a terrorist .
The man , a fighter for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , had slipped into Israel nearly 30 years before and murdered a man and his 4 - year - old daughter .
James Bennet , now the editor of The Atlantic , was The Times ’s Jerusalem bureau chief from 2001 through 2004 .
After his return , he wrote a two - page memo to Chira on the use of “ terrorism ” and “ terrorist ” that is still cited by editors , though the paper has no formal policy on the terms .
His memo said it was easy to call certain egregious acts terrorism “ and have the whole world agree with you . ”
The problem , he said , was where to stop before every stone - throwing Palestinian was called a terrorist and the paper was making a political statement .
Bennet wrote that he initially avoided the word terrorism altogether and thought it more useful to describe an attack in as vivid detail as possible so readers could decide their own labels .
But he came to believe that never using the word “ felt so morally neutral as to be a little sickening .
The calculated bombing of students in a university cafeteria , or of families gathered in an ice - cream parlor , cries out to be called what it is , ” he wrote .
Matthew Lieberman is associate professor of social neuroscience at the University of California , Los Angeles .
In recent weeks , he ’s also rebutted the claims of a recent paper , “ Voodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience , ” which explored the high correlations between measures of personality or emotionality in the individual — such as the experience of fear , or the willingness to trust another person — with the activity of certain brain areas as observed in an fMRI machine .
Mind Matters editor Jonah Lehrer chats with Lieberman about why most fMRI correlations are n’t false , the “ reward ” of intense grief and why accepting unfair offers seems to activate brain areas involved with self - control .
LEHRER : Your field of research has come under fire in a recent paper titled " Voodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience . "
What 's the authors ' argument and have they identified a significant problem in this field ?
LIEBERMAN :
In their paper , Vul and colleagues suggest that brain - personality correlations in many social neuroscience studies depend on invalid methods and thus are “ implausibly high , ” “ likely … spurious ” and “ should not be believed . ”
These claims are incorrect .
These analyses use standard procedures for drawing inferences and protecting against false positives .
The correlation estimates will tend to be somewhat higher than the true value , but there is no evidence to suggest that these correlations are meaningless or “ voodoo ” science .
The argument that Vul and colleagues put forward in their paper is that correlations observed in social neuroscience papers are impossibly high .
There ’s a metric ( the product of the reliabilities of the two variables ) that determines just how high of a correlation can be observed between two variables .
They suggest that because , on average , this metric allows correlations as high as 0.74 , that social neuroscientists should never see correlations higher than that .
Given the gravity of the claim , it ’s important to get this [ figure ] right , but they do not .
Here ’s their mistake : it ’s not the average of this metric that determines what can be observed in a study , but rather the metric for that particular study or at the very least , the metric estimated from prior use of the actual measures in that study .
Just because the average price of groceries in a supermarket is $ 3 does not mean you cannot find a $ 12 item .
In fact , a study that I ’m an author on ( and is a major target in the Vul et al. paper ) is a perfect example .
The reliability of the self - report measure in our study is far higher than the average they report allowing for higher observed correlations .
They knew this [ fact ] , but presented our study as violating the “ theoretical upper bound ” anyway .
Their second major conceptual point is that numerous social neuroscience authors were making a non-independence error .
Ed Vul gives a nice example of what he means by the non-independence error in a chapter with [ Massachusetts Institute of Technology neuroscientist ] Nancy Kanwisher .
They suggest that we might be interested in whether a psychology or a sociology course is harder and assess this [ question ] by comparing the grades of students who took both courses .
In a comparison of all students , we find no difference in scores .
But what if we began by selecting only students who scored higher in psychology than sociology and then statistically compared those ?
If we used the results of that analysis to draw a general inference about the two courses , this [ strategy ] would be a non-independence error , because the selection of the sample to test is not independent of the criterion being tested .
This [ practice ] would massively bias the results .
Although Vul is absolutely right that this would be a major error , he ’s not describing what we actually do .
Vul ’s example assumes that the question that we are interested in is how the entire brain correlates with a personality measure or responds differently to two tasks .
Staying with the grades examples , what social neuroscientists are really doing , however , is something closer to asking , “ Across all colleges in the country , are there colleges where psychology grades are higher than sociology grades ? ”
In other words , the question is not what the average difference is across all schools , but rather which schools show a difference .
There is nothing inappropriate about asking this question or about describing the results found in those schools where a significant effect emerges .
With whole - brain analyses in fMRI , we ’re doing the same thing .
We are interested in where significant effects are occurring in the brain and when we find them we describe the results in terms of means , correlations , and so on .
We are not cherry - picking regions and then claiming these represent the effects for the whole brain .
Vul et al. sent a survey around to the authors of about 50 papers to find out if authors were making the non-independence error , but they never told the authors what they were really interested in and the questions they sent did not actually assess the right information about the methods used in these studies .
Based on the wrong information about the studies , they characterized half of the studies as making the non-independence error .
I ’ve been in touch with authors of almost all of the criticized studies and almost all of them have said something along the lines of .
“ Of course I did n’t use the method Vul et al. describe .
Who would ever do that ? ”
And that ’s the problem .
Nobody does the analyses that Vul et al. are accusing us of .
What we do is test thousands of spots in the brain ( called “ voxels ” ) to see if the differences in activity from one subject to the next reliably relates to differences on , say , a personality measure like neuroticism .
This procedure is entirely valid .
Then , a subset of the tests — those considered reliable enough that they would replicate — are reported in a table in the article ( or in a figure or in the text ) .
I suppose we could include a 200 - page table and report the significance of every voxel in the brain , but everyone understands that we report the most significant activations and that the remaining regions have less significant results ( this is the standard reporting procedure for scientific research ) .
You have to remember that our goal is not to find the average effect in the brain , but to find where in the brain significant effects occur .
The procedure we use is exactly the right one to do in order to answer that question .
LEHRER :
They provide different sources of evidence ( for example , simulations and analyses of published studies ) to make their point .
How compelling , in your opinion , is the evidence ?
LIEBERMAN : Vul et al. provide some pieces of evidence for their argument that seem quite compelling at first blush , but that do not hold up under careful inspection .
First , they include a simulation to show that correlations as high as 0.80 in fMRI data can be observed even when the true correlation in the population is zero .
This [ fact ] is true of every study ever run by a behavioral scientist .
There is always some probability , no matter how small , that the observed results could be due to chance alone .
That ’s what a p-value assesses .
The real question is how often will such large observed effects occur , when the true correlation is zero , under realistic conditions in fMRI studies .
Vul et al. conducted their simulation assuming an fMRI sample size of 10 subjects , but fMRI studies rarely have sample sizes this small .
Indeed , in their “ meta- analysis ” of social neuroscience fMRI studies , the average sample size was more than 18 .
In our reply , we simulated samples of 10 , 15 , 18 and 20 subjects , and examined how often correlations of 0.80 will be observed when there is no real effect .
When the sample is 10 , at least one large spurious correlation is likely to happen in a large percentage of simulated studies .
When the sample size is increased to 18 subjects , however , there are spurious correlations in only a small percentage of simulated studies .
So spurious correlations can occur , but they will be rare in typical fMRI studies .
It is also important to remember that if a correlation is spurious , its spatial location in the brain should be random , but our correlational effects are not random .
Studies of empathy for pain , fear of pain and the social pain of being rejected all show correlations between self - report measures and activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex .
This region is the same one that is surgically lesioned to treat intractable chronic pain — hardly random .
In your interview with Ed Vul , I see that he suggests that even if these effects are n’t entirely spurious , they may only account for a relatively small percentage of the variance and thus are n’t that scientifically interesting .
First of all , that ’s a major admission right there to go from arguing these are “ spurious and invalid ” to admitting they are “ probably valid , but modest . ”
Second of all , there are people who would otherwise be dead if we adopted Vul ’s opinions regarding the importance of small effects .
The biggest study to examine the effects of aspirin on heart attacks was stopped midway through the study because the experimenters looked at the data and realized it was unethical to prevent subjects in the placebo control from taking aspirin .
Significantly more people had died from heart attacks in the placebo condition than the aspirin condition , and yet the experimental manipulation ( aspirin versus placebo ) in this study accounted for less than 1 percent of the variance in the outcomes .
So is there likely to be some inflation in the r-values obtained in whole - brain correlational analyses ?
Sure , but we ’ve known this for a long time and most studies are interested in identifying where in the brain meaningful relations are occurring rather than estimating their exact magnitude .
Are the reported correlations egregiously inflated ?
Based on the sample of studies that Vul et al. survey , probably not .
Is an invalid method being used to test whether meaningful correlations are present and therefore worthy of the label “ voodoo ” ?
No way .
LEHRER : Do you think this controversy has had any positive benefits for the field , even though you strongly disagree with its findings ?
LIEBERMAN :
The answer is yes , but it ’s worth taking a moment to discuss the potential harm as well .
Despite the fact that Vul et al . ’s novel claims ( impossibly high correlations , invalid methods ) are demonstrably false , these claims have the potential to bring great harm to the field .
There are people at funding agencies and top journals wondering whether they should continue to support this kind of work .
And this [ effect ] does n’t just involve social neuroscience either , because anyone reading their paper can recognize that the issues Vul et al.
raise , albeit incorrectly , apply equally to all areas of cognitive neuroscience .
So even if people in the field recognize the limitations of the Vul et al.
argument , it may be a challenge to regain the trust of those we count on to support our work .
It ’s a well - known social psychological fact that when someone is cleared of a crime , the lasting association is between the person and the crime , rather than the fact that they were cleared .
On to the good news .
I think this is getting lots of people to think more carefully about many different kinds of analyses .
For instance , many of the “ independent ” correlations that Vul et al. approve of have a source of bias ( restriction of range ) that causes them to under - estimate the true correlation value .
There ’s a statistical correction for this and we ’ve included it in our reply .
Additionally , the results of the simulation we ran in our reply was illuminating for us .
Based on how we and other social neuroscientists typically analyze data , this simulation suggests that we should really be aiming for samples of at least 18 subjects because at this size , there was a dramatic drop in the number of false positives ( for example , finding a correlation of r=0.80 when no true correlation existed ) .
Of course , we would always like to run larger samples but the expense of imaging is tremendous .
LEHRER : You 've studied some of the brain differences underlying different types of grief , and found that , paradoxically , extreme grief is actually characterized by the activation of " reward centers " in the brain .
Could you explain the data ?
And what can this teach us about the nature of grief ?
LIEBERMAN :
In this study , headed by Mary - Frances O’Connor [ of the University of California at Los Angeles ] , we looked at two groups of women whose mothers or sisters had died from breast cancer in the past few years .
One group had gone through the grief process and recovered relatively normally ( normal grief ) and the other group was diagnosed with “ complicated grief , ” meaning that they were not recovering with the passage of time .
Both groups were shown images and words meant to remind them of the deceased ( along with control images and words that did not ) .
Both groups showed activity in the pain network that we previously observed during social exclusion .
When we compared the two groups with one another , however , there was no difference in the activity in the pain network .
Instead , we observed greater activity in a reward region ( ventral striatum ) in the complicated grief subjects relative to the normal grief subjects .
This is the first study to find this effect so any interpretation is preliminary .
Nevertheless , this activation may reflect something like a craving for connection with the deceased much like the craving for a drug in an addicted individual .
To this end , we found that the activity in this same “ reward ” region was significantly associated with the extent to which subjects told us they were yearning for the deceased .
It also reminds us that activity in the reward regions of the brain may not always signal greater well - being for an individual .
Indeed , from a Buddhist perspective , these attachments and cravings gets us into just as much trouble as the more obviously negative events we all try to avoid .
LEHRER : You 've found that the ability to accept unfair offers requires the activation of cortical areas typically associated with self - control .
What can this teach us about our propensity for fairness ?
We do n’t know if accepting unfair offers “ requires ” lateral prefrontal activations , but we did see these activations when people did accept a certain kind of unfair offer .
[ Psychologist ]
Alan Sanfey [ of Princeton University ] and colleagues published the first fMRI study of the ultimatum game in 2003 .
In this game , the proposer decides how to split $ 10 between himself and the responder , and the responder decides whether to accept or not .
The interesting part of the game is that if the responder says no , both players get nothing .
When the proposer offers $ 5 , an even split , responders nearly always accept , but when the proposer offers $ 1 or $ 2 , the responder will often decline — even when the proposer and responder will never play the game again making reputational concerns irrelevant .
Sanfey found that responders receiving unfair offers of $ 1 and $ 2 out of $ 10 had greater insula activity , a limbic region associated with pain and visceral distress .
Moreover , greater activity in this region was associated with a greater tendency to reject the “ unfair ” offer .
We conducted a similar study in my lab , headed by Golnaz Tabibnia , in which we looked at two things .
First , is there an observable effect of being treated fairly , above and beyond the higher monetary payouts associated with fairness ?
We looked at this by comparing offers such as $ 5 out of $ 10 to offers such as $ 5 out of $ 23 .
In both cases , you can earn $ 5 , but the first offer is much fairer than the second .
We found that when we took the monetary aspect out of the picture in this way , we still saw activity throughout the brain ’s reward network , associated with being treated fairly .
This [ finding ] is consistent with a number of recent studies showing that positive social treatment from others activates reward regions .
Because we included offers such as $ 5 out of $ 23 , we could also look at something new that Sanfey could not .
This offer is unfair , but to the typical college undergraduate it is a financially desirable proposition ( $ 5 is the maximum reward in most neuroscience ultimatum game studies ) .
Rejecting $ 1 out of $ 10 is easy , but $ 5 out of $ 23 is a different story .
There are at least two things that might be going on when people accept these unfair but desirable offers .
On the one hand , the pure reward potential might be highly motivating .
In this case , one would expect to see more activity in reward regions like the ventral striatum when accepting $ 5 out of $ 23 compared to when they reject these offers .
We did not see any evidence for that .
Alternatively , this could be a case of self - control , in which people may say to themselves “ that may be an insulting offer , but if I resist the temptation to get revenge , I can leave with more money . ”
Although our data ca n’t establish whether subjects actually thought something like that , the data were certainly consistent with that kind of process .
When people accepted these offers , we saw increased activity in right inferior prefrontal cortex ( a region involved in various forms of self - control ) , decreased activity in the insula , and an inverse relationship between the regions such that greater prefrontal activity was associated with diminished insula activity .
This [ finding ] is consistent with the idea that people are regulating their distress in order to achieve the long - term financial benefit .
One interesting implication of this is that it suggests our impulse is to reject unfair treatment rather than to get the money and that it is our cognitive abilities that lead us to accept , rather than to reject , the unfair treatment and take the money .

( breakingviews.com ) --
Why should U.S. taxpayers give General Motors another $ 16 billion in aid ?
After all , just two months ago the ailing carmaker claimed the first $ 13 billion would do the trick .
Because , as the company 's executives argue in the recovery plan they submitted to the Treasury on February 17 , letting GM fail and file for bankruptcy protection would require a stonking $ 100 billion or more in financing , the vast majority provided by the U.S. government .
That makes its latest appeal for help look like chicken feed .
It 's the latest twist in GM 's argument against entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , following on from last year 's claims it would upend the U.S. economy , eliminate more than three million jobs and imperil national security .
Chrysler has adopted a similar approach , asking for another $ 2 billion - it 's already got or been promised $ 7 billion - and claiming bankruptcy would cost up to $ 25 billion .
Why do they think a bankruptcy filing would cost so much ?
It 's largely a result of sharply reduced revenues based on the belief that far fewer people would buy a car from a bankrupt manufacturer , plus support required for suppliers and dealers .
Bankruptcy would certainly be a painful process .
But GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler are relying in large part on a couple of short research reports , neither of which presents its methodologies in full .
The logic is questionable .
GM assumes bankruptcy would greatly damage its reputation .
But the taint of failure is well established .
After all , the last few years have been spent in crisis mode and the last three months in lobbying for ever increasing amounts of government assistance .
Can its image really get that much worse ?
The Obama administration has , at least , given some indication that it wo n't be soft on Detroit - hardnosed restructuring expert Ron Bloom has been brought on as an advisor and insiders are touting a bankruptcy of one or more of Motown 's Big Three as a possibility .
Their job is to prove that the White House has the bite to match its bark and not cave in to scare tactics .
But perhaps GM 's cataclysmic claims are better directed at its other stakeholders .
So far it has yet to reach agreement with either the unions or bondholders , both of which would almost certainly fare much worse in Chapter 11 .
If GM 's prophesies of doom could jolt them to take the necessary haircuts .
Creating a web framework with WSGI on Vimeo
The Michigan Python Users Group ( MichiPUG ) meeting topic from February 2009 , presented by Kevin Dangoor .
This screencast video shows us using WSGI components to build up a web framework piece - by - piece .
By the way , for people who are interested in working on the Bespin server , this is the kind of “ web framework ” that the server is built upon .
We talked to Brian Ford ( brixen on the IRC ) about what 's been going on in the Rubinius project .
Brian lists some of the changes in Rubinius that have happened in the past few months :
[..]
There 's been hundreds of commits and thousands of lines of changes in the past two months .
A couple highlights :
* Evan has added a JIT framework that can be enabled , along with a dynamically generated bytecode interpreter .
* Contributors have fixed and improved performance for a number of Ruby core library classes .
* We 've reworked our bootstrap process to improve the quality of code in the core library .
* We 've got a working instrumenting profiler that produces the same output as MRI 's but better than 10 x faster .
* Adam Gardiner has been getting the Ruby debugger working again on the new VM .
* I 've update our FFI implementation to be closer to that released by JRuby and the MRI FFI gem .
* I 've completely redone our compiler specs in a much better format .
* The Rubyspecs for 1.8 and 1.9 are merged and I 've added significant features to MSpec to facilitate running the specs for 1.8 and 1.9 .
Keep in mind that Engine Yard , through my work , continues to be the major financial backer of the RubySpecs which benefits * every *
Ruby implementation out there , MRI included .
Brian gave a talk on the RubySpecs at RubyConf '08 .
For more information see the http://rubyspec.org/ website .
LLVM , a framework for building compiler backends , has been generating interest for some time now .
There Ruby bindings for LLVM which have already yielded a few interesting projects .
Brian explains what 's going on in Rubinius and LLVM :
LLVM is not currently turned on by default .
We are exploring all options for native code generation .
Evan has been working on a JIT assembler in C ++.
This is obviously a time - critical component .
The gain from generating native code is directly offset by the time taken to generate the code at runtime .
LLVM is a huge and impressive library that can take C/C++ source code through all manner of cutting edge ( and old school ) optimizations to arch - specific machine code for a number of processors .
We 're still exploring how to best leverage its impressive power .
One possibility is to generate LLVM IR during compilation and defer machine code generation till runtime .
The other thing to realize is that optimizations give a speed benefit correlated to the amount of code that can be optimized .
Ruby is a language in which method calls play a very large role .
Unless we can aggressively inline code , optimizations have very little to work with .
We 're exploring a more capable runtime type system that will enable effective inlining .
A big part of last year was spent on a major rewrite of the old VM ( " shotgun " , written in C ) to the new C++ based VM .
Brian explains that Rails will soon be supported ( again ) :
Not to the same level that it worked with shotgun .
With the new VM , a lot of the fundamentals underlying the core library were rewritten .
In particular , we have an issue with our Autoload implementation at the moment that is a blocker for running Rails / Merb .
We 're focusing on all these issues in Q1 .
We plan to have the significant macro and micro web frameworks running including Rails / Merb and ramaze , camping , Sinatra , waves ... any I 'm missing ?
Ruby_parser ( InfoQ coverage of ruby_parser ) , written by Ryan Davis , is a Ruby parser written in Ruby .
Brian explains the current plans for parsing Ruby code in Rubinius :
My responses here are a bit controversial , but I believe they are well supported by the evidence .
There is no benefit to using RubyParser .
It is the exact same technology ( LALR ( 1 ) , read hard and not accessible to the vast majority of programmers ) as used by the MRI native parser , which we 've used in Rubinius since the project was started .
RubyParser is significantly slower and introduces an unnecessary incompatibility point relative to MRI .
We will eventually make the execution or Ruby code fast enough that using something like RubyParser will be conceivable .
But until then , there is no benefit .
Parsing is the Achilles ' heel of Ruby implementations and for us it is a non-issue .
We can use the MRI source almost directly .
If folks are really interested in parsing Ruby , for pete 's sake explore a useful technology like PEGs ( implemented by Treetop ) that will give us composable grammars and truly open up grammars and parsing to lay programmers .
Note : Treetop allows to write PEG parsers with Ruby .
Evan Phoenix gave an overview of some Rubinius design improvements at RubyConf ' 08 .
Brian also summarizes the changes :
There are some big areas that we are exploring but they basically reduce to better compiler technology , better GC , better data structures , and better type system .
Of course , this is iterative .
But keep in mind that Rubinius is a project that is barely 2 years old .
Evan has made outstanding architecture decisions throughout the life of the project and we 've got an excellent foundation in the new C++ VM , Ruby compiler , and Ruby core library .
The Rubinius project has already brought many improvements to the Ruby space ; Brian already mentioned the RubySpecs which are used by all Ruby implementations nowadays .
Another library that originated in Rubinius is the Ruby FFI library :
First of all , while the push into FFI was started by Rubinius , the JRuby folks deserve credit for getting the MRI gem out there .
It 's a win -win solution for all Ruby implementations , but especially ones like JRuby who cannot ever support Ruby C- API extensions like MRI and Rubinius can .
We chose to implement FFI because we had an arguably better API than DL and because it is very tied to the implementation .
All the implementations can agree on the API that is provided to Ruby code , but there is almost nothing in the FFI implementation itself that can be shared .
Rubinius ' FFI and Ruby FFI differ in the support of callbacks :
They are not a huge priority right now , but we will add them .
Rubinius is the only alternative implementation that offers Ruby C- API compatibility to C extension authors .
We do n't have to use FFI for everything because , for example , you can recompile ImageMagick with our ruby.h and you 're done ( not that ImageMagick will necessarily work right now since we 're still working on the C - API , but for example we use the MRI Readline C extension directly in Rubinius ) .
See the Rubinius tag on InfoQ for more more information on Rubinius .
Jane Austen has been Hollywood gold for years now , but when did she become science - fiction platinum as well ?
Her novels are spawning a startling trifecta of bizarre science fiction films , plus a new fantasy novel .

We already reported that the as=yet=unpublished Austen / zombie novel Pride And Prejudice And Zombies has a movie deal .
It 's just what it sounds like : Pride And Prejudice , but with zombies .
Advertisement
And now Variety reports that Elton John - Elton John ! - is producing a film called Pride And Predators .
That 's what it sounds like as well .
It 's Pride And Prejudice ... except that alien monsters descend and start killing everyone in sight .
Says John 's fellow producer David Furnish :
It felt like a fresh and funny way to blow apart the done - to - death Jane Austen genre by literally dropping this alien into the middle of a costume drama , where he stalks and slashes to horrific effect .
And then there 's Lost In Austen , the successful British TV miniseries about ardent Jane Austen fan Amanda , who gets whisked back in time to Austen 's era .
She finds herself living out a Pride And Prejudice - esque storyline .
( But no zombies or Predators , as far as I know . )
Think Life On Mars , only Jane Austen - style .
The movie version is being produced for Columbia by American Beauty 's Sam Mendes , who knows a bit more about movies than Elton John .
Probably way better than all three of these movies combined will be Shades Of Milk And Honey , a " Jane Austen - style story with magic " by Campbell Award - winner Mary Robinette Kowal .
She just sold Shades , in a two - book deal , to Tor 's Liz Gorinsky , according to Publisher 's Marketplace .
Obama to end military 's ban on gays , spokesman says Obama to end military 's ban on homosexuals , spokesman says '
President Obama will end the 15 - year - old " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that has prevented homosexual and bisexual men and women from serving openly within the U.S. military , a spokesman for the president - elect said .
Obama said during the campaign that he opposed the policy , but since his election in November has made statements that have been interpreted as backpedaling .
On Friday , however , Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs , responding on the transition team 's Web site to a Michigan resident who asked if the new administration planned to get rid of the policy , said :
" You do n't hear politicians give a one - word answer much .
But it 's ' Yes ' . "
The little - noticed response , made in a video posted on change.gov , made barely a ripple outside blogs focused on the gay community , but that 's not surprising , said those who have been pushing to overturn the ban .
Not only was Obama 's position expected , they said , but support for reviewing or repealing the policy has grown markedly in recent years , including from some unexpected quarters .
The end of " do n't ask , do n't tell " may not happen immediately , several critics of the policy said .
Although they appreciate clarity from Obama on the issue , they anticipate that the demands of the economy and two wars are likely to trump a speedy policy reversal .
" The question is n't if we do it and the question is n't when we do it , it 's how we do it , " said Rep. Ellen Tauscher , D - Walnut Creek , whose 2006 bill to repeal the ban earned broad support among Democrats in Congress but did not move forward in the face of a near - certain veto by President Bush .
" I 'm going to reintroduce the bill in the next few weeks , " Tauscher said .
" We 've got the American people behind us . "
An ABC poll in July found that three quarters of Americans supported allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military compared to 44 percent of Americans who expressed the same support in 1993 , when President Clinton approved " do n't ask , do n't tell , " as what he called an " honorable compromise " that nevertheless bitterly disappointed his supporters in the gay community .
Former Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell and former Sen. Sam Nunn , D - Ga. , who both backed the 1993 policy , recently have called for it to be reevaluated .
John Shalikashvili , who followed Powell as chairman , has called for its repeal , as has former Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr , an opponent of gay rights and legal protections .
In an op - ed piece in the Wall Street Journal , Barr disparaged the policy for wasting money and talent .
The current leaders of the military , secretary of Defense Robert Gates and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen , have neither supported nor opposed ending the policy in recent comments , saying pointedly that Congress and the president make the laws .
The military follows them .
Recently , the main active supporters of " do n't ask , do n't tell " have come from the nonprofit Center for Military Readiness , whose founder , Elaine Donnelly and other officers did not respond to requests for comment .
Donnelly has argued that ending the ban on gays serving openly in the military would devastate unit cohesion and morale by ordering heterosexual troops into " forced cohabitation " with openly gay and lesbian troops .
But critics of the policy say society has changed since " do n't ask , do n't tell " was implemented to address similar concerns .
" We had a decade in the 1990s where people came out , and people came to know that their sisters and their mothers and their colleagues and their children and their friends were gay , " said Nathaniel Frank , a senior research fellow with the Palm Center at UC Santa Barbara , which conducts research on sexual minorities in the military .
" Familiarity breeds tolerance , and even acceptance . "
More recent years have seen the high - profile discharge of gay Arabic linguists and other troops whose military jobs were deemed essential in Iraq , Afghanistan and the " war on terror " -- dismissals that struck many people as inexplicable , said sociologist Melissa Embser - Herbert , author of The U.S. Military 's ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' Policy : A Reference Handbook .
" We know of gay , lesbian , bisexual veterans who have served in combat theater , and I think that 's also a big piece of it , " she said .
" It 's a much harder sell to the general public that that person who died or lost a leg did n't deserve to be serving their country . "
The military has also experienced a shift in attitudes , according to a number of studies .
A 2006 Zogby International poll found military members who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan to be split on the issue , with about a quarter saying gays should be able to serve openly and about a third saying they should not .
But about a quarter of respondents said they knew a gay person already serving in the military , and a large majority of those — two thirds — said the presence of a gay person in their unit made no impact on their personal or their unit 's morale .
Three quarters said they would have joined the military even if gays were permitted to serve openly .
A more recent , if unscientific , readership survey by the Military Times group of newspapers reported that about 58 percent of active - duty respondents opposed repealing the ban , a number that was cited in some media accounts as reflecting broad military opposition to a change .
But the newspapers that conducted the poll warned that their readers were not a perfect mirror of the military -- they were more likely to be older , male , careerists , officers and politically conservative .
In that context , Embser - Herbert said , it is remarkable that the level of opposition was not higher , since it is the younger , enlisted troops who are more likely to favor allowing gays to serve openly .
" It 's the ' Will and Grace ' generation , " she said .
" They 've grown up seeing gay people on TV and having friends in 10th grade come out . "
In the 1980s , when John Caldera was a Navy hospital corpsman , " do n't ask , do n't tell " was not yet policy but was practice .
Caldera , a gay man now a member of the San Francisco Veterans Commission , recalled how sailors diagnosed with HIV were sequestered to a ward to await the inevitable investigation of their presumed homosexuality and likely discharge .
" The policy ... should have never been created , " he said .
" With this new administration I look for the light at the end of the tunnel . "
Today , Caldera is one of several gay veterans in District 8 of the American Legion whose commander , Michael Gerold , a veteran wounded in combat in Afghanistan , appointed an openly gay veteran , as district finance officer , without hesitation .
" He 's an Iraq - Afghanistan veteran .
It 's just not an issue .
Core competencies and leadership , that 's what I need , " he said .
" I do n't give a darn about the rest . "
Another legion officer , Matt Shea , recalled deploying to Iraq with a friend and fellow squad leader who later came out to him .
" It 's about competence , about being able to do your job .
He was a better leader than most , took care of his guys better than most I 'd seen , " said Shea .
" Who ... cares ?
Seriously . "
The 7 Most ‘ American ’ Places Outside US
Americans are known to work hard and play even harder .
That ’s why when they ’re exhausted from their 9 - 5 ’s , they like to relax , kick up their feet and take a vacation to get away from the daily stresses .
What if Americans could jet off to some place that offers an exotic twist but still maintains the familiar comforts of the American lifestyle ?
What if they could spend the day hiking through the rainforest but still grab a Big Mac for supper , all while feeling safe , comfortable , and welcome ?
Here are the 7 most ‘ American ’ places outside the US , places where Americans will feel right at home .
Toronto , Canada
Population : 2.5 million
Language : English
Approximate Distance : 60 miles
Peter Ustinov famously described Toronto as “ New York run by the Swiss ” , and it is one of the top vacationing spots for Americans looking for fast and easy international travel .
Toronto comes without the dreaded culture shock or 10 flights .
Only a 90 minute drive from the US border , Toronto ’s climate is similar to any of the northern states complete with hot , humid summers .
Since the US is Canada ’s leading trading partner , it ’s pretty easy to understand why Toronto would share many of the same restaurants , shopping centers , products , customs and amenities that are present in the US .
Toronto may make Americans feel like they ’ve never left home but the city definitely has great tourist attractions to keep tourists busy .
The CN Tower which held the world record of tallest free - standing structure for 30 years , one of the largest zoos in the world , the Toronto Zoo , as well as several famous art galleries , museums and sporting events – just to name a few .
Overall , Canada is n’t that different from the US .
While staying there , Americans can still watch their favorite television shows , rent the same movies , eat many of the same foods , read about the same celebrities and communicate fluently .
And despite some sibling rivalry between the two countries , Americans are overwhelmingly welcome to cross the border .
Sydney , Australia
Population : 4.28 million
Language : English
Approximate Distance : 9400 miles
Considering Australia is predominantly of British origin , it makes sense that this is another country that will provide a safe and homey tourist destination for Americans .
The two countries share a very long and deep relationship spanning back many years and have subsequently developed a tight bond .
Both countries share similar outlooks , cultures and values and both have a strong commitment to democracy and human rights .
From evolution to linguist similarities , Americans share much common ground with the Aussies down under .
The climate is temperate with warm summers making for easy adjustment for southern or northern Americans .
Australia is also one of the top ten most tourist friendly countries in the world so Americans do n’t have to worry about feeling unwelcomed .
Sydney provides an ‘ American ’ feel while still offering incredibly unique experiences .
From the wild outback to fascinating wildlife , Sydney is known for its spectacular beauty and famous landscapes .
Check out Sydney ’s most famous beach , Bondi Beach , take a tour of Taronga Zoo , visit the Chinese Garden of Friendship or taste a bit of culture at the famous Sydney Opera House .
Sydney will gladly open her arms and take tourists on a journey of a lifetime , all while still providing the basic comforts and luxuries Americans are used too .
London , England
Population : 7.55 million
Language : English
Approximate Distance : 3000 miles
London , England may be on the other side of the world , but it is another great place for a comfortable American vacation .
The US was founded by 13 British colonies but the two share much more than just history and lineage .
The predominant language used in London is English ( though the British certainly have their own unique slang ) so the learning curve is small .
London is also influenced by the familiar Anglo - Saxon culture Americans are accustomed too .
From music and art to fashion , sports and media , the similarities between the US and London are great .
London is also a European hub for business , finance , politics and more so Americans will recognize many of the brands and companies while travelling through the city .
However , London is still rich with historic treasures , containing four of the World Heritage Sites and for those looking for a bit of fun and adventure , there are many worthwhile tourist attractions including beautiful parks and gardens , theaters , galleries , museums , and many famous landmarks such as the Buckingham Palace .
Tourists can enjoy London all while still feeling the ease of being at home in “ the States ” England is also one of the top ten countries that love America , so Americans can expect a warm and friendly welcome – just remember to drive on the other side of the road !
Monterrey , Mexico
Population : 1.3 million
Language : Spanish
Approximate Distance : 280 miles
143 miles south of the US border lies another top destination spot for Americans looking to balance familiarity with the exotic .
As one of Mexico ’s largest cities , Monterrey looks and feels much like Phoenix but with a more pronounced Spanish flavor .
Sharing a border and being large trading partners has had a huge impact on Monterrey life , blending mariachis and tacos with Wal - Marts and Applebee’s .
Monterrey is a fast growing metropolis full of ‘ americanizados ’ ( Americanization ) as well as rich culture .
Although some of the more southern areas of Mexico have shown concern regarding the growing American influence , in Monterrey , residents welcome it with open arms .
The great thing about travelling to Monterrey is while you can still experience things like American - style football , fast - food restaurants , American television and the latest US fashions , there is still a very strong commitment to keeping Mexican tradition and culture alive .
There are hundreds of landmarks and cultural sites such as the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey or Museo de Historia Mexicana and breath taking scenery full of waterfalls , mountains , caves and wildlife .
Monterrey has also been ranked as one of the most secure cities in Latin America and Mexico , so Americans thinking of making Monterrey their getaway of choice , will find themselves in a safe home away from home .
Stockholm , Sweden
Population : 807,301
Language : Swedish
Approximate Distance : 5400 miles
With the unique location of being built on 14 different islands , Stockholm , Sweden is certainly a rare sight to behold for any tourist .
It is considered one of the most beautiful capital cities on the planet , but it ’s also one of the most Americanized cities in Europe .
The Swedes have always been early adopters of American products and trends , and this has created a melting pot of western and European culture that is prevalent in Stockholm .
Stockholm is also a very ‘ English - friendly ’ European city .
Since the late 1940 ’s , English has been a compulsory subject in school for Swedes and despite its northerly location ; Stockholm ’s weather is much like Seattle but with a slightly colder winter .
The beauty of Stockholm for American tourists is not just its minimal learning curve , but also the extraordinary location , preserved mediaeval city Gamla Stan with fairy tale towers , renowned museums , distinguished theaters , World Heritage Sites and how easy it is to see it all – most attractions are found in the inner city .
There is even an amusement park complete with a tunnel of love , roller coaster , and funhouse .
Stockholm is known for its superb and diverse food thanks to immigration , but Americans can still enjoy an all - American chain like TGI Friday’s .
Frankfurt , Germany
Population : 670,000
Language : German
Approximate Distance : 4000 miles
Frankfurt , Germany seems an unlikely place for those looking to vacation in an ‘ American ’ city , but it ’s the most US - influenced city in Germany .
After World War II , Frankfurt was left in ruins and the city turned to innovation rather than restoration and constructed a city skyline that would give New York a run for its money .
This stunning landscape of skyscrapers has dubbed Frankfurt as a German “ Mainhattan ” ( Frankfurt is located on the Main River ) .
Another surprising fact about Frankfurt is that one in three people living there do not hold a German passport .
That means it ’s easy to find someone who speaks your language and serves your favorite food .
Frankfurt has long developed a reputation as being a liberal and hospitable haven stemming from centuries of being a trading center .
Frankfurt has already secured itself as a major economic and business hub for Germany and Europe , but it is working to distinguish itself as an attraction for literature and art connoisseurs .
The city has an energetic nightlife , an array of museums and festivals and one of the most important zoos in Europe , the Frankfurt Zoological Garden – almost all of which lie inside the old city walls .
Frankfurt offers the frills of home surrounded by historic wonders spanning back 1200 years .
Panama City , Panama
Population : 813,097
Language : Spanish
Approximate Distance : 2600 miles
Panama and the US have had close historical ties dating back decades .
The US has assisted Panamanians in promoting economic , political , security and social development through out the country and many Americans are now making Panama their retirement destination of choice because Panama is such a welcoming and friendly place for Americans to travel to , particularly Panama City .
Panama City is the capital and largest city of Panama and has previously been chosen to be the American Capital of Culture .
Panama uses the American dollar and most Panamanians are bilingual in English as well .
However , even with such a strong American presence , Panama City still offers many stunning attractions and historical sights to see that are exclusive to Panama culture .
Stroll along beautiful beaches , hike through tropical rain forests , relax in world - class hotels ( Panama City has the 2nd highest hotel occupancy rate in the world behind Perth , Australia ) , and get a taste of Panamanian culture by visiting the Old Quarter .
Panama City offers a safe and beautiful vacationing spot where Americans can easily fit in .
Whether Americans want to travel to the other side of the world or take a 90 minute road trip to the neighboring country , they can easily find a warm , welcoming tourist destination where they can relax and explore something new , all while feeling like they ’ve never left home .
Meeting up with dudes I meet on Craigslist to buy or sell concert tickets has been some of the best mini - dates I 've ever been on .
The whole process is already like a blind date anyway , just a whole lot shorter .
All blind dates , in fact , should only revolve around exchanging something .
That way you actually have a purpose of meeting , as opposed to just getting laid .
Of course getting laid is its own purpose , and can also be considered an exchange of goods and services .
But at least if it's not a match , you do n't have to fake your way through an entire meal .
You need to bond over a common interest – you ’re both obviously into the same bands and what brings people closer together than a shared taste in music ?
This leads to brief emails back and forth and then comes the awkward " this is my voice " phone conversation , to finally waiting outside their apartment so you can meet face to face .
But that ’s when the drawn out part of the dating process ends .
You make few pleasantries , exchange money and tickets , and leave .
There ’s no moment where you ’re obligated to kiss anybody , no giant pause at the end of the night where you ’re forced to decide whether this person is worth your time or not .
But , you ’re still being social , introducing yourself to new faces , putting yourself “ out there ” without feeling like you ’re supposed to put out .
And hey , if a connection sparks in between taking his money for your general admission Fall Out Boy tickets , you can always tell people you met in a less embarrassing way than “ online ” .
Because seriously , no matter how great and not - crazy the person you meet on Match , JDate or eHarmony is , it never stops being humiliating admitting to people how you met .
That ’s why I ’m going to start my own online dating service called throughafriend.com .
That way when people ask how you met , you can honestly say “ Through a Friend ” without providing more details .
drunkataparty.com and atabar.com are also viable options .
A new chain letter has hit the tipping point on Facebook in recent days called “ 25 Random Things About Me . ”
It ’s one of the largest cases of chain letters being forwarded through Facebook using Facebook Notes we ’ve seen to date .
While Facebook ca n’t pinpoint exactly when the chain started , a Facebook spokesperson told Inside Facebook that :
The number of total Facebook Notes created per day has increased over 100 % in the last week
The number of people tagged in Facebook Notes per day has increased 5 x in the last week
Here ’s how the chain letter works : the above instructions , which accompany the 25 things being shared , ask recipients to write up their own “ 25 Random Things About Me ” Note and “ tag ” 25 of their Facebook friends in it .
While chain letters have been around since at least the 19th century , the use of Facebook Notes as a channel for one - to - many forwarding is still relatively uncommon compared to popular content sharing Facebook applications and even email .
However , as with any new communication tool , the social rules around Facebook Note tagging are still being defined :
Macro Photography Equipment Tips
What is macro photography ?
Macro photography is the art of taking close - ups of small things and the subjects tend to become larger than life .
Sometimes you need dedicated macro photography techniques .
It is the opposite of micro photography and often the subjects are things like a water droplet on the petal of a flower or a line of ladybirds as they go about their daily business .
What Camera to use for Macro Photography
You can get great results with just an ordinary point and shoot digital camera , but the serious macro photographer will want a single - lens reflex camera .
You can attach special - purpose macro lenses and the viewfinder shows you what the end result will be on the sensor .
What is a Macro Lens ?
It is easier to find a good quality single focus lens for macro photography than it is to find a good quality telephoto zoom lens .
The best types of macro lenses have a ranging length of between 50 mm and 200 mm , and will focus continuously from infinity to 1:1 .
A macro lens helical has floating elements to change the optical design to give good quality results in close - up macro photography .
This is why you get beautiful , sharp images that are focused at all distances in macro photography photos .
So how do you choose a lens for macro photography ?
The same way you would choose a telephoto lens .
You choose a macro lens to suit the purpose you want to use it for .
For example , you may want to photograph that incredible butterfly perched on the edge of a pale pink rose petal early in the morning so you will need a 200 mm lens if you are going to capture it before it flies away .
If your purpose is to compress the facial features of your subject then you will probably use a 105 mm lens over a short wide angle one .
Macro Photography Lighting
A handheld flash is handy for lighting your subjects and is powerful when used a few inches from the subject .
Try using it on one side of the subject while someone holds up a white piece of paper on the other side as a reflector .
This will give a harsh , stark effect .
For softer light , experiment with other material to diffuse the light from the flash , for example , colored gels .
If you have a fascination for capturing close - ups of small things then get out and experiment with different techniques for taking macro photographs , and see what amazing results you can get .
Note :
Here ’s a link to an article for improving your macro photography techniques .
Over the past decade , we have built a country - sized economy online where the default price is zero -- nothing , nada , zip .
Digital goods -- from music and video to Wikipedia -- can be produced and distributed at virtually no marginal cost , and so , by the laws of economics , price has gone the same way , to $ 0.00 .
For the Google Generation , the Internet is the land of the free .
Which is not to say companies can't make money from nothing .
Gratis can be a good business .
How ?
Pretty simple :
The minority of customers who pay subsidize ...
brother beats the crap out of brother with a guitar !

Welcome to the website of the U.S. Department of the Treasury 's Office of Financial Stability , which manages the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) .
This site provides information and data related to the TARP , which was created by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ( EESA ) in response to the financial crisis .
TARP includes several investment programs that helped stabilize an economy on the brink , unfreeze the markets that provide credit to businesses and families , and assist struggling homeowners facing foreclosure .
The authority to make new investment program commitments under TARP expired on October 3 , 2010 .
Since then , Treasury has moved swiftly to replace temporary government support with private capital .
As of October 31 , 2016 , cumulative collections under TARP together with Treasury 's additional proceeds from the sale of non-TARP shares of AIG total more than $ 442 billion , exceeding total disbursements by more than $ 7.9 billion .
Treasury is now winding down its remaining TARP investments .
Treasury is also continuing to implement TARP initiatives to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure .
This website provides information , reports , and data on each of the programs established through TARP , including their design , purpose , and results .
COURTNEY
Love claims she ’s not taking drugs anymore , but you would n’t know it from comments she made in the Jewish magazine Heeb .
Love , whose mother is Jewish but who describes herself as Buddhist , says of ex-husband Kurt Cobain ’s legacy : “ Every time you buy a Nirvana record , part of that money is not going to Kurt ’s child , or to me , it ’s going to a handful of Jew loan officers , Jew private banks , it ’s going to lawyers who are also bankers . . . ”
The former Hole singer also mused on why she ’s given up playing in an all - girl band : “ Like , there are [ bleep ] ing riot grrls sitting there banging on pots and pans and talking about their vaginas , and that ’s all really lovely , but the music blows . ”
On why she wo n’t date actors : “ They ’re [ bleep ] .
They ’re women . ”
And on being a parent : “ I ’m more like , ‘ You ’re not going to do that , so [ bleep ] off , or I ’m taking your computer , and your [ bleep ]ing , you know , BlackBerry . ’ “

It 's a bizarre sight : rows of polished church pews , each dotted with neat piles of fruit or veg .
Shoppers scoop heaps into baskets , trolleys , or crumpled plastic bags saved from previous trips to Tesco .
This is a weekly food shop , cooperative style - a model of food distribution where neighbours work together to take control of their local supply chain .
The system is simple : find a supplier , buy in bulk and collectively cover the costs .
Smaller co-ops will only buy what participants have ordered , whereas larger organisations operate as markets or even set up their own shops .
Some of these " community " co-ops invite customers to become members .
You pay a nominal fee to be able to shop from it , or have a say in how it is run .
Others are more informal and open to all .
There are also " workers ' " co-ops , which are often much larger organisations , where paid employees share all key business decisions .
The concept , of course , is far from new , but it 's proving increasingly popular .
" Interest is definitely growing , " says John Atherton of Co-operatives UK , an organisation that supports cooperative enterprise across Britain .
" We 're seeing rising numbers of buying groups and community shops .
It 's a trend that is set to continue . "
The motivations are many : fears about food security ; food inflation ; the power of supermarkets ; the bruised image of capitalism ; a lost sense of community .
Across Britain , food co-ops are sprouting up in school halls , community centres , farm sheds or even your neighbour 's front room - anywhere , in fact , where rent is free .
" I use the term ' trust trading ' , " says Dan Dempsey , manager of a project establishing food co-ops in Wales .
In essence , he says , it 's about a return to traditional routes of trade : reconnecting farmers with communities , and countryside to cities ; paying a fair price and avoid markups by middlemen .
With strong backing from the Welsh assembly , his team has helped to launch 180 food co-ops in the last three years , supplying 6,000 families and turning over around £ 1 m .
" We 're cracking the system , " he says .
" Supermarkets do n't have to dominate . "
It was this notion of trust that inspired the Rochdale Pioneers , established in 1844 and widely regarded as the first successful food co-op .
At the time , food adulteration was commonplace .
Unscrupulous traders were known to whiten flour with alum ( plaster of paris ) and dry used tea leaves before reselling them .
Not much has changed : from the current scare over pork contaminated with dioxins , to the melamine - in - baby - milk scandal in China , the parallels could not be more striking .
Trealaw Food Co-op , Rhondda Valley , Wales
Nestled in the Rhondda Valley , Trealaw is a long , thin strip of houses barely two streets wide .
This post - industrial swathe of Wales boasts an Aldi , a Lidl and an Asda .
Yet Trealaw Food Co-op still manages to have around 200 members .
Every Thursday morning they collect their pre-ordered bags of fruit and vegetables from the local church .
For £ 3 you get what would cost you about £ 7 in the local supermarket .
" Word is spreading , " says member Faye Jones .
" We offer the personal touch , the way it used to be in the shops . "
The nearby school collates orders from teachers and parents and a local wholesaler delivers the produce .
Volunteers divvy it up into bags and pop in recipe cards and leaflets from local organisations such as Age Concern .
" We 're always trying something new , " explains Jones , who also revels in the social aspect : " They are not members as such ; they are friends . "

Unicorn Grocery , Manchester
" Equal pay , equal say , " is the slogan of this worker 's co-op in south Manchester .
It 's your dream whole - foods shop : brightly lit , well - stocked ; run by motivated , happy staff .
Since it opened in 1996 , annual turnover has reached £ 3.5 m .
" We 're all ' member owners ' , not unskilled supermarket employees , " explains founder Adam York .
Staff share business decisions and earn a flat rate of pay .
A quarterly bonus is weighted by length of service .
Recently , Unicorn began to grow its own produce in a market garden nearby .
To boost production , last month the company bought 21 acres of prime growing land 14 miles west of the shop .
Customers helped to raise the capital after being invited to invest in " loanstock " , a type of five - year fixed term bond , setting their own interest rate anywhere between 0 and 6 % .
" We like to think that this model - which has been around for quite a while - is about to come into its own , " says York .

Just Trade , Lewes , East Sussex
" It 's always a fun night , " says coordinator Keith Rapley , describing Just Trade 's bi-monthly shopping evening .
Established in 1995 , the emphasis is on dry goods .
Local honey and apple juice are available as well as 300 items from Infinity , a cooperative distributor based in Brighton .
It costs £ 6 per year to be a member .
About 80 members download their order form from the website , and then collect their goods from a local school .
" It 's a good way to stay out of the supermarkets , " says member Lorraine Serrecchia .
She prefers to spend her money in the community , and supplements her Just Trade order with fresh produce from local shops .

St Andrew's Food Co-op , London
Father Martin believes in throwing his church doors wide open .
Every Tuesday , while members come to stock up on fresh produce , volunteers run a creche in one corner and a coffee morning in another .
The co-op has 50 regulars , who pick up enough fruit or veg to keep a family of four going for a week for £ 3 , ordered a week in advance .
Only 10 or so of them worship at the church .
There 's no , " Here 's your banana ; here 's your Bible , " explains Martin .
A market trader from nearby North End Road delivers its order en route back from the wholesalers .
" It 's the opposite of going to Waitrose , " says Martin .
" It 's so cheap ; no packaging or plastic bags ; minimal food miles . "
Joanna Dugdale has been a member for six months .
She appreciates the ethical virtue , she says , but what most impresses is the value : " My gripe with the supermarkets is that they really overcharge for healthy food . "

Food For All , Bristol
This project started small : " It was a just a cupboard in an office , " laughs 77 - year - old Lola Hardingham , co-op member and volunteer .
It now occupies a proper shop , which is open five days a week .
The neighbourhood is far from affluent : " People always turn up their noses about Hartcliffe , " she says .
Stock is organic and local : fruit and veg from a community market garden ; meat and cheese from a farm shop ; dry goods from Essential , a wholesaler and workers ' co-op based in the city .
Anyone can shop , but co-op members , who pay £ 2 annually , receive a 10 % discount .
Current membership is
around 200 .
Volunteers also run stalls in old people 's homes , sheltered housing and community centres .
Sales are up and down .
" The shop 's a bit quiet , " says Zoe Templar , manager .
Regulars blame Morrison's , who have recently opened nearby .

True Food Co-op , Reading
A chunky Isuzu lorry , running on biodiesel , is a familiar sight on the streets of Reading .
It is stuffed with fridges , trestle tables and a vast range of foodstuffs .
True Food runs an average of five markets each week , typically at community centres .
Members buy shares ( it 's up to them how much they pay ) which entitle them to have a say in how it is run , with all profits invested back into the business or the community .
Membership stands at 140 .
The website includes a list of tasks for volunteers to sign up for .
It has been a decade 's work for Chris Aldridge , a founder member .
The organisation began life as an informal buying group , and now has an annual turnover of around £ 400,000 .
" I 'm amazed and proud , " says Aldridge .
" We turned something that met once a month into a cooperative that involves a whole community , from all walks of life . "

JONESBORO , Ga. , Jan. 8 ( UPI ) -- A Georgia woman has been charged with cooperating in her husband 's sexual assaults on their daughter .
The woman , 33 , allegedly gave her daughter vodka and told her to cooperate with her father 's sexual demands , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported .
She faces a long list of charges , including rape , statutory rape , incest , aggravated child molestation , sodomy , enticing a child for indecent purposes and giving an underage person alcohol , the report said .

The alleged assaults took place between March and August last year in Riverdale in the Atlanta suburbs , warrants filed in Clayton County show .
Police say that the couple moved from Atlanta and the daughter was also assaulted there .
Police are searching for the father , who faces similar charges , the report said .
According to one warrant , the father punished the girl until she complied with his demands .
On one occasion , he allegedly forced her to stand in the living room for hours until at 3 a .m. she finally gave in to him .
President Obama's $ 875 billion dollar economic stimulus plan simply wo n't work for elementary reasons that any politician should understand .
In order for the government to put money into the economy , it first must take money out of the economy .
Government stimulus plans are government spending programs .
Stimulus plans require new taxation or borrowing .
Any gain realized by government spending will be quickly absorbed back by the government .
When the government borrows to fund spending programs more money has to be taken out of the economy than was originally put in .
So in reality , this stimulus plan will have a negative effect on the economy .
The inflation created from government borrowing will especially hurt senior citizens and those on fixed incomes .
At a time when the federal government is running trillion dollar deficits and has a multi-trillion dollar debt yet to pay off , do we want Washington D.C. attempting to manage the economy ?
The federal government needs to practice sound financial management , balance its budget and cut spending .
That is the proper thing for all governments to do during an economic slow down .
SDEROT , Israel -- Mohammed Abu Hassanin may be a young boy , but he 's old enough to know he 's scared of the attacks being launched by Israel in Gaza .
A wounded boy is carried into the Al - Shifa hospital on Monday in Gaza .

" When the Jews bomb us when we are asleep , [ Hassanin ] says ' We get scared , ' " a translator says .
Hassanin is one boy from Gaza speaking frankly to an anchor on Hamas TV about the attacks , which have gone on for 10 days .
Children like him have accounted for one - third of the casualties at Gaza 's main hospital , foreign doctors say .
And now Hamas and their media are making them the face of the attacks .
The children have seen terrible images of tragedy : their friends injured or killed and bloodied bodies in the streets .
They are images Hassanin says he will never forget .
He 'll keep them stored away until he 's old enough to do something about it .
" When we will grow up , we will bomb them back , " a CNN translator quoted the boy saying on Hamas TV .
It 's a sentiment psychiatrists in Gaza say could be responsible a frightening future --­ that the violence children are witnessing will sow the seeds for future violence .

In Gaza , a little girl wails as she talks about her friend who was killed in an attack on a Hamas house .
" She could be my sister , " the girl tearfully says .
" She is my friend but maybe my sister could die some day , I do n't know .
I am afraid . "
Gaza psychiatrist Eyad el Sarraj said similar trauma to children following past Palestinian intifadas has led to violent results .
Watch psychiatrists explain their fear »
" Today children are experiencing a serious kind of trauma , and I fear for the future , " el Sarraj said .
" The children of the first intifada were throwing stones at the Israeli troops .
And because of the trauma they were subjected to , 10 years later , the same children became suicide bombers . "
Nowhere is safe for the children , and many are without food .
On Sunday , Save the Children staff members delivered food parcels to 641 families -- or nearly 6,000 people , including more than 3,000 children -- in Gaza City , east Jabalyah , Beit Lahia , Beit Hanoun and Um Al Nasser .
But the group said the continuous air assaults and ground fighting are making movement dangerous for needy families .
" The situation has reached a critical level for children who are exposed to and experiencing violence , fear and uncertainty , " said Annie Foster , Save the Children 's team leader for the emergency response in the region .
" Parents are facing enormous challenges to protecting and caring for their children .
Either they cannot leave their house to attend to basic needs for fear of being caught in the crossfire -- or they are being forced from their homes , into harm 's way , to find shelter . "
In the streets of Gaza , where Israeli ground forces are operating , and on the Israeli side , where Hamas rockets are being launched , the streets are empty .
Even playgrounds for children are equipped with bunkers .
Watch the latest on Hamas ' continued rocket threats »
Sirens wail on the Israeli side warning of Hamas rocket attacks .
When asked what they think when they hear the sound , the children respond with only one word : " Fear . "
The threat of Hamas rockets in the south of Israel is taken so seriously that almost all the schools within rocket range of Gaza have locked their gates and told children not to come to school .
According to the Israeli government , 300,000 students are affected .
The threat to children is something , perhaps the only thing , that people on both sides of the border agree on .
Gaby Schrieber , an Israeli psychiatrist at Barzilai Hospital , says Israeli children get excellent help and structured support ­ -- something he fears children in Gaza wo n't be receiving .
And if they do n't get the support they need or hope for a better future , Schrieber worries what will happen to them .
" Where is hope for them , and how can they structure their future in their minds ? "
Schrieber said .
" They can become extremists . "

A volley of rockets has been fired into southern Israel from Gaza , hours after a unilateral Israeli ceasefire began .
At least four out of seven rockets landed near the town of Sderot , with no reports of injuries .
Israel launched an air strike on Gaza in response .
The exchange puts an immediate strain on the ceasefire , which followed three weeks of fighting .
Palestinian medics say at least 50 bodies have been pulled from the rubble since Israel halted its offensive .
Israel says it will not set a timetable for withdrawing its troops , but Hamas said it would not accept any Israeli presence in Gaza .
" We can't talk about a timetable for withdrawal until we know the ceasefire is holding , " said the Israeli prime minister 's spokesman , Mark Regev .
" If there is a danger Hamas is going to deliberately torpedo the ceasefire , and we will have to reinitiate offensive actions against Hamas , for that reason we have to be reticent about withdrawing our forces , " he said .
The stopping of rocket - fire had been a chief aim of the military campaign .
Israeli troops killed a Palestinian near the southern Gazan town of Khan Younis on Sunday morning , reports from Gaza said .
If confirmed , the death would be the first fatality since the ceasefire began .
At least 1,300 Palestinians , according to Palestinian sources , and 13 Israelis have been killed since Israel launched its offensive on 27 December .
Egyptian summit Shortly before the rockets fell , Israeli troops briefly traded fire with Hamas militants in the north of the Gaza Strip after coming under attack , Israeli military officials said .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the latest attacks " again proved that the ceasefire is fragile and it has to be reassessed on a minute - by - minute basis " .

Excerpts : Olmert declares ceasefire Ceasefire may not end war Lebanese fear next step Survivors count losses in Rafah
Heads of state from across Europe are joining Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas and UN chief Ban Ki-moon at the Egyptian resort of Sharm El - Sheikh for a summit aimed at shoring up the ceasefire .
They will discuss how to make the ceasefire durable and respected by Hamas , how to get aid to Gaza and beginning the process of rebuilding there .
But the BBC's Laura Trevelyan , who is at the resort , says with neither Israel or Hamas attending , there are questions about how much can be achieved and whether this will amount to more than a gigantic photo opportunity by those who want to help resolve the conflict .
Olmert warning
The rockets were fired at about 0900 ( 0700 GMT ) , Israeli police said .
Israeli aircraft struck the militants who launched the rockets from the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun , the military said .
Hours earlier , Prime Minister Olmert told the nation that Israel was halting its offensive whose goals " have been more than fully achieved " .

In a televised address , Mr Olmert warned militants in Gaza that if they " decide the blows they 've been dealt are not sufficient and they are interested in continuing the fight , Israel will be prepared for such and feel free to continue to react with force " .
The ceasefire came into effect at 0200 .
Hamas has rejected the move , saying any continued Israeli presence in Gaza would be regarded as an act of war .

" The occupier must halt his fire immediately and withdraw from our land and lift his blockade and open all crossings and we will not accept any one Zionist soldier on our land , regardless of the price that it costs , " Hamas spokesman Farzi Barhoum said , shortly before the ceasefire began .
Mr Abbas said the ceasefire was " important and necessary but insufficient " , and called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza .
Israel has begun pulling some of its troops out of the territory , says the BBC's Katya Adler in Jerusalem .
But it says others will remain for now and strike back if Israel continues to come under attack .
The US has welcomed the ceasefire , saying it " expects that all parties will cease attacks and hostile actions immediately " .
Secretary General
Ban expressed relief , saying the ceasefire should be " the first step leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza " .
Aid organisations have expressed concern that crossings into Gaza will not reopen fully unless Hamas is committed to a ceasefire .
BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen says the question now is whether Hamas decides to lick its wounds and regroup - or whether it gambles on dragging Israel into a war of attrition .

This may be the worst of times to be looking for a job but it is among the best to be starting up on your own .
One thing distinguishing this recession from previous ones is there are lots more young entrepreneurs and lots of low - cost opportunities to exploit .
Whether they will create jobs to make up for even part of the loss caused by the financial collapse is arguable but we must nurture them .
I was reminded of this at a recent workshop hosted by the Brunel University entrepreneurs society , where nearly 150 youngsters , mostly from ethnic minorities , turned out in their spare time to hear a panel of speakers and do five - minute mock pitches for funding before a mini Dragons '
Den of judges .
An event such as this , full of energy and enthusiasm , was unheard of in my youth and you would have been pushed to find it in the dotcom boom of the 1990s .
It is part of a flowering of entrepreneurial talent in London and other regions .
Christian Ahlert 's MiniBar in east London , for instance , regularly attracts 300 people to network and hear people with ideas pitching for funds and sometimes has to turn people away .
This month 's theme , " Hyper - Local " , features embryonic start - ups such as Richard Pope 's StreetWire , HopHive , Spoonfed , and AudioBoo - an iPhone app about sharing contextual broadcasting , not yet public .
Ahlert , who is launching Yumshare , for joint buying to reduce the cost of food , says MiniBar is still growing despite a recession that has made venture capitalists pull in their horns .
And the James Dyson Foundation announced last week it is giving £ 5 m to the Royal College of Art to fund a new building , including 40 business " incubator units " where graduates can take their designs from drawing board to marketplace .
Saul Klein's OpenCoffee Club meets once a week on Thursdays in London , as does The Tuttle Club on Fridays .
For meet - ups near you try meetup.com .
What makes this exciting is that a wave of new entrepreneurs is coinciding with unprecedented opportunities to develop .
Do n't think depression , think opportunity .
Not only is the cost of web startups barely 10 % of what it was in the dotcom boom , but there is a vast new market opening up for the bedroom entrepreneur thanks to the exploding possibilities of the mobile phone .
On some counts more than 15,000 applications have been developed for Apple 's iPhone and iPod Touch .
Apple has created what our mobile operators were too myopic to see : a market where small creators can sell their wares in an easy way to customers that lets them keep most of the income .
The iPod Touch is also a big outlet for casual games , itself a huge growth area .
And this is only the beginning of a new market as the pursuit of fairly rewarded creativity spreads to other phones using Google 's Android operating system or Nokia 's ovi.com , launched this week and aiming to get 50 million users quickly in an assault on Apple .
Trade generated from mobiles - from music to books - is already massive and has n't yet got into its stride .
Half the planet has a mobile , creating a networked market the like of which has never been seen before .
The ecosystem of the mobile phone is a unique economy in its own right , in which consumers merge with producers fired by something the web never had : a simple micropayments system .
How best to exploit this unprecedented opportunity ?
The joint stock company - first popular in Elizabethan times - looks inappropriate after the financial collapse .
We need new corporate forms for a new era .
Maybe people with ideas should join together in groups of 20 or 50 , donating their business plans as their equity and inviting potential investors on the web to put up money in the hope that enough ideas will be viable to give them a decent return .
I 'd rather put my money in something like that than leave it to banks to invest in the next black hole they find .

There is no justification for conservationists to defend particular species because of their “ ethnicity ” , Professor Christopher Smout writes in a new book , Exploring Environmental History .
Campaigns against “ alien invaders ” — such as the cull of American ruddy ducks to prevent them from breeding with European duck species — have no basis in science , he argues .
“ Conservationists are up in arms because they fear the ducks will all get turned into some kind of mishmash , ” he told The Independent .
“ The conservationists would say : ‘ We ’re doing this because it ’s endangering the genetic integrity of the white - headed duck . ”
“ I do n’t think that ’s a scientifically valid point of view .
The concern with genetic integrity seems almost quasi-racist .
Our attitude to alien species is culturally determined and sometimes you end up with rather bizarre actions by scientists . ”
He added that interbreeding between species could often bring evolutionary benefits , and dismissed fears that the genetic identity of red deer in Scotland is threatened by silka deer , which were brought to the UK from Asia in 1860 .
The Telegraph
Convenient of this professor to compile every cliche opposing defense of ethnic - cultural self - preservation into a single article .
Well done !
Conservationists realize that each race of each species has adapted over thousands of years to its unique environment , and each race has its own genetic log of these adaptations .
If it is suddenly convenient for new species to show up , we are not seeing proof of their adaptation to this environment in the long - term , only a shorter - term aggression .
So to mix the two is not only to reverse evolution and destroy natural selection , but to weaken the species for the future .
Like all modern solutions , it 's short sighted and outward - directed , not clear on differentiating between our impulses and how our world works .
We guard the gates of HELL !

A year ago , I wrote to Gordon Brown asking him to place a moratorium on new coal - fired power plants in Britain .
I have asked the same of Angela Merkel , Barack Obama , Kevin Rudd and other leaders .
The reason is this - coal is the single greatest threat to civilisation and all life on our planet .
The climate is nearing tipping points .
Changes are beginning to appear and there is a potential for explosive changes , effects that would be irreversible , if we do not rapidly slow fossil - fuel emissions over the next few decades .
As Arctic sea ice melts , the darker ocean absorbs more sunlight and speeds melting .
As the tundra melts , methane , a strong greenhouse gas , is released , causing more warming .
As species are exterminated by shifting climate zones , ecosystems can collapse , destroying more species .
The public , buffeted by weather fluctuations and economic turmoil , has little time to analyse decadal changes .
How can people be expected to evaluate and filter out advice emanating from those pushing special interests ?
How can people distinguish between top - notch science and pseudo - science ?
Those who lead us have no excuse - they are elected to guide , to protect the public and its best interests .
They have at their disposal the best scientific organisations in the world , such as the Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences .
Only in the past few years did the science crystallise , revealing the urgency .
Our planet is in peril .
If we do not change course , we 'll hand our children a situation that is out of their control .
One ecological collapse will lead to another , in amplifying feedbacks .
The amount of carbon dioxide in the air has already risen to a dangerous level .
The pre-industrial carbon dioxide amount was 280 parts per million ( ppm ) .
Humans , by burning coal , oil and gas , have increased this to 385 ppm ; it continues to grow by about 2 ppm per year .
Earth , with its four - kilometre - deep oceans , responds only slowly to changes of carbon dioxide .
So the climate will continue to change , even if we make maximum effort to slow the growth of carbon dioxide .
Arctic sea ice will melt away in the summer season within the next few decades .
Mountain glaciers , providing fresh water for rivers that supply hundreds of millions of people , will disappear - practically all of the glaciers could be gone within 50 years - if carbon dioxide continues to increase at current rates .
Coral reefs , harbouring a quarter of ocean species , are threatened .
The greatest danger hanging over our children and grandchildren is initiation of changes that will be irreversible on any time scale that humans can imagine .
If coastal ice shelves buttressing the west Antarctic ice sheet continue to disintegrate , the sheet could disgorge into the ocean , raising sea levels by several metres in a century .
Such rates of sea level change have occurred many times in Earth 's history in response to global warming rates no higher than those of the past 30 years .
Almost half of the world 's great cities are located on coastlines .
The most threatening change , from my perspective , is extermination of species .
Several times in Earth 's history , rapid global warming occurred , apparently spurred by amplifying feedbacks .
In each case , more than half of plant and animal species became extinct .
New species came into being over tens and hundreds of thousands of years .
But these are time scales and generations that we cannot imagine .
If we drive our fellow species to extinction , we will leave a far more desolate planet for our descendants than the world we inherited from our elders .
Clearly , if we burn all fossil fuels , we will destroy the planet we know .
Carbon dioxide would increase to 500 ppm or more .
We would set the planet on a course to the ice - free state , with sea level 75 metres higher .
Climatic disasters would occur continually .
The tragedy of the situation , if we do not wake up in time , is that the changes that must be made to stabilise the atmosphere and climate make sense for other reasons .
They would produce a healthier atmosphere , improved agricultural productivity , clean water and an ocean providing fish that are safe to eat .
Fossil - fuel reservoirs will dictate the actions needed to solve the problem .
Oil , of which half the readily accessible reserves have already been burnt , is used in vehicles , so it 's impractical to capture the carbon dioxide .
This is likely to drive carbon dioxide levels to at least 400 ppm .
But if we cut off the largest source of carbon dioxide - coal - it will be practical to bring carbon dioxide back to 350 ppm , lower still if we improve agricultural and forestry practices , increasing carbon storage in trees and soil .
Coal is not only the largest fossil fuel reservoir of carbon dioxide , it is the dirtiest fuel .
Coal is polluting the world 's oceans and streams with mercury , arsenic and other dangerous chemicals .
The dirtiest trick that governments play on their citizens is the pretence that they are working on " clean coal " or that they will build power plants that are " capture - ready " in case technology is ever developed to capture all pollutants .
The trains carrying coal to power plants are death trains .
Coal - fired power plants are factories of death .
When I testified against the proposed Kingsnorth power plant , I estimated that in its lifetime it would be responsible for the extermination of about 400 species - its proportionate contribution to the number that would be committed to extinction if carbon dioxide rose another 100 ppm .
The German and Australian governments pretend to be green .
When I show German officials the evidence that the coal source must be cut off , they say they will tighten the " carbon cap " .
But a cap only slows the use of a fuel - it does not leave it in the ground .
When I point out that their new coal plants require that they convince Russia to leave its oil in the ground , they are silent .
The Australian government was elected on a platform of solving the climate problem , but then , with the help of industry , it set emission targets so high as to guarantee untold disasters for the young , let alone the unborn .
These governments are not green .
They are black - coal black .
The three countries most responsible , per capita , for filling the air with carbon dioxide from fossil fuels are the UK , the US and Germany , in that order .
Politicians here have asked me why am I speaking to them .
Surely the US must lead ?
But coal interests have great power in the US ; the essential moratorium and phase - out of coal requires a growing public demand and a political will yet to be demonstrated .
The Prime Minister should not underestimate his potential to transform the situation .
And he must not pretend to be ignorant of the consequences of continuing to burn coal or take refuge in a " carbon cap " or some " target " for future emission reductions .
My message to Gordon Brown is that young people are beginning to understand the situation .
They want to know : will you join their side ?
Remember that history , and your children , will judge you .

Hi !
You might 've seen me commuting at the same time as you .
I like to ride bikes .
They 're good exercise , environmentally friendly , and really very fun .
I work downtown , just like you !
Full time , just like you !
I 'm tired at the end of the day , just like you !
Actually , you might think I look familiar .
I probably look like your daughter , or your favorite niece .
But I only look familiar if you see me .
Dear soccer mom in the SUV , please hang the fuck up and drive .
Yes , that was a stop sign .
Yes , I had the right of way .
Yes , you almost slammed into me and sent me flying into speeding traffic .
Dear soccer mom , maybe you 've even met my parents before , it 's a small world .
Would you like to explain to them why their daughter died ?
Was that text message to your husband so important ?
Are you that eager to go see your children at the end of the day ?
I want to go home too , alive .
I follow all the rules of the road .
For real , soccer mom .
I 'm a pretty responsible cyclist .
And with all those flashing lights on my bike , if you were only looking at the road , you would 've seen me .
So dear soccer mom , and everyone else on the road .
Please pay attention .
We 've all had a long day .
And I have a pretty short temper .
Next time you hit me , I will get up ( and , yes , I will get up unless you 've managed to finish me off ) , and stuff my U Lock down your fucking throat .
Thanks , have a jolly commute !

Counting down to an election day expected to draw a record - shattering turnout , voting - rights watchdogs are sounding the alarm that a repeat of the Florida fiasco of 2000 could occur in any of a dozen battleground states .
Lawsuits are already flying in many of these states .
Voting rights advocates in Colorado , to take just one example , told a federal judge Wednesday that the names of nearly 30,000 voters were recently purged from the state registry in violation of federal law and ought to be restored by election day .
In a compromise , those voters will be allowed to cast provisional ballots .
Across the battleground states , where Democrats had a 2 - 1 advantage in new registrations , voting - rights groups contend the eleventh - hour verifications demanded by Republican officials are attempts to disenfranchise the new voters .

The flood of millions of first - time voters could lead to crowded and contentious polling places across the country , triggering last - minute identity checks that could deny ballots to those whose names or addresses do n’t match other government records .
“ This one is the meltdown scenario , ” said Judith Browne - Dianis , co-director of the Ad vancement Project founded by civil rights lawyers to pursue racial justice .
Common Cause , the American Bar Assn. , the League of Women Voters and a phalanx of other public interest groups are urging states to ensure that the polls are adequately staffed to handle an onslaught bolstered by millions of newly registered voters .
Voting advocates are worried about its effect in states like Virginia , which has one of the lowest ratios of voting machines to registered voters .

“ Voters will simply walk away if the lines are too long , ” warned Susannah Goodman , who directs the election reform program at Common Cause , a campaign reform group based in Washington .
“ They do n’t want to , but they may have a job they have to get to , and they have to go . ”
Congress enacted the Help America Vote Act in 2002 in response to the Florida debacle two years earlier .
The law provided $ 3 billion for new equipment and statewide registries , but the sheer volume of new voters has overwhelmed efforts to verify their eligibility .
Litigation brought in recent weeks in Ohio , Georgia , Florida and Colorado may serve to alert voters that they may be challenged .
But in many states , the verification methods have created more obstacles than they have removed .
In Florida , an aggressive “ no match , no vote ” standard has been applied to question whether more than 10,000 of those who have registered since Jan. 1 should be given ballots despite discrepancies between their registration information and other government records , said Tova Wang , vice president for research at Common Cause .
Advertisement
Voting rights groups , both nonpartisan and Democrat - aligned , have compiled lists of vulnerable voters and tried to track them down .
“ We ’re engaged in protecting voters from being disenfranchised by virtue of typos and clerical errors , ” said Adam Skaggs , an attorney with New York University ’s Brennan Center for Justice .
He said that the likelihood of fraud has been “ vastly inflated ” and that discrepancies are overwhelmingly the result of innocent mistakes or outdated voter registries .
In Montana , authorities recently sought to drop 6,000 voters from the rolls because of address changes , including soldiers deployed to Iraq , Skaggs noted .

A Brennan Center study of ballot designs found problems in North Carolina , where voters who choose a one - touch straight - party option on voting machines may not notice that the presidential race is n’t included and requires a separate vote .
In Ohio , the candidates for the top office are split between two pages , which could lead some voters to invalidate their ballots by choosing one on each .
In Georgia , the voter registry has been scrutinized for potential noncitizen entries , and thousands of people -- most with Latino names -- have been flagged for identity checks if they seek to cast a ballot .
Lawsuits challenging election officials ’ plans to deny ballots in cases of mismatches in at least six states have been shot down by the courts .
But appeals are in the works , and concerns over access persist in most of the states analysts consider a toss - up .
“ I think we ’re still going to see a lot of problems , in part because some voters are n’t going to find out until election day that they ’ve been dropped from the rolls , ” said Rick Hasen , a professor of election law at Loyola Law School .
“ I expect this to happen in Florida , where they had a very aggressive no match , no vote policy . ”

Citing news reports from Michigan , Ohio , Indiana and Florida , the community activist group ACORN warned last week that Republican officials in those states had hinted at intentions to scan foreclosure filings to identify voters who are no longer living at the address on their registration .
“ This shameless challenge adds insult to injury to those who have been hit hardest by the economic crisis , ” said ACORN , which itself has been accused of fraudulent registrations .
In response to the flood of early voting problems , the Obama campaign , Cable News Network and the Lawyers ’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law have set up hotlines , with CNN fielding more than 15,000 calls since opening its phone bank on Oct. 15 .
While legal challenges loom over denied ballots and voting machine breakdowns , legal experts said they doubted the electoral vote count would hinge on a single state this time , as occurred in Florida in 2000 , when 537 votes separated George W. Bush and Al Gore .

“ The good news story is that it ’s very unlikely in any given year that you ’re going to have such a close outcome , ” said Edward B. Foley , an Ohio State University law professor .
Just in case , he has developed a proposal for a nonpartisan arbitration tribunal that could be an alternative to ceding that role to the Supreme Court .
The two presidential campaigns are also preparing to deal with lawsuits over the outcome by joining nonprofit and pro bono attorneys who are fanning out by the thousands to monitor the polls .
The Obama campaign has been urging supporters to vote early as a way to avoid problems .
“ We think for the most part local election officials have done a good job , ” said Jenny Backus , a campaign spokeswoman .
The McCain campaign has focused in recent weeks on attacking ACORN ’s voter registration efforts .
But spokesman Ben Porritt said the campaign had confidence in most local election officials .
“ For the most part , these things are handled properly , ” he said .

While attention has zeroed in on perceived attempts to deny ballots to certain voters , seasoned election monitors point out that such infringement is rare and usually the result of unintentional human error in a system reliant on lay volunteers .
More pleased than apprehensive over predictions of historic turnout , League of Women Voters President Mary Wilson said the nonprofit was concentrating in the final days on ensuring polls have enough workers and equipment , and was seeking to downplay the obstacles so as not to discourage voters .
“ It does no good to be talking about barriers to voting when we ’re this close to the election , ” she said .
Wilson hailed the improvements in voter registration procedures mandated by the Help America Vote Act but lamented the unanticipated complications imposed by the verification regime .

“ A person can leave off a digit from his driver ’s license , or a woman who gets married and uses her maiden name as a middle initial -- they ’re not going to match , ” she said .
“ Couple that with the fact that the Social Security Administration itself says 28 % of the time there ’s not going to be a match with its data entry and you can see that some of the things HAVA brought to us turn out to be barriers in their implementation . ”
One benefit of the voting reform law , she added , has been the provisional ballot for voters who show up at the polls only to learn their eligibility is in question .
These ballots will be counted if voters confirm their identity within 48 hours , whereas many of those challenged in previous elections were turned away .
Courts including the U.S. Supreme Court have so far ruled against screening efforts that could deny access , allaying activists ’ worst fears .
“ I was really scared , ” said Wendy Weiser , who heads the Brennan Center ’s voting rights project .
“ Now , I am cautiously optimistic , or maybe just mildly apprehensive . ”

Voting rights groups sued , asking a federal judge to reinstate 30,000 names purged from the state registry in what they argue was a violation of federal law prohibiting removals within 90 days of a federal election .
In a compromise , those stricken will be allowed to cast provisional ballots .
FLORIDA
Voter advocacy groups sued last year to challenge a “ no match , no vote ” law , but failed to revoke it .
About 10,000 voters remain on a list flagging them for identity checks on or before election day .
The state is also one of five against which the Justice Department has filed complaints alleging misconduct related to minority voting .

Peak Oil and other threats to human civilization
Massive depopulation of the human species
Can it be prevented ?
( NaturalNews ) Jared Diamond is no doom - and - gloomer ; he 's a Pulitzer Prize winning author of thoughtful , carefully researched books about the rise and fall of societies .
Diamond is best known for http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Cho... ) and http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates... ) , both of which are among my top - recommended books of all time .
When you read these books , you 'll quickly realize that Diamond is perhaps the world 's top expert on what might be called the " holistic , interdependent nature of complex societies . "
Rather than limiting his perspective to immediate , short - term actions and consequences ( as most national leaders and corporations do ) , Diamond intelligently examines the long - term , interdependent factors that lead to any society 's success or failure .
I 've personally read both of Diamond 's books mentioned above , and they have strongly influenced my own views about the future ( or lack thereof ) of western civilization .
What Diamond and I both agree on is that , and short - terming thinking can easily doom a society or civilization to irreversible collapse .
( Another interesting book to read on this subject , although it 's quite technical and a bit older , isby Joseph Tainter . )
Collapse can come from many vectors .
Many collapses are environmental , such as the collapse of the Anasazi Indians in North America or the collapse of the Tiwanaku in South America ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku ) .
Other causes of collapse include man-made accelerations of environmental change ; the classic example being the rampant deforestation ofby its inhabitants ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island#D... ) .
It is the Easter Island example that perhaps most closely resembles the short - sightedness of modern western civilization .
At the expense of future generations , today 's CEOs , bankers and politicians are destroying our future in so many ways ( financial , chemical , environmental , plundering of fossil fuels , etc. ) that it is a challenge to imagine a scenario where western civilization even survives in its current form .
Jared Diamond , in fact , has publicly declared he sees only a 51 percent chance of western civilization surviving .
You can hear this from his own mouth in this video interview : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnZgbyiG8wc&
This is no casual number - tossing game from a newbie .
Jared Diamond has studied the success and failure of world societies more closely than anyone living today .
He describes himself as " cautiously optimistic " but worries that the outlandish financial decisions being made by the world 's leaders have put us all in a precarious position from which western civilization may not emerge intact .
In my own view , the financial challenges facing our world are , indeed , quite severe .
And they may yet bring down the entire global banking system .
But in the medium term , I seeas being the far greater threat to the continuation of human civilization as we know it .
Cheap , plentiful fossil fuels discovered in the last hundred years ( or so ) spurred a food bubble , which led to a population bubble .
Cheap oil , in other words , created the temporary conditions necessary to support a runaway population explosion that is , without question , unsustainable without cheap energy .
But cheap oil is finite .
And based on all reasonable accounting , world oil production is already in a state of substantial decline .
That means oil will become increasingly scarce and expensive with each passing year , precisely as the world 's hunger for oil reaches unprecedented heights ( cars in China , India , etc . ) .
When the era of cheap oil ends , the food bubble made possible by mechanized agriculture will also end .
And that will usher in an era of rapid human depopulation .
Long - term , in a post - Peak Oil scenario , most experts expect the planet to only be able to support about one billion people .
The current population on the planet is about 6.7 billion people ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_populatio... ) .
That means we are likely to see a die - off of about 5.7 billion people , or roughly 6 out of every 7 people .
A loss of 6 out of 7 people -- even in the long run -- means a greatand a return to a far more agrarian society .
There is only ONE nation on Earth that has the experience and culture to handle this transition without much loss of life , and that 's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_new_guine... ) .
Many nations like Ecuador , Panama , Peru , Bolivia and certain Pacific Island nations may also fare well , given that gardening is still a way of life that 's taught there ( and their climates are especially conducive to easy food production ) .
For everybody else , the transition will be quite devastating .
The loss of population density and specialization means a collapse of technology multipliers such as mechanized agriculture , just - in - time manufacturing systems and complex industrial logistics that manufacture and deliver products quickly and cheaply .
The long , complex supply lines that characterize modern society will collapse , becoming local .
For example , right now fish caught in Canada are shipped to China to be filleted by low - cost laborers , then they are shipped back to Canada to be sold as fish fillets .
Such outrageous examples of the wasteful use of energy ( and long supply lines ) will vanish almost overnight in a post - Peak Oil scenario .
Unless some cheap energy supply is quickly discovered that can magically replace oil , virtually all food will eventually become local , which means that anyone living in a region that cannot produce its own food will either starve or leave .
Las Vegas , Phoenix and virtually the entire American Southwest will be mostly abandoned by humans .
You can expect a mass exodus of people from virtually all cities .
Los Angeles would likely become a gang - infested war zone that resembles Somalia more than America .
Those who master the skills of agriculture ( and who can protect themselves from the desperate masses leaving the cities ) will live and reproduce .
Those who deny reality and hope for some government to save them with silly economic stimulus bills will starve and die .
It is the ultimate application of Darwinian Natural Selection , on a grand and merciless scale .
In the end , about 1 out of 7 people will remain .
They will be the healthy , resourceful people who are willing to work in order to survive .
The masses of medicated , junk - food - eating , entitlement - minded citizens of western nations who insist someone else should save them will be removed from the human gene pool through natural processes .
Deniers who foolishly think oil will never run out , or that the global banking system can be saved by printing free money from nothing , or that western civilization will last forever will also be removed from the human gene pool .
A dire scenario ?
No more dire than all the previous civilization collapses that have occurred on our planet .
The history of human life on Earth is full of arrogant , short - sighted societies that believed they would last forever .
Arrogance quickly crumbles into dust in the face of ecological reality ( or perhaps in this case , economic reality ) .
Of course , if the leaders of modern nations had any real intelligence ( defined as having long - term vision and understanding the future implications of present - day decisions ) .
Human life CAN be sustainable on our planet , but only if the people are willing to elect leaders who make decisions today that protect the future instead of selling it out .
Such decisions , however , are never popular with the short - sighted people living today .
Sadly , there is hardly a single example of a future - minded politician in America today .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich may be one of the rare ones on ecological issues , and Rep. Ron Paul is of course right - minded on financial issues .
I cannot think of another elected representative ( nor any Senator ) that has any real long - term view of a sustainable society .
Nor do most people think beyond their own paychecks and immediate circumstances .
How many people are actually taking great steps to reduce their ecological footprint ?
How many are investing in nutrition and superfoods for healthy babies ?
How many are truly growing their own food and solving the problems of seed saving , irrigation , food storage and soil erosion ?
Remarkably few .
Most people in society today live indefined by indoor lighting , air conditioning , processed foods , chemical medicines , artificial wood furniture , television programming and online social networking .
Reality is the soil , the rivers , the air , sunlight , plants and seeds .
It is found in the animals , microbes , forests and aquatic ecosystems . , nor bargained with , nor put off .
Reality is shaped by our decisions and actions , and what we see unfolding in the world right now -- global warming , chemical contamination , depletion of fossil fuels -- is merely a reflection of the destructive actions being mindlessly taken by people living today .
It is often said that in a Democracy , people get the government they deserve .
On a large scale , this related thought is also true :
And it is thisthat Jared Diamond so graciously reminds us to consider .
We have a choice to decide our collective future .
Today 's decisions create tomorrow 's results .
There is absolutely no question that the decisions being made right now across the nations of western civilization will create a future world with a greatly reduced capacity for human population .
If that is what modern people wish to create , they are right on track with it .
But if modern people want to create a different outcome -- a sustainable world that future generations might enjoy without a population collapse and all the suffering that goes with it -- serious changes in behavior are immediately needed in many areas : Economic , ecological , cultural , medicine , agriculture and more .
Do not be led to believe that modern civilization is anything more than an erratic blip of temporary insanity on the chart of human history
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Ticketmaster Entertainment Inc and Live Nation Inc may unveil a merger as soon as this week , creating a music industry powerhouse with a combined market value of over $ 700 million , a source briefed on the talks told Reuters on Tuesday .
Michael Rapino , President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation , speaks at the Reuters Media Summit in New York , December 4 , 2008 REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
If the deal goes ahead , the marriage of the world ’s biggest concert promoter and the leading ticketing and artist - management company will create a dominant force in the industry with ties to more than 200 artists such as the Eagles , Miley Cyrus , Christina Aguilera , Madonna and Jay -Z .
A successful deal will also crown Live Nation ’s longstanding efforts to mold itself into a diversified conglomerate with businesses beyond concert promotion .
A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that talks are at an advanced stage , but could still fall apart over issues such as management control .
Another hurdle would be competition issues because such a merger would concentrate power in the music industry under one roof .
One senior music label source , who did not want to be identified , told Reuters the merger will “ face major antitrust issues from managers , record companies , ticketing companies and concert promoters to name a few -- not to mention the Obama administration will be very tough on this stuff . ”
The new company would be called Live Nation Ticketmaster , the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday .
The paper , citing unidentified sources , said the boards of both companies had yet to approve a merger .
The deal will not involve any cash transfer , said the Journal , which was first to report on the advanced talks .
Ticketmaster spokesman Albert Lopez declined to comment .
Live Nation officials were not immediately available .
Live Nation has been trying to boost its thin concert - promoter margins by diversifying into adjacent businesses such as ticketing , which has margins as high as 25 percent versus an average 4 percent from concert promotion .
In December , the firm said it expected no further growth in 2009 in the midst of a recession , even though it forecast fan attendance would rise 10 percent .
As part of its expansion thrust , the firm became known for signing big names like Madonna for so - called 360 deals that combine artist management with touring and merchandising .
Ticketmaster has also made forays into new territory .
Last year , it acquired Front Line Management , which represented around 200 major acts .
Irving Azoff , head of Ticketmaster , and Live Nation Chief Executive Michael Rapino both are expected to remain at the combined organization but their exact roles have not yet been nailed down , the Journal reported .
A person brief on the talks told Reuters that Rapino is expected to be the CEO of the combined company .

Those skeptical of vaccines have various reasons .
Some believe that vaccines are responsible for otherwise unexplained increases in conditions such as autism , asthma , and multiple sclerosis .
Others , including the conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly , see government attempts to track and enforce immunization as an intrusion on privacy .
Still others — parents whose recollections of their own bouts of chickenpox or measles are bathed in nostalgia — argue that the elimination of traditional childhood illnesses is an attack on childhood itself .
The parents at Shining Mountain are influenced by the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner , a turn - of - the - century Austrian philosopher who founded the Waldorf movement .
Steiner ( who was not a medical doctor ) believed that children 's spirits benefited from being tempered in the fires of a good inflammation .
The critics have concluded that the dangers of vaccination outweigh the risks of vaccine - preventable disease .
Like all medical interventions , vaccination entails some risk , although the extent and gravity of potential side effects are matters of debate .
For example , febrile seizures occur in roughly one in 10,000 children — perhaps 1,000 a year in the United States — who receive the current whooping - cough vaccine .
Such seizures rarely , if ever , lead to permanent brain damage , however , and in any case febrile seizures are triggered just as easily by a run -of - the - mill infection as by a vaccine .
Suspicions that mercury preservatives used in vaccines inflicted neurological damage on children are worrisome but unproved ( mercury has largely been phased out of vaccines over the past three years ) .
To some extent vaccination is a victim of its own success .
Owing to vaccination campaigns , smallpox no longer exists in man , and polio has been driven from the Western Hemisphere .
Measles , diphtheria , and invasive hemophilus bacterial disease ( such as meningitis ) are rare in the United States , and even whooping cough is unusual enough that few parents consider it a threat .
All these diseases , with the exception of smallpox , still infest various corners of the world , but in most of the United States even those who have not been vaccinated against them , or in whom the vaccine is not effective , are protected , because most of the people we meet have been vaccinated .
Epidemiologists call this phenomenon " herd immunity " : the more vaccinated sheep there are , the safer an unvaccinated one is .
When vaccination rates drop , disease returns .
From the archives :
( January 1999 )
A prominent demographer warns that the spread of tuberculosis and AIDS in Russia will soon make Western hand - wringing over the pace of Russian " economic reform " seem quaint .
By Murray Feshbach " Dead Souls " ( January 1999 ) A prominent demographer warns that the spread of tuberculosis and AIDS in Russia will soon make Western hand - wringing over the pace of Russian " economic reform " seem quaint .
By Murray Feshbach
Precisely at what point herd immunity fails is difficult to calculate , but there is ample evidence that it does .
Since the collapse of the Soviet public - health system diphtheria has returned to Russia with a vengeance , killing thousands .
Sweden suspended vaccination against whooping cough from 1979 to 1996 while testing a new vaccine .
In a study of the moratorium period that was published in 1993 , Swedish physicians found that 60 percent of the country 's children got whooping cough before they were ten .
However , close medical monitoring kept the death rate from whooping cough at about one per year during that period .
It 's very rare that I do any C++ programming these days .
However , one of my oldest customers continues to utilize a C++- based optimization / statistics framework that we helped them build many years ago .
The project has a wonderful purpose , and we owe quite a bit to some of the first people to trust us ( thank you Sommer and Dorry ! ) .
As a Ruby programmer , I 've come to love test - driven programming .
As such , I 've made an effort recently to build a test - based workflow into this existing codebase ( not always the easiest thing to do , applying a test - base to a large existing codebase ) .
Today I found myself in dire need of being able to test private functions in C ++.
As a testament to the poor state of testing in other programming languages , many message boards / threads simply told me that I was testing the wrong thing ( you should test the public API , not the private implementation ) .
Well , needless to say , this left me a bit uncomfortable .
The fact is , the majority of my code is tucked into private methods , and I 'd be left with huge long - running end - to - end tests if I strictly followed this heuristic .
However , I came across one golden nugget , one of the most clever hacks I 've seen in some time .
By utilizing pre-processor directives , we can temporarily override the meaning of private and protected in C++ code , essentially aliasing it to public .
# define protected public # define private public #include " TheClassHeaderUnderTest.h " #undef protected #undef private
See what this is doing ?
We wrap the class that we 'll be testing in pre-processor directives to interpret protected and private as an alias for public , essentially loading that class ( when including the header file ) as entirely public .
This allows me to access everything !
Private methods , private variables , you name it .
And now , just like in Ruby , it 's no holds barred , allowing me to poke and prod my objects without being wrapped on the wrist by the compiler .
Even better , these directives simply wrap your includes in your test files .
In other words , I do n't have to change my implementation to achieve this .
A clever hack , no matter the language or technology , is a clever hack .
And I absolutely love this hack .

Digital TV conversion delayed until June 12 TELEVISION
MIAMI - FEBRUARY
04 : Bob Granville reaches to change the channel on his analog television set in his home Februrary 4 , 2009 in Miami , Florida .
He said he is glad their will be a delay in the move to a digital signal given his inablity to drive and buy himself a converter .
The U.S. House voted today 264-158 to delay the analog TV shutdown to June 12 from the original date of Feb. 17 .
The bill , already approved by the Senate , now goes to President Barack Obama for his approval , which is expected to pass .

Television viewers who rely on sets that use antennas to pick up broadcast signals have about four extra months to get ready for the nation 's switch to digital TV .
The House of Representatives voted 264- 158 Wednesday to push back the Feb. 17 deadline to June 12 , a move that President Obama had supported .
The vote , largely along party lines , gives approximately 6.5 million unprepared households more time to get ready for the day when all analog TV broadcasts are turned off .
" The passage of this bipartisan legislation means that millions of Americans will have the time they need to prepare for the conversion , " the White House said in a statement .
" We will continue to work with Congress to improve the information and assistance available to American consumers in advance of June 12 , especially those in the most vulnerable communities . "
The Senate first passed the bill unanimously last week and then resubmitted it after a corresponding House vote fell short of the two - thirds majority needed .
Wednesday 's
House vote required a simple majority .

" We are not ready for this transition , " Rep. Anna Eshoo , D - Palo Alto , said during the House debate .
" We can fix these problems and minimize this catastrophe if we pass this legislation . "
Consumers who rely on traditional over - the - air broadcasts will need to upgrade to a pay TV service such as cable or satellite , buy a TV with a digital tuner , or install a converter box on their older analog set .
The bill passed by the House does not include new money for a federal program aimed at providing viewers $ 40 coupons toward a converter box , which runs $ 40 to $ 80 .
The program has dispensed its allotment of $ 1.34 billion worth of coupons and is waiting for unused coupons - good for 90 days - to expire before issuing new vouchers .
About 3.5 million requests are now on the waiting list .
The new legislation also allows consumers to reapply for a coupon if their vouchers have expired .
Obama 's stimulus package includes $ 650 million for the converter box coupons , but Republicans argued that the money will not be available for weeks if not months .
Opponents of the delay said the new transition date only adds more confusion , delays the handover of old spectrum to emergency first responders and does n't come with money of its own for the coupon program .
Some Republicans took issue with the Democrats ' streamlined approval process for the bill , which prevented representatives from amending the legislation and adding funding for the coupons .
" We 're delaying a hard transition today without any additional money or any way to send out additional coupons , " said Joe Barton of Texas , the top Republican on the House Commerce Committee .
" How silly is that ? "
The delay does not mean every station will continue to broadcast in analog .
Broadcasters will be permitted to shut off their analog transmission before June 12 .
That creates a potential uneven transition for analog viewers , who might still lose some channels , depending on what local stations decide to do .
Despite that scenario , proponents said the delay was necessary to not only disburse more coupons but also help educate people about issues that arise from the transition .
" We knew there was going to be some challenges moving forward even if the date is moved , but this allows us so get more information and assistance to folks , " said Mark Lloyd , vice president of strategic initiatives at the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. firms are experiencing the worst business conditions in 27 years as the year - long recession worsens , a survey showed on Monday .
The National Association of Business Economics ’ ( NABE ) quarterly industry poll found that the economic slump worsened in the fourth quarter and the majority of respondents expected gross domestic product to contract at a faster pace in 2009 .
The U.S. economy tipped into recession in December 2007 and there are worries the downturn , triggered by the domestic housing market crash , could be the worst since World War Two .
“ The NABE ’s industry survey depicts the worst business conditions since the survey began in 1982 , confirming the U.S. recession deepened in the fourth quarter of 2008 , ” said spokeswoman Sara Johnson .
The survey was carried out between December 17 and January 8 , covering 105 NABE members .
The housing market collapse and the resulting global credit crisis have eroded household wealth , causing sharp cut backs in spending and severely depressing demand .
About 47 percent of respondents in the NABE survey reported a fall in demand for services and goods , which was an all - time high , while only 20 percent saw an increase .
This was the lowest percentage since the survey started in 1982 .
Sluggish demand was more pronounced in the goods - producing sector , where 79 percent of the firms reported falling demand .
“ The survey ’s measure of demand fell to its lowest level in the history of the survey , ” said Johnson .
Falling demand left most firms pessimistic about the economic outlook for 2009 , the survey found .
About 78 percent of respondents expected GDP to be lower than last year .
Real GDP was likely to fall by more than 1 percent , 52 percent of the respondents reckoned .
In the last survey in October , only 38 percent of respondents anticipated a decline .
Slack demand and lack of credit are forcing firms to cut capital spending and axe jobs , according to the survey .
About 39 percent of firms said they planned to reduce payrolls over the next six months , while 17 percent expected to hire people .
The survey found that labor market conditions deteriorated sharply in late 2008 , confirming the government ’s payrolls report for December which showed 1.9 million jobs were lost in the last four months of the year .
The NABE said job losses were expected to continue in the first half of 2009 , with most of the layoffs seen in sectors such as good - producing , finance , real estate , transport , utilities and communications .
Given the harsh economic climate , more firms are resorting to price cuts to lure buyers , with only 12 percent saying they raised prices in the last quarter .
This was the lowest since the end of 1998 and could likely heighten fears of deflation .
Wage pressures are also muted .
About 14 percent for respondents reported rising wages and salaries , while 13 percent said compensation had declined .
This was the highest number in five years .
In 1986 , Ford unleashed a moonshot automobile which dragged the company and its competitors into the future .
With the 2010 Ford Taurus , it seems Ford is staking its claim at greatness again .
UPDATE : The 2010 Ford Mustang 's been officially unveiled !
Check it out here or in the galleries …
After almost 20 years of the Taurus moniker applied off - and - on to models which have increasingly lost their way , Ford 's engineers have said " enough . "
Make no mistake , the new Taurus is a battle cry from a more lean , more mean and more hungry Ford Motor Company .
With even the most passing review of the new Taurus you can't help but take notice .
Ford is n't aiming at best in class here , they 're aiming at " best in world . "
Their words , not ours .
The Taurus shares chassis architecture with the upscale Lincoln MKS but shares none of the body work or interior .
Gone is the milquetoast styling of the Five Hundred - cum - Taurus in favor of a more aggressive , confident design , borrowing elements of the European Kinetic styling language as well as elements from the Ford Interceptor concept .
The resulting combination provides the presence of the Chrysler 300 with the sporty , stylish look of a European Ford Mondeo .
Plus maybe a little freight train brawn mixed in for good measure .
When the powers - that - be over here at Jalopnik asked me to test drive a car for you boys , I was …
The Taurus is being aimed at brand flagship status , and as such , delivers equipment levels not normally seen in the sub-luxury segments .
In high - end trim , the car gets the recently announced Ford Park Assist system and a new system called Blind Spot Information System with Cross Traffic Alert , capable of warning of cars in your blind spot and of parking lot traffic approaching as you back out of a space .
The interior gets the equipment overkill treatment packaged into a stylish cabin , split down the middle with a swooping center console , keyless start button included .
Passengers are treated to available nicely trimmed heated and cooled perforated leather seats and heated seats at the rear .
The rear seat folks even get a power rear sun shade .
It 's bristling with techno - gadgetry , voice activated nav-system complete with the Sync software platform and optional Sirius Travelink , rear - view backup camera and a Sony - branded audio system Ford President for the Americas Mark Fields is claiming will rival the best home - based systems .
The Taurus also gets a new radar - based speed sensitive cruise control system which also pre-charges the brake system when it senses an impending collision .
Ford 's Active Park Assist looks to be much more controlled than the system Lexus debuted on the …
Engines on the new Taurus are familiar and expected , with a baseline powertrain being the 3.5 - liter V6 with 263 HP and 249 lb- ft of torque , mated to a standard 6 speed transmission ( paddle shift optional ) driving the front wheels with all - wheel - drive optional .
The base motor is fun and all , but we 're salivating over the prospect of the twin - turbocharged Ecoboost V6 - equipped Taurus SHO .
Wheels are controlled with a pretty standard McPherson strut front and multi-link rear suspension which Ford claims to have tuned for handling as much ride .

We have n't driven the new Taurus yet , and we 've only spent a few hours with it at a Ford backgrounder in Dearborn , but in our short time with the car , talking with the engineers , the stylists and the vehicle line managers , but as far as first impressions go , the new Taurus makes a damn impressive one .
The level of fit and finish , styling detail , material choices and overall drama is a huge departure from the current model .
The static car is so good it makes maintaining any semblance of objectivity a battle .
We 'll be bringing you live coverage of the unveil from the floor of the Detroit Auto Show later today .

DETROIT , Jan.11 , 2009 – The Ford Taurus – the car that changed America 's view of full - size sedans – is all - new for 2010 and ready to take on the world 's best , with an upscale new design , impeccable driving dynamics , class - leading technologies and an unbeatable price tag .
" The new Taurus sets the pace for Ford 's growing new car launch momentum , " said Mark Fields , president of The Americas .
" This sedan completely redefines expectations of what Taurus stands for – and helps further define what Ford is capable of delivering – quality , fuel - efficient vehicles featuring the latest technologies and head - turning design . "
The new Taurus benefits from Ford 's Global Product Development System , which made it possible to deliver an all - new sedan 12 months sooner – with more new features than customers and dealers dreamed possible .
" Taurus is our premium Ford flagship , and it casts a halo across the entire brand portfolio , " said Derrick Kuzak , group vice president for global product development .
" Building on its reputation for safety leadership , we leveraged extensive use of computer - aided design and engineering technologies as well as digital pre-assembly modeling to deliver a high - quality , new Taurus a year ahead of schedule . "
Even better news ?
The new 2010 Taurus will start at $ 25,995 – the same price as 2009 models but with more class - leading features , new technologies and perceived quality that rivals premium luxury sedans .
" The new Taurus showcases the what the Ford brand promise is – expressive design , class - leading technologies and an engaging driving experience , " said Jim Farley , Ford 's group vice president of Marketing and Communications .
" To truly appreciate the new Taurus , you have to drive it .
All of the experiences come together once you 're behind the wheel . "
New times , new design
" Lightning can strike twice , " said Peter Horbury , executive director of Design for The Americas .
" Like the 1986 original , the new 2010 Taurus differentiates by combining style with substance . "
The shift starts with the vision for Taurus itself .
It debuted as a family sedan , but with the advent of crossovers , the new Taurus is aimed more at drivers who might move friends and family but place more of a premium on the driving experience and technologies aimed at making time on the road more meaningful and fun .
" Taurus is more of a ‘ me ' sedan now , and we 've delivered with this buyer in mind , " said Moray Callum , director of Ford 's Car and Crossover Design .
Exterior design details are more sculpted and powerful – from the powerdome that speaks to the strength behind its confident grille to the pronounced fenders and fascia .
Bold new headlights combined with recessed parking lamps frame a new expression of the signature Ford three - bar grille – and the lowered roofline helps make the new Taurus more aspirational .
New wheels , from 17 - to 20 - inches in diameter , fill the sculpted wheel wells and lend Taurus a muscular and athletic stance .
The raised shoulder lines of the new Taurus provide a confident profile and enable generous truck capacity .
The exterior color palette for the 2010 Taurus includes new hues , selected to harmonize with interior appointments and offer customers a broader range of color combinations .
New colors include Candy Red Metallic Tint , White Platinum Metallic , Steel Blue Metallic , Gold Leaf Metallic and Ingot Silver Metallic .
Inside , a forward - leaning center stack – home to the climate controls , audio components and available navigation screen – flows in a continuous unbroken form through the instrument panel and down into the center console .
The smart design allows for the interior to be formed with unbroken lines to impart seamless quality and craftsmanship .
The door panels employ an innovative urethane tooling process providing unique texture and identity to surfaces , with visible stitching and a hand crafted appeal .
This same process allows for door panel two - toning , enabling model series differentiation .
The new Taurus ' precision craftsmanship is reflected in the quality of materials used in the interior as well as the exterior panel margins , which are comparable to costly German luxury sedans .
Better on - road performance , too
To match its more athletic looks , the new Taurus features sportier driving dynamics .
The 2010 Taurus comes standard with Ford 's proven Duratec 3.5 - liter V - 6 , generating an estimated 263 horsepower and 249 foot - pounds of torque .
This award - winning engine earns a ULEV - II emissions certification and comes paired with a choice of two new six - speed automatic transmissions .
The smooth and refined Duratec V - 6 helps the front - wheel - drive Taurus deliver unsurpassed highway fuel economy .
Taurus reflects
Ford 's commitment to deliver the best , or be among the leaders , in fuel economy across the vehicle segments where it competes .
Taurus fuel economy is aided by employment of a two - speed fuel pump and Aggressive Deceleration Fuel Shut - Off technology .
The Taurus engine plan also calls for optional availability of Ford 's advanced EcoBoost™ 3.5 - liter V - 6 , with an announcement regarding availability coming soon .
The Taurus SE offers a six - speed automatic transmission with a Grade - Assist hill - holding rollback prevention feature , paired with an economical 2.77 final drive ratio .
SEL and Limited series Taurus models are offered with SelectShift® , featuring racing - inspired shift control paddles mounted on the steering wheel .
SelectShift offers the convenience of conventional automatic operation , or a manual shift mode that gives the driver complete control over gear selection .
The SelectShift transmission enables " match - rev " downshifts and will hold manually selected gears , unlike some competitive transmissions that second - guess the driver .
The SEL is offered with a 2.77 final drive ratio , while the Limited series uses a 3.16 gear in front - wheel - drive models , and a 3.39 ratio in all - wheel - drive models to provide enhanced acceleration .
Chassis and suspension components are tuned to deliver on the sporty and aggressive design with optimized roll stiffness for cornering control , responsive steering with sharp turn - in and precision accuracy .
This chassis tuning of the MacPherson front struts and multi-link rear suspension reflects Ford Global DNA , defined by responsive steering and handling , while maintaining a comfortable ride quality .
The 2010 Taurus features a new SR1 suspension configuration .
Named for its " one - to - one " rear shock absorber ratio , it provides a superior balance between cornering and handling while providing a stable baseline for fine tuning .
The new SR1 enables the use of 19 - and 20 - inch wheels – and reduces vehicle weight , saving fuel .
" While driver engagement was a key objective for the new Taurus , we also put huge emphasis on creating a quiet environment , " said Chief Engineer Pete Reyes .
" Wind tunnel development time was important to reduce noise , vibration and harshness , but it also helped with fuel economy .
Customer - focused technologies
Tech - savvy customers will find plenty to like about the new 2010 Taurus .
Its technologies enable customer connectivity , while fulfilling desires for personalization , customization and control .
This comprehensive list of features is n't just technology for the sake of technology .
These offerings have been selected and developed to provide the ultimate in comfort and convenience for the driver and all passengers .
Extensive work has also been done to ensure that these technologies are easy to understand and intuitive to operate .
Adaptive Cruise Control allows the driver to set the vehicle cruising speed while using radar technology to monitor traffic travelling up to 600 feet ahead , automatically adjusting Taurus speed to help maintain a safe distance between vehicles .
Adaptive Cruise Control also integrates Collision Warning with Brake Support , a new active safety feature .
The collision warning system uses a radar sensor to detect moving vehicles ahead and provides a visual " heads - up " warning signal transmitted across the base of the windshield and an audible warning when slower moving traffic is detected ahead .
The system also pre-charges the brakes and engages an electronic brake assist to help the driver stop more quickly .
Intelligent Access with Push - Button Start , a new Taurus feature , allows the driver to enter the car and start the engine by simply carrying the fob as they approach and enter the vehicle .
SecuriCode™ Keyless Entry Keypad enables vehicle access by unlocking the driver 's door using a five - digit code on the new keypad system flush - mounted in the driver 's side B - pillar .
MyKey™ allows parents or fleet administrators to activate a restricted driving mode .
When enabled , MyKey features a Persistent Beltminder® with Audio Mute until safety belts are buckled , an earlier low - fuel warning , and consistently engaged AdvanceTrac® stability control , Blind Spot monitoring , Cross Traffic Alert and Forward Collision Warning .
Additional programmability includes restrictions on audio volume , limiting top speed to 80 mph and speed chime warnings at 45 , 55 , or 65 mph .
Auto High Beams / Rain -Sensing
Wipers harness sensor technologies to switch headlights to high intensity when no other vehicles are detected , in a range of up to 500 feet for taillight detection , and up to 2,000 feet for oncoming headlight detection .
Rain - sensing wipers use an advanced optical sensor to detect the intensity of rain and / or snowfall to adjust wiper speed .
Easy Fuel™ Capless Fuel Filler System is an industry - exclusive feature that self - seals without a traditional fuel cap .
Blind Spot Information System ( BLIS® ) consists of two multiple beam radar modules , one each per rear quarter panel .
When an approaching vehicle enters the defined blind spot zone , an indicator alert provides warning to the driver in the corresponding side view mirror .
Cross Traffic
Alert uses the existing BLIS radar modules to sense oncoming traffic when slowly backing out of a parking spot .
This industry - exclusive system functions only while the vehicle is in reverse and warns when cross- traffic appears within three car widths .
Ford SYNC ® is the fully integrated , in - vehicle voice - activated communications and entertainment system , with 911 Assist , Vehicle Health Report and GPS - based features including business search and call completion .
SYNC connects to MP3 players , iPods , memory sticks and PDAs .
SYNC 's 911 Assist™ will place a call to a local emergency operator in the event of an air bag deployment incident .
The latest version of SYNC adds Traffic , Directions and Information , providing turn - by - turn route guidance , and the ability to access content by personalized favorites such as region , subject matter or sports team .
Voice - Activated Navigation System with SIRIUS Travel Link™ uses an 8 - inch screen to present a birds - eye - view map with 3D landmarks .
The system responds to voice commands for destination programming and route selection .
In addition , it provides enhanced route guidance features such as street name announcements and detailed freeway exit , turn and ramp position lane guidance .
The screen can be personalized with up to 32 pictures , sized up to 1.5MB .
The system also incorporates the SIRIUS Travel Link , offering availability of current weather and ski conditions , a five - day forecast , local fuel pricing by cost per gallon as well as brand , sports scores and movie listings .
Sony® branded audio components deliver sound from a variety of sources , with an AM - FM tuner , SIRIUS Satellite radio , CD , DVD audio and an integrated 10 GB hard drive for storage of up to 2,400 songs .
This package also includes an available 10 - speaker premium audio system .
Multi-Contour Seats are available on an industry - exclusive basis for driver and passenger , integrating a six - way lumbar support and subtle rolling pattern massage .
The bottom cushion features Active Motion .
This provides minute but continuous movement , stirring a change of muscular activation helping a driver avoid back pain .
" Multi -Contour seats will be a real benefit for long distance drivers , or people with back trouble , " said Steve Michell , product design engineer .
" The key is their subtlety .
Active Motion is enough to help relieve fatigue but not enough to be distracting to a driver . "
Safety leadership grows
The new 2010 Taurus builds on its legacy of safety leadership , incorporating a comprehensive array of passive and active features engineered to protect and preserve its passengers .
" A stiffer body structure and new crash avoidance technologies make the Taurus – already named the safest full - size sedan – even safer , " said Reyes , chief engineer .
Taurus safety begins with a body structure optimized for strength and stiffness .
The energy - absorbing front structure features octagonal front frame rails , tunnel rails and " shotgun " front structural members designed to absorb and redirect crash forces away from the passenger compartment .
The Taurus body structure features ultra high - strength boron steel in the B - pillar for added side impact protection .
The new Taurus is equipped with a comprehensive package of active and passive safety features , including dual - stage driver and front passenger air bags , side impact air bags and Safety Canopy® , a Ford exclusive protection system that features side curtain air bags that help protect front and rear outboard passengers in both rollover and side impact crashes .
Other key safety features include :
Side Protection And Cabin Enhancement ( SPACE ™ )
Architecture is comprised of a hydroformed cross-car beam embedded in the floor between the door frames , providing additional strength in the side of the vehicle .
In the event of a side impact , the beam helps divert crash forces away from the occupants .
A strong roof cross member and side impact door beams work with the floor - mounted tube to further improve side impact protection .
Personal Safety System® is designed to reduce the risk of injury to the driver and front seat passenger in the event of a moderate to severe frontal collision .
Sensors note right front occupant weight , safety belt usage , outboard seat belt tension and seating position to optimize air bag deployment force for occupant safety .
AdvanceTrac® electronic stability control predicts the vehicle 's intended path , using sensors to detect and measure oversteer and yaw , while continuously monitoring vehicle speed , throttle position and steering wheel angle .
When the system senses a loss of wheel traction , engine torque is reduced and braking is applied in conjunction with the standard Anti-lock Braking ( ABS ) system .
The system also incorporates traction control to aid drivers when operating the vehicle on loose or slippery surfaces .
SOS Post - Crash Alert is an integrated system that automatically unlocks the doors , sounds the horn and activates the emergency flashers in the event of an air bag deployment .
" Customers will find a lot to love about the new Taurus , " Fields said .
The 2010 Ford Taurus will be built at Ford 's Chicago ( Ill . )
Assembly Plant and will be available in dealer showrooms in the summer .
New allegations of absentee ballot fraud in '02 and ' 04 follow on her multiple voter fraud crimes in FL in ' 05 , for which she was never ' cleared , ' as some media have inaccurately reported ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/9/2009 , 1:25 pm PT
An official state investigation is now underway into multiple voter fraud charges against Rightwing author and one - time attorney Ann Coulter in Connecticut .
The investigation began after a complaint was filed with the state 's Elections Enforcement Commission on January 29 , 2009 .
The BRAD BLOG has exclusively obtained a copy of that one - page complaint which is posted in full , as filed with Joan M. Andrews , Director of Legal Affairs and Enforcement for the commission , at the end of this article .
The complaint was filed by Daniel Borchers , a conservative Christian critic of Coulter 's following allegations in the New York Daily News in January that she had illegally voted by absentee ballot in CT , using her parents address there , in 2002 and 2004 , despite being a resident of New York City at the time .
Previously allegations by Borchers against Coulter have been the subject of a number of articles over the years here at The BRAD BLOG , and he has , on occasion , even guest blogged a number of times here for us himself .
Though the allegations of Coulter having committed voter fraud in CT in 2002 and 2004 would be her first known instances of casting ballots illegally , they are not the first allegations of such crimes against Coulter .
In 2005 , after she moved from NY to Palm Beach , FL , she knowingly falsified her Voter Registration Form ( a 3rd degree felony ) , knowingly voted at the wrong precinct ( a 1st degree misdemeanor ) , as well as gave a false address for her drivers license ( another 3rd degree felony ) .
Despite an inaccurate report from AP in May of 2007 , subsequently picked up by other media , Coulter was never " cleared " of the voter fraud charges in FL .
The BRAD BLOG has posted indisputable evidence of her FL crimes , including her actual fraudulent Voter Registration Form on which she lied when filling out her own address , official testimony from a Palm Beach pollworker ( and the county 's former Supervisor of Elections ) detailing her knowingly having voted in the wrong precinct , as well as a report from the Palm Beach Township Chief of Police , verifying the crimes .
Coulter , however , was able to escape accountability for the illegalities in FL , due to an inappropriate ( and likely illegal ) intervention from a former boyfriend of hers in the FBI , and gaming of the legal system , such that the crimes were eventually nullified by the statute of limitations there .
The most recent complaint from Borchers follows articles by the New York Daily News and Lee Stranahan at Huffington Post last month , detailing her apparently - illegal CT absentee voting .
But it would not be the first time he would play a roll in this continuing saga ...
In May 2007 , after the Palm Beach County Sheriff declined to prosecute , and dismissed the charges , it was revealed that the reason given for the dismissal was the intervention of FBI agent John Fitzgerald .
A phone call made by Fitzgerald on Coulter 's behalf , to the rookie detective looking into the local case of voter fraud , included a claim that Coulter had used the address of her real estate agent , Suzanne Frisbie , because she was being stalked by Borchers .
Had she been found guilty of the charges , she might have faced a $ 5,000 fine , and three years behind bars for the one third - degree felony alone .
As we pointed out at the time , when the Palm Beach County Sheriff had dismissed the charges , even if the allegations of Borchers being under investigation for stalking were true --- and evidence shows they are not --- it would have been incredibly inappropriate to reveal the name of someone who was the target of such an active FBI investigation .
At the time , the FBI promised an internal probe into the incident .
The BRAD BLOG has been unable to receive information on that investigation , and if it was ever even carried out , despite several attempts to reach the FBI on the matter .
Moreover , Coulter 's expressed fears of being stalked are belied , and revealed as extraordinarily disingenuous , by yet another incident involving Coulter and a BRAD BLOG guest blogger .
In November of 2005 , Coulter posted the private address and family phone number of Lydia Cornell , an actress and citizen journalist who had filed a story critical of the GOP superstar on these pages .
Coulter had access to Cornell 's personal information , after our blogger had sent her a private email requesting comment on the story before it was published .
Though Coulter did n't reply to the email prior to publication , she later posted it , in full , after the story ran here .
After news of the dismissal of the case by the Palm Beach County Sheriff 's office , the matter was picked up by the Florida Election Commission who took long enough looking into the issue , that they were eventually able to to dismiss it in late 2007 , on the basis that Florida 's two - year Statute of Limitations had run out .
While the Associated Press incorrectly reported that Coulter was " cleared " of the charges , following the intercession of the FBI 's Fitzgerald , she had decidedly not been .
Nonetheless , as they never issued a correction to the story , a number of media outlets have since mis-reported the AP report , as fact , while covering the more recent charges in CT .
Borchers , the founder of CoulterWatch and Citizens for Principled Conservatism , told The BRAD BLOG this morning that he was " surprised " by the number of media outlets which have contacted him for interviews since the recent story of his CT complaint broke in Sunday 's New York Daily News .
He was quoted by the Daily News as saying " For over 10 years , Ann Coulter has gotten away with illegal , immoral and unethical behavior , ranging from plagiarism to defamation , perjury to voter fraud . "
In our phone call with him this morning , he once again dismissed the notion that he was under investigation for stalking Coulter , despite have been a years - long critic of hers , documenting , among other things , her frequent use of violent , eliminationist rhetoric against political foes , and positions that he alleges are hypocritical in that they are neither Christian nor Conservative .
In regard to the stalker allegations against him , made via her attorney and her former boyfriend at the FBI , Borchers notes that , " even if that were true , it does n't make sense that she 'd put her realtor in jeopardy , as well as her parents in Connecticut , " by using their respective addresses on official voter forms , rather than her own .
Coulter 's FL realtor Frisbie had said she had no idea that Coulter used her address to fill out her Voter Registration Application in Palm Beach , until after the story had broken in the media .
Borchers told us that , since the story broke yesterday , he has received " dozens of emails , and only two of them were not supportive " of his efforts .
Unlike in FL , there is no Statute of Limitations for voter fraud charges in CT , Borchers notes .
He also added that he was told by the CT Election Enforcement officer that " anybody , anywhere , " could file for an official investigation of such crimes .
Borchers is a resident of Maryland .
Voter Fraud and the GOP
The voter fraud allegations against Coulter are particularly troublesome for the GOP , given that their election strategy has long been to allege massive Democratic voter fraud --- despite evidence to the contrary --- in hopes of furthering legislation that would require Photo ID restrictions for voters at the polling place .
Such legislation , countless non-partisan and bi-partisan studies have shown , would adversely disenfranchise minorities , the elderly , and students --- all of whom tend to vote overwhelmingly Democratic --- due to the fact that anywhere from an estimated 20 to 30 million of such legal voters in the United States do not currently possess the type of ID which would be needed to meet the restrictive voting requirements of such laws .
To date , we are aware of none of the Rightwing media outlets who routinely decry " massive Democratic voter fraud " ( without actually providing such evidence ) having called for Coulter to be held accountable for her very well - documented voter fraud crimes in Florida , and now in Connecticut .
• • • Articles and evidentiary documents from the entire Coulter Voter Fraud saga have been indexed , from over the years , at this BRAD BLOG Special Coverage page .
We told the entire story in full , for the first time , including additional information from Borchers and more , in this article , as published in the April 2008 edition of Hustler magazine .
Borchers ' official complaint , filed on January 29 , 2009 , with the CT State Elections Enforcement Commission , follows below .
We 've redacted some of his personal information , and the version submitted to CT was notarized , as per state law ...

Colbert : The Audacity of Nope RAW STORY
Published : Friday January 30 , 2009
Print This Email This Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert , assuming his best fake - conservative pundit persona , was wildly enthusiastic on Thursday about the Republican House members ' unanimous refusal to vote for President Obama 's stimulus program .
Declaring Today 's Word to be " The Audacity of Nope , " Colbert exclaimed , " We do n't neet a package filled with handouts -- we need one filled with balls !
And yesterday , 177 House Republicans put their nuts on the line and said , ' No !
We will not vote for this bill that we know will pass anyway ! ' "
" But these hard times demand an even larger meaningless gesture , " continued Colbert .
" That is why I am calling on every Republican who voted against this bill to put no money where your mouth is .
Refuse to accept a single penny of the $ 800 billion for your Congressional district !
Think of it like a hunger strike . "
Colbert paused briefly while the audience cheered .
" Then , just sit back and watch in glee , " he resumed , " as the Democrats face the wrath of their constituents , suffering as the $ 800 billion tears through their districts like a Force Five cash - o - cane . "
" It wo n't be easy , " acknowledged Colbert , " but you are fighting for a principle !
If we can't have a perfect bill to stimulate the economy -- you 'd rather have no economy at all . "

Bill Maher sits down for a great conversation with Ron Paul .
Stick with it , Ron Paul makes one of the most succinct cases as to why marijuana should be legal , and even goes beyond Maher ’s position by saying that he does n’t believe it should even be taxed or regulated .
Simply put Paul believes all drugs should be legal , and people should be able to grow them , and sell them without any government intervention .
Oh yeah .
And he ’s a republican representative from Texas

One more sign that President Obama is serious about prioritizing science : his pick for First Dog is a breed that 's an important model organism in genetics research .
In an interview with People magazine that hits newsstands Friday , Michelle Obama revealed that the family is going to adopt a Portuguese water dog in April .
This curly - coated canine was chosen partly because it 's hypoallergenic , meaning it should n't send little Malia into fits of coughing and sneezing .
Some cachet also comes from having a PWD , and not just because Massachusetts Sen .
Ted Kennedy owns two .
There are only about 8,000 of the dogs in the world .
The breed almost died out in the early 20th century before being saved by intensive husbandry efforts in the 1940s and ' 50s .
This genetic bottleneck is what makes PWDs so interesting to biologists , said Gordon Lark of the University of Utah , who has studied the dogs for years .
" There were only about 30 founding dogs , " he said .
" The breed has a very narrow gene pool , yet it has a wide range of sizes and shapes . "
Lark and his team are studying how such limited genetic diversity can give rise to the breed 's exceptional body - form variety .
They 're mapping out gene function in PWDs , correlating dogs ' genetic profiles with X - rays of their bones .
Many PWD owners send the researchers this and other information , hoping to advance science and perhaps improve the future health of the severely inbred animals .
Many owners even hand over their beloved pets ' remains for a complete autopsy .
" We can do personalized genetics on these dogs , " Lark said .
" We 've found out a lot about how to study disease . "
Lark also appreciates PWDs on a different level , one that 's more immediately relevant to the Obama family .
" They 're marvelous dogs , " he said .
" They have a real sense of humor . "

The Bennett family had decided to spend a fabulous Christmas in Paris , strolling down the boulevards , taking in the sights , enjoying the festive period in one of the world 's most romantic cities .
Unfortunately , half of their luggage , including the children 's gifts , had a rather more adventurous time of it , seemingly ending up in Afghanistan and prompting a security alert when it was returned to the UK .
David and Marie Bennett , from Brockenhurst , near Southampton , had packed two cases for their trip to the city of light , one for themselves , one for their children , Françoise , 13 , and 10 - year - old Remi .
They flew from Southampton airport to Charles de Gaulle in Paris just before Christmas but were devastated when the children 's bag , loaded with their presents and clothes , failed to make it to the carousel .
With many shops closed for Christmas , it meant the family were n't able to dress as stylishly , or warmly , as they would have liked , but they made the most of their time in France .
However , when they returned to the UK they discovered just how far from their missing case they must actually have been .
The wandering suitcase finally turned up in England after six days away from its owners labelled with the International Air Transport Association airport code " FAH " .
Although it was an unfamiliar code to airport staff they looked it up and were amazed to find that the code stands for Farah , a city in western Afghanistan .
Quite how it could have got there remains a mystery : planes do not fly routinely to Farah from Charles de Gaulle , let alone from Southampton .
Mr Bennett , 48 , said yesterday : " We are still none the wiser about the suitcase 's journey .
I imagine it must have just disappeared down a chute to Afghanistan .
" It 's like some sort of Disney film where a mistake leads to a suitcase taking its own holiday .
When we finally picked up the bag it had about five different labels .
" Staff did n't recognise the airport code on the label and had to look it up .
They said , ' You 'll never believe it - your case has been to Afghanistan . '
" There was even a note from Hampshire police saying they 'd gone through the bag because of where it had come from . "
Air France is investigating but admitted that it was baffled .

Foxmarks offers basically the same type of background bookmark - syncing awesomeness for IE and Safari as it does for Firefox , with a few key exceptions :
No password syncing : A tough break , but not too hard to overcome by using Dropbox as a cross- platform password syncer
A tough break , but not too hard to overcome by No syncing bookmarks to your own server :
Probably not a deal - breaker for most users , but we hope it makes a showing some day soon .

i Phone sync only for Mac Safari : Actually , this is n't a feature Foxmarks even offers for Firefox , so it 's kind of a bonus .

If you 're still down to try out Foxmarks in its newest forms , head to the Foxmarks downloads page and grab your appropriate installer .
I lack a Mac system , so I 'll be stepping through an Internet Explorer setup below .
Double - click the installer , accept all the standard " Do you want ... " and " Allow ... " prompts , and you 'll be asked to either create a Foxmarks account or sign in with the one you 've got .
After verification , you 'll end up at this simple screen , familiar to Foxmarks veterans :
The default action , if you simply hit " Synchronize , " is for Foxmarks to merge any favorites you 've got on your system with anything backed up in your Foxmarks cloud .
That 's fine for newcomers , but I generally like to get rid of all of the pre-loaded MSN , Windows Live , and similar bookmarks , so let 's hit " Change sync settings " and switch it up :

After that , Foxmarks gets going .
Instead of installing an icon in Internet Explorer 's bottom status bar , Foxmarks plants itself in your system tray .
You 'll see it pop up a notification when it 's done grabbing or placing bookmarks to / from the servers .
Right - clicking this icon gives you access to your Foxmarks settings , can open up your web - based bookmarks browser , and close down the Foxmarks process .
It seems to run whether or not you 've got IE up and running , which is somewhat memory insensitive , but also convenient for those who open and close their browser regularly .

The Foxmarks options are similar to what Firefox users have been used to : a quick - sync button , choices on how and when Foxmarks synchronizes , and , best of all , the same kind of computer - by - computer selective bookmark syncing , or " profiles . "

And here 's the advanced options , where you can change your encryption demands , force a server - or computer - wiping sync , and turn off that Foxmarks tray icon .
Turning off the icon still lets you at the Foxmarks options from IE 's " Tools " menu :

In last year 's Sunday Times Rich List , Mr Ross 's fortune was valued at £ 873 m .
Now he could be worth , on paper , less than nothing at all .

Most of us would be content with £ 873 m , or indeed a hundredth of that – but not David Ross .
He would rather risk it all – although he would never have thought of it like that when he pledged his shares to the bankers in return for their loans .
The point , however , is that it would only have been by taking a great risk – giving up a secure salaried career to take a punt on an entirely new business concept – that David Ross became worth £ 873 m in the first place .
There are very few self - made multimillionaires , if any , who have not taken risks which would make the rest of us unable to sleep at night , or keep our food down .
Rupert Murdoch , for example , more than once staked his entire company and family wealth with gigantic bets on new technology – most notably satellite television .
I recall a conversation with another multibillionaire who had borrowed enormous sums to set up what was in effect an entirely new industrial process , and he told me that it was impossible to become truly rich as an entrepreneur unless you were prepared to take risks which your rivals would regard as excessive .
This , in part , explains why such people can be high up in the Rich Lists one year , and fodder for the liquidators the next .
The very characteristic which enabled them to make them a vast fortune also leads them into perdition .
Their other characteristic , of course , is that they truly want to be very rich indeed .
In fact " want " is an entirely inadequate word .
The desire burns within them with an intensity which almost defies rational analysis .
In the first place , that is the greed which enables them to override the fear which would deter a more normal person from taking the entrepreneurial risks involved ; in the second place , that insatiable hunger is what drives a David Ross to risk his entire fortune in order to make it many times bigger ( as , indeed it would have become , if the property market had not collapsed along with his bankers ' collateral , the Carphone Warehouse share price ) .
Over the past few weeks we have see this psychological mechanism cause havoc across continents .
In last year 's Forbes magazine rich list , Oleg Deripaska was said to be the richest man in Russia , with " a fortune of $ 28.6 bn " .
Yet this was not enough for Mr Deripaska .
He too had borrowed vast sums using his assets as collateral and as the commodity prices on which his company is based plunged , he has been forced to beg Mr Putin 's government to help him pay his debts to a syndicate of 13 western banks .
In Germany an allegedly prudent industrialist , 74 - year - old Adolf Merckle – said last year by Forbes to be " worth $ 9.2bn " – went running to the regional government of Baden - Wùrttemberg for help .
" The billionaire with empty pockets " – as he was described by Sùddeutsche Zeitung – had lost vast sums on a pure gamble : he had " shorted " Volkswagen shares , which subsequently soared .
Although many want to become rich in order to acquire possessions , this is rarely the prime motivation after the first few years of great wealth .
People such as David Ross , Oleg Deripaska and Adolf Merckle have long since owned any house or car which they can ever have wanted .
Beyond that , it is simply a question of keeping score .
The more millions , or billions , the better you have proved yourself at the game .
This is pure competitiveness , divorced from greed ( or even the desire to keep a trophy wife satisfied ) .
It is the testosterone factor , the same basic , unthinking impulse that drives the spermatozoon to flick its little tail faster to reach the egg .
Perhaps this is one of the reasons why it is very hard to think of any self - made women among the world 's billionaires ( though there are quite a few who have built on substantial inheritances ) .
It is , to use a less gooey analogy , the same desire that drives the greatest of sportsmen : what distinguishes the most successful from those who never quite make it to the very top is not a gulf of talent , but the possession of a desire to succeed which can burn its way through every obstacle .
I suspect that it is something like this which drove Bernard Madoff into creating what has been described as " the world 's greatest Ponzi scheme " – a $ 50 bn fraud which has ensnared some of the globe 's biggest banks and hedge funds .
Mr Madoff had been very wealthy for decades , a former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market and – how bizarre this now seems – an adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission on market regulation .
My guess is that for many years Mr Madoff 's funds had been run perfectly legally , but when the markets began to falter he started to pay income to existing investors out of the capital from newcomers .
That way he could still seem to be a " winner " in the investment game – and presumably he had hoped that a pick - up in the stock market would enable him to disguise his chicanery .
It is of course more than possible to be a winner in the game while remaining scrupulously honest and a model of probity .
The best example is the world 's richest man , Warren Buffett , who has piled up his $ 60 bn ( or so ) , while living in the same modest suburban home for half a century , occasionally emerging to demand that the rich pay more taxes .
Be in no doubt , however : Warren Buffett , whose family went hungry in the Great Depression , had and has an unparalleled desire to come out on top in the money game .
In the unlikely event that he entered a lottery and won , you can be sure that he would immediately invest every cent in his own business ventures .
Yes ; the rich are different .
Can a Jedi lightsaber cut through Superman ?
The answer is surprisingly no .
Yahoo Answers is the service that continues to give .
Full discussion on the question here .
Today 's Onion has a mostly tongue - in - cheek story of " 28 - year - old publisher 's assistant Peter Graney [ who ] told reporters ... that he is inexplicably getting worse at sex . "
You know this guy .
You faked your orgasm for him .
" After doing it for so long , it stands to reason that I 'd eventually get a handle on how things are going to go , " Graney said .
" But it varies wildly .
There are times when even I 'm thinking ' When is this going to be over ? '
It 's like I can't finish up to save my life . "
" And by now , you 'd think I would n't have to worry about ejaculating too soon , " Graney continued .
" But nope .
Every so often , I still totally jump the gun .
When will I get some kind of control over this ?
I 'm not trying to be Sting or anything , but Jesus Christ . "
Graney cited other declining abilities , most notably in the arena of foreplay .
By his estimate , the frequency with which he has been asked to stop performing cunnilingus or some other preliminary sex act due to his partner 's physical discomfort has increased 22 percent over the past three years .
Advertisement
Basically , what we have here is a guy that either flails away with no skill to the point of mutual exhaustion without either of you getting off , or a guy that pops the champagne cork in immediate celebration of his ability to penetrate you .
And , let 's not even get started on the increasing frequency with which he is asked to stopped his undoubtedly poor attempts at oral — if a dude has been asked enough before that there is an increasing frequency with which he is asked to stopped , he 's probably never been that good at it .
And you know how Graney got to the age of 28 without knowing that he sucks in bed ?
Because no one told him .
Ladies , when you fake an orgasm , you 're making a guy 's terrible bedroom skills another woman 's problem .
Every time you pretend to climax while he 's lying motionless beneath you , arms at his sides , you 've convinced him that such is how its done .
Every time you 've faked enthusiasm for particularly tooth - enhanced and painful oral just to get the guy to quit it already , rather than telling him that he 's doing it wrong , you 've set up another woman 's clitoris for the same poor treatment .
Every time you 've told him , " That happens to everyone " when he 's ejaculated so quickly you barely realized he 'd managed penetration , he 's gonna believe that and think that it 's okay .

The thing is , at 28 , Graney is probably just now getting around to fucking 25 - 28 year old women ( when he does get laid ) — and , as we get older , we 're more likely to tell a dude what the fuck he 's doing wrong .
So , he 's probably not getting worse at it , he 's probably just finally boning women who are apt to tell him exactly how bad he is at it .
I mean , for fuck 's sake :
" I 'm always asking , ' Do you like that ? ' or ' How does that feel ? '
Way more than I used to , " said Graney , adding that he now believes less than a third of his sexual encounters over the past 18 months were satisfying to the women involved .
If you 've got to ask , dude , the answer is pretty much always no .
Ladies , for the sake of the rest of the sisterhood , I 'm begging you : stop faking it .
If for no other reason than that then he wo n't think the rest of us are frigid bitches when his orchestrations fail to bring us to a higher plan of consciousness .
Our ladybits thank you .

Man Somehow Getting Worse At Sex [ The Onion ]
The past year brought some exciting advancements for the Linux operating system and open source software .
Open technology continues to become more pervasive and the Linux kernel is now widely used in a multitude of mainstream products ranging from set - top boxes to mobile phones .
With 2008 coming to a close , we wanted to take a minute to look at some events of significance to the open source software community .
Mozilla releases Firefox 3
Mozilla 's Firefox web browser is one of the most successful and widely - known open source software applications .
The popular browser continued its ascent this year with the official launch of Firefox 3 , which attracted a record - setting 8 million downloads in the first 24 hours .
The release was widely reported in the mainstream press and even got the coveted Colbert Bump .
Google releases Chrome
Google also dropped a browser bombshell this year with the launch of Chrome , its own open source WebKit - based browser for Windows .
Chrome delivered some excellent innovations , including a process isolation system and a built - in task manager that allows users to view the resource consumption of individual tabs .
Google has pushed Chrome forward at a rapid pace and has closed some of the remaining feature gaps by introducing a complete bookmark manager and other capabilities .
The browser exited beta earlier this month and could soon land preinstalled on hardware from major manufacturers .
Android platform arrives on handsets
Another major open source move by Google this year was the launch of the company 's Linux - based Android platform for mobile phones .
Although Android got off to a rocky start and the flagship G1 device imposed some disappointing limitations , Google made things right by releasing special developer models .
The platform source code is now fully available and Google has begun to accept patches .
KDE 4 officially released
The KDE ecosystem got a major boost this year with the official release of KDE 4 , a major update that completely transformed the open source desktop environment .
The original 4.0 release had a lot of rough edges that generated considerable controversy .
It has improved enormously over the past year and delivered a very strong update with version 4.1 .
The next point release , which is due in January , will take the desktop even further .
The early KDE 4.2 betas are very impressive and many aspects of the user experience have been enhanced .
Nokia plans to liberate Symbian
Mobile phone giant Nokia has become one of the most influential players in the open source software landscape .
The company completely redefined its software strategy this year and has significantly boosted its commitment to open source .
Nokia acquired Symbian this year as part of a bold plan to liberate the platform .
It will eventually be distributed under the open source Eclipse Public License and is gradually moving towards a community - driven development model .
Nokia acquires Trolltech
In January , Nokia announced plans to acquire Trolltech , the company behind the open source Qt toolkit .
Nokia aimed to use
Qt to bridge the gap between mobile and desktop development and also to provide a portable toolkit that would work across several different mobile platforms .
The Qt developers have been working to add Symbian S60 support to the toolkit , a feature that is demonstrated in a preliminary technical preview that was released several months ago .
Maemo 5 revealed
Nokia is also pushing forward with Maemo , its Linux - based Internet Tablet operating system .
At the Open Source in Mobile conference in Berlin , Nokia 's Ari Jaaksi unveiled the roadmap for Maemo 5 , the next major version of the platform .
The new platform includes a multitude of exciting technical improvements and user interface enhancements that were discussed at the first ever community - oriented Maemo Summit .
The first alpha of the Maemo 5 SDK was released this month , fueling lots of fascinating speculation about features that could potentially be included in future Internet Tablet devices .
Python 3 slithers into view
Open source language development technologies also saw major gains this year .
The Python programming language shed backwards compatibility with the long - awaited 3.0 release , which introduces some powerful new features and syntactic improvements .
Python has gained significant traction and continued to see more high - profile adoption this year through Google 's App Engine and other venues .
Python is also one of the most popular programming languages in the Ars Orbiting HQ and we have written several tutorials about it in recent months .
Mono 2 released , first Moonlight beta emerges
This was also a big year for the Mono project , an open source implementation of Microsoft 's .NET platform .
The Mono developers released version 2.0 , which supports C# 3.0 and introduced support for Mac OS X , which has helped attract new developers to some Mono - based projects .
WinForms support has improved significantly and the runtime itself has become very robust .
This year also brought the official release of MonoDevelop 1.0 , an open source development environment for building GTK # applications .
Mono gained several high - profile adopters this year , including Linden Labs , the maker of the virtual world platform Second Life .
The Mono developers also launched the first beta release of the Moonlight project , which seeks to provide Linux users with an open source implementation of Microsoft 's Silverlight web plugin .
Sun 's OpenSolaris lights up
Sun released the very first version of OpenSolaris this year .
OpenSolaris , which emerged from Project Indiana , was created to build a user - friendly desktop distribution on top of the open source Solaris platform .
Despite some early friction , the project shows a lot of promise .
The second release , which occurred earlier this month , included some impressive functionality , such as a new ZFS snapshot visualization feature .
Looking forward
This year brought many exciting new developments for open source software , but there are many more that we can look forward to in 2009 .
Intel 's intriguing new Linux - based Moblin platform is finally arriving on devices and will make major inroads in 2009 as the platform gains broader acceptance .
The ACCESS Linux Platform and other emerging LiMo - compatible platforms could also debut on devices in the coming year and bring the open source operating system to more handsets .
Netbook growth will likely continue to surge , creating many new challenges and opportunities for Linux .
Netbook - centric development initiatives , such as Ubuntu 's Netbook remix and ARM port will continue to advance .
We also expect to see community - driven distros gaining some enterprise traction as companies look for more ways to cut support costs .
Another area where Linux will continue to grow is in virtualization , where the platform 's flexibility makes it uniquely suited for JeOS appliances .
Major Linux distributors will continue to build robust enterprise virtualization technologies around Xen and KVM .
Although the coming year will bring many exciting new developments , there will be some challenges as well .
The ongoing debate about how to bring freedom to the cloud will intensify and become more urgent as more users turn to web - based applications .
The role of the open source software community in civic and political issues will become more pronounced , too .
The principles of software freedom can make a difference in many critical areas , including national security and election integrity .
The coming year is bright for Linux and open source software .
Despite its continued inability to gain a broad foothold on the desktop , the open operating system is practically everywhere else and many believe that it is the platform of the future .
Linux向けのツールは巷に数多く出回っているため、素晴らしいものが埋もれてしまっているというケースもある。そこで、そういった素晴らしいアプリケーションのうち、管理者が知っておくべきものをいくつか紹介する。
freshmeat でLinuxアプリケーションを検索してみると1万1828件もヒットする（2008年1月12日現在）。これらすべてのアプリケーションのうち、使ってみる価値があるのはどれだろうか？いくら何でもすべてということはないだろう。しかし、こういった大量のアプリケーションに埋もれ、巷で話題になっていないものの、使ってみる価値のある、隠れた宝石があるはずだ。本記事では、マルチメディア関係のツールから、認証局を生成するツールにいたるまで、ありとあらゆるジャンルにおける知られざる逸品のいくつかに光を当てている。
＃ 1：Floola
Floolaはオープンソースにはなっていないものの、Linux上で動作するアプリケーションである（Mac OS X版やWindows版も用意されている）。Floolaは楽曲管理（特にiPodとの同期）のさらに先を行く機能を提供している。この粋なアプリケーションを用いることで、ダウンロードしたYouTubeビデオを、あなたのiPodで再生できる形式へと変換することもできるのだ。しかも、巷でよく見かける他のアプリケーションとは異なり、Floolaはこういった作業をシームレスかつシンプルに行うことができるのだ。コマンドを入力する必要はなく、すべてGUIを使って行うことができるのである。面倒くさいことがあるとすれば、YouTubeのビデオを取り扱うには、使用しているLinuxマシンにFFmpegをインストールしておかないといけないという点くらいのものだろう。つまり、Floolaは変換処理にFFmpegを使用するようになっているのだ。
ただ、iTunesが提供しているものすべてに対応する機能がFloola側にあると考えてはいけない。Floolaは画像のサポートやSnarlのサポート（Windows版のみ）、Growlのサポート（Mac版のみ）、メモ帳機能、iPodの修復、プレイリストのエクスポート（HTML形式）、多言語サポート、歌詞のサポート、ファイル（重複ファイルや行方不明となったファイル）の検索、アートワークのサポート、動画のサポート、Googleカレンダーのサポート、プレイリスト、ポッドキャスト、Last.fmのサポートなどを提供している。Linux版のFloolaは、実行バイナリの形態で入手可能になっており、/usr/binディレクトリにコピーした後、「Floola」というコマンドを実行するだけで起動し、簡単に使用できるようになっている。
＃ 2：transKode
マルチメディア対応のアプリケーションをもう1つ紹介しておこう。transKodeは、柔軟性の高い、モジュール化された一連のコマンドラインツールであるTranscode用に作成されたフロントエンドだ。Transcodeは、現時点における最強のオーディオおよびビデオ変換ツールである。TranscodeではGUIとCUIのインタフェースが用意されており、DVやMPEG-2、MPEG-2
Part 2、H.264、QuickTime、AC3のほか、libavcodecに含まれているすべてのフォーマットを含む、膨大な数のフォーマットがサポートされている。Transcodeでは、DVDを再生と同時にインポートし、Video4Linuxデバイスから録画することも可能となっている。Transcodeの問題は、平均的なユーザーにとってコマンドの量が多すぎるという点にある。transKodeはこの問題を改善するために、マルチメディアファイルの形式を変換するという複雑な作業を可能な限りシンプルにするユーザーフレンドリーなインタフェースを採用している。
OPEC chief wants ' substancial ' cut in output Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday October 18 , 2008
Print This Email This ALGIERS ( AFP )  OPEC will need to order a " substantial " cut in oil output at next week 's emergency meeting in Vienna , Algerian Energy Minister and current OPEC chief Chakib Khelil said Saturday .
" There will be a reduction in production at the next extraordinary meeting of OPEC , and it will have to be a substantial one to get the balance right between supply and demand , " he told reporters .
" If it has to be 1.5 million barrels per day , or two million barrels per day , that 's what it will be , " Khelil added , during a visit to the southern Algerian province of Tamanrasset .
Iran -- OPEC 's second largest exporter -- also called Saturday for a significant cut amid prospects of reduced demand in the face of the global economic slowdown , the state broadcaster reported .
OPEC has announced it will hold an extraordinary meeting earlier than expected next Friday -- instead of in November -- to discuss the global financial crisis and its impact on the oil market .
Oil prices had reached a peak of 147 dollars a barrel earlier this year but slumped below 70 dollars on Thursday for the first time in more than a year .
Prices rebounded above 71 dollars a barrel on Friday on speculation that OPEC could cut production at the emergency meeting , traders said .
Duffy emerged triumphant at last night ’s Brit Awards , scooping three awards including best British album .
The singer , who collected the prize for her debut , Rockferry , from her fellow countryman Tom Jones , was also named best female solo artist and best breakthrough act .
Her victory was made all the more sweet by the fact that her main rivals , Coldplay , failed to win anything .
Collecting her third award of the evening , a tearful Duffy said : “ I just want you to know , for the record , that I ’ve travelled around this country back and forth from Wales to London and played my songs to old ladies who are probably watching TV right now .
I ca n’t tell you what this means . ”

The annual event in London ’s Earls Court was staged on a set made up of giant tents and caravans with performances from U2 , Kings of Leon , Take That and Girls Aloud .
Elbow , fresh from their success at the Mercury Prize , were the surprise winners of best British group .
Accepting the band ’s award from the Hollywood actor David Hasselhoff , the lead singer , Guy Garvey , said : “ You would n’t believe how long it ’s taken us to get this close to the Hoff .
But it ’s been worth it . ”
The American rock band Kings of Leon won two awards in the international category , for best international group and best international album , while the veteran British heavy metal band Iron Maiden won the award for best British live act .
Collecting the band ’s first award , the Kings of Leon drummer Nathan Followhill said : “ We ’re going to be that cheesy ass band that thanks the Brit Academy and our record label .
But it was n’t just for our good looks , it was for the music as well .
Thank you God and thank you mum . ”
The American singer Katy Perry won best international female solo artist , with Kanye West winning the male equivalent .
Accepting her award with the words “ holy shit ” , Perry went on to add that she had thought about not turning up .
“ I just want to thank everybody here in London and the UK .
I ’m so sick right now , but they said I should show up because something special might happen . ”
As expected , the best solo male artist award was won by Paul Weller .
The category was widely regarded as a foregone conclusion , after bookmakers reported a huge rush in the number of punters betting on Weller earlier in the week and suspended all betting on the awards .
Girls Aloud won their first Brit award for their single “ The Promise ” .
Collecting the award , an emotional Sarah Harding grabbed the microphone and yelled : “ It ’s about time ! ” Take
That descended from the roof to perform their hit “ Greatest Day ” , and Girls Aloud descended in gold leotards for “ The Promise ” .
A raunchy collaborative performance between the Pet Shop Boys , the American singer Lady GaGa and the Killers lead singer Brandon Flowers closed the show .
Earlier , the Pet Shop Boys ’ Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe had accepted an award for their outstanding contribution to music .
Kylie Minogue hosted the event alongside Gavin And Stacey ’s Matthew Horne and James Corden .
The comedy pair donned red dresses and knee - high leather boots to join Kylie as backing singers in a short but enthusiastic rendition of her hit “ Ca n’t Get You Out Of My Head ” .

Contrary to the words of a popular song , there is such a thing as the real world .
Computer science faculty at Washington University in St. Louis are exposing their undergraduate students to learning in ways that prepare them for interaction in the real work place .
It 's not about " staying between the lines , " though , more about getting out of your seat , moving around and interacting with your classmates .
It 's called active learning , a learning - laboratory - based tutorial teaching concept .
Kenneth Goldman , Ph.D. , associate professor of computer science and engineering , initially secured a grant from the National Science Foundation in 2007 to explore active learning at WUSTL .
He is on leave , and now Cindy Grimm , Ph.D. , associate professor of computer science and engineering at Washington University in St. Louis , and Ron Cytron , Ph.D. , associate chair of the department , are carrying out the work to put the old paradigm of lecture - based instruction in moth balls .
The computer science department at Washington University in St. Louis is changing the format of some of their classes in hopes to better prepare students for life after college .
The department is going away from the traditional lecture format and taking on an " active learning " format where classes are based on student interaction , presentations and critiques .
Credit : Nick Roth
" At the heart of active learning is the hallmark of interactive face time and students taking a more active role and not just repeating what a professor wants to hear , " said Grimm , the principal investigator of the grant .
" We think it provides a motivation to learn things that they have to know to do something that they really want to do .
This is more readily learned by participation with other students . "
Lectures are posted on the Web and students typically watch them in the evening before coming to class , so they are prepared for active learning in the classroom .
" The struggle for the teacher used to be , ' How do I fit my three hours of lecture a week and work interactive things into that , " Cytron said .
" Now , it 's the other way around . "
Cytron said that active learning is based upon the Socratic teaching method .
" It 's asking a question and having the students struggle with it versus giving students a bunch of solutions and lecture and then have them find the answers on their own , " he explained .
Different attention spans in the 21st century
Both say the concept is not comfortable , initially , for either students or professors because the lecture is an " old friend " that professors are comfortable with and have relied on .
Active learning is often unscripted and relies on students working in groups and learning from each other .
Some argue that the lecture is going to the sideline in computer science because the new generation of students has poor attention spans .
Cytron disputes that .
" Students today have a different attention span and use more of their sensory inputs when it comes to learning , " he said .
" Today 's freshman has been doing interactive things with friends for years .
We find that we need some kind of stimulus to keep them involved . "
The lecture still has n't gone completely the way of the dodo bird .
Grimm said that in more theoretical and mathematically based course , active learning is hard to do because of the density of the topics .
" Courses dealing more with algorithm and theory students find more difficult to grasp on their own , " she said .
" So we guide them a little more and give lectures from time to time . "
On the other hand , a course such as Computer Science and Engineering 332 , software design , needs very little lecturing .
" No one solves problems in vacuums anymore , " Cytron said .
" I think today , ' What were we thinking when we told students to solve on their own and not consult with anyone else ? '
I tell people today that all of the programs written by just one person have already been written .
Collaborations are what happens in the real world . "
Avoiding ruffled feathers
Grimm said she and her colleagues today emphasize group work , teamwork and peer reviews .
" Students learn the art of critiquing substantively without ruffling feathers , " she said .
" This is a benchmark of art and architecture classes and industry , too .
A big motivator for the students is to add critiquing .
Industry has always liked the skill set we impart to our students , but they also want them to be familiar with teamwork , explaining their ideas , and being comfortable with the critique .
We have n't taught that as much until just recently . "
A challenge for computer science professors is grading teamwork .
Grimm 's system is based on a hypothetical 100 tokens given to each person of , for instance , a five - member group .
At the end of a project , team members are asked to evaluate their own role as well as the role of the other four in terms of relative contribution .
If they all did the same work , they 'd each get 20 points , but the spread is always uneven , she said .
" Surprisingly , most students are very honest , " she said .
" This kind of safety net is like having a Wal - Mart greeter at the front of the store so no one gets way with anything .
Nearly all of the time , it comes out very candidly . "

Millions of Arabs across the Middle East and north Africa are watching vivid and often shocking coverage of the Israeli military onslaught on Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Arabic satellite TV channels , with al - Jazeera again leading the field .
Al - Jazeera , based in Qatar , has four correspondents in Gaza and its bulletins are broadcasting graphic images that would never find their way on to western TV screens .
" It 's very dangerous inside Gaza for our people , but they are trying to focus on humanitarian issues , " said Ahmad Jaballah , the channel 's deputy editor .
On Saturday , the first day of Israel 's Operation Cast Lead , it broadcast live from Gaza City 's Shifa hospital as the victims of the first bombing raids were being treated .
Yesterday much of the footage was of funerals .
Precise audience figures are hard to come by , but al - Jazeera claims it has a regular audience of 50 million , rising during a crisis of this magnitude .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that from Yemen to Morocco it is easily beating its nearest satellite rivals , the Saudi - owned al - Arabiya and the BBC Arabic TV , launched this year .
Al - Jazeera pictures are now also available free on its YouTube site .
Its sister English - language channel ensures they have a global reach , though the Arabic channel and website show the bloodiest pictures : one yesterday featured a dead Palestinian toddler over the caption : " Children of Gaza : for what sin were they killed ? "
Al - Jazeera has also just become available to computer users live over broadband on the Livestation Network in every country except the US , where it is blocked .
The Gaza violence is being covered intensively by al - Manar , the TV station of Lebanon 's militant Shia Hezbollah movement .
Coverage elsewhere on Arab state - run TV channels reflects the views of individual governments , with Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia openly critical of Hamas as well as Israel .
Syria , Iran 's only Arab ally , highlights Palestinian resistance .
In this febrile atmosphere , everything is intensely political : Hassan Nasrallah , Hezbollah 's leader , this week attacked al - Arabiya by dubbing it " al - Ibriya , " a pun suggesting it is serving Jewish interests .
Al - Jazeera , sensitive to charges of partisanship , has interviewed Israeli ministers and officials as well as the exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshal in Damascus .
But it has been unable to interview Ismail Haniyeh , the Hamas prime minister , who is presumably in hiding in Gaza .
It has reported from Sderot and other Israeli towns hit by Palestinian rocket and mortar fire .
On Monday it interviewed Tzipi Livni , Israel 's foreign minister and prime ministerial hopeful , who criticised the channel .
But its coverage is controversial in the Arab world too .
The western - backed Palestinian Authority has accused it of being biased in favour of Hamas .
Researchers have discovered that the mysterious overweight stars known as blue stragglers are the result of ' stellar cannibalism ' where plasma is gradually pulled from one star to another to form a massive , unusually hot star that appears younger than it is .
The process takes place in binary stars - star systems consisting of two stars orbiting around their common centre of mass .
This helps to resolve a long standing mystery in stellar evolution .
The research , which is part funded by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) and carried out by scientists at Southampton University and the McMaster University in Canada , is published in the journal Nature on Thursday 15 January .
Blue stragglers are found throughout the Universe in globular clusters - collections of about 100 , 000 stars , tightly bound by gravity .
According to conventional theories , the massive blue stragglers found in these clusters should have died long ago because all stars in a cluster are born at the same time and should therefore be at a similar phase .
These massive rogue stars , however , appear to be much younger than the other stars and are found in virtually every observed cluster .
Dr Christian Knigge from Southampton University , who led the study , comments : " The origin of blue stragglers has been a long - standing mystery .
The only thing that was clear is that at least two stars must be involved in the creation of every single blue straggler , because isolated stars this massive simply should not exist in these clusters . "
Professor Alison Sills from the McMaster University explains further : " We 've known of these stellar anomalies for 55 years now .
Over time two main theories have emerged : that blue stragglers were created through collisions with other stars ; or that one star in a binary system was ' reborn ' by pulling matter off its companion . "
The researchers looked at blue stragglers in 56 globular clusters .
They found that the total number of blue stragglers in a given cluster did not correlate with predicted collision rate - dispelling the theory that blue stragglers are created through collisions with other stars .
They did , however , discover a connection between the total mass contained in the core of the globular cluster and the number of blue stragglers observed within in .
Since more massive cores also contain more binary stars , they were able to infer a relationship between blue stragglers and binaries in globular clusters .
They also showed that this conclusion is supported by preliminary observations that directly measured the abundance of binary stars in cluster cores .
All of this points to " stellar cannibalism " as the primary mechanism for blue straggler formation .
Dr Knigge says : " This is the strongest and most direct evidence to date that most blue stragglers , even those found in the cluster cores , are the offspring of two binary stars .
In our future work we will want to determine whether the binary parents of blue stragglers evolve mostly in isolation , or whether dynamical encounters with other stars in the clusters are required somewhere along the line in order to explain our results . "
This discovery comes as the world celebrates the International Year of Astronomy in 2009 .

Over the next two years a ground - breaking decision by the council of ministers and the European Parliament will result in the biggest release of information held by governments to the public and the media since the creation of the European Union .
All 27 EU countries will disclose data revealing details of some € 100bn given in subsidies by the Eurotaxpayer every year to farmers , food companies , industrial regeneration schemes and the fishing industry , from the Black Sea resorts in Bulgaria and Romania to the Canary Islands and Madeira .
The decision is the result of a rare example of journalists cooperating with each other across Europe to bring pressure on the governments of member states , using national freedom of information laws .
The data that will be released next year and in 2009 has been among the secrets most strongly guarded by national governments , who have used privacy and data protection laws to prevent people finding out the main recipients of the Euro largesse .
The reason - as has become clear as the information has dribbled out - is to protect from unwanted publicity not poverty - stricken hill farmers but huge multinationals such as Tate & Lyle and the Danish Arla group ( which owns Express Dairies ) , powerful politicians , and royals from the Queen and Prince Charles to the Grimaldis in Monaco .
For they are emerging as the biggest beneficiaries under the information already released .
The idea that all this should become public originated in 2000 - not from a journalist but from a Labour special adviser , Jack Thurston , who worked for Nick Brown , then agriculture minister .
One afternoon , fed up with a rather tedious EU agriculture negotiation , Brown demanded from his permanent secretary , Sir Richard Packer , a list of the top 20 people getting all these EU subsidies .
After much trepidation Sir Richard produced the list and allowed the minister to glance at it for 10 minutes .
Thurston remembers looking over his shoulder and seeing the royals and multinationals heading the list .
When Brown asked to take it away , the request was refused and he was warned that to publish such information breached the Data Protection Act .
After Thurston left his job he wrote a pamphlet for the Foreign Policy Centre think - tank challenging the need for the subsidies and calling for the details to the published .
At the same time , a Danish journalist , Nils Mulvad , used a provision under the Danish freedom of information act to demand the release of documents sent to the tax authorities that listed EU subsidy payments .
At the third attempt , in 2004 , he won his case and Denmark became the first country in the EU to release subsidy payment data .
Last year he was voted European Journalist of the Year in European Voice 's awards .
Three months after the Danish ruling Britain 's FOI Act became operational on January 2 , 2005 .
On the day the act became law the Guardian joined the Foreign Policy Centre to demand the release of all subsidies in England and Northern Ireland ( Scotland and Wales had separate jurisdiction ) .
While the Guardian was publicly demanding the information , Thurston was using his Labour connections to press Margaret Beckett , then agriculture secretary , and Larry Whitty , the farms minister , and advisers to Gordon Brown , to concede .
The government agreed and Britain became the first big member of the EU to release the information .
By May through the offices of the German Marshall Fund , another think - tank , a meeting in Brussels united journalists from Britain , Denmark , Sweden , Holland , Germany and Spain , among others to share information .
What followed was the establishment of the website farmsubsidy.org , which publishes articles from journalists revealing grants as each country has been pushed into naming who gets the cash .
Some countries fell after spectacular events - Holland decided to release the information after the Dutch agriculture minister , Cees Veerman , was exposed for not revealing to Parliament that he was taking EU subsidies for farms he owned in the Dordogne .
Others , like Slovenia , volunteered to release everything when they joined the EU .
Journalists in Sweden , Finland and Norway , which is not even an EU member , have forced their governments to release data .
And transnational journalism meant that Arla was revealed to have received more in EU subsidies through Denmark , Sweden , the United Kingdom and Holland , than from profits it made .
It was this background that led the EU Commission to go for releasing details of every subsidy it gave .
By the time it agreed to take such a historic step , countries were falling like dominoes as journalists forced the release of information under FOI laws .
Germany is the latest .
Thurston says : " Journalists have been central .
Without them all we would have is raw data .
It is journalists , who have the local knowledge about the people and companies who receive the money , who turn the information into stories which people can relate to - therefore making government more accountable to the people who pay for these subsidies . "
This is an email than I just sent to Daniel Gross a reporter at Newsweek :
Dear Mr. Gross :
I am a professor of history at the University of Alabama .
Much of my research and teaching focuses on the Great Depression era in American history .
In an article in Salon on January 2 , 2009 , David Sirota quoted you as stating , “ One would be very hard - pressed to find a serious professional historian who believes that the New Deal prolonged the Depression ” ( See here ) .
If the quotation accurately represents your views , it is very mistaken .
Off the top of my head , I can name “ several serious professional historians ” who would probably argue ( and argue strongly ) “ that the New Deal prolonged the Depression . ”
In addition to myself , they include Jonathan Bean of Southern Illinois University , Brad Birzer of Hillsdale College , Brad Thompson of Clemson University , Jeffrey Hummel at San Jose State University , Larry Schweikart of the University of Dayton , Michael Allen of the University of Washington at Tacoma , Ralph Raico of Buffalo State College , Burton Folsom of Hillsdale College , David Mayer of Capital University in Columbus , John Moser of Ashland University in Ohio , and Paul Moreno of Hillsdale .
All have doctorates in history from top - ranked universities .
This is just off the top of my head .
If you want additional names , please feel free to call me at 205-348-1870 .
Of course , I would happy to discuss my own views on this topic .
Sincerely ,
David T. Beito

The Malaysian Grand Prix will not follow Singapore 's example in turning into a night race , it has been confirmed - with organisers explaining that the prohibitive costs amidst the current economic downturn do not make it a viable proposition .
The Sepang circuit has welcomed Formula 1 since 1999 , and has a contract to continue to do so until 2015 .
The resounding success of the sport 's inaugural night - time race in Singapore back in September , however , has raised the pressure on neighbouring and nearby countries such as Australia , Malaysia , China and Japan to do likewise , as a means of generating extra media coverage and attracting greater viewing audiences in Europe , when the grands prix would be broadcast at a more sociable time .
Moreover , the raft of new countries clamouring for a spot on the F1 calendar has upped the ante on existing venues to increase their viewing figures in order to maintain their places , but though the Malaysian government did discuss the proposal , it has ultimately deemed that it would not be possible .
F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has made little secret of his desire to see more races in the region held under floodlights , but Malaysia has now confirmed that it is not in a position to meet the 78 - year - old 's request , and will instead pursue the twilight option that is set to begin this season ( 9 am GMT ) , when the grand prix will take place at 5 pm local time , two hours later than usual .
The Formula One Management chief executive is understood to have agreed to this compromise .
The change in time will also mean cooler temperatures for spectators at what is traditionally the hottest race on the schedule in the tropical South East Asian country .
Both of the first two races on the 2009 calendar - Australia on 29 March and Malaysia a week later - will start two hours later this year .
Despite the global credit crunch , race organisers are still hopeful of securing a maximum attendance of 130,000 over the course of the three - day event .
" We have amended the contract , " explained Se?pang Inter??natio?nal Circuit chairman Datuk Mokhzani Tun Mahathir .
" The race will start at 5 pm ; that is about 9 am in Europe .
It will also be a little bit cooler in the late afternoon for fans to watch the race at the circuit .
" It is another way of saying that there will be no night race until 2015 .
When I met him , Bernie told me that we will no longer raise the issue .
" I told him that we are facing an economic crisis .
The night race may or may not attract more people to the circuit .
" The [ attendance ] target can be achieved although we are experiencing an economic slowdown .
This year we are offering more attractive packages and activities to attract spectators . "
Circuit spokesman Irwan Rahman added that the installation of a lighting system to illuminate the track would cost in the area of $ 5.77 million , with no guarantees of any increase in revenue from the change .
" The benefit should still be there [ with a 5 pm start ] , " he told The Associated Press .
" There are no contracts that we have to do night races . "

A court in India recently dismissed criminal proceedings against a couple who were arrested for kissing .
The BBC's Soutik Biswas examines India 's tangled relationship with the kiss .
' A smooch can land you in trouble ' ( Photo : Rashbehari Das ) Look before you kiss in India .
A smooch can get you in serious trouble in the world 's largest democracy .
Earlier this week , a court in Delhi - ah , of all places , in the " happening " capital !
- threw out the case against a young , married couple who were picked up by police allegedly for kissing near a railway station .
The kiss has been under threat in India for as long as I can remember .
Two years ago , an over - enthusiastic Richard Gere had the riot act read to him when he swooped down and clasped actress Shilpa Shetty and planted several kisses on her .
The two , by the way , were at an event to tell lorry drivers about safe sex .
News television hyperventilated , serving up titillation and tattle in equal measure on the serial - kissing Hollywood actor .
Some protesters burnt effigies of Gere ; others shouted slogans demanding the death of the hapless Shetty .
It took the Supreme Court to suspend an arrest warrant against Gere , and obscenity charges against Shetty .
Much earlier , in the early 1990s , I remember the public outrage after Nelson Mandela kissed actress Shabana Azmi when he came visiting .
Clueless
And when India 's usually benign tabloids splashed grainy mobile phone pictures of a Bollywood couple - they were dating at that time - allegedly kissing some years ago , the star diva fretted and fumed and began legal proceedings against the paper .
Even marriage sometimes does n't give you the licence to smooch - an Israeli couple was fined $ 22 by a court for kissing after getting married in a Hindu ceremony in Rajasthan .
The priests had taken umbrage .
For clues to why Indians appear to be clueless about kissing , listen to a model - actress Udita Goswami .
India 's ancient past is littered with kisses , if literary work is any evidence
Your views on this article " I have pledged that in any of my forthcoming films I will not give a lip kiss , " she told a newspaper .
" I am not comfortable doing that .
I belong to a traditional family and my values do not allow me to indulge in such acts . "
But a kissing famine has led to a curious demand for it in the dark confines of the movie theatre - and become a passport to fame for some .
A Bollywood starlet 's film some years ago was hyped as one in which she had kissed her dazed looking co-star 17 times .
( It so happened that the kisses were the only memorable thing about the film . )
Since then kiss - starved audiences have been counting the starlet 's kisses in all her films - one later film of hers was advertised as one with " 99 slaps - 1 kiss " so that fans were not entirely disappointed .
A Bollywood dance girl kicked up a storm when she was smooched in front of the cameras by a little - known singer at his birthday party .
She hummed and hawed about the " inappropriateness " of the kiss and the media and the kiss - hungry republic lapped it up .
India 's ancient past is littered with kisses , if literary work is any evidence .
' Westoxication ' Vedic Sanskrit texts , dating back to 1500 BC , apparently contain the first mention of a kiss in writing .
( A caveat from a researcher : " This does not mean that nobody kissed before then , and it does n't mean that Indians were first to kiss . " )
India 's famous epic poem and one of the world 's oldest literary works , The Mahabharata , composed sometime between 3000 BC and 1500 BC , mentions kissing .
Some demonstrators called Gere 's embrace of Shetty ' vulgar '
The Radhika Santwanam , a collection of erotic poetry from a courtesan in a court in southern India , from the mid-18th century , describes a kiss in fairly graphic detail :
Move on her lips / The tip of your tongue / Do not scare her / By biting hard .
And in Kama Sutra , the definitive epic of amour , the scholar Vatsayana devotes a chapter on the art of kissing .
He painstakingly details some 30 types of kisses - straight , bent , turned , press , nominal and throbbing are some among them .
And Richard Gere , please take note , Indian cinema 's first kiss dates back to 1933 in a film called Karma where the actress is lip - locked with actor and real life husband Himanshu Rai for some four minutes .
Four minutes !
So why does India have this tortured and twisted relationship with the kiss ?
Some people play it down , saying those who protest belong to a " loony fringe " of moral fundamentalists .
Others say it is a hangover from tradition in an ancient civilisation .
Still others say many Indians long for traditional mores as Western consumerist values swamp the country .
Or is it a response to what the Iranian intellectual Jalal - e - Ahmad called " Westoxication " - superficial consumerist display of commodities and fads produced in the West ?
Do some Indians - cutting across class - actually rail against such " Westoxication " when they are revulsed by couples kissing ?
" Looked at closely , " says leading Indian sociologist Dipankar Gupta , " revulsion against Westoxication is principally an aesthetic sneer and not a full blooded call for a return to tradition " .
Or is the rage against the kiss born out of a hypocritical morality that equates sex with sin and desire with guilt ?
As sociologist Shiv Vishwanathan tells me , " India is the only country which has a body police and not a thought police " .
There must be some truth in all these theories .
So , torn between tradition and seductive imported values , Indians will continue to grapple with the Big Question - to kiss or not to kiss ?
And , as a friend quips , " When we do kiss , we do n't tell " .
This debate is now closed .
Here is a selection of your comments .
With a country that has pressing issues of poverty , terrorism , and corruption , it 's so sad that these " kiss crashers " have nothing else better to do than whine about kissing .
They are probably just jealous that no girl has ever kissed them .
Rajen U Desai , USA Indians have kissed for as long as any other people .
T Ramakrishnan , U.S.A .
We Indians truly value a kiss , and maintain its importance by reserving some privacy for it .
Unless love has privacy , its essence is lost .
Ranjit Kumar , United States
I admit to being very confused .
How is it that our traditions include the Kama Sutra , and historic monuments with graphic murals spread all over the place , is the same country that now seems to have the most Victorian of values now ?
N Bh , India I am Indian .
I think your article assumes that " kissing is good and it must be allowed " by your remarks supporting some scriptures that allow kissing , " Indians are clueless " , " hypocritical morality " etc .
I do n't think it is good to have a public show of kissing - imagine if children start adopting such measures !!
Each country has its traditions and one must pay attention to those issues .
You cannot blindly import values from one society and impose on another society .
You may even say why do Indians scoff at live - in relationships , why do they wear saris but not shorts etc. like in the West ?
If tomorrow say another country allows nudity in public , will you begin to wonder about the same why it is not being allowed in India ?
There are so many other issues that Westerners engage in which would puzzle Indians - that does not mean Indians expect all Western people should abandon their views and adopt Indian views .
It works both ways you see .
Anonymous , USA I 'm from Liberia , West Africa and I grew up watching Indian movies .
I believe that Indians are one of the beautiful people in the world .
I think there should be more kissing in Indian movies .
For the rest of the Indians who are not in the movie business if they do not want to kiss is up to them .
Beatrice Johnson , USA .
Even though I was brought up in western culture I do not believe that kissing on the lips in public is appropriate behaviour .
Some things are private .
Ursula Konig , Australia Indian tradition is not against kissing .
Point here is it is against kissing openly .
Hence there is not at all any hypocritical morality .
This story has failed to explain the subject matter precisely .
Subhash Chander , UK Pity that the article did n't enlighten us any further as to the rationale for not kissing in public in a democracy in the 21st century .
Is there a " tradition " of any length for such attitudes towards public displays of " passion " in India - or not ?
Or is this actually a more modern development ?
If so , what is the mentality underlying this ?
What does it say about India at this time and attitudes towards conforming to a notion of " tradition " ?
SEQ , UK All this from the land that brought us the Karma Sutra .
How times have changed ....
Steve Harris , United Kingdom Kissing is a way of showing affection .
The fact some people in India frown against kissing reminds one of the unnecessary moral gags placed on the freedom of adults to display affection for each other .
Igwe CA , UK
Any natural act which is heavily suppressed will only be exaggerated in its expression !
Gerri Friedberg , M.A. , USA
In 1977 I went to India and met an English girl who was studying Indian culture at SOAS in London ( the School of Oriental and African Studies ) .
We spent several weeks travelling around the subcontinent together .
In an effort to do as the Indians do she refused to walk alongside me when we were out sightseeing , but trailed several steps behind !
Not much kissing there then !
John , UK Kissing was never considered offensive or as a disrespect in India .
Kissing your kid , siblings , parents are considered as a display of love .
Wherein , kissing your wife or any other girl " in public " is considered to be erotic .
And that is a no - no in public .
True love need not be displayed with a public smooch it is understood .
It 's not about tradition or culture it is just the basic decency and respect .
Getha , India I am an Indian living in US .
I still find it hard to kiss in public after so many years in US and even though I grew up in a fairly modern environment .
I can never distinguish between the feeling of whether I am kissing in public just to show off ( because it was forbidden in public places in India ) or I really have the urge to show affection in public .
Cplus , USA
There are so many more horrid acts that occur in the world .
They are constant and seemingly never ending .
It seems incredible that the world 's largest democracy would waste valuable time trying to ban a wonderful show of affection .
I think India should stick to banning poverty and hunger and not try to educate anyone on kissing .
However being a former " colony " of Great Britain it may not be that surprising that there lingers a so called aversion to kissing .
After all , England does have a rather prudish reputation .
Richard , Canada
In Japan many people feel bad when they see a newly married couple kiss openly before attendant of the wedding ceremony .
K. Mochizuki , Japan Coming from a traditional Asian family , I find the Indian aversion to a public display of affection not strange at all .
It is a common opinion in Asian societies .
So , leave the Indians and their courts alone , if they are happy in their decorum , who else cares .
Manstan , USA Perhaps the BBC could try and explain why kissing is culturally unacceptable in India .
As an anthropology student , I very keen to learn more .
Will Rathouse , Wales
Its sad that we Indians have this complex about kissing and then go on and harp about us being the largest democracy .
One should be free to chose what he or she pleases to do in this matter .
We need to get over the views of our past traditions and culture and embrace change .
I rather think that people who cause oppose such things are jealous , ignorant or downright stupid .
And its not just kissing , there are various such issues , which are not really issues that are being beaten to death by conservative , traditional , political and religions entities .
Tushar , UAE Beautifully written article .
Bernard Keyser , USA .
I have just been to watch Slumdog Millionaire and that finishes with a full on kiss between the two stars but nothing has been said about this yet Richard Gere is still persona non grata in India !
I just do n't understand .
Robert Brown , USA May I direct your attention to this ancient Hindu temple ?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khajuraho
David , USA Fascinating !
Well , I for one would n't laugh at this .
I think it is just that some societies - or parts of a society - regard certain actions as being not right in public .
Put into its proper context , the Indian reaction ( by that I mean the reaction of some segments of Indian society ) to kissing in public is no stranger than the attitude prevalent in English - speaking countries of blowing one 's nose quietly in public .
American prudery is a byword in Europe , yet the largest porno industry in the world is located in the USA apparently .
It seems fitting that the country that produced the Sutra of Desire ( Kamasutra ) should have a sort of taboo about kissing in public .
It is so typical of us humans !
D Fear , Germany
What 's wrong with kissing in public when the same is openly shown in the Indian movies all over the country ?
News , US How can love be wrong ?
How can showing love be wrong ?
I grew up in India and I do n't think this reflects the vast majority of people 's views .
People who are against love are the ones who are wrong .
Tony , USA I am Indian by origin .
I do n't mind kissing or being kissed .
Here is one for such a nice article .
Iftekhar , US I have always found that lip kissing someone with whom you are not attached to be a distinctly uncomfortable experience - so I have always avoided it .
Maybe the Presbyterian upbringing has left its mark or perhaps the fact that I hold it to be a private token of affection between a committed couple .... but even then I would not kiss my husband on the lips in public as I feel that it always smacks of insincerity when you have to reaffirm your relationship in front of your peers ... but each to his own .
Bee Wise , Scotland Frankly , I find it hypocritical .
I do n't see any outcry when Indian movies show actresses in wet saris , very revealing clothes , or in other situations that Indians might find " objectionable " .
Cyrus , U.S. I think you do not know India very well .
Sitting outside the country cannot make you understand the culture , the values , norms of how to behave in public .
Kissing or smooching in public is popular in West but not considered very good in India that is true .
If you talk about movies - kissing scenes - the public knows what 's shown in the movie .
If they want to watch it or not that is their deliberate and personal wish .
But the couple kissing while getting married in the Hindu ceremony is absolute no - no .
If you are following the traditional rituals of marriage then follow it completely and show your westernised emotions privately .
It is not a gesture to show in public .
In that case , is getting married in India by traditional way is just for fun or fashion or you really believe in the values ?
I strongly disagree with your mockery in the article shown for India .
Please clear your concepts about Indian values before writing anything about it .
Rakhi , UK
The author rightly mentions about the fact that India 's past is littered with kisses but is there a book or an epic in which it is written that kisses should be done in public ?
If a couple wants to kiss , then why cant they go in somewhere and kiss ?
Whets the need to do it in public ?
We have a society which is modern in its outlook and views but kissing in public is just an indecent act and in no way ' liberal ' or ' modern ' thinking .
Rohit Jain , India
It may be a largest democracy in the world , still we have to play by social rules .
Babu , USA
I think the conservatives in Indian society are kidding themselves in assuming that showing love for your partner is not an Indian value .
Sunny S. Grewal , Canada Another theory - India continues to exist in the sphere of Victorian values that the West have long since repudiated ?
Sunjay Chandiramani , Switzerland
Thank you for this write - up , I had wanted to write to BBC after reading the article on the Indian couple which seems a freak case to not misrepresent India as the middle - east .
We are by no means a prudish nation and I researched on You Tube about kisses in Bollywood , some that you have mentioned in your article .
Of course I have seen couples kiss in shopping malls or cinemas in India .
Lets put the case against the couple in perspective , and not use it as a one - dimensional view of India .
We are a modern , growing nation in the throes of change , economic and cultural
Santwana , UK
Why is it wrong for a country to stick to its traditional values .
India does not believe in publicly displaying these very personal feelings .
A little self control does n't harm .
Leena Ektre , United States
Every single people on this planet has its own longstanding traditions , and they all serve some particular purpose in the society .
I therefore think that the Western prejudices against Indian culture of ' no smooches ' should not make us look down upon the Indians .
It 's their culture !
Lonjezo Sithole , Malawi Sanskrit texts dating 1500 BC may mention the kiss .
However , quoting something like this implies that the author 's underlying assumption is that society never changes ( or should not change ) !
Like any other society , the Indian society changes , quite literally , from one generation to another and , in that context , 3500 years is a very long time .
Clearly , what could be done back then may not be ok now and vice versa .
Most importantly , the issue is about kissing ; it is about kissing in public .
In my view , Sanskrit texts are quoted because westerners find them aligned to their current way of life .
An even more ridiculous thing in this article is , " Even marriage sometimes does n't give you the license to smooch " .
Again , this is a total misrepresentation of the issue .
Marriage does give you license to kiss , however , [ marriage or no marriage ] , the real issue is about kissing in " public " .
Do n't you think that the Israeli couple was foolish in wanting to get married in a Hindu way but did n't want to abide by the local custom ?
India has people of all kinds of opinions .
And this is merely a case of a young couple running into old fashioned or corrupt policemen .
The thing to highlight would have been the court 's decision on the case .
One last point for the sake of argument - Recently , a local Swiss government banned people from hiking naked in the Alps .
Of course they are correct but why does n't anyone make a big hue & cry over it ?
Because , in this regard , most people 's definition of obscenity is the same .
While you and I may not agree with the policemen regarding whether kissing in public is acceptable , it is prudent to be mindful of the customs of the society one lives in .
Siddharth , USA Bollywood does n't represent India 's values and customs .
To call " Indians " clueless about kissing lacks journalistic integrity and perception when the report should just leave it as differences between cultures .
Why make such a big deal , unless you want to paint India as having an odd , backward culture .
Keith , USA
The issue is not kissing .
The issue is kissing in public .
Indians prefer to practise their demonstrations of affection within the confines of their own privacy .
I do not see why the public needs to endure the sight of two people exchanging saliva .
Samir Mody , UK
The author is not trying to understand the culture of India .
He is trying to get attention of the west by ditching India , many people got their fame this way .
I wo n't blame the author , because he has to keep his job .
Kissing in public considered as uncomfortable to others in India not in private .
Because we are not used to that , at least for centuries .
Showing proof of kissing in ancient times is a dumb statement .
I think the author do n't have any sense to know how time can change an entire race and culture .
Since we are to used to see kissing in public , we feel it uncomfortable .
Not for us but for our children .
They are curious to try anything new that can lead to traps as in west .
I felt sympathy to the author 's lack of sense .
Praveen , Canada India is full of contradictions !!!
Sharon Widell , New Delhi
It 's terrible that in today 's world that this is an issue .
But why must you have it done in public anyway ?
Precious ikpea , Nigeria
I recently came back from a holiday in India , and we were warned not to be affectionate with our partners by our tour guide .
We were happy to agree to this - if kissing is not in Indian culture , then fine .
We did however , find it odd that it was very common for grown men to hold hands with their male friends .
Our group were all intelligent liberal people , in no way homophobic etc , and we do see gay people doing this occasionally in the UK .
BUT , in India it really seemed strange to us .
So , different strokes for different folks I guess .
Caroline , London , England
For some reason , whenever Western values are summoned , ' promiscuity ' is the only trait that sticks to the Indian conscience ( well , at least that of the lot that gets all riled - up about these things ) .
Hard work , civility , respect for human life , etc somehow fail to register .
Sigh .
There are just way too many people with absolutely nothing else to do .
Joe A , India Good article ...
But why did the author refrained from mentioning the actress names ?
Siddhartha , USA
True , some Indians make a big deal of kissing in the public .
but NOT EVERYONE .
So please do n't blow this out of proportion .
People of my age ( 27 ) do n't bother if couples kiss in public .
Also , almost every Bollywood movie has a kissing scene .
All the cases filed against the snoggers is really a shame .
Whatever it is , the court was sensible .
Arnold Layne , India Kissing as an act of love passes unremarked in the Western countries .
For people who have n't visited India or have n't known India for what it had stood for , it is unsurprising that news such as this sound bizarre .
The Indian culture boasts of guarding traditions that are well over 5000 years old , and the act of kissing did exist as was mentioned in the earliest Indian literary texts .
Surprisingly , it is downplayed as many other acts that display love .
The reason perhaps is that the spirit of the World 's largest democracy believes such acts to be intimate , reserved for two in private , and a display of such acts in public is deemed pretty vulgar .
Bharath , France Interesting article - thank you .
As a Londoner , there are times when , on a late night train home , I could really do without people inspecting each others tonsils to the extent that sometimes occurs .
The young have a phrase - " get a room " with which I heartily concur .
Absolutely OK in private but not much fun to sit next door to on the District Line .
AG , UK How does one relate morals to a simple kiss ?
Maybe if two people were really slobbering each other it might become sickening , but there is nothing morally wrong with kissing .
Anon , Canada
I believe it is not up to us to decide what a country should think , or do .
We need to be sure to research what types of behaviour are appropriate in said country BEFORE we leave our homes , and behave accordingly .
Darcy Ballew , USA Kissing by couples in ugly .
Even in America people dislike seeing people kissing in public .
What India preaches is to confine all intimate relationships within closed doors .
Over indulgence would lead to ugly scenes and unwarranted attention .
The woman who is involved in a kissing act will face innumerable problems .
Let India follow its traditions .
Kiss within the walls better than kiss under the sun .
Vignesh , USA Very interesting article .
You see things accordingly to the light you throw on them .
The writer of this article views the Indian values from the light of Western values !
Whether to accept or not accept public kissing is nothing but a choice .
Unfortunately , people in the West forgot their own values and traditions through which they pride themselves in their own literature !
How would the English literature picture an English woman living in the 18th or 19th century kissing intimately in the street ?!
If the West 's traditions and values have been washed out by liberalisation , at least allow other nations to cherish their own values and traditions !
Jamil , Jordan I lived in Delhi when the whole Richard Gere kiss was going on ...
Kind of entertaining at the time .
One thing I wonder or do n't understand is when actors / actresses say they do n't want to kiss on screen they are totally ok with showing almost their entire bodies by wearing short skirts and tops .
This is also not accepted by many in India , from what I 've understood ....
Astrid Klomp , Sweden
This taboo on kissing is true not just in Indian culture , but most cultures that revere modesty and resist inappropriate expression , which is indeed relative to the country .
Even though I am an American , I have been raised by Pakistani parents who express the same concern with appropriate and moral behaviour , hence , I would NEVER kiss my girlfriend or wife in front of them .
It 's odd to think that I should be allowed a girl friend but not allowed to kiss her .
Salman Malik , USA
I feel that a kiss is due to the author .
The article made for some fabulous reading .
Attiq Ahmed , Pakistan
It is curious that a fundamental reason is not mentioned ... the spread of disease and germs by mouth - to - mouth contact .
I grew up in Southern India and it was unthinkable to drink from the same glass if it had been touched by other lips .
The notion of other people 's saliva as " dirty " was ingrained in me from an early age .
Sri Rahm , USA Amused by the sociologist Vishwanathan 's comment , " India is the only country which has a body police and not a thought police " .
Makes a nice sound bite , but of course they have both .
Does n't the fact that Rushdie 's " Satanic Verses " is banned count ?
See Wikipedia 's article " Censorship in India " for other examples .
Mark Brecher , USA
If kissing in public is the worst their young people , married or otherwise , are doing , they should count their lucky stars .
People do much , much worse in places like Central Park , NY or Grant Park , Chicago .
Diana , USA A very well written article .
I feel embarrassed right now as an Indian .
But it is true , public display of affection is a crime in India , why ?
I have no idea .
In fact , I have been confronted by a police officer for kissing my girlfriend .
The ' demonstrators ' referred to here are illiterate people who have no idea about the Indian culture or what exactly they are demonstrating against .
As a person who has studied Indian history and culture , I can say that kissing or wearing revealing clothes is not against our so called " culture " or " values " .
We have had kings with 365 wives and we have the most revealing formal dress in the world , sari .
Even if some people feel or are taught that it is against our values , it is high time that we grow up and try to catch up with the rest of the world .
Ishan Thukral , India
Your friend 's quip has the answer hidden in it .
Indian tradition is not against kissing as you have mentioned yourself .
Kissing is an expression of love as was cited by the courts for the recent case that you mentioned and love in Indian tradition is considered sacred , something which if you express publicly , diminishes in its value .
This is also the reason why Indians do n't keep saying " I love you " to their near and dear ones 10 times a day .
Maybe this concept is somewhat foreign to the western world .
V Gautam , USA I would never do anything to disrespect someone 's culture but really , to start to use Western ways as a reason not to kiss is silly .
If you do n't want to kiss then just do n't and stop blaming other cultures for your uptight ways .
Shawna , USA Soutik - do n't you have better topics to cover for BBC ?
Vishnu , USA
A very well written piece - hilarious - could n't stop laughing .
Oru Mohiuddin , UK I enjoyed Soutik Biswas 's piece .
Good show !
But it is folks such as Ms Goswami who make me smile .
Sanctimonious talk such as ' my traditional family ' smacks of Grundyism and the Empress Victoria .

17 - year - old Ali Kamara , a black Muslim , was walking home on Staten Island Tuesday night after it was announced that Barack Obama was elected president when he was brutally assaulted by four white men .
Kamara tells the Daily News : " I see the car coming .
They looked at me and said , ' Obama ! '
They were not happy .
They had hoodies on .
They started hitting me with bats and my body started vibrating . "
Luckily , Kamara was able to break away and hide until the thugs left ; his mother , who moved with Ali to Staten Island from Liberia in 2000 , showed the News a bloody towel she used to staunch his wounds .
An NYPD spokesman says the department 's Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident as a bias crime .
And Kamara says he heard his assailants scream the word " Obama ! " but not any other racial or religious slurs , so it could be the bullies just mistook Kamara for the new President - Elect .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Only a few of Obama ’s cabinet nominations have received any criticism during this transition period ; most have been fuss - free .
But Lisa Jackson , commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection since 2006 and Obama ’s pick to head the enervated Environmental Protection Agency , has been slammed by an environmental nonprofit called Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ) that has blasted her in the toughest terms , calling her incompetent , weak , and unaccomplished .
Other environmental groups are cheering Jackson as she heads to the Senate for a confirmation hearing on Wednesday .
But PEER has produced pages and pages of research ( PDFs available here ) that it claims serve as an indictment of her 31 - month tenure as the Garden State ’s top environmental officer .
The organization points out that in 2006 Jackson said publicly that “ developing a new ranking system to prioritize ” polluted sites due for cleanup was “ the most important thing ” her department was working on .
Without a ranking system for the state ’s more than 15,000 contaminated sites — the longest such list in the nation — her department could not identify New Jersey ’s most dire pollution problems .
But , PEER complains , Jackson never delivered a ranking system and then proposed to outsource clean - up responsibilities to private contractors .
Jeff Ruch , the executive director of PEER , says , “ She never developed a coherent plan .
This was supposed to be her specialty , because the time she had spent previously at the EPA was spent on toxic cleanup .
But she never displayed any expertise in a way that was helpful . ”
This is but one example .
Jackson comes under fire from PEER for a variety of other reasons : letting Superfund clean - ups go unfinished ( a common New Jersey problem that predates Jackson ) ; waiting three months to inform parents and workers that their Gloucester County day care was vulnerable to mercury vapors because it was built on the site of a former thermometer factory ; mistreating a whistleblower ; and creating flood hazard controls plagued by loopholes .
PEER also alleges that under Jackson and New Jersey ’s DEP weakened groundwater pollution protections and missed key deadlines for a climate change bill .
Ruch acknowledges that Jackson has had her successes and that she has a reputation of being accessible and personable .
In total , Ruch paints a picture of a conventional state - level bureaucrat with a record of both wins and losses , whose primary sin is not leaning more on her boss , Governor Jon Corzine , a Democrat whose weak environmental instincts may lay at the root of many of Jackson ’s alleged failings .
Ruch describes a pattern in which Jackson repeatedly staked out a strong initial position on an environmental issue but ultimately unveiled a weak legislative or statutory proposal , because of pressure from the governor , industry , or someone else .
“ This is example of what we ’ve seen out of Bush ’s EPA , ” says Ruch .
“ They take staff decisions to the White House , they get reversed , and then they pretend it was their decision .
That ’s exactly the sort of thing we were seeing in New Jersey . ”
He worries that Obama picked Jackson precisely because she is willing to be compliant , and will let the White House , not the EPA , make environmental policy .
But when it comes to Jackson ’s nomination , PEER is in the minority in the green community .
Most environmental groups support Jackson .
Frances Beinecke , president of the Natural Resources Defense Council , has said Jackson is “ an excellent choice as the next administrator of the EPA ” and that she has been a “ strong advocate for the enforcement of environmental laws . ”
The Sierra Club also applauds the pick .
Its executive director , Carl Pope , said the organization has a “ very close , very positive relationship ” with Jackson and that “ she brings a strong scientific background to an agency where for the past eight years science and knowledge have been systematically corrupted and disregarded . ”
Jeff Tittel , the director of New Jersey ’s chapter of the Sierra Club , disputes PEER ’s charges .
“ You have to understand that Jackson started out with a department that ’s had trouble for a long time , ” he says .
He points to past Republican governors of New Jersey , who depleted the DEP , and the current Democratic governor , Corzine , who “ is n’t exactly pro-environment . ”
He cites Jackson ’s victories on keeping state parks open , on protecting open space , and on important sewer and septic regulations .
He praises her leadership on the state climate change bill , which was stronger than the governor originally wanted .
“ She ’s made the best of a bad situation , ” he says .
Tittel does n’t deny that Jackson ’s record is imperfect .
“ In some areas things have gotten cleaner , in some areas things have gotten dirtier , ” he says .
But he emphasizes that New Jersey is , on balance , better off for Jackson ’s leadership .
He attributes PEER ’s gripes to a few sources in New Jersey who “ have their own set of problems , and issues , and grudges . ”
And PEER ’s Ruch fires back by calling Tittel ’s support of Jackson “ self - serving . ”
“ There ’s a question of whether they did their job , ” he says of New Jersey environmental groups like Tittel’s .
“ They stood by while a lot of this happened . ”
Despite PEER ’s gripes , Jackson is expected to have no trouble at her Senate confirmation hearing .
Environmentalists in Washington are looking to her to revitalize the EPA after the agency ’s embarrassing eight years under Bush and Cheney .
If she disappoints them , no doubt PEER will be ready with a quick “ We told you so . ”
Iridium spacecraft provide satellite phone services US and Russian communications satellites have collided in space in what is thought to be the biggest incident of its kind to date .
The US commercial Iridium spacecraft hit a defunct Russian satellite at an altitude of about 800 km ( 500 miles ) over Siberia on Tuesday , Nasa said .
The risk to the International Space Station and a shuttle launch planned for later this month is said to be low .
The impact produced a cloud of debris , which will be tracked into the future .
Since the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 , it is estimated about 6,000 satellites have been put in orbit .
Satellite operators are all too aware that the chances of a collision are increasing .
The space station does have the capability of doing a debris- avoidance manoeuvre if necessary
John Yembrick
Nasa spokesman
The Americans are now following the debris path from the impact .
It is hoped that most of it will fall to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere .
Shuttle launch
The concern is whether the debris will spread and pose any risk to the ISS , which is orbiting the Earth some 435 km below the course of the collision .
According to the Washington Post , a Nasa memo said officials determined the risk to be " elevated " but have estimated it as " very small and within acceptable limits " .
SPACE DEBRIS
Around 17,000 objects tracked in space Monitored by the US Space Surveillance Network Nasa says four other cases of minor collisions in orbit ISS has had to manoeuvre away from debris eight times
Collision highlights growing threat Nasa spokesman John Yembrick said the ISS had the " capability of doing a debris - avoidance manoeuvre if necessary " .
He said this had happened on just eight previous occasions during the course of its 60,000 - plus orbits .
Officials said there were no plans to delay the launch of Nasa 's space shuttle Discovery later this month , although that would be re-evaluated in coming days .
Nicholas Johnson , an orbital debris expert at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that the Hubble Space Telescope and Earth - observing satellites at higher orbits and closer to the collision site were at greater risk of damage .
' Extremely unusual ' Communications firm Iridium , based in Bethesda , Maryland , said it " lost an operational satellite " after it was struck on Tuesday by the Russian satellite .
It said its clients may experience some brief outages until it had temporarily fixed the problem by Friday .
Iridium said it hoped to replace the 560kg satellite , launched in 1997 , with one of its in - orbit spares within the next 30 days .
The firm described it as an " extremely unusual , very low - probability event " , stressing that it was not caused by any fault on its part .
Russia 's space forces confirmed the collision with the defunct 950kg ( 2,094lb ) satellite .
" A collision occurred between an Iridium 33 satellite and a Russian Kosmos 2251 military satellite , " Major General Alexander Yakushin said .
The satellite was launched in 1993 and ceased to function two years later , he said according to the AFP news agency .
Russia has not commented on claims the satellite was out of control .
Littered orbit Space debris experts say the chances of such collisions have been rising .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Litter in orbit - caused in part by the break - ups of old satellites - has increased to such an extent that it is now the biggest threat to a space shuttle in flight .
Mr Johnson said that at the beginning of this year about 17,000 manmade pieces of debris were orbiting Earth .
The items , some as small as 10 cm ( four inches ) , are tracked by the US Space Surveillance Network - sending information to help spacecraft operators avoid the debris .
Of the 6,000 satellites sent into orbit since 1957 , about 3,000 remain in operation , according to Nasa .
Europe has just initiated its own space surveillance programme .
One of its main weather satellites had a near miss in December with a Chinese object .
The Europeans knew nothing about the threat until the Americans contacted the European Space Agency to inform it of the danger .

I guess it's no wonder John McCain was so happy to use " Joe the Plumber " as a debate prop last night -- he 's a partisan Republican who also happens to be a member of McCain 's old friends , the Keating family .
From Martin Eisenstadt :
Turns out that Joe Wurzelbacher from the Toledo event is a close relative of Robert Wurzelbacher of Milford , Ohio .
Who ’s Robert Wurzelbacher ?
Only Charles Keating ’s son-in - law and the former senior vice president of American Continental , the parent company of the infamous Lincoln Savings and Loan .
The now retired elder Wurzelbacher is also a major contributor to Republican causes giving well over $ 10,000 in the last few years .
Now I guess we know why Joe is telling the press that Obama is a " socialist " and that the Obama tax plan " infuriated " him .
After all , it would hit families like the Keatings and their minions the hardest .
Not to mention that Obama 's economic - recovery plan would put the crimps on influence peddlers like McCain 's old friends , the Keating Five .
But he sure made for a good one - day story .
[ H/t to Mike . ]
This is a guest post by Joseph Bonneau .
Joseph Bonneau is a researcher at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory whose research interests include privacy and security in social networks .
He originally reported these vulnerabilities on his group ’s research blog , Light Blue Touchpaper .
Facebook has a spotty track record enforcing the privacy of photos posted by users and designated as private .
Up until last February , Facebook ’s photo security relied on users not being able to craft custom PHP queries , instead of checking login cookies with every photo request .
It was only a manner of time before this was hacked in a fairly spectacular way in February 2008 , exposing a few personal photos of CEO Mark Zuckerberg .
The “ temporary flaw ” was fixed , only to be hacked again in March , and again in May .
The Associated Press picked up the story , Paris Hilton ’s name got involved , and Facebook was forced to re-work their photo security and prevent these PHP - style hacks .
Recently , however , I ’ve been poking around Facebook a bit as part of my ongoing research on privacy into online social networks , and I found a new set of problems with Facebook ’s photo security .
Facebook photos have URLs like http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=34947682&id=210132, which include a photo id and a user id .
A year ago , clicking on this link would show you my photo because Facebook did n’t check your login cookie if you knew the photo ’s URL .
This was the theme of last year ’s hacks .
In the current implementation , though , the login cookie is always checked against the photo ’s access control list , so clicking on that link wo n’t work unless you ’re one of my friends .
Facebook encourages users to send out these “ public photo links , ” and they are posted all over the web .
Unfortunately , Facebook does n’t actually host all of its own images , they rely on third - party content delivery networks like Akamai and LimeLight Networks to efficiently serve photos around the globe .
If you examine the the HTML for a Facebook photo page , you ’ll see the image is hosted at an address like http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v646/41/83/210132/n210132_34947682_4899.jpg.
Note the .ak subdomain in the URL , this is a clear sign that Akamai is being used , which can of course be confirmed easily using a tool like traceroute .
This direct link will give you access to the photo from the link I posted above .
It does n’t matter if you are not one of my Facebook friends or even if you have a Facebook account , this is a simple HTTP get request with no cookies at all .
The photo server does n’t check your login cookies for two reasons .
First , it ’s more efficient to host photos on a special - purpose , blazingly fast photo server which does n’t have to worry about parsing PHP parameters and verifying login cookies .
This kind of thing matters when you are hosting billions of photos .
Second , since the photos are hosted from the domain “ fbcdn.net ” instead of “ facebook.com , ” your browser wo n’t send your Facebook cookies to the photo server .
This is the “ same origin ” policy which is fundamentally built into web browsers , and is an essential feature to protect your privacy .
It ’s actually being used correctly here too , in that Facebook is preventing its third party photo servers from having access to your cookies from the main site by hosting them from a separate domain .
The problem though is that now the confidentiality of a photo is reduced to its URL being difficult to guess .
It sure seems to have a lot of randomness to it , but you ’ll find you can remove most of that ; the link http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/210132/n210132_34947682_4899.jpg will work just as well .
You ’ll also notice that now three of the four numbers present in the link are the photo ID and user ID that were listed in the original “ public link ” to the photo as hosted within Facebook .
The only thing to guess is the final 4 digits , which effectively serve as a PIN .
This is the part that Facebook flubbed , we know from the history of ATM security that four digits provide far from enough randomness to prevent brute - forcing .
In fact , by simultaneously querying the many servers mirroring the same photos , it ’s possible try all of the 8999 possibilities in about 2 minutes .

Let us set aside the obvious fact that both the social status and salary of academics are anything but stellar , that our platform is rather limited and usually ignored , that the students often struggle to achieve high - school level performance , the offices are on the dingy side , and the secretaries are few and overwhelmed ( the benefits are , on the whole , pretty good , relatively speaking -- but that ’s only because we live in a country where a huge number of people havebenefits at all ) .
Fish is incensed by the case of one professor Denis Rancourt , a faculty member at the University of Ottawa who started out his semester by giving top grades to all his students and gingerly proceeded to teach political activism rather than physics , for which he was actually hired .
But guess what ?
Rancourt now faces dismissal from the school , and rightly so .
Which not only shows that the system actually works despite “ academic exceptionalism , ” but that such a philosophy must be pretty rare indeed , because this is the first case I ’ve heard of and I have never , ever , in my entire career witnessed any other claim by an academic that came even close to Rancourt ’s bold idiocy .
Then again , perhaps things are different at Florida International .
Fish ’s underlying question is a good one : what , exactly , is academic freedom , and what are its reasonable boundaries ?
Fish cites a couple of outrageous court cases to argue that it is not a constitutionally - given right and that its scope should be rather limited .
For instance , in US v. Doe ( back in 1972 ) the courts rejected the claim by a researcher that his academic freedom meant that he did not have to answer questions about his research in a subpoena .
I would agree : indeed , I think the results of scientific inquiry ought to be made public if the researcher or institution used even a penny of federal or state money , as is usually the case .
Then again , to argue that we should reject a concept like academic freedom simply because it ’s not in the US Constitution is rather a narrow view , even on purely legal grounds .
There is no Constitutional protection of journalistic sources either , and yet many in recent years have argued that there should be one ( within limits ) , because of the good it does for society .
Accordingly , several States have passed laws to that effect , and even Congress has considered the issue .
Rights are n’t a God - given immutable set , they are won or lost by legal battles , legislative battles and the education of the people at large .
So what is academic freedom after all ?
It is n’t the caricature that Fish pretends so many academics put forth .
It is certainly not a license to do whatever one wants regardless of the rules and regulations of one ’s place of work .
University professors are not free to insult their students ( unless by “ insulting ” one means to present them with a view that is at odds with their metaphysical or cultural presuppositions ) ; they cannot teach whatever they want ( as the Rancourt case demonstrates ) ; they cannot even simply refuse a direct order from the Department Chair or Dean to show up to a usually useless committee meeting , because there are administrative penalties to be reckoned with -- just like in any other job .
( Contrary to popular perception , professors do have a hierarchical series of bosses , which usually include , from the bottom up : Department Chair or Head , Dean , Provost , President , and Board of Trustees ; in the case of State universities , add the State Governor and Legislature .
Also contrary to popular myth , professorsbe fired , even if they have tenure , though the standards in the latter case are quite high . )
But academicshave an ethical duty to pursue scholarship ( largely ) in whatever way they see fit , with minimal interference from the university ’s administration .
Moreover , they should be allowed to teach their specialties withinbroad educational parameters , not the far too much business - like views of so many ( but of course not all ) administrators .
And perhaps equally importantly they should be able to address the public , as intellectuals , in whatever way and through whatever medium they deem effective ( including blogs in the New York Times ) .
The reason for this large ( but not infinite ) latitude is because -- as even Fish grudgingly admits -- academia is a different type of job from most others .
It ’s not just that the product ( “ education ” ) is hard to measure by its very nature ; it is that the “ clients ” are not even ( only ) the students , but their parents ( who usually pay handsomely for said education ) and , more importantly , society at large .
It is in society ’s broad interest that we produce not only competent specialists but , ideally , citizens capable of critical thinking .
If Fish wishes to aim at a truly important target he should “ think again ” ( the title of his blog ) about university administrators who -- this time truly with a small number of exceptions -- seem to considers themselves thefor the existence of universities , which they increasingly run as a Wall Street - type business ( oh boy ! ) or use as a trampoline for their own career and political ambitions .
Administrators should be the smallest and most invisible gear of the university ’s machine .
They ought to work to maximize faculty ’s ability to teach and do scholarship ( in that order , not the usual reversed one ) and of students to learn and grow .
In order to do that , administrators should be invisibly busy trying to raise as much capital as possible and , well , it in the most efficient way possible .
The reality , as anyone including Fish can easily tell you , is far from this ideal , andis the real scandal .
And by the way , exactly what did you do to improve things when you were a Dean at the University of Illinois ?
What I find dangerous in writings like Fish ’s ( and not just these past couple of columns in the NYT ) is that they represent an insane attack from within on academia , an already beleaguered institution , constantly under assault by all sorts of anti-intellectual forces .
The same forces that brought us the Christian Right and George W. , have made a mockery of reason and argument , and have ignored science in the pursuit of blind and destructive ideological agendas .
The classical types of anti-intellectualism described by Richard Hofstadter have now been joined by extreme post - structuralism and deconstructionism , ironically themselves movements made possible by that very academia that they criticize with such gusto .
Time to take reason back from all ranks of anti-intellectualists .
Time to defend rights like that of academic freedom , regardless -- or in fact precisely because -- they are not enshrined in the Constitution .
Time to recognize the value of what more than a thousand years of struggle against church and government have wrestled from the clutches of power to benefit us as a society of ( ideally ) freethinking individuals , including Professor Fish .
Loudtalks is a simple , free , walkie - talkie style communication tool that allows you to talk with your buddies without having to go through the hassles of scheduling a call , dialing or waiting .
Just push a button when you want to talk .
Loudtalks is n’t just another Internet telephony application , it ’s different .
Loudtalks look similar to an instant messaging application like Skype or Yahoo messenger .
When you have something to say to a friend on your list , simply click on the friend , push on the button and say it .
When it ’s done , release the button .
It operates very much like those push - to - talk walkie - talkie sets .
If keeping the button pressed down while talking sounds difficult for you , it can be locked by clicking on the lock button next to the push button and your hands become free .
There are also customizable keyboard shortcuts ( default is F7 ) that allows you to talk even when the application is minimized .
The communication is n’t real time .
If your friend is not online at that moment , he can playback your recorded voice message when he returns and reply whenever he desires .
This is n’t a drawback , rather it ’s an enhancement to the usual way people communicate with each other .
Loudtalks is about voice communication without calls and instant messaging without typing .
Loudtalks also supports group messaging , where you can combine several contacts into a channel and broadcast your message .
You can create permanent group channels from your contacts and then drag additional contacts to add them .
A very neat feature .
I really liked Loudtalks .
It ’s dead simple and probably the easiest voice messaging application ever .
The question is pretty short and to the point .
What exactly is Grimace , the McDonald ’s character ?
I mean Ronald McDonald is a clown , that ’s pretty clear .
And the majority of the remaining McDonald ’s characters seem to have at least a passing resemblance or relation to McDonald ’s food .
The Hamburglar is a thief that steals hamburgers .
Birdie is a giant bird .
Not sure if she produces the eggs for Egg McMuffins or has some relation to Chicken McNuggets , but she ’s pretty clearly a bird .
Mayor McCheese has an enormous cheeseburger for a head .
The Fry Guys look like a wad of French fries .
Well , really they look like pom-pons , but at least the have some relationship to french fries , its in their name .
Grimace ?
I guess he likes shakes .
Or are they called partially gelatinated non-dairy gum - based beverages ?
But what is he ?
To me he always looked like an enormous gumdrop .
According to Wikipedia , he ’s a member of the “ wumpus ” species with short arms and legs .
Which begs the question , what ’s a wumpus ?
I mean there must have been some thought process behind the original design .
So I looked it up , and it turns out Grimace was not always good , nor did he only have two arms .
Here ’s visual proof :
The original McDonaldland characters had a more psychedelic look and were based on HR Puf ’n ’stuf characters .
So much so , that they were sued for copyright infringement and McDonald ’s paid out a hefty settlement .
Certain characters were cited , but Grimace seemed to have escaped the litigation .
Why ?
Maybe because McDonald ’s amputated two of his arms and made him into a good guy , thus creating a brand new character that would not be accused of being plagiarized .
At least that ’s the theory .
But it does n’t really answer the question .
What is he ?
I mean even after his transformation , he must have been intended to resemble something , right ?
I ’ve asked this of other people , but have yet to come to a satisfying conclusion .
A couple of theories :
He ’s an evil Sith Lord ?
He ’s more qualified to be President than this buffoon ?
He ’s a Purple People Eater ?
He ’s a rockin’ bass player ?
He ’s Charlie Weis ?
He ’s a medical miracle ?
He ’s Satan ?
He ’s a Polygamist ?
He ’s a professional golfer ?
He ’s a Pimp ?
A ladies man ?
He ’s your Valentine ?
He ’s a bit creepy on Police Ride - Alongs .
He ’s Godzilla ’s Cousin ?
This does n’t explain anything , but felt appropriate
This is more the answer , which is that there ’s no answer .
So I put the question forth to the people ,
What is Grimace ?
… and now Grimace has a few questions of his own …
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand You see somebody naked and you say , " Who is that man ?
" You try so hard but you do n't understandJust what you will say when you get homeBecause something is happening here but you do n't know what it is Do you , Mr. Jones ?
You raise up your head and you ask , " Is this where it is ?
" And somebody points to you and says , " It 's his " And you say , " What 's mine ? " and somebody else says , " Well , what is ?
" And you say , " Oh my God , am I here all alone ?
" But something is happening and you do n't know what it is Do you , Mr. Jones ?
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geekWho immediately walks up to you when he hears you speakAnd says , " How does it feel to be such a freak ?
" And you say , " Impossible ! " as he hands you a boneAnd something is happening here but you do n't know what it is Do you , Mr. Jones ?
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
To get you facts when someone attacks your imaginationBut nobody has any respect , anyway they already expect you to all give a checkTo tax - deductible charity organizationsAh , you 've been with the professors and they 've all liked your looksWith great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks
You 've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald 's books
You 're very well - read , it 's well - known
But something is happening here and you do n't know what it is Do you , Mr. Jones ?
Well , the sword swallower , he comes up to you and then he kneels He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice , he asks you how it feels
And he says , " Here is your throat back , thanks for the loan " And you know something is happening but you do n't know what it is Do you , Mr. Jones ?
Now , you see this one - eyed midget shouting the word " Now " And you say , " For what reason ? " and he says , " How " And you say , " What does this mean ? " and he screams back , " You 're a cow !
Give me some milk or else go home
" And you know something 's happening but you do n't know what it is Do you , Mr. Jones ?
Well , you walk into the room like a camel , and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground There ought to be a law against you comin ' around
You should be made to wear earphones '
Cause something is happening and you do n't know what it is Do you , Mr. Jones ?

The next module for the International Space Station needs a name ; something with a little more pizazz than its current appellation , Node 3 .
NASA is seeking opinions and suggestions for new names , for the component – a connecting module and its cupola , targeted to launch in December 2009 .
The cupola looks very cool , almost like a starship bridge – with six rectangular windows and one circular window overhead , providing a panoramic view that will be unrivaled by any other spacecraft ever flown .
Node 3 itself will connect to the port side of the Unity Node and will provide room for many of the station ’s life support systems .
NASA has a few names picked out , so you can vote for those , or suggest your own designation .
NASA says the name should reflect the spirit of exploration and cooperation embodied by the space station , and follow in the tradition set by Node 1 - Unity - and Node 2 - Harmony .
Here are the choices so far :
Earthrise , Legacy , Serenity , Venture , or , suggest another name .
Voting / suggesting is open until March 20 here .
More about Node 3 :
Space shuttle Endeavour will deliver the Node 3 components during the STS - 130 mission , currently schedule for December 2009 .
Once the cupola is attached to one of the module ’s six ports , it will offer astronauts a spectacular view of both their home planet and their home in space .
Aside from providing a perfect location to observe and photograph the Earth , the cupola also will contain a robotics workstation , where astronauts will be able to control the station ’s giant robotic arm .
After Node 3 is installed , the station ’s crew will transfer over many of the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems ( ECLSS ) currently stored in various places around the station , including :
The Oxygen Generation System ( OGS ) , which takes the station ’s water and splits it apart into hydrogen , which gets vented into space , and oxygen , which is returned into the cabin for the crew to breathe
Atmosphere Revitalization System ( ARS ) , which controls the station ’s carbon dioxide levels and maintains the temperature and atmospheric pressure at comfortable levels .
The Water Recovery System ( WRS ) and Urine Processor Assembly ( UPA ) , which take waste water from the station ’s shower and toilets and purify it , separating any contaminants and making it safe for the crew to drink .
The Waste and hygiene compartment , which provides a place for the crew to shower and use the bathroom in a way that allows the station to process the majority of the water used onboard so that it may be used again , greatly lessening the need for resupply flights from Earth .
NASA and its station partners traditionally have named each habitable part of the station , including its three laboratories ( the U.S lab - Destiny , the European lab - Columbus , and the Japanese lab - Kibo or Hope ) , two airlocks ( Quest and Pirs ) , and two Russian - built modules ( Zvezda or Star , and Zarya or Dawn ) .

Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni reiterated over the weekend that Israel will not tolerate rocket fire emanating form the Gaza Strip .
Israel , she told the Washington Post , has no intention of reoccupying the Strip , but the international community would have to be patient and allow it to achieve the objectives set for Operation Cast Lead .
When asked about the pressure placed on Israel by the international community to end the Gaza campaign , Livni said that she " does n’t like the term ceasefire since it looks like an agreement between two legitimate sides .
Support US Congress backs Gaza op Yitzhak Benhorin House of Representatives aligns with US Senate , issues resolution supporting Gaza offensive , Israel 's right to self defense US Congress backs Gaza op
" At the end of the day , this is not a conflict between two states but a fight against terror .
. . .
We need to fight in Gaza because they ( Hamas ) have targeted Israel for eight years .
We are fighting in order to weaken them and to affect their ability to target Israel in the future .
" This is an ongoing war against terror , " she continued .
" We do n't ask the international community to fight with us .
We ask the international community to give us some understanding and time . "
The weapons ' smuggling into the Strip , she added , " must be stopped by Israel or someone else ...
We needed to give an answer to their rearmament .
We need to know that at the end of this military operation , we will not face the rearmament of Hamas . "
' We are fighting terror . '

Iran is heavily involved in the evolution of Hamas , said Livni : " When ( Hamas ) started , the missiles were homemade – made in the Gaza Strip .
But not anymore .
Now they are professional , coming from Iran . "
' We need time '
As for the future prospect of the Israeli offensive in Gaza , " It depends .
First we need to find out whether they understand that Israel is no longer a state which they can target while hoping for restraint .
Israel is going to defend itself .
" I think that some of these goals were achieved ...
But the idea is not to reoccupy the Gaza Strip .
When we left Gaza , Hamas used to write on billboards that terror won and Israel left Gaza because of terror .
So today the message for the Palestinians is that we left the Gaza Strip in order to create hopes for peace .
But now we are coming back because of terror , " she said .
" Hamas ' strategy is resistance and survival .
As long as they survive , this is a victory ( for them ) .
When they know the international community is putting pressure on Israel , they can hold out and take some oxygen , waiting for Israel to be stopped by the international community .
It is a pity . "
As for the suggestions that an international force be tasked with maintaining the ceasefire , Livni said that she was " not against the participation of the international community , but it does n't replace our need to fight terrorism .
And sometimes , when you have monitoring forces within a place , it makes it more difficult for us to defend ourselves , because the last thing we want is to kill people by mistake .
" Israel is not going to show restraint anymore .
. . . it is not a missile against a missile .
We are going to attack strongly if they continue . "
The goal , she concluded , is to keep the Israeli - Palestinian peace process alive : " We are willing to ...
Try and find a peace treaty with the moderates as long as at the end of the day , we do n't fight a terror state on the other side of the border ...
A Gaza Strip controlled by Hamas is a burden not only to Israel but to the Palestinians themselves . "

Tumbling oil prices may dim Sarah Palin 's political future John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 18 , 2009
Print This Email This Update at bottom : Palin must pay income taxes on thousands taken for expense money " Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's first two years in office have been called a time of milk and honey , when the resource - rich state was flush with wealth from record oil prices , " begins the AP's Rachel D'Oro .
But alas -- like the Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez , who the Republican Party was quick to mock as the socialist strongman of Latin America , Sarah Palin is feeling the wrath of global stock traders ' diminished hunger for oil .
Rapid declines in oil prices have punished the budget of the resource - rich state , calling into question Palin 's stewardship .
Was she really a successful governor or just the beneficiary of overinflated prices ?
Writes D'Oro , " That could have political repercussions for the former Republican vice presidential hopeful , who has signaled an interest in a 2012 presidential run but must stay visible in the Lower 48 to be successful .
" Given these bad times , she 's going to have a much more difficult time traveling outside Alaska , " Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics , told her .
" When times are good , people will let their governor roam .
In bad times , citizens expect their governor to stay home and work on solving the problems . "
" Oil accounts for as much as 90 percent of state revenues .
So the plunge of North Slope crude from an all - time high of $ 144.59 per barrel last July threatens to give the state an estimated budget shortfall of up to $ 1.5 billion in the fiscal year that ends June 30 . "
Alaska residents also receive proceeds from the state 's oil sales .
Price shrinkages could pose trouble for the popular governor at home as well .
" She 's kind of been moved up a couple notches and I could see her leaving the state and getting her profile up even higher on the national political level , " Bear Ketzler , city manager of the Yukon River village of Tanana , was quoted as saying .
" But I think for her to be electable in four years , Obama would really have to screw up . "
Palin must pay income taxes on thousands taken for expense money
It 's not just Obama administration nominees who have tax issues .
" Gov. Sarah Palin must pay income taxes on thousands of dollars in expense money she received while living at her Wasilla home , under a new determination by state officials , " the Anchorage Daily News reports .
The paper adds , " The governor 's office would n't say this week how much she owes in back taxes for meal money , or whether she intends to continue to receive the per diem allowance .
As of December , she was still charging the state for meals and incidentals . "
CNN notes , " The Washington Post first reported ( link ) last September that Palin had billed the state for nearly $ 17,000 worth of meals and other living expenses while staying in her own home during the first 19 months of her administration , even though the official governors residence is in Juneau . "
Sharon Leighow , Palin 's spokeswoman , told the paper by e-mail , " The amount of taxes owed is a private matter .
If the governor collects future per diem , those documents would be a matter of public record . "
" How is it that a person is able to collect a stipend for normally travel - related incidentals while staying at home ? "
Wonkette mocks .
" Through Alaskan magic . "

LP vs digital is a " religious war " that has been played out by various audiophiles ever since the CD format was introduced in the early 1980s .
" Vinylphiles " claim that CDs do not sound as good as LPs , period .
CDs appear to sound " harsh " , " unlistenable " , " lacking in dynamics " , plus a myriad of other " faults . "
Some vinylphiles even extend this to all digital formats , including the new Super Audio CD and DVD - Audio high resolution formats , whereas others believe the higher resolution formats either equal or at least get closer to the " superior " sound of LP .
" Digiphiles " on the other hand laugh at LP 's pitiful dynamic range , surface noise , pop and crackle , harmonic distortion , and various other limitations to do with the ability of either the cutting head to master difficult signals onto disc , and the ability of stylii to track them without " jumping . "
So , are there any evidence to support these claims ?
Can both parties be right ?
I was interested to find out if there are any objective evidence that I can gather using my sound card ( Audiotrak Prodigy 7.1 ) and my very old copy of Cool Edit .
I am particularly intrigued by vinylphile claims that LPs mastered from a digital recording sound better than that exact same digital recording on CD .
Plus , recording an LP onto CD yields most of the benefits of the original LP , and still sound better than the commercially pressed CD .
The Approach
I took a few albums from my personal collection that I have on both LP and at least one digital format ( CD , SACD , or DVD - A ) .
I selected the following songs from the following albums :
Main Titles from the original motion picture soundtrack to Chariots of Fire ( Vangelis ) LP ( Polydor 2383 602 ) 1981 Australian PolyGram pressing , purchased second hand CD ( Polydor 800 020 -2 ) 1984 Polyram made in Germany , purchased new
( ) Mick 's Blessings from Café Bleu ( The Style Council ) LP ( Polydor 817 535-1 ) 1984 Australian PolyGram pressing , purchased new Original CD release ( Polydor 817 535 -2 ) 1984 PolyGram made in Germany , purchased new " Digitally Remastered " CD re-release ( Polydor 557 915 - 2 ) 2000 Universal made in the EU , purchased new
( ) What 's New from What 's New ( Linda Ronstadt and The Nelson Riddle Orchestra ) LP ( Asylum 9 60260 ) 1983 USA WEA pressing , purchased second hand DVD - Audio ( Elektra / Asylum / Rhino 8122-78341-9 ) 2002 Warner Strategic Marketing made in Germany , purchased new
( and ) Genesis Ch.1.V.32 from I Robot ( The Alan Parsons Project ) LP ( Arista Code 304 AL.7002 ) 1977 Australian EMI pressing , purchased second hand DVD - Audio ( Classic HDAD 2003 ) 2004 Classic USA release , purchased new
( ) More Than This from Avalon ( Roxy Music ) LP ( EG 2311 154 ) 1982 Australian PolyGram pressing , purchased second hand Hybrid SACD ( Virgin ROXYSACD 9 ) 2003 Virgin made in Holland , purchased new
( )
Notice that most of the LPs are second hand .
LPs deteriorate with every play , so this comparison is potentially biased against LPs .
What I did was cleaned all the LPs using a VPI HW16.5 vacuum based record cleaning machine ( using VPI record cleaning fluid , VPI brush and a domestic lint brush - do n't ask why , but it works ! ) to ensure that I minimize surface noise and crackle , and take out any dirt and grime from the second hand LPs .
I recorded all the tracks on the LPs using my system ( Dynavector DV - 20 xL cartridge , Rega P3 turntable , Dynavector P - 75 phono stage ) via the analog outputs of my Denon AVC - A1SE + amplifier .
I used my HTPC and n- Track Studio to do the recordings in stereo at 96 k Hz sampling rate and 24 - bit resolution .
For the CDs , I ripped the actual digital information ( at 44.1kHz/ 16 - bit resolution ) directly from the discs using Exact Audio Copy .
In some cases , I also recorded them as reproduced by my Sony SCD - XA777ES player via the analog outputs of my amp .
I recorded SACD and DVD - A tracks using the analog outputs ( via my amp ) of the Sony SCD - XA777ES and Panasonic DVD - RP82 players respectively .
Linear PCM 96 kHz /24 - bit tracks encoded as DVD - Video content were recorded using the analog outputs ( via my amp ) Panasonic DVD -RP82 , but also digitally ripped from the disc using DVD Decrypter .
All wave files were then analysed using Cool Edit Pro .
The results are ... interesting ...

“ Yes . ”
The follow - up , of course , is “ When ? ” , but this is just about the best news we ’ve heard from the Obama camp regarding the decade old policy banning gays & lesbians from openly serving in the military .
It ’s exciting not just because Obama will be fulfilling a campaign promise , but because after eight years of press secretaries serving as little more than obfuscating puppets , Robert Gibbs will answer your questions – and by way of YouTube , to boot .
The question comes at about 4:18 in the video .
( CNN ) --
The Czech Republic 's practice of surgically castrating convicted sex offenders is " invasive , irreversible and mutilating " and should stop immediately , the Council of Europe 's Anti-Torture Committee said in a report made public Thursday .
The central European country castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008 , when investigators from the Council of Europe , a human - rights forum , visited the Czech Republic .
The Council of Europe condemned the practice as " degrading . "
The procedure is being performed even on first - time , non-violent offenders , such as exhibitionists , its investigation revealed .
Prisoners have to request castration under Czech law , but many fear they will be jailed for life if they do not , the investigation found .
" In practically all the cases , these patients indicated that their application was at least partially instigated by fear of long - term detention , " the report said .
" Some patients claimed that the treating sexologist had explicitly told them that surgical castration was the only available option to them and that refusal would mean lifelong detention . "
And it warned that some " significantly " mentally retarded people had been castrated .
" In at least five cases , legally incapacitated offenders were surgically castrated , " the report said .
" In all of these instances , the court - appointed guardian had signed the consent form ; in two cases , the guardians were mayors . "
The investigators found only two convicts who had spontaneously volunteered for castration , while others they interviewed said mental health staff specializing in sexuality had recommended it .
" The other patients interviewed indicated that the treating sexologist had suggested surgical castration , in several cases within a week of the patient 's admission to hospital , " the report said .
" Some of the sexologists interviewed by the delegation themselves affirmed that for certain patients there was no alternative treatment to surgical castration . "
The Czech Republic defends the practice as voluntary , saying castration aims permanently to reduce testosterone levels in order to diminish the offender 's sexual urges .
The process , officially called " therapeutic testicular pulpectomies ... are performed upon a written request of an adult man , " the Czech government responded .
It said the operation had to be approved by a committee of experts .
" Prior to the performance of such intervention , the patient must express his consent with its performance .
Castration is considered with respect to men who cannot manage their sexual instincts and are sexually aggressive , " the Czech government said , saying the Council of Europe had not proven its case sufficiently for the country to abandon castration .
It argues the procedure is effective in reducing repeat offenses .
But the Council of Europe questioned the statistics on repeat offenses and said even if they were correct , castration was not an appropriate way to reduce recidivism .
" The committee 's delegation came across three cases in which sex offenders had committed serious sex- related crimes , including serial rape and attempted murder , after they had been surgically castrated , " the human - rights group said .
" Surgical castration is no longer a generally accepted medical intervention in the treatment of sex - offenders , " the report said .
It said candidates for castration often received information about the procedure which was too technical to understand -- or no information at all .
" Several patients who had undergone surgical castration told the delegation that they would never have applied for surgical castration had they been properly informed , " the report warned .
It condemned the practice as " an irreversible intervention that always leads to infertility and , in the long run , a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis , " also warning of possible depression and changes in appearance .
It said it was impossible to determine how many people had been castrated in keeping with a 1966 law .
The Council of Europe delegation visited the Czech Republic from March 25 to April 2 , 2008 .
It issued its report and the Czech response on July 23 , 2008 .
It made them public on Thursday at the request of the Czech government , it said .

Conservatives will have to do some soul - searching after election day , said Peter Wehner , a former deputy assistant to President Bush , in The Washington Post .
No matter who wins the White House , Democrats should increase their margins in the House and Senate .
But if Republicans use the " wilderness years " ahead to " become champions of an ambitious conservative reform agenda , they will begin the road back to political dominance . "
That 's " absurd , " said David Sirota in Blog for our Future .
The Republicans made this election " an ideological contest between Reagan conservatism and supposed wild - eyed liberalism / socialism , " and a Democratic landslide would be " a huge repudiation of conservative ideology . "
The Right can't just erase what will be a huge progressive mandate by telling voters " nah nah nah ca n't hear you ! "
Some conservatives believe that shoring up the base is the first step toward a comeback , said Sean J. Miller in National Review online .
But Canada 's conservatives moved to the center after a near - death experience 15 years ago , emphasizing economic issues over social ones .
And Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's conservatives " are now in the ascendency , having won back - to - back elections , " so Republicans might want to look " look north . "
An Arizona man who has waged a 10 - year campaign to stop a flood of illegal immigrants from crossing his property is being sued by 16 Mexican nationals who accuse him of conspiring to violate their civil rights when he stopped them at gunpoint on his ranch on the U.S. - Mexico border .
Roger Barnett , 64 , began rounding up illegal immigrants in 1998 and turning them over to the U.S. Border Patrol , he said , after they destroyed his property , killed his calves and broke into his home .
His Cross Rail Ranch near Douglas , Ariz. , is known by federal and county law enforcement authorities as “ the avenue of choice ” for immigrants seeking to enter the United States illegally .
Trial continues Monday in the federal lawsuit , which seeks $ 32 million in actual and punitive damages for civil rights violations , the infliction of emotional distress and other crimes .
Also named are Mr. Barnett ’s wife , Barbara , his brother , Donald , and Larry Dever , sheriff in Cochise County , Ariz . , where the Barnetts live .
The civil trial is expected to continue until Friday .
The lawsuit is based on a March 7 , 2004 , incident in a dry wash on the 22,000 - acre ranch , when he approached a group of illegal immigrants while carrying a gun and accompanied by a large dog .
Attorneys for the immigrants - five women and 11 men who were trying to cross illegally into the United States - have accused Mr. Barnett of holding the group captive at gunpoint , threatening to turn his dog loose on them and saying he would shoot anyone who tried to escape .
The immigrants are represented at trial by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund ( MALDEF ) , which also charged that Sheriff Dever did nothing to prevent Mr. Barnett from holding their clients at “ gunpoint , yelling obscenities at them and kicking one of the women . ”
In the lawsuit , MALDEF said Mr. Barnett approached the group as the immigrants moved through his property , and that he was carrying a pistol and threatening them in English and Spanish .
At one point , it said , Mr. Barnett ’s dog barked at several of the women and he yelled at them in Spanish , “ My dog is hungry and he ’s hungry for buttocks . ”
The lawsuit said he then called his wife and two Border Patrol agents arrived at the site .
It also said Mr. Barnett acknowledged that he had turned over 12,000 illegal immigrants to the Border Patrol since 1998 .
In March , U.S. District Judge John Roll rejected a motion by Mr. Barnett to have the charges dropped , ruling there was sufficient evidence to allow the matter to be presented to a jury .
Mr. Barnett ’s attorney , David Hardy , had argued that illegal immigrants did not have the same rights as U.S. citizens .
Mr. Barnett told The Washington Times in a 2002 interview that he began rounding up illegal immigrants after they started to vandalize his property , northeast of Douglas along Arizona Highway 80 .
He said the immigrants tore up water pumps , killed calves , destroyed fences and gates , stole trucks and broke into his home .
Some of his cattle died from ingesting the plastic bottles left behind by the immigrants , he said , adding that he installed a faucet on an 8,000 - gallon water tank so the immigrants would stop damaging the tank to get water .
Mr. Barnett said some of the ranch´s established immigrant trails were littered with trash 10 inches deep , including human waste , used toilet paper , soiled diapers , cigarette packs , clothes , backpacks , empty 1 - gallon water bottles , chewing - gum wrappers and aluminum foil - which supposedly is used to pack the drugs the immigrant smugglers give their “ clients ” to keep them running .
He said he carried a pistol during his searches for the immigrants and had a rifle in his truck “ for protection ” against immigrant and drug smugglers , who often are armed .
A former Cochise County sheriff´s deputy who later was successful in the towing and propane business , Mr. Barnett spent $ 30,000 on electronic sensors , which he has hidden along established trails on his ranch .
He searches the ranch for illegal immigrants in a pickup truck , dressed in a green shirt and camouflage hat , with his handgun and rifle , high - powered binoculars and a walkie - talkie .
His sprawling ranch became an illegal - immigration highway when the Border Patrol diverted its attention to several border towns in an effort to take control of the established ports of entry .
That effort moved the illegal immigrants to the remote areas of the border , including the Cross Rail Ranch .
“ This is my land .
I´m the victim here , ” Mr. Barnett said .
“ When someone´s home and loved ones are in jeopardy and the government seemingly can´t do anything about it , I feel justified in taking matters into my own hands .
And I always watch my back . ”

Ted Stevens was convicted on corruption charges last month Alaska 's Republican Senator Ted Stevens has lost his bid for a seventh term in office after a knife - edge race against Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich .
The Democratic candidate led the Senate 's longest - serving Republican by 3,724 after Tuesday 's count , with only 2,500 overseas votes to be tallied .
If the Democrats win two more Senate seats they would be able to prevent the Republicans from blocking legislation .
Minnesota 's vote is due to be recounted while Georgia will hold a run -off vote .
The result means the balance of power in the Senate now favours the Democrats , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington .
With 58 of the 100 seats , they are now just two short of the 60 needed to overcome filibusters - a tactic used by the Senate minority to prevent legislation from coming to a vote .
Automatic recount Mr Stevens , 85 , was seen almost as an institution in his state , our correspondent says , to the extent that the airport in Anchorage was named after him .
But the Senate race in Alaska was plunged into controversy when Mr Stevens was convicted last month of lying about gifts he had received from an oil company .
REMAINING SENATE RACES Minnesota : Manual recount set to begin Georgia : Run-off scheduled for 2 December
Profile : Ted Stevens
His defeat means the Senate will have its first Democratic representative from Alaska for 30 years .
In Minnesota , Democrat Al Franken , a well - known comedian , trails incumbent Republican Norm Coleman by just 206 votes , or 0.007 % of the vote .
According to Minnesota state law , a winning margin of less than 0.5 % of the vote triggers an automatic manual recount .
The decision is expected to be taken on Tuesday , with the recount starting on Wednesday .
When ballots are counted by hand , candidates can often pick up votes , because human counters register votes that counting machines ignore .
In Georgia , because no candidate won more than 50 % of the vote , a run-off between the top two candidates was automatically triggered .
Incumbent Republican Saxby Chambliss faces Democratic challenger Jim Martin in the 2 December vote .
A recent opinion poll from Research 2000 gave Mr Chambliss a three - point lead , with 49 % to Mr Martin 's 46 % .
Former president Bill Clinton is due to campaign for Mr Martin on Wednesday .
Historic split
As well as the three outstanding Senate races , the outcome of one state 's presidential vote has still not been declared .
LATE STATE RESULTS Missouri : John McCain favoured to win Nebraska : State officials announced on Friday that the vote was split for the first time ever In Missouri , Republican John McCain is leading by some 4,900 votes , with only provisional ballots left to be counted .
Provisional ballots are votes cast by people whose eligibility to vote is unclear on election day .
Even if all of the provisional ballots were declared valid , Barack Obama would have to win the vast majority of them to take the state .
So far , only one US network - NBC - has declared Mr McCain the winner in Missouri .
Last Friday , Nebraska officials declared that President - elect Barack Obama had won one of the state 's electoral college votes .
It is the first time in recent US history that a state has split its electoral college votes .
Nebraska grants two electoral college votes to the winner of the state - wide vote , and one electoral vote for the winner in each congressional district .

Microsoft has violated European competition law by including Internet Explorer with Windows , according to the European Commission .
The Commission said other browsers are prevented from competing with IE because Windows includes Microsoft 's own browser .
Furthermore , the remedies put in place under the US government 's landmark 2002 antitrust settlement does not make IE 's inclusion with Windows lawful under European law .
Under that ruling , Microsoft agreed to separate IE from Windows and allow users to de-select IE as their chosen browser .
The idea was that users did n't get IE as a default from start up .
The ruling came in a Statement of Objections from the Directorate General for Competition of the European Commission and was issued after browser specialist Opera filed a complaint with the Commission a year ago .
Opera alleged Microsoft was continuing to abuse its dominant position by tying its browser to Windows and by not following web protocols .
Microsoft now has two months to issue a written response to the directorate general and can request a hearing .
The company said in a statement that it 's studying the statement of objections and is committed to conducting its business in full compliance with European law .
Microsoft has included IE with Windows since 1996 . ®
I used to work for an consulting firm that specialized in FDA compliance for pharma and medical device companies , and I can tell you the consultants had no faith whatsoever in the FDA approval process during this administration .
Looks like their concerns were warranted :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
In an unusually blunt letter , a group of federal scientists is complaining to the Obama transition team of widespread managerial misconduct in a division of the Food and Drug Administration .
" The purpose of this letter is to inform you that the scientific review process for medical devices at the FDA has been corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers , thereby placing the American people at risk , " said the letter , dated Wednesday and written on the agency 's Center for Devices and Radiological Health letterhead .
[...]
The FDA declined to publicly respond to the letter , but said it is working to address the concerns .
In their letter the FDA dissidents alleged that agency managers use intimidation to squelch scientific debate , leading to the approval of medical devices whose effectiveness is questionable and which may not be entirely safe .
" Managers with incompatible , discordant and irrelevant scientific and clinical expertise in devices ... have ignored serious safety and effectiveness concerns of FDA experts , " the letter said .
" Managers have ordered , intimidated and coerced FDA experts to modify scientific evaluations , conclusions and recommendations in violation of the laws , rules and regulations , and to accept clinical and technical data that is not scientifically valid . "
A copy of the letter , with the names of the scientists redacted , was provided to The Associated Press by a congressional official .
" Currently , there is an atmosphere at FDA in which the honest employee fears the dishonest employee , and not the other way around , " the scientists wrote .
This artist 's conception shows what the ancient whale ( male ) , Maiacetus inuus , may have looked like when alive about 47.5 million years ago .
More than 47 million years ago , a whale was about to give birth to her young … on land .
That 's according to skeletal remains of a pregnant cetacean whose fetus was positioned head - down as is the case for land mammals but not aquatic whales .
The teeth of the fetus were so well - developed that researchers who analyzed the fossils think the baby would have been born within days , had its mom not died .
The fossil discovery marks the first extinct whale and fetus combination known to date , shedding light on the lifestyle of ancient whales as they made the transition from land to sea during the Eocene Epoch ( between 54.8 million and 33.7 million years ago ) .
Philip Gingerich , a paleontologist at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , and his team discovered the pregnant whale remains in Pakistan in 2000 , and then in 2004 , Gingerich 's co-authors and others found the nearly complete skeleton of an adult male from the same species in those fossil beds .
The adult whales are each about 8.5 feet ( 2.6 meters ) long and weighed between 615 and 860 pounds ( 280 and 390 kg ) , though the male was slightly longer and heavier than the female .
( Gingerich is also director of the University of Michigan 's Museum of Paleontology . )
{{ video = " LS_090204_whale " title= " Surprising Whale Discovery " caption =
" Remains of a mother whale with her fetus inside were discovered . " }}
Confusing find
On the dig that ultimately yielded the pregnant whale , Gingerich and his team first spotted what looked like a line of chalk on the ground surface , which later turned out to be the teeth of the whale fetus .
" Very quickly I got into the baby 's teeth , " Gingerich told LiveScience .
" Then I kept going around it , and the ribs seemed too big for the size of the animal and they were all going the wrong way .
So I have to say I spent the whole day excavating this thing confused about what in the world was going on here . "
Soon after , Gingeric discovered another , larger , skull , and he realized the fetus was still inside its mother .
The new species , now called Maiacetus inuus , is a member of the Archaeoceti , a group of cetaceans ( an animal group that includes whales , dolphins and porpoises ) that predate modern toothed and baleen whales .
Archaeocetes had mouths full of several types of teeth , as well as nostrils near the nose tip .
Both features are seen in land mammals but not in today 's whales .
Like other archaeocetes , the newly discovered whale was equipped with four legs modified for foot - powered swimming ( sort of like climbing , or scrambling , up a steep hill but instead in water ) .
While the whales likely could support their weight on their flipper - like limbs , they probably could n't go far on land .
" They clearly were tied to the shore , " Gingerich said .
" They were living at the land - sea interface and going back and forth . "
Land delivery
The team suggests that Maiacetus fed at sea and came ashore to rest , mate and give birth .
The head - first position of the fetus matches what is found in many land animals , particularly the artiodactyls ( pigs , deer and cows ) , which are thought to have given rise to ancient whales .
Human babies also emerge head first , ideally .
Scientists speculate that a head - first orientation allows land mammals to breathe even if they get stuck in the birth canal .
That 's not the case underwater .
" If you 're born in the water you do n't want the head out away from the mother until it 's going to pop free , because you do n't want it to drown , ” Gingerich said .
In addition , tail - first delivery in modern whales and dolphins would ensure the baby is facing in the same direction as its mother who is likely swimming .
To keep mom and baby from getting separated , tail - first delivery would be optimal , Gingerich said .
The research , published in the Feb. 4 issue of the online journal PloS ONE , was funded by the Geological Survey of Pakistan , National Geographic Society , National Science Foundation and Alexander von Humboldt Foundation .
December 30 , 2008 MD5 considered harmful today Creating a rogue CA certificate Alexander Sotirov , Marc Stevens ,
Jacob Appelbaum , Arjen Lenstra , David Molnar , Dag Arne Osvik , Benne de Weger
Summary
We have identified a vulnerability in the Internet Public Key Infrastructure ( PKI ) used to issue digital certificates for secure websites .
As a proof of concept we executed a practical attack scenario and successfully created a rogue Certification Authority ( CA ) certificate trusted by all common web browsers .
This certificate allows us to impersonate any website on the Internet , including banking and e-commerce sites secured using the HTTPS protocol .
Our attack takes advantage of a weakness in the MD5 cryptographic hash function that allows the construction of different messages with the same MD5 hash .
This is known as an MD5 " collision " .
Previous work on MD5 collisions between 2004 and 2007 showed that the use of this hash function in digital signatures can lead to theoretical attack scenarios .
Our current work proves that at least one attack scenario can be exploited in practice , thus exposing the security infrastructure of the web to realistic threats .
As a result of this successfull attack , we are currently in possession of a rogue Certification Authority certificate .
This certificate will be accepted as valid and trusted by all common browsers , because it appears to be signed by one of the root CAs that browsers trust by default .
In turn , any website certificate signed by our rogue CA will be trusted as well .
If an unsuspecting user is a victim of a man - in - the - middle attack using such a certificate , they will be assured that the connection is secure through all common security indicators : a " https : / / " url in the address bar , a closed padlock and messages such as " This certificate is OK " if they chose to inspect the certificate .
This successful proof of concept shows that the certificate validation performed by browsers can be subverted and malicious attackers might be able to monitor or tamper with data sent to secure websites .
Banking and e-commerce sites are particularly at risk because of the high value of the information secured with HTTPS on those sites .
With a rogue CA certificate , attackers would be able to execute practically undetectable phishing attacks against such sites .
The infrastructure of Certification Authorities is meant to prevent exactly this type of attack .
Our work shows that known weaknesses in the MD5 hash function can be exploited in realistic attack , due to the fact that even after years of warnings about the lack of security of MD5 , some root CAs are still using this broken hash function .
The vulnerability we expose is not in the SSL protocol or the web servers and browsers that implement it , but in the Public Key Infrastructure .
This infrastructure has applications in other areas than the web , but we have not investigated all other possible attack scenarios .
So other attack scenarios beyond the web are conceivable , such as in the areas of code signing , e-mail security , and in other areas that use certificates for enabling digital signatures or public key encryption .
The rest of this document will explain our work and its implications in a fair amount of detail .
In the interest of protecting the Internet against malicious attacks using our technique , we have omitted the critical details of our sophisticated and highly optimized method for computing MD5 collisions .
A scientific paper [ SSALMOW ] about our method is available as of March 11 , 2009 , so that the affected Certification Authorities have had some time to remedy this vulnerability .
Organization Section 1 below gives an outline of our work .
To fully appreciate our result some basic knowledge is required .
Therefore in section 2 we provide some background on certificates , and in section 3 we describe the necessary details on hash functions .
Readers familiar with those topics may want to skip ( large parts of ) these sections .
Our present work can be seen as a continuation of recent work in the last few years , of which the history is briefly sketched in section 4 .
Section 5 describes our method in detail .
Readers not interested in many technical topics may want to skip ( large parts of ) this section .
The possible impact of the attack scenarios and possible countermeasures are dealt with in section 6 and section 7 respectively .
We conclude with " Frequently asked questions " in section 8 .
Presentation
This work was presented on December 30 , 2008 at the 25th Annual Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin .
The presentation was originally announced as " Making the theoretical possible .
Attacking a critical piece of Internet infrastructure " , but finally was entitled " MD5 considered harmful today : creating a rogue CA certificate " .
[ added Jan. 8 , 2009 ] Video and audio files of the 25C3 presentation in different formats are available from CCC .
Look for files with names like " 25c3-3023-en-making_the_theoretical_possible.xyz " .
Our demo at the 25c3 was based on " sslsniff " by Moxie Marlinspike .
We modified it ever so slightly to be more verbose ( and hopefully more visual as a demo ) , to randomize serial numbers ( to fix an issue with Firefox ) and to sign with a user selected hash function ( this allowed for SHA - 1 signatures in the leaf certificate ) .
Jacob Appelbaum misspoke when he said that he had written this tool at the start ; he correctly explained the tool 's origin at the end of the video .
1. Outline of the attack
Our attack scenario basically is as follows .
We request a legitimate website certificate from a commercial Certification Authority trusted by all common browsers .
Since the request is legitimate , the CA signs our certificate and returns it to us .
We have picked a CA that uses the MD5 hash function to generate the signature of the certificate , which is important because our certificate request has been crafted to result in an MD5 collision with a second certificate .
This second certificate is not a website certificate , but an intermediary CA certificate that can be used to sign arbitrary other website certificates we want to issue .
Since the MD5 hashes of both the legitimate and the rogue certificates are the same , the digital signature obtained from the commercial CA can simply be copied into our rogue CA certificate and it will remain valid .
Here is a schematic diagram and a description of how website certificates are meant to operate .
1 A Certification Authority distributes its CA root certificate ( the white one in the diagram ) via browser vendors to browsers .
These root certificates reside in a " trust list " on the user 's PC .
This means that all certificates issued by this CA will be trusted by default by the users .
2
A company that wants its website to be secured , purchases a website certificate at the CA ( the green one in the diagram ) .
This certificate is signed by the CA and guarantees the identity of the website to the users .
3
When a user wants to visit the secure website , the web browser will first ask the web server for the certificate .
If its signature can be verified with the certificate of a CA in the trust list , the website certificate will be accepted .
Then the website will be loaded into the browser , and all traffic between the browser and the website will be secured by using encryption .
And here is a similar diagram and description of how our attack scenario may be used to impersonate an existing website .
1a A legitimate website certificate is obtained from a commercial CA ( the blue one in the diagram ) .
1 b A rogue CA certificate is constructed ( the black one in the diagram ) .
It bears exactly the same signature as the website certificate .
Thus it appears as being issued by the CA , whereas in fact the CA has never even seen it .
2
Then a website certificate ( the red one in the diagram ) bearing the genuine website 's identity but another public key is created and signed by the rogue CA .
A copy of the genuine website is built , put on another web server , and equipped with the rogue website certificate .
3
When a user wants to visit the secure website , the web browser will look on the Internet for the genuine web server .
There exist " redirection attacks " , by which the communication from the browser can be redirected to the rogue website .
This rogue website presents its certificate to the user , together with the rogue CA certificate .
The signature in the rogue website certificate can be verified with the rogue CA certificate , and this rogue CA certificate in turn will be accepted by the browser , as its signature can be verified with the CA root certificate in the trust list .
The user will not notice anything .
An effective and efficient countermeasure to remediate this vulnerability is to stop using MD5 for digital signatures .
Acceptable alternatives to replace MD5 , such as SHA - 1 , are widespread or , like SHA - 2 , at least becoming rapidly available .
Fortunately most CAs have already taken such steps .
It would be best to stop using MD5 for the creation of certificates altogether , as its continued use may lead to severe security problems .
As a last resort , in the case that MD5 cannot be discontinued immediately , a CA can take simple alternative countermeasures such as randomizing the serial numbers of all newly issued certificates .
We stress that such countermeasures are mere band - aids rather than fundamental solutions .
We also recommend to be similarly careful when using SHA - 1 and to avoid its adoption in new products , as theoretically it has been shown that it suffers from similar problems as MD5 .
While the weaknesses in SHA - 1 known so far do at this moment not allow the same type of attack scenarios we have shown to be possible for MD5 , experts in the area believe that it is sufficiently likely that before long SHA - 1 suffers the same fate as MD5 .
2.1 . The need for certificates More and more the web is used for exchanging sensitive information .
Think of internet banking websites , websites that require a login password , websites on which transactions with financial value can be performed , etc .
Often the sensitivity of the information implies that it should not be exposed to unauthorized persons .
The exchange of sensitive information requires that the user of a website wants assurance that the website he or she is visiting is not a rogue web site , but is the genuine website of the organisation he or she has to do business with .
This is what certificates provide .
A certificate is a document that contains both an identity and a public key , binding them together by a digital signature .
This digital signature is created by an organisation called a Certification Authority ( CA ) .
This organisation guarantees that upon creating the digital signature it has checked the identity of the public key owner ( e.g. by verifying a passport ) and that is has checked that this public key owner is in possession of the corresponding private key .
Anybody in possession of the CA 's public key can verify the CA 's signature on the certificate .
In this way the CA guarantees that the public key in the certificate belongs to the individual whose identity is in the same certificate .
2.2. X.509 certificates
The worldwide accepted standard for digital certificates is called X.509 .
An X.509 certificate contains the following parts the " to - be- signed " part , consisting of : serial number validity period issuer name - this is the identity of the issuing CA subject name - this is the identity of the party being certified ; this can be a user ( person , organisation , website ) , another CA , or even the issuing CA itself subject public key - the public key of the party being certified " basic constraints " field , containing a bit indicating whether this is a CA certificate or a user certificate ( we will denote this by " CA = TRUE " resp .
" CA = FALSE " ) a path length field , indicating the maximum number of intermediate CAs that are allowed between the " root CA " and the end user
the " signature " part , containing a digital signature over the " to - be- signed " part ; this digital signature is produced using the issuing CA 's private key .
By the digital signature in a certificate , the CA guarantees that it has checked ( according to its policies ) that the subject identity mentioned inside the certificate is indeed the owner of the public key that is inside the same certificate , and that this public key owner also is in possession of the corresponding private key .
The signature in the certificate can be verified by anybody , by using the issuing CA 's public key .
2.3 . Certificate hierarchy X.509 certificates fit into a hierarchy of CA and end user certificates .
A signature on data can be verified by the signer 's public key .
This public key is linked to the owner 's identity by a certificate .
This link can be verified by verifying the certificate 's signature , using the public key of the issuing CA .
This CA public key can be found inside the CA certificate , one layer upwards in the hierarchy .
This CA certificate will itself be signed by a CA another layer up .
At the top of the hierarchy there is the " root certificate " , that is " self signed " , and that has to be trusted for its own sake .
Many of these self signed root certificates are installed in browsers or operating systems .
Applications using them , such as web browsers , will trust them automatically , i.e. the applications will accept the certificates as authenticated and genuine without explicitly asking the user if it should do so .
The user may be notified by small security signs such as a closed padlock symbol in the browser 's frame .
Every certificate that is in a hierarchy of which the root certificate is trusted , is also automatically trusted .
3.1 . Hash functions
The cryptographic operation that uses a private key to sign data does not deal directly with the data itself , but with a purportedly unique representation of this data , that has a predetermined fixed length , is short and therefore convenient to work with .
This can be compared to a fingerprint as a purportedly unique , short and convenient representation of a human being .
The process of creating such short representations of data is called " hashing " .
Unfortunately , because of the fixed length of the hash , there must exist pairs of different inputs that yield the same hash value .
Good hash functions , however , have the property that finding such pairs is extremely difficult , even though they are guaranteed to exist .
This is precisely where MD5 has a crucial weakness .
A " hash function " is a cryptographic function that takes as its input a bit string of any length , performs a deterministic algorithm with this input , and produces as output a bit string of fixed length .
This output is called the " hash value " or the " hash " of the input .
Other terms that can be found for " hash value " are " fingerprint " or " message digest "
If H is a hash function , m is an input bit string , and h is the output of H applied to the input m , then we write h = H ( m ) .
Some common and useful terminology : if h = H( m ) then h is called the " hash " of m , m is called a " preimage " of h ,
then for a given input m , a " second preimage " of m is a different input m' such that H( m ) = H( m ' ) ,
, a " second preimage " of is a different input such that , if m and m ' are different inputs such that H( m ) = H( m ' ) then the pair {m , m'} is called a " collision " for H .
The difference between the concepts of second preimage and collision is subtle , but crucial .
3.2 . Hash function requirements
A hash function should satisfy the following requirements : ( practicality ) computing the hash h( m ) of any input m can be done efficiently ,
) computing the hash of any input can be done efficiently , ( preimage resistance ) given h , it is hard to compute a preimage of h , i.e. it is hard to compute an m such that h = H( m ) ,
) given , it is hard to compute a preimage of , i.e. it is hard to compute an such that , ( second preimage resistance ) given m , it is hard to compute a second preimage of m , i.e. it is hard to compute an m ' such that m ≠ m ' and yet H( m ) = H( m ' ) ,
) given , it is hard to compute a second preimage of , i.e. it is hard to compute an such that and yet , ( collision resistance ) it is hard to compute a collision for H , i.e. it is hard to compute m and m ' such that m ≠ m ' and yet H( m ) = H( m ' ) .
Let us assume that we have a hash function which produces hashes with a length of k bits .
Brute force methods simply try all possible inputs in a certain range , or try a large number of random inputs , until a ( second ) preimage or a collision are found .
For ( second ) preimage resistance this requires an expected number of hash computations equal to 2 k .
For collision resistance the situation is different , due to the " birthday paradox " , reducing the number of hash computations to approximately 2k / 2 .
Cryptographers say that a hash function with hash length k provides only k/2 bits security .
A cryptographic hash function is said to be " cryptographically strong " if no better methods are known than the above mentioned brute force type methods with the mentioned complexities .
3.3 . Hash function history
In 1990 Rivest designed MD4 , a hash function with hash length 128 bits .
Collisions for MD4 were found in 1995 .
In 2005 a method for finding preimages was published .
In 1991 Rivest announced MD4's successor , MD5 , an improved design , also with hash length 128 .
In 1993 some weaknesses in its design were pointed out , but it took until 2004 before collisions were found .
Producing collisions is nowadays a matter of seconds on a PC .
The more advanced type of collisions used in our method can be produced in a matter of hours on special but commodity hardware .
In 1995 NIST proposed SHA - 1 , a hash function with hash length 160 bits .
In 2005 weaknesses in its design were found , showing that finding collisions takes essentially fewer computations than the brute force method of complexity 280 , but so far collisions have not been published .
NIST advises to replace SHA - 1 by 2010 .
From their introduction until the present day , the hash functions MD5 and SHA - 1 have been the work horses of many cryptographic systems .
The replacement of MD5 in common applications is far from completed .
The replacement of SHA - 1 has not really taken off yet .
Even if SHA - 1 would have lived up to its design objectives , its output length of 160 is too small to justify its prolonged use for more than the short term .
NIST recognized this at an early stage , and came in 2001 with the new SHA - 2 family of hash functions .
So far these have withstood all cryptanalysis .
Nevertheless NIST saw the need for mobilizing the cryptographic community to get a deeper understanding of hash function design and to come up with better hash functions for the next 10 years .
Therefore it has started an open competition for selecting the successor of SHA - 2 , dubbed for the moment SHA - 3 .
The winner of this competition is expected to be selected by 2012 , and will most probably become the de facto hashing standard for the next decade .
3.4 . The Design of MD5 MD5 uses the Merkle - Damgård iterative construction .
The input bit string is padded to a multiple of 512 bits .
The length of the unpadded bit string is incorporated in this padding .
Then the padded input bit string is divided into blocks of 512 bits each , hereafter called " input blocks " .
The core of MD5 is a compression function .
The input blocks are fed to MD5 in successive calls to the compression function , that uses each input block in updating a state of 128 bits .
This state is called IHV , which stands for " Intermediate Hash Value " .
Thus the compression function accepts as input a 128 bit state IHV and a 512 bit data block , and produces as output an updated state IHV .
The initial state is a fixed value , and the final state is the hash value .
So if we denote the input blocks by M 1 , M 2 , ... , M n ( 512 bits each ) , the initial IHV by IHV 0 ( 128 bits ) , and the compression function by CF , then the sequence of computations is IHV 0 = fixed value
IHV 1 = CF ( IHV 0 , M 1 )
IHV 2 = CF ( IHV 1 , M 2 )
IHV 3 = CF ( IHV 2 , M 3 )
:
:
:
IHV n-1 = CF ( IHV n - 2 , M n - 1 )
IHV n = CF ( IHV n - 1 , M n )
MD5 hash = IHV n
3.5 . Collisions for MD5
In 2004 Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo
Yu presented a collision for MD5 consisting of 2 input blocks , neglecting padding .
Details of the collision construction method were published at EuroCrypt 2005 in [ WY ] .
Their method works for any value of the initial IHV 0 .
In other words , their method produces on input of any 128 bit IHV 0 a pair {{M 1 , M 2 } , {M 1 ' , M 2 '}} , each consisting of two 512 bit input blocks , such that {M 1 , M 2 } ≠ {M 1 ' , M 2 '} , and IHV 0 = IHV 0 '
IHV 1 = CF ( IHV 0 , M 1 ) ≠ IHV 1 ' = CF ( IHV 0 ' , M 1 ')
IHV 2 = CF ( IHV 1 , M 2 ) = IHV 2 ' = CF ( IHV 1 ', M 2 ')
Due to the iterative structure of MD5 and to the fact that IHV 0 can have any 128 bit value , such collisions can be combined into larger inputs .
Namely , for any given prefix P and any given suffix S a pair of " collision blocks " {C , C'} can be computed such that MD5 ( P||C||S ) = MD5 ( P||C' ||S ) .
We use the term " collision block " for a specially crafted bit string that is inserted into another bit string to achieve a collision .
One collision block may consist of several input blocks , even including partial input blocks .
The collision blocks of [ WY ] consist of precisely two consecutive input blocks .
In his 2007 MSc thesis [ S ] ( see also [ SLW ] ) , Marc Stevens extended this collision construction method to so called " chosen - prefix collisions " .
This means that collisions can be found between different arbitrary initial IHV s .
His method may require more than two input blocks .
Thus , due to the iterative structure of MD5 , the chosen - prefix collision construction method is able to produce on input of any pair of chosen prefixes { P , P'} and any suffix S , a pair of collision blocks { C , C'} , such that MD5 ( P||C||S ) = MD5 ( P' | |C' ||S ) .
To be more precise , for given { P , P'} the collision blocks are constructed as follows .
First P , P ' are padded with bit strings A , A ' of any useful size and contents to achieve equal lengths of P||A and P' | |A ' .
Then , using a " birthdaying " step , bit strings B , B ' are produced such that the resulting P||A||B and P '
| |A ' | |B ' have equal length , being a multiple of 512 , and such that the resulting IHV s at this point have a prespecified structure .
This enables the construction of a pair of " near collision blocks " { NC , NC '} that gives rise to a collision .
Each near collision block will consist of a number of 512 bit input blocks .
Thus , with C = A||B||NC and C' = A ' | |B'| |NC ' , the resulting IHV s are identical .
Consequently , MD5 ( P||C ) = MD5 ( P'| |C' ) , and thus also for any suffix S it is the case that MD5 ( P||C||S ) = MD5 ( P' | |C' ||S ) .
The chosen - prefix collision construction method is feasible in practice , but of essentially higher complexity than the method using identical arbitrary initial IHV s.
However , in return one gets complete freedom in the choice of both prefixes P and P ' .
4.1 . Meaningfulness
The main problem in trying to abuse the type of collisions for MD5 that can be produced with the available methods is that one does not have sufficient control over the input blocks that are calculated to let the IHV s collide .
This means that no methods are known to obtain collision blocks with a prescribed formatting , which would be needed to make the collision blocks fit into a meaningful file .
For a number of different file types , applications of collisions and chosen - prefix collisions have been described in the literature solving the problem of meaningfulness in various ways , see e.g .
" The story of Alice and her Boss " .
We now concentrate on the applications to certificates .
4.2 . Different public keys
In 2005 Arjen Lenstra , Benne de Weger and Xiaoyun Wang [ LW ] showed how collisions of the identical initial IHV type could be built into a pair of X.509 certificates .
For an example , see " Colliding X.509 Certificates based on MD5 - collisions " .
The main idea was to hide the random - looking ( but carefully engineered ) collision blocks in the public key .
This will not raise any suspicion , not even to a careful observer who scrutinizes all bits of a certificate looking for signs of fraud , as public keys usually look perfectly like random data anyway .
It turned out to be possible to hide collision blocks inside RSA moduli while even assuring the security of the pairs of moduli as being both products of sufficiently large primes .
Thus it was shown how to produce a pair of different X.509 certificates with identical MD5 hash values of the " to - be- signed " parts , and therefore with identical CA signatures .
This is a violation of fundamental principles of the certificate infrastructure .
However , as the prefixes of the colliding inputs had to be equal , the certificates were showing identical identities , severely limiting the practical abuse potential .
4.3 . Different identities
In 2007 , due to the work of Marc Stevens [ S ] , chosen - prefix collisions for MD5 had become available .
This meant that it had become possible to choose any pair of prefixes in the certificates before the RSA moduli , and get certificates with different chosen identities and different public keys ( hiding the collision blocks ) , and with identical MD5 hash values of the " to - be- signed " parts , thus with identical CA signatures .
For an example , see " Colliding X.509 Certificates for Different Identities " .
This is already a much more interesting application .
However , a number of limitations complicate this attack when applied to real Certification Authorities .
The attacker has to choose the entire prefix before the collision generation process can begin .
This includes fields that the attacker does not directly control , such as the validity period and serial number of the signed certificate .
Succesfully predicting those fields requires significant control over the CA 's operational procedures , which was thought to be hard to achieve .
In addition , the colliding certificates in " Colliding X.509 Certificates for Different Identities " used 8192 bit RSA keys , which are not accepted by all Certification Authorities .
Nevertheless , both the collision construction method of 2005 and the much better chosen - prefix collision construction method of 2007 on certificates based on MD5 were a firm warning to the security community that MD5 should no longer be used for digital signatures in certificates .
As attacks only get better with time , it should not come as a surprise that in 2008 we were able to improve upon the previous work on colliding certificates and obtain a rogue CA certificate signed by a commercial Certification Authority .
5.1 . Introduction
In July 2008 we set out to investigate if the colliding certificates attack could be applied to a real Certification Authority .
The first step was to identify the CAs that still used MD5 .
Unfortunately it is not possible to determine the hash function a CA uses from the CA certificate .
We had to look at ( website ) certificates issued by the CAs instead .
Over the course of a week we spidered the web and collected more than 100,000 SSL certificates , of which about 30,000 were signed by CAs trusted by Firefox .
There were six CAs that had issued certificates signed with MD5 in 2008 : RapidSSL

Out of the 30,000 certificates we collected , about 9,000 were signed using MD5 , and 97 % of those were issued by RapidSSL .
It was quite surprising that so many CAs are still using MD5 , considering that MD5 has been known to be insecure since the first collisions were presented in 2004 .
Since these CAs had ignored all previous warnings by the cryptographic community , we felt that it would be appropriate to attempt a practical attack to demonstrate the risk they present to everybody using a web browser that includes their root CA certificates .
We set out to obtain a legitimate website certificate from this CA for which we would be able to predict the entire contents of the " to - be- signed " part .
This certificate would contain a specially crafted collision block in the RSA modulus , which would result in a MD5 collision with a second specially crafted certificate .
An ignorant observer , no matter how carefully the certificate is inspected , would most likely fail to notice anything suspicious about it .
Once we have obtained a valid signature from this CA , we would copy it into our second certificate .
Since the " to - be- signed " parts of both certificates have the same MD5 hash , the signature would be valid for the second certificate .
Thus the real CA , without knowing it , would provide us with a valid signature for a certificate it has never seen , and should never have signed .
The potential of this attack scenario is even greater than just obtaining a rogue certificate for a single secure website .
This is because our rogue certificate does n't have to be a website certificate , but it could be an intermediary CA certificate .
Although the certificate originally signed by the real CA has in the " basic constraints " field the flag " CA = FALSE " , indicating that this certificate cannot be used to validate other certificates in a certificate chain , our rogue certificate has the same flag set to " CA = TRUE " .
We are in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key in this rogue CA certificate .
As a result we are able to issue any number of certificates to anybody we choose , and they will be recognized as valid certificates by anybody trusting the real CA , which is all Internet users using one of the common web browsers .
5.2 . Validity period and serial number prediction
The first big challenge was to figure out a way to predict the validity period and serial numbers of the certificates issued by a Certification Authority , since these are the only two fields in the chosen prefix that the attacker does not control directly .
Predicting the validity period of the certificate turned out to be an easy task .
The system used by RapidSSL and FreeSSL for issuing certificates is fully automated and each certificate is issued exactly 6 seconds after the user clicks on the final " Ok " button to complete the purchase .
Since the timestamps in the certificate validity period field use granularity in seconds , we could easily click this button at an arbitrary time T - 6 seconds and get a certificate with a validity from time T to T + ( 1 year ) .
With full control over the validity period , we move on to solving the serial number prediction problem .
We estimated that it would take us 3 days to generate our pair of colliding certificates , which meant that we needed to predict the serial number of the certificate three days in advance .
Most of the certificates in our data set had serial numbers that looked random and thus hard to predict , but we noticed that RapidSSL and FreeSSL were using sequential serial numbers .
One can think of the sequential serial number as a remote counter .
Each certificate we purchase from the CA reveals the current value of the counter and increments it by one .
During the normal operation of the Certification Authority , the counter is incremented based on the number of the issued certificates .
Statistical analysis of the serial numbers from the 9,251 certificates in our RapidSSL data set revealed that on average this number has a pretty low variance .
In a three day period from Thursday night to Sunday night , the CA typically issues between 800 and 1000 certificates :
The anomaly with the last data point in the graph above is a result of the 100 certificates we purchased during one particular weekend at the end of September .
Without our involvement , the increment during that weekend would have been a little less than 1000 .
With this information , we decided on the following plan :
On Thursday night , we would purchase a certificate to get the current value of the serial number S. We would predict that on Sunday night ( time T ) the serial number would be a little less than S+1000 .
A few hours before time T , we would start purchasing certificates to push up the serial number closer and closer to the target number , finally getting it to S+999 about 30 seconds before time T .
If we were lucky and the CA received no other certificate request during those last 30 seconds , we would be able to send a request at time T and get our predicted serial number .
5.3 . Constructing colliding certificates
In this section a detailed description is given of the contents of the two certificates with identical signatures that we now have .
The certificate we obtained from the commercial CA will hereafter be called the " real certificate " .
Its sibling certificate is our " rogue CA certificate " , and it is a sibling in the sense that the " to - be- signed " parts of these certificates were constructed together , to constitute a collision for the MD5 hash function .
The real certificate was requested from the CA by sending it a " Certificate Signing Request " ( CSR ) .
The initial engineering task we had to do is to construct the contents of the CSR and the structure and contents of the rogue CA certificate in such a way that the resulting real certificate ( constructed by the CA ) and the rogue CA certificate ( constructed by us ) will be perfectly aligned .
The second , and much more intricate , engineering task was to predict the contents of various fields in the real certificates , and based on this , construct the contents of various other fields in both certificates , in such a way that we would be able to obtain an MD5 collision .
Complying with the X.509 standard [ HPFS ] , each of the two certificates consists of : a header of 4 bytes ,
a so called " to - be- signed " part of 927 bytes ,
a so called " signature algorithm " field of 15 bytes ,
a " signature " field of 131 bytes .
The picture below shows in great detail the alignment and most of the contents of the two certificates .
The colors green , yellow and red respectively indicate the chosen prefixes , the collision blocks and the suffixes .

5.3.1 . The real certificate and the CSR
The structure of the " to - be- signed " part of the real certificate is prescribed by the CA .
We have control over contents and length of a few fields only .
The structure is as follows : byte 0 - 3 : header byte 4 - 8 : version number ( 3 , default value ) byte 9 - 13 : serial number ( 643015 , set by CA and predicted by us ) byte 14 - 28 : signature algorithm ( " md5withRSAEncryption " , set by CA ) byte 29 - 120 : issuer Distinguished Name ( CA default value ) byte 121 - 152 : validity ( " from 3 Nov. 2008 7:52:02 to 4 Nov. 2009 7:52:02 " , set by CA and predicted by us ) byte 153 - 440 : subject Distinguished Name
( Country = " US " ,
Organisation = " i.broke.the.internet.and.all.i.got.was.this.t-shirt.phreedom.org " ,
Organisational Unit ( 3 fields set by the CA )
Common Name = " i.broke.the.internet.and.all.i.got.was.this.t-shirt.phreedom.org " ,
Country , Organisation and Common Name set by us in the CSR ) byte 441 - 734 : subject public key info :
byte 441 - 444 : header byte 445 - 459 : public key algorithm ( " RSAEncryption " , set by us in the CSR ) byte 460 - 468 : headers byte 469 - 729 : RSA modulus ( 2048 bit value , set by us in the CSR ) byte 730 - 734 : RSA public exponent ( 65537 , set by us in the CSR ) byte 735 - 926 : extensions :
byte 735 - 740 : headers byte 741 - 756 : key usage ( " digital signature , nonrepudiation , key encipherment , data encipherment " , set by CA ) byte 757 - 881 : subject key identifier , crl distribution points , authority key identifier ( uninteresting fields , set by CA ) byte 882 - 912 : extended key usage ( " server authentication , client authentication " , set by CA ) byte 913 - 926 : basic constraints ( " CA = FALSE , Path Length = None " , set by CA )
To obtain this certificate we constructed a Certificate Signing Request ( CSR ) , according to the required PKCS # 10 format .
This request contains the following data : " to - be- signed " part : version number ( 1 ) subject Country = " US " subject Common Name = " i.broke.the.internet.and.all.i.got.was.this.t-shirt.phreedom.org " ( used by the CA for the fields Organisation and Common Name ) public key algorithm ( " RSAEncryption " ) public key ( consisting of the RSA modulus and the RSA exponent )
signature algorithm ( " md5withRSAEncryption " )
signature ( 2048 bit value , computed with our private key over the " to - be- signed " part , this signature can be verified with the public key inside the request , in this way the CA can be certain that the requestor is in possession of the corresponding private key )
The requirements for the construction of the key pair for the real certificate were as follows : the modulus should be a 2048 bit value ,
as public exponent we conveniently chose 65537 , as usual ,
the corresponding private key is required to be known by us , because with it the CSR has to be signed ,
the collision blocks are hidden in the modulus .
The alignment turned out such that the 256 byte modulus starts at byte 474 .
This means that we have 38 bytes of the current 512 bit MD5 input block left .
The first 26 bytes of those were simply chosen at random .
The last 12 bytes of those were used as " birthday bits " , see below for further explanation .
Then we had three " near collision blocks " of 512 bits ( i.e. 64 bytes ) each .
The entire " collision block " thus consists of 96 + 3 x 512 = 1632 bits , i.e. 204 bytes .
At the end of the last near collision block the MD5 collision is established .
The collision block was computed by the collision finding method described below .
That means that we do not have much control over its contents , we simply have to accept the random looking data that comes out of the cluster of game consoles .
Then we have 256 - 26 - 204 = 26 bytes ( = 208 bits ) left in the modulus .
We used them to make sure that the modulus will have the form of a product of two primes , known to us , in such a way that we can also compute the corresponding private exponent .
This is done as follows .
We start with a fixed bit string B of 1840 bits ( 230 bytes , namely 38 bytes to reach alignment with MD5 input blocks , plus 3 x 64 bytes for 3 near collision blocks ) .
We now want to append another bit string S of 208 bits ( 26 bytes ) such that the resulting 2048 bit B||S represents an integer which is a reasonably secure RSA modulus , i.e. a number n=p×q with p , q prime , that withstands current factoring methods .
In order to find such S , we pick a random 224 bit integer q , and then hope that there is an integer p such that B||S represents the number n=p×q .
Then we hope that both p , q are prime .
If our hopes turn out to be false , we simply try another random value q , until we succeed .
This method seems coarse , but we do n't know how to do it better , and it works well in practice .
The reason is as follows .
The value of n we are looking for lies in the interval B×2208≤n208 .
For a given q of k bits this means that the interval from ( B / q ) ×2208 to ( ( B+1 ) / q) ×2208 should contain an integer p , and furthermore that the integers p , q both are prime .
As the width of this interval is 2208 / q , which is approximately 2208 - k , we have to try approximately 2k - 208 times before we find such an integer p lying in the proper interval , irrespective of primality .
The probability that q is prime is approximately 1 in log ( 2k ) =k×log ( 2 ) .
Next , note that p has approximately 2048 - k bits .
The probability that such a number is prime is approximately 1 in log ( 22048 - k ) =( 2048 - k ) ×log ( 2 ) .
This means that we have to generate approximately 2 k - 208 × k × ( 2048 - k ) ×( log ( 2 ) ) 2 numbers q of k bits before we can expect one hit .
In only k×( 2048 - k ) ×( log ( 2 ) ) 2 cases we have to test a k bit number for primality , and in only ( 2048 - k ) ×log ( 2 ) cases we have to test a 2048 - bit number for primality .
We chose k=224 , which turned out to be doable in practice .
The time required for computing this secure modulus was a couple of minutes only on a standard PC .
The resulting RSA modulus thus is rather unbalanced : its prime factors have 1824 and 224 bits respectively .
This is estimated to be just out of reach of current factoring methods , in particular ECM .
Note that the private key corresponding to the real certificate is used only for signing the CSR , and that the real certificate itself is used only for providing us with a valid signature .
This certificate and corresponding key pair will never be used in some real application , though such use would in principle not harm anybody .
An interesting consequence of this is that the creation of a secure RSA modulus is not necessary at all , we could have taken any number for n of which we know the factorisation , such that φ ( n ) is coprime to our public exponent 65537 .
The reason that we need the factorisation is that we need to compute the private exponent , as we have to sign the CSR .
There is even no need for n to be a product of two primes , having a prime or any kind of factorisation would also do .
Nevertheless we chose to be careful here too , and to make it a secure RSA modulus of which the private key will be kept secret as well .
An interesting point to make is that the " path length " field in the " basic constraints " field of the CA 's root certificate is not set .
The path length field is the maximum number of intermediate CA levels in the CA hierarchy that this CA will allow between its own level and the end user level .
If the CA would have set the path length to 0 , then applications checking for the path length would have rejected certificates signed by our rogue CA , as there the path length is 1 : our rogue CA is at the level between the end user certificate and the root CA certificate .
For the collision construction it is absolutely necessary that we are able to predict at bit level the entire contents of the " to - be- signed " part of the certificate up to the point where the collision block starts .
The only fields that are not either constant , or directly controlled by us are the validity period and the serial number .
However , using the techniques described in section 5.2 , we were able to predict the values of these two fields .
5.3.2 .
The rogue CA certificate
The structure of the " to - be- signed " part of the rogue CA certificate is chosen by us ( but of course within the limits of the X.509 standard ) , to facilitate the collision construction process .
Here the only field prescribed by the CA is the issuer Distinguished Name .
The structure of the rogue CA certificate is as follows : byte 0 - 3 : header byte 4 - 8 : version number ( 3 , default value ) byte 9 - 11 : serial number ( 65 , arbitrary choice ) byte 12 - 26 : signature algorithm ( " md5withRSAEncryption " , set by us in the CSR ) byte 27 - 118 : issuer Distinguished Name ( CA default value ) byte 119 - 150 : validity ( " from 31 Jul. 2004 0:00:00 to 2 Sep. 2004 0:00:00 " ) byte 153 - 212 : subject Distinguished Name
( Common Name = " MD5 Collisions Inc. ( http://www.phreedom.org/md5) " ) byte 213 - 374 : subject public key info :
byte 213 - 215 : header byte 216 - 230 : public key algorithm ( " RSAEncryption " ) byte 231 - 237 : headers byte 238 - 369 : RSA modulus ( 1024 bit value ) byte 370 - 374 : RSA public exponent ( 65537 ) byte 375 - 926 : extensions :
byte 375 - 378 : headers byte 379 - 395 : key usage ( " digital signature , nonrepudiation , certificate signing , offline CRL signing , CRL signing " ) byte 396 - 412 : basic constraints ( " CA = TRUE , Path Length = None " ) byte 413 - 476 : subject key identifier , authority key identifier ( uninteresting fields ) byte 477 - 926 : tumor ( Netscape extension )
The field that makes this certificate a " CA certificate " is the " basic constraints " fields , with the value " CA = TRUE " .
The RSA key pair , of which the public key is inside the rogue CA certificate , was generated by OpenSSL in a standard key pair generation process .
The private key is kept in a safe place and we 're not planning on releasing it publicly .
This private key is required for issuing end user certificates signed by the rogue CA , so this is quite sensitive .
To minimize this danger , the validity period of the rogue CA certificate is set to a relatively short period in the year 2004 ( the month August 2004 , when Xiaoyun Wang presented the first MD5 collision at the Crypto Conference in Santa Barbara ) .
This backdating is done on purpose .
It means that even if the private key to our rogue CA certificate falls into the wrong hands , the certificate would be rejected by all common browsers because of its expiration date , except when the system clock of the user 's computer would be set back to within this short period in 2004 .
The probability that this will happen unintentionally is negligible .
Note that the serial number we have chosen is a rather low one .
We do not know whether an actual certificate issued by this CA with this serial number was already in existence .
We took a low number because that most probably implies that a possible other certificate with that serial number has already expired a long time ago .
5.3.3 . Alignment
The bytes 0 - 473 in the real certificate ( the fields up to the modulus , and the first 5 bytes of the modulus field which are a predictable header ) are pretty much fixed by CA requirements .
Those 474 bytes form the " chosen prefix " on the real certificate 's side .
For this certificate we chose to have a 2048 bit RSA key .
The main reason for this size is the fact that we have to hide the collision block in there .
Our collision construction method enables us to make collision blocks of 1632 bits , so 2048 seems a reasonable choice .
Moreover 2048 bit RSA moduli are quite common , so no suspicion is raised .
At the side of the rogue certificate we could not use the public key modulus for hiding the collision block .
The reason for this is that we want to set the CA flag in the " basic constraints " field to the value " TRUE " , contrary to the corresponding field in the real certificate .
The problem is that this " basic constraints " field occurs after the public key , and with the type of collisions we have , we cannot allow any bit difference after the collision block .
So in the rogue CA certificate , both the public key and the extensions up to the " basic constraints " field have to be placed before the collision block starts .
To accomplish this , it was helpful that the subject Distinguished Name in the real certificate has considerable length , that can easily be stretched by choosing an appropriately sized Common Name .
At the same time we took the subject Distinguished Name in the rogue CA certificate as short as possible , to allow sufficient space for a full 1024 bit public key and the " basic constraints " field , all this to be placed in the area corresponding to the subject Distinguished Name field of the real certificate .
In this way all necessary fields belonging to the " chosen prefix " of the rogue CA certificate could be placed in the first 477 bytes of the " to - be- signed " part .
The next problem that had to be solved is that we need a field in the extensions of the rogue CA certificate in which we have to hide at least 3 × 512 + 96 = 1632 bits ( 204 bytes ) of the collision block .
This is random looking data , over which we do not have much control , as this data comes out of the collision construction method , and we do not control that enough to be able to make such a block with some real world interpretation .
And we have one more problem , as all data after the public key from the real certificate needs to be copied bitwise into the rogue CA certificate .
This data does have an interpretation relevant to the real certificate , but this interpretation most probably is not relevant , even disturbing , for the rogue CA certificate .
Together those fields have a considerable size , namely 427 bytes .
These two problems together ask for a place in the rogue CA certificate to hide 427 bytes of data in , some of which are random looking , and some of which have an interpretation that should not be shown in certificate viewers .
The solution we adopted is to define a so called " Netscape Comment " block .
This is a proprietary extension in which any data can be stored , which will be ignored by most certificate processing applications , including the major browsers .
There is a small problem here in that formally the contents of this field must be of type IA5 String , and our content is not of that form .
An ASN.1 parser that strictly follows the standard will complain about this , as happens e.g. with Peter Gutmann 's program " dumpasn1 " .
But as most application software ignores the extension anyway , the certificate with this standard violating field in it will still be accepted in practice .
It is conceivable that the 427 bytes could have been hidden in a different extension field ( there is even an X.509 certificate with a movie hidden inside ) .
The Netscape Comment extension requires a header of 23 bytes .
So the contents of the extension will start at byte 500 , and that now can become exactly the spot where the birthday bits start , in both certificates .
This explains the fact that in the real certificate , where the modulus starts at byte 474 , there are first 26 random bytes to fill up the space .
In a technical sense the " chosen prefixes " of the two certificates end at byte 499 .
The collision block starts at byte 500 .
This collision block consists , as said before , of 96 + 3 × 512 = 1632 bits = 204 bytes , so it ends at byte 703 .
So from byte 500 until byte 926 there are 427 bytes inside the rogue CA certificate that are quite meaningless to the certificate itself .
We call this big , seemingly unnecessary block of data a " tumor " .
From our point of view it 's a benign one .
We start the modulus of the public key of the real certificate at byte 474 .
As explained above , for alignment with the rogue CA certificate we need to fill up the first 26 bytes somehow , so we just chose 26 random bytes to start the modulus with .
We have to think in terms of blocks of 64 bytes , as MD5 splits up the input in 512 bit blocks .
So we now have 12 bytes left until the next 512 bit block starts with a new IHV value .
So at byte 500 of the " to - be- signed " part we have reached the stage where in the real certificate we are inside the modulus , and in the rogue CA certificate we are inside the tumor .
The MD5 collision construction method we used consists of two stages : a " birthdaying " stage and a " near collision " stage .
The birthdaying stage is meant to prepare the next difference in IHV s between the two certificates , at the border between two 512 bit blocks .
Thus we have 12 bytes , i.e. 96 bits , available for those birthday bits .
This is , due to improvements in the birthdaying procedure , more than enough .
In fact , we needed only 72 bits for our new technique of birthdaying , so of the 12 available bytes three were simply set to 0 .
Note that , by their very nature , these 72 birthday bits are completely different in both certificates , and look completely random .
These birthday bits were computed by our collision finding programs , for details see below .
Then there are three MD5 input blocks of 512 bits each , i.e. 3 × 64 bytes , byte numbers 512 to 703 .
Each of the three input blocks was constructed by our collision finding method to cancel out certain differences in the IHV s. Contrary to the birthday bits , these near collision blocks differ only in one or two bits .
At the end of the third block the difference has vanished entirely , thus constituting a collision for the MD5 compression function .
From byte 704 on the certificates are exactly , i.e. bitwise , identical .
In the real certificate we now have 26 + 12 + 3 × 64 = 230 bytes of the modulus .
The remaining 26 bytes of the modulus were computed to ensure that it's a secure RSA modulus , as explained above .
Then in the real certificate the public exponent and all " version 3 extensions " follow .
In total this required 197 bytes .
They were generated in the real certificate by the CA , and then simply copied into the tumor in the rogue CA certificate .
One of the fields in there is the " basic constraints " field , set to " CA = FALSE " .
Interestingly enough , the bytes of this field are also present in the tumor , but the certificate processing software will not recognize them as having any interpretation attached to them , as they are part of the tumor .
After the extensions in the real certificate and the tumor in the rogue CA certificate have ended , at byte 926 , the " to - be- signed " part of the certificates are finished , and the MD5 hash function can be called on these 926 byte long strings to produce the colliding value .
What finally follows inside the certificate are the " signature algorithm " field and the " signature " field .
Naturally , those fields are identical in both the certificates .
For download : binary files containing both " to - be- signed " parts : " to - be- signed " part of real certificate , binary file
" to - be- signed " part of real certificate , human - readable hexadecimal file
" to - be- signed " part of rogue CA certificate , binary file
" to - be- signed " part of rogue CA certificate , human - readable hexadecimal file
To check that the two " to - be- signed " parts collide , run an MD5 program on the binary files .
To check that the two " to - be- signed " parts differ , run e.g. a SHA - 1 program on the binary files .

.
The differences in the MD5 IHV s are depicted in the following image .
Each line represents the 128 bits of one IHV difference ( this time not the XOR difference but the difference in non-adjacent form for 32 bit words ; a black pixel stands for no difference , a blue pixel stands for a + 1 difference , an orange pixel stands for a - 1 difference ) .
It is clear that the IHV difference looks random in IHV 1 to IHV 7 , gets special in IHV 8 ( this is due to the birthdaying ) , and then gets canceled out piece by piece in the next three input blocks , so that it has completely vanished in IHV 11 .
5.3.4 . Collision construction
The chosen - prefix collision construction method is basically described in our EuroCrypt 2007 paper [ SLW ] .
However , some crucial improvements to this method have been developed that made the present application possible .
Details of those improvements have been made available in an academic paper [ SSALMOW ] .
The basic idea of the method is twofold .
In the second part of the method differential paths are constructed that are capable of eliminating special bit differences in the IHV s with certain probabilities .
This can be called a search for near collisions .
In a few consecutive " near collision blocks " thus special combinations of bit differences can be eliminated .
For each bit difference a fresh differential path has to be constructed , so it is crucial to have an automated way to produce differential paths .
The first part of the method prepares the IHV difference so that it becomes suitable for the second part .
This is simply done by a birthday search for an input pair that has an IHV difference with the proper structure .
Optimization of the trade - off between the number of birthday bits and the number of near collision blocks is another item that is discussed in the paper [ SSALMOW ] .
In the case at hand we decided to choose for 72 birthday bits and 3 near collision blocks .
The computational bottleneck is the birthday search .
To illustrate the collision construction we have made some nice pictures of bit differences in the internal states of MD5 .
The entire inputs for MD5 consist of pairs of 15 input blocks of 512 bits each .
In each compression function call the input IHV is put into an internal state of 128 bits .
The compression function performs 64 rounds , in each round updating the state , using some bits from the input block .
After the 64th round the internal state is XORed with the input IHV to produce the output IHV .
In the pictures above and to the right the differences between IHV s and the 64 internal states in between the rounds are shown .
Here each time the difference between the two input files are taken .
These differences are computed in non-adjacent form for 32 bit words .
Each line in the pictures shows the 128 bits of an IHV or an internal state difference .
In the animated picture above the first line , above the yellow division line at the top , shows the input IHV difference , the last line , below the yellow division line at the bottom , shows the output IHV difference , and the 64 lines in between the yellow division lines show the 64 internal state differences after each round .
the animation shows the processing of the 15 compression function calls one at a time .
The picture to the right shows the same data in one big row rather than animated .
Note that each output IHV is the input IHV for the next compression function call .
A single attempt for constructing a chosen - prefix collision costs about a little more than a day .
The first stage consisting of the birthday search is computationally the most expensive .
Luckily it is also very suited for the special SPU cores of the Cell Processor that the Sony PlayStation 3 uses .
We had more than 200 PS3s at our disposal , located at the " PlayStation Lab " of Arjen Lenstra 's Laboratory for Cryptologic Algorithms at EPFL , Lausanne , Switzerland ( see the picture ; acquisition of this cluster was sponsored by EPFL DIT and by a matching equipment grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation ) .
The birthdaying takes about 18 hours on the 200 PS3s using 30 GB of memory that was equally divided over the PS3s .
The second stage computes the 3 collision blocks that eliminate the IHV differences left after the first stage and costs in total about 3 to 10 hours on a high - end quadcore pc .
This part is not suited for the PS3s SPU cores due to the large memory demands and the high number of branches in the software execution flow .
Since the two stages are performed on different hardware , we were able to pipeline several attempts , so that within one weekend ( 72 hours ) we could easily perform 3 attempts ( 3 × 18 + 10 = 64 hours ) .
The total complexity of the collision construction can be estimated at 251.x MD5 compression function calls , when 30 GB of memory is available .
5.4 . Real life execution
For one single attempt to obtain a CA signature we had to guess the serial number and the validity period the CA was going to use a few days in advance .
This information is crucial to get the chosen prefix for the real certificate 's " to - be- signed " part , and this is input for the collision construction method .
Once a collision has been found , the public key modulus has to be computed .
Then the Certificate Signing Request could be composed and sent to the CA at the precise time , and then we had to wait for the CA to return a signed certificate , and see if the serial number and validity period were guessed correctly .
We performed our attemps over the weekend to take advantage of the lower load of the CA .
Each weekend we would generate from one to three collisions with serial numbers within the predicted range and purchase enough certificates to increment the serial number up to the desired value .
Unfortunately , the first three tries failed due to timing issues .
We received a couple of certificates signed only a second too late and a number of times requests by other customers of the CA interfered with our attempts to get the right serial number .
Finally , on the fourth weekend we succeeded in getting a certificate with the right serial number signed at the right time .
Each certificate we purchased from RapidSSL cost us USD 45 .
However , the CA allowed us to reissue each certificate up to 20 times for free , which meant that a single certificate request cost us only USD 2.25 .
In total , we spent USD 657 on purchasing certificates for this project .
6 . Impact A short summary of our result is that we have come in possession of a " rogue " Certification Authority whose certificate will be accepted by default by most browsers .
Thus we are able to issue SSL certificates to any website we like , including rogue websites claiming to be legitimate ones .
This has been possible by exploiting the following weaknesses : an efficient method to construct " chosen - prefix collisions " for the MD5 hash function ,
there is at least one commercial Certification Authority that : issues certificates with a signature created using the MD5 hash function , processes online requests for certificates in an automated way , does not check for anomalous requests , allows predicting with reasonable probability of success a valid combination of serial number and validity period , has no technically enforced limit on the length of a chain of certificates .
Any website , whether it is secure ( i.e. uses SSL ) or not , whether it has an MD5 - based , SHA - 1 - based , SHA - 256 - based , or any other type of certificate , irrespective of which Certification Authority issued the certificate , can be impersonated , in particular not only genuine websites that have an MD5 - based certificate are vulnerable .
The rogue Certification Authority we have has been set up for demonstration purposes only .
Its certificate has on purpose been backdated , so that it will be recognized by browsers as having expired more that 4 years ago .
Moreover the corresponding private key , needed to issue certificates with , will be kept in a safe place to prevent abuse .
Thus it is unlikely that with this particular rogue Certification Authority harm can be done .
However , we have shown that it is possible in practice , with some non-negligible but doable effort , to set up such a rogue Certification Authority .
If we can do it now , others will be capable of doing it as well in the foreseeable future .
In theory it is even conceivable that other groups or individuals already have developed similar skills and knowledge as we have , and are already able to impersonate websites at their will .
We have no indication that this is actually the case .
Because of this we believe it is important to stop using MD5 as soon as possible .
In combination with known weaknesses in the Domain Name System ( DNS ) protocol such as Kaminsky 's " DNS Flaw " [ K2 ] ( see also [ OMM ] ) , the vulnerability we exposed opens the door to virtually undetectable phishing attacks .
Without being aware of it , users can be redirected to malicious sites that appear exactly the same as the trusted banking or e-commerce websites they believe to be visiting .
User passwords and other private data can fall into wrong hands .
We do not want to help persons with criminal intent .
Therefore we will for the time being not release the full details of how we have been able to obtain the rogue Certification Authority certificate .
It should however be noted that the basic principles of constructing " chosen - prefix collisions " for MD5 were published already in May 2007 , see [ SLW ] , and the " Chosen - prefix collisions " website .
To make our present results possible these publicly known techniques have been improved at crucial points .
These improvements are published in an academic paper [ SSALMOW ] .
Apart from that , somebody who wants to redo our work has to do considerable implementation and optimization efforts .
For the time being we do not plan to release such implementation details .
Other applications than secure web communication using SSL might be vulnerable as well .
Every Certification Authority that will honor requests for MD5 - based certificates and that has sufficiently predictable serial numbers and validity periods , may be vulnerable to similar attacks .
This may include Certification Authorities in the areas of e-mail signing and encryption , software signing , non-repudiation services , etc .
We feel safe to say that the impact of our work is very limited in the sense that we think it is highly unlikely that our rogue Certification Authority can be abused by anyone ( including ourselves ! ) .
We have released sufficient detail of our methods to show that we have a realistic attack scenario .
The proof of the pudding is our colliding certificates , available for download on this website , so that everyone can verify our claims , and in the demonstration we have provided .
Our intent is to raise awareness that MD5 is broken so drastically that its continued use in digital signature schemes and certificates poses realistic threats .
Our desired impact is that Certification Authorities will stop using MD5 in issuing new certificates .
We also hope that use of MD5 in other applications will be reconsidered as well .
Proper alternatives are readily available .
6.1 . Revocation issues
One interesting observation from our work is that the rogue certificate we have created is very hard to revoke using the revocation mechanism available in common browsers .
There are two protocols for certificate revocation , CRL and OSCP .
Until Firefox 3 and IE 7 , certificate revocation was disabled by default .
Even in the latest versions , the browsers rely on the certificate to include a URL pointing to a revocation server .
Our rogue CA certificate had very limited space and it was impossible to include such a URL , which means that by default both Internet Explorer and Firefox are unable to find a revocation server to check our certificate against .
As a workaround , system admistrators can configure the browsers to always query a company - specific OSCP server for revocation information , but this option is not easily usable by individual end users .
This points out an important problem that still needs to be resolved , in case similar attacks result in certificates that need to be revoked in the future .
Another interesting scenario is that our result opens possibilities for Denial of Service attacks on existing Certification Authorities .
If an attacker wants to have somebody 's certificate revoked ( e.g. of a competing web shop ) , he can use our techniques to obtain a rogue certificate from the same Certification Authority , which has the same serial number as the target certificate .
As soon as this rogue certificate gets published , the Certification Authority has no choice but to revoke it .
Since revocation happens only on the basis of the serial number of the certificate , at the same time the legitimate certificate of the victim will be revoked .
This attack will become extremely powerful if the root certificate of the Certification Authority is targeted .
An attacker can thus force revocation of this root certificate , and with that of the entire certificate tree depending on it .
7. Countermeasures First and foremost , there is no proper excuse for continued use of a broken cryptographic primitive when sufficiently strong alternatives are readily available , for example SHA - 2 .
Secondly , there is no substitute for security awareness .
Openness about security problems , vulnerabilities and technical possibilities is invaluable to make the Internet a safer place .
Advice from experts should be taken seriously and early in the process .
In this case , MD5 should have been phased out soon after 2004 .
This being said , we continue discussing countermeasures that can be taken by different stakeholders .
Users browsing the web might be redirected to a rogue website that has obtained an erroneously trusted SSL certificate .
A user cannot do anything to prevent this from happening .
She might try to detect it , but we realize that this is somewhat cumbersome for the average web user .
The user may click on the proper button or menu item in the browser , to view details of the certificate for the website she is visiting .
The used hash function is visible in the " Signature algorithm " field , see the picture to the right , where " md5RSA " means that MD5 was used for signing the certificate .
When all certificates in the chain up to the root CA certificate use other hash functions than MD5 such as SHA - 1 , our attack has not been used .
When MD5 has been used , fraud may be detected by inspection of the certificate at bit level .
When the certificate has a " tumor " inside , this may or may not be shown in a user friendly certificate viewer .
See the picture on the left , where there is a strange " Netscape comment " field with the value 3 .
Actually this is a 427 byte field that for technical reasons cannot be shown on screen in this viewer .
An expert who can inspect the certificate with tools such as " dumpasn1 " , will be able to identify such a strange field in the certificate .
However , a standard user will likely not notice anything .
Therefore inspection of certificates is not a strong countermeasure .
Preventive countermeasures are much more powerful .
We now describe the preventive countermeasures that CAs and browser vendors can take , but users cannot .
Certification Authorities are recommended to stop using MD5 altogether .
To prevent chosen prefix attacks , they can add a sufficient amount of randomness to the certificate fields , preferably as far to the start of the certificate as possible .
The serial number is a good field to use for this , as it comes very close to the beginning of the certificate , and it allows for 20 bytes of randomness .
Many Certification
Authorities seem to use already random serial numbers , albeit probably for different reasons .
The German Signature Law prescribes random serial numbers for qualified SHA - 1 certificates ( see [ B ] ) to provide some randomness in the hash input .
We do note however that this use of randomness in the serial number is a workaround , made possible by lucky choices in the X.509 standard .
It is not a bad idea in general to add randomness to a hash input when a possible attacker is able to choose the input .
A much more reliable , since designed , solution is to use randomized hashing , see [ HK ] for a paper , and [ BS ] for an implementation in Firefox .
Such a solution introduces ramdomization as a " mode of operation " for hash functions , which is a much more fundamental approach to the problem than relying on features that happen to be present in existing standards for non-security reasons , or for no reason at all .
Other measures a Certification Authority may take are to make active use of the " pathlength " parameter in the " basic constraints " field .
When a CA has the policy of only issuing end user certificates , this policy can be enforced technically by setting the path length to 0 .
Our specific attack scenario can be detected because there is a three - level hierarchy ( see the upper picture ) .
This detection can however be avoided by a small variant of our attack scenario , where the rogue colliding certificate is not a CA certificate but a website certificate in itself ( see the lower picture ) .
We note that such a rogue colliding end user certificate may be constructed without a tumor : the collision block can then be hidden again inside the public key .
This makes detection much more difficult .
Other ways of formatting the certificate may be possible .
An interesting question is whether CAs should revoke existing certificates signed using MD5 .
One may argue that the present attack scenario has in principle been possible since May 2007 , and that therefore all certificates ( or all CA certificates ) signed with MD5 that have been issued after this date may have been compromised .
Whether they really have been compromised is not relevant .
What is relevant is that the relying party who needs to trust the certificate does not have a proper way of checking whether the certificate is to be trusted or not .
One may even argue that all older certificates based on MD5 should be revoked , as for an attacker constructing rogue certificates it is easy to backdate them to any date in the past he likes , so any MD5 - based certificate may be a forgery .
On the other hand , one may argue that the likelihood of these scenarios is quite small , and that the cost of replacing many MD5 - based certificates may be substantial , so that therefore the risks of continued use of existing MD5 - based certificates may be seen as acceptable .
Regardless , MD5 should no longer be used for new certificates .
Finally , Certification Authorities can monitor the flow of Certificate Signing Requests that they receive for abnormal series of requests , such as many requests by the same user in quick succession .
Browser and Operating System vendors such as Microsoft ( vendor of Windows and Internet Explorer ) and Mozilla ( vendor of Firefox ) can implement pop-up warnings to the users when an MD5 - based certificate is encountered .
Blocking MD5 - based certificates is also possible , but rather drastic .
Browser vendors can implement path length checking .
Furthermore , it is the browser vendors who determine which Certification Authorities are present in the trust lists inside the browsers or operating systems .
This puts them in a good position to put pressure on the Certification Authorities to adopt proper procedures and use strong cryptographic primitives .
We have contacted the mentioned browser vendors so that they are aware of the problem .
Website owners can check whether their Certification Authority has proper procedures , notably does not use unacceptable hash functions such as MD5 .
Website owners can ask their CAs to switch to more secure hash functions such as SHA - 2 .
8. Frequently asked questions Question .
Can your proof of concept rogue CA certificate be misused ?
Answer .
This is highly unlikely .
We intentionally set the expiration date of our rogue CA certificate to August 2004 .
Any certificate signed by our rogue CA will similarly be invalid after August 2004 .
This allows us to test our proof of concept certificate by setting the system date back to August 2004 , but prevents the certificate from being misused if it ever falls into the wrong hands .
If your system date is correct , your web browser will notify you that the certificate is invalid because it has expired , effectively warning you that that website should not be trusted .
The validity period of the certificate is sufficiently short to make it most unlikely that the system clock of your computer is accidentally set back to this time .
Question .
Are all digital certificates / signatures broken ?
Answer .
No .
When digital certificates and signatures are based on secure cryptographic hash functions , our work yields no reason to doubt their security .
Our result only applies when digital certificates are signed using the hash function MD5 , which is known to be broken .
With our method it is only possible to copy digital signatures based on MD5 between two specially constructed digital certificates .
It is not possible to copy digital signatures based on MD5 from digital certificates unless the certificates are specially constructed .
Even so , our result shows that MD5 is NOT suited for digital signatures .
Certification Authorities should stop using the known broken MD5 and move to the widely available , more secure alternatives , such as SHA - 2 . Question .
What is the status of collision attacks for SHA-1 ?
Answer .
As far as we know the only group seriously working on collision attacks for SHA - 1 is in Graz , Austria , see their website " SHA - 1 Collision Search " .
Status of the theory : at the Rump Session of Crypto 2007 they estimated the complexity of their attack for collisions with identical initial IHV s to be < 261 calls to the compression function .
For chosen - prefix collisions they estimated in 2006 a complexity of just below the birthday bound of 280 .
Improvements on the latter result are probably possible , but nobody has looked into this .
Status of experiments : Since mid 2007 the people in Graz are running a distributed SHA - 1 Collision Search BOINC project , aiming at finding a SHA - 1 collision with identical initial IHV s.
They estimate ( private communication ) that now ( December 2008 , so after 1.5 years ) they have covered less that 10 % of the search space .
So they need your spare cycles .
Question .
Suppose that a criminal creates by our method his own rogue Certification Authority that is trusted by all browsers .
Are then only websites with certificates from the CA whose signature he used vulnerable to impersonation attacks ?
Are only websites with certificates based on MD5 vulnerable to impersonation attacks ?
Answer .
No .
When a criminal uses redirection attacks in combination with a rogue but trusted CA certificate , all websites are equally vulnerable .
Question .
What should websites do that have digital certificates signed with MD5 ?
Answer .
Nothing at this point .
Digital certificates legitimately obtained from all CAs can be believed to be secure and trusted , even if they were signed with MD5 .
Our method required the purchase of a specially crafted digital certificate from a CA and does not affect certificates issued to any other regular website .
Question .
Where does the title " MD5 considered harmful today " of this website come from ?
Answer .
In December 2004 , shortly after MD5 collisions were found , Dan Kaminsky came with an exploit for them .
His paper is entitled " MD5 to be considered harmful someday " , see [ K1 ] .
We think this day has come .
Question .
When and where will the paper with details on the chosen - prefix collision construction method be published ?
Answer .
A paper [ SSALMOW ] on the improvements on the MD5 chosen - prefix collision construction method is available as of March 11 , 2009 .
This paper will appear in the proceedings of Crypto 2009 .
A full paper [ SLW2 ] on the MD5 chosen - prefix collision construction method is available as of June 16 , 2009 .
Question .
Will source and / or executable code of the chosen - prefix collision construction method be made public ?
Answer .
For the time being we have no such plans .
[ added June 16 , 2009 ]
But plans change , because the world changes .
Almost half a year since the major CAs have moved away from MD5 , we think it 's safe to publish code .
See Marc Stevens ' code page hashclash - Framework for MD5 Differential Path Construction and Chosen - Prefix Collisions .
Question .
How do we know that the CAs still using MD5 have n’t already been attacked by somebody else ?
Answer .
Given the time and resources we needed to construct our proof of concept and the advanced mathematics required to implement our method , it is our opinion that it is unlikely this has happened already .
However , because our proof of concept shows that it is possible , there is no 100 % guarantee .
Question .
What are the known weaknesses in DNS that you refer to in the press release ?
Answer .
The DNS spoofing vulnerability discovered by Dan Kaminsky in 2008 allows an attacker to redirect requests for any website to a web server controlled by them .
For more information , please see [ K2 ] and [ OMM ] .
The SSL protocol used for secure websites is supposed to detect this kind of attack because the attacker would not have a legitimate digital certificate for the hijacked website .
However , the MD5 collision attack we discovered allows attackers to create arbitrary trusted digital certificates and allows them to hijack any secure website on the Internet if the user ’s DNS servers are not patched against the DNS spoofing vulnerability .
Question .
How much did your proof of concept research cost ?
Answer .
It took a few months to design and implement our method , based on a lot of knowledge and skills that we have developed over the last two years .
We spent about USD 700 on purchasing test certificates from a CA .
The computations needed for our work were done on a cluster of about 200 PlayStation 3 game consoles in the cryptanalytic lab at EPFL .
Question .
Why were game consoles used ?
What other hardware is suitable ?
Answer .
Game consoles use hardware specialized for the computational needs of the detailed 3D graphics in games .
This hardware is also very suited for the basic arithmetic used in cryptographic algorithms and greatly outperforms general purpose computers on brute - force computations .
We have found that one PlayStation 3 game console is equivalent to about 40 modern single core processors .
The most computationally intensive part of our method required about 3 days of work with over 200 game consoles , which is equivalent to 32 years of computing on a typical desktop computer .
Common graphic cards have been used by some for MD5 cryptanalysis as well .
Question .
How long would it take for someone else to try and imitate you ?
Answer .
The basic theory behind our work was published in 2007 , but we have made a lot of improvements that are not yet in the literature .
We estimate that a team of highly skilled researchers and programmers who have prior experience in this area would need at least a month to duplicate our work .
Starting from scratch without prior understanding of the MD5 collision techniques would be far more challenging and would take significantly longer .
In addition to cryptographic research and development expertise , access to significant computational resources is needed .
Regardless of how long it would take to reproduce our work , MD5 should no longer be used for certificates .
[ added June 16 , 2009 ]
Since we have now released full details and code , the answer above is of historic interest only .
Question .
What is the best way to ensure that the attack scenario we developed is not possible in the future ?
Answer .
Stop using MD5 as soon as possible , and migrate to ( more ) secure cryptographic hash functions .

Latest Modification June 16 , 2011
Archaelus suggested in this post that writing a new format routine to handle named parameters may be a good learning exercise .
So , in the spirit of learning the language I wrote a formatting routine which handles named parameters .
An Example :
1 > fout : format ( " hello ~s{name} , ~p{one} , ~ p{two} , ~ p{three}~n " , [ {one , 1} , {three , 3} , {name , " Mike " } , {two , 2} ] ) .
hello Mike , 1 , 2 , 3 ok
The Benchmark :
1 > timer:tc(fout , benchmark_format_overhead , [" hello ~s{name} , ~p{one} , ~ p{two} , ~ p{three}~n " , [ {one , 1} , {name , " Mike " } , {three , 3} , {two,2} ] ,100000 ] ) .
{ 421000 , true} = 4.21 us per call
Although I suspect that much of this overhead is due to looping , as a calling the function with one loop yields a response in < 1us .
1 > timer:tc(fout , benchmark_format_overhead , [" hello ~s{name} , ~p{one} , ~ p{two} , ~ p{three}~n " , [ {one , 1} , {name , " Mike " } , {three , 3} , {two , 2} ] , 1 ] ) .
{ 1, true}
If there is a better way of benchmarking in erlang , please let me know .
The Code : ( which has been revised in accordance with Doug 's suggestion )
- module ( fout ) .
- export ( [ format/2,benchmark_format_overhead/3 ] ) . benchmark_format_overhead(_, _,0 ) -> true ; benchmark_format_overhead( OString , OList , Loops ) -> { FString , FNames}=parse_string ( OString , ONames ) , benchmark_format_overhead( OString , OList , Loops - 1 ) . format ( OString , ONames ) -> { FString , FNames}=parse_string ( OString , ONames ) , io : format ( FString , FNames ) .
parse_string ( FormatString , Names ) -> { F , N}=parse_format( FormatString ) , { F , substitute_names ( N , Names )}. parse_format( FS ) -> parse_format ( FS , " " , [ ] , " " ) . parse_format ( " " , FormatString , ParamList , " " ) -> { lists :reverse ( FormatString ) , lists : reverse ( ParamList ) } ; parse_format ( [ $ { |FS ] , FormatString , ParamList , " " ) -> parse_name ( FS , FormatString , ParamList , " " ) ; parse_format ( [ $ }|_FS ] , FormatString , _ , _ ) -> throw ( {' unmatched } found ' , lists: reverse ( FormatString ) } ) ; parse_format([ C|FS ] , FormatString , ParamList , " " ) -> parse_format( FS , [ C|FormatString ] , ParamList , " " ) .
parse_name ( [ $}|FS ] , FormatString , ParamList , ParamName ) -> parse_format( FS , FormatString , [ list_to_atom ( lists:reverse( ParamName ) ) |ParamList ] , " " ) ; parse_name ( [ $ { | _FS ] , FormatString , _, _ ) -> throw ( {' additional { found ' , lists : reverse ( FormatString ) } ) ; parse_name ([ C|FS ] , FormatString , ParamList , ParamName ) -> parse_name( FS , FormatString , ParamList , [ C|ParamName ] ) . substitute_names ( Positioned , Values ) -> lists : map ( fun ( CN ) -> case lists : keysearch ( CN,1 , Values ) of false -> throw ( {' named parameter not found ' , CN , Values} ) ; {_ , {_ , V}} -> V end end , Positioned ) .
As this was a learning exercise , I was hoping that those more experienced with erlang could give me tips on how to improve my code .
Cheers , Mike

How does a population increase its power ?
By increasing the intelligence , strength and health of its members .
r strategy : breed chaotically , frequently , and invest little in offspring ;
K strategy : breed deliberately , with partners for life , and invest a lot in the offspring .
Sluts are r strategists , e.g. nonstrategists .
Breed like an r , end up producing dumb , narcissistic , reckless children — a path to the third world .
Traditional values ( home in first world nations ! ) emphasize not only K strategies , but finding a transcendent reason to see and amplify beauty in it .
We call that love .
AMERIKA
In evolutionary terms , what is progressive in social terms is the exact opposite , and what is considered not progressive , is :
The r-strategy is characterized by a high rate of propagation .
It occurs especially with species specialized on colonizing new habitats with variable conditions or with species with strongly fluctuating population sizes .
The K - strategy , in contrast , describes a regulated , density - dependent propagation in view of the capacity limit of the habitat K .
It occurs in species living in stable habitats , where a high rate of propagation is of no advantage .
It is regarded as more progressive than the r-strategy in an evolutionary sense .
In nature , all conceivable transitions between these two extremes occur .
A given species will therefore mainly adopt one strategy , even though shares of the other strategy cannot be overlooked .
Sometimes , extern circumstances like unpredicted changes of the living conditions trigger a change from one strategy to the other .
BUH
In other words , K - strategies recognize the carrying capacity and are designed to maximize it .
r -strategies recognize only how much food there is today and attempt to saturate the population so that some survive .
Humanity ’s lack of a K - strategy , across the board , is what is responsible for ecocide through overpopulation , as well as class war .
When it is applied , on a personal or social level , results improve :
A genetic risk factor that increases the likelihood that youth will engage in substance use can be neutralized by high levels of involved and supportive parenting , according to a new University of Georgia study .
The study , published in the February issue of the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology , is the first to examine a group of youth over time to see how a genetic risk factor interacts with a childâ€™s environment to influence behavior .
â€ œWe found that involved and supportive parenting can completely override the effects of a genetic risk for substance abuse , â€ says study co-author Gene Brody , Regents Professor in the UGA College of Family and Consumer Sciences .
â€ œItâ€™s a very encouraging finding that shows the power of parenting .â€ Science Daily
Survival of the fittest does not mean whoever wins the fight wins .
That ’s too easy .
It means whoever survives , no matter how many fights , and raises a family who are in turn balanced , inclined to survive , and wise , wins .
This is why all rising populations use K- strategies , and all declining ones apply r-strategies .

Advertisement Remarkable footage of elusive narwhal has been captured .
A BBC team used aerial cameras to film the creatures during their epic summer migration , as they navigated through cracks in the melting Arctic sea ice .
They believe the footage , which forms part of the BBC Natural History Unit 's new series Nature 's Great Events , is the first of its kind .
Narwhal are sometimes called " Arctic unicorns " because of the long , spiral tusk that protrudes from their jaws .
The appendages can reach more than 2 m ( 7ft ) in length ; scientists believe males use them to attract potential mates .
' An amazing sight '
The BBC crew headed to the Arctic in June 2008 , to film the tusked animals ' summer migration .
At this time of year , temperatures begin to rise above freezing and the thick sea ice starts to melt , creating a complex network of cracks that cover the white expanse .
These animals are just so completely unreal - they are like something from mythology
Justin Anderson , BBC producer
Every year , thousands of narwhal use these narrow fissures to travel thousands of kilometres , from the south of Baffin Bay to the high Arctic fjords .
But tracking these animals down is not easy .
Justin Anderson , who produced the programme , said : " Even though they are quite large animals , the area we had to cover was enormous - the size of Scotland .
" It is like finding a needle in a haystack . " A " dive " crew , equipped with underwater cameras , spent four weeks on the ice trying to locate the mysterious whales .
But just as they caught a glimpse of them , the sea ice had become so dangerously thin that filming was forced to halt .
However , an " aerial " team arrived by helicopter to take up the mantle .
Mr Anderson explained : " It took us seven days to travel to the place where the whales had been spotted [ Lancaster Sound ] - we were stuck by possibly the worst thing you can encounter in a helicopter in the Arctic - fog .
They are following the retreat of the sea ice as they have done for thousands of years
Mads Pieter Heide - Jorgensen
" But then we got there , we ' lucked out ' ; the skies cleared and we had eight days of 24 - hour summer sunshine . "
Using a special mount , cameraman Simon Werry filmed the creatures from the helicopter , as the narwhal swam through the melt - water leads .
Mr Anderson said : " This is the first time the narwhal migration has been filmed this way .
It has been filmed from the ice , but this is the first time it has been filmed from the air .
" It was an amazing sight .
These animals are just so completely unreal - they are like something from mythology - and we were all just completely gobsmacked when we saw them . "
Thanks to their elusive nature , narwhal can prove difficult to study and there is still much to learn about these Arctic mammals .
Mads Peter Heide - Jorgensen , from the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources , said the purpose of the creatures ' summer migration remained a mystery .
He explained : " The interesting thing is that these creatures feed in the deep water in the central part of Baffin Bay during the winter .
" But when they are in the summer grounds , they hardly feed at all .
" They are following the retreat of the sea ice as they have done for thousands of years , and spending summer in front of glaciers for reasons we do not really understand . "
With such a connection to the Arctic ice , researchers are trying to establish whether narwhal will be affected by changes in the Arctic ice cover .
Dr Heide - Jorgensen has been using satellite tags , which , as well as keeping track of the whereabouts of narwhal , are also able to monitor the temperature of the waters where the whales swim .
He said : " They give us the temperature profiles in the wintering grounds and we can see the temperature of the deep areas has been increasing over the past 50 years .
" However , we can not yet see any direct effects of climate change on the narwhal . "

It became difficult for the shippers to obtain routine letters of credit at the height of financial crisis over the autumn , causing goods to pile up at ports even though there was a willing buyer at the other end .
Analysts say this problem has been resolved , but the shipping industry has since been swamped by the global trade contraction .

Steve Martin On U.S. Airways Flight 1549 ( Spoof Video )
was onlast night and shared photos and dramatic video of his hair - raising experience on Flight 1549 .
Check out the real deal here
The tongue - in - cheek bit was pure ' Martin ' and very entertaining .
Must see video below .
A lady has been assailed by a man of bronze in public , with her shameless attacker having the temerity to make light of the affair even whilst probing her intimately .
For her part , the lady seems to be concealing her distress well .
We do not hear what transpired between the two after the photograph was taken …
Not the first time we have seen statues cause mischief .
Aleksei Miller ( 1962 - ) , CEO of Gazprom
In the wake of his meeting with Aleksei Miller , the head of Gazprom , President Dmitri Medvedev said that Europeans must be made aware that Gazprom delivered gas to Ukraine at one price , but , ordinary Ukrainians had actually to pay double that price for Russian gas .
Mr Miller , the CEO of Gazprom , informed President Medvedev about the lack of progress at the talks on gas deliveries to Ukraine .
The dialogue resumed , but , it gives the impression that the Ukrainian negotiators have no mandate or no instructions on the level of 2009 prices and volumes of gas purchases .
Asked by President Medvedev if Kiev came up with any suggestions , Mr Miller emphasised that the talks are going nowhere .
The head of Gazprom stressed that the Ukraine is not prepared to sign a contract .
In his turn , Mr Medvedev directed Gazprom to cooperate with the Ukraine in the gas sector only after they sign all the necessary documents .
In this case , he noted , “ It is the only way to stop them from stealing gas ” .
He also emphasised , “ Unfortunately , I do not trust the Ukrainian side ” , and explained it by saying , “ I would like to remind you that when we delivered gas to Ukrainian users at 179.50 dollars ( 5,232 roubles .
133.35 euros. 118.30 UK pounds ) per 1,000 cubic metres last year , that same gas was sold to them at the price of 320 dollars ( 9,327 roubles .
237.72 euros. 210.91 UK pounds ) per 1,000 cubic metres .
The difference was pocketed by unknown parties , which , most probably , uphold the corrupt interests of others , and the money realised in such a way , in all probability , was used to attain certain political ends or to resolve someone ’s personal problems .
This is very upsetting .
Our European colleagues should know about this ” .
Bearing this in mind , and recalling the fact that the Ukraine rejected Russia ’s previous proposal of a privileged gas price , Mr Medvedev declared that , in future , Russia would give no more preferences or gas discounts .
He said , “ The financial model for any future contract , which we shall use for all customers , should be based on universal regulators , including the fixing of prices .
Therefore , in future , I believe , we should make use of no preferences ; we should give no discounts to any states .
The price should be the standard one , the same for Europeans and Ukrainians , without any preferences or discounts .
Ukrainians should pay the price the Europeans are paying ” .
At present , the price of Russian natural gas in Europe is approximately 450 dollars ( 13,116 roubles .
334 euros. 296 UK pounds ) per 1,000 cubic meters .
This is the specific price currently being negotiated by Gazprom at talks with the Ukraine .

Editor ’s Note :
As Alice said , things do get curiouser and curiouser .
It appears that the Ukie nationalist extremists have beaten the record for bald - faced corruption , edging out such strong competitors as Boss Tweed , Dick Daley , Yassir Arafat , King Saud , and Robert Mugabe ( reflect on the fact that Yushchenko ’s wife comes from Chicago , the home of the Daley Machine ) .
They negotiated a discount price from Gazprom , and then stuck the Big Green Weenie to the peoples of the Ukraine .
Whenever you hear a loudmouth Galician Uniate nationalist shouting out their diatribes , reflect on the following .
Since 1991 , Russia has been selling not only natural gas , but other goods and services , to the Ukraine at knockdown discount prices .
Where ’s the gratitude ?
THERE ISN ’T ANY .
If it were not for this effectual subsidy by Russia , the Ukrainian economy would have collapsed in ruins .
In short , Russia has propped up this shaky and dodgy edifice .
It is time for that to stop .
The leadership of the Ukraine is comparable only to Enron , WorldCom , and Bernie Madoff in the depth of its corruption and deceit .
Let this weak successor - state die naturally .
The world will be no poorer ; indeed , the suffering peoples of the Ukraine would be freed from misrule and kleptocracy .
As for Yushchenko and his cronies … let them come to the West and sponge off their American sponsors instead of the Russians .
I wonder how long it would take for them to wear out their welcome ?

Adalah - NY : The Coalition for Justice in the Middle EastMedia Contact : info [ at ] adalahny.org Stars ’ Photos Removed from Leviev Website as Celebs Seek Distance from Rights AbuserAfter letters from Adalah - NY to Eight Stars , Leviev Removes Celebrity Photos ( for release with hyperlinks : http://adalahny.org/index.php/press-releases/268-celebrity-phote-leviev-website-removed
New York , NY , December 19 , 2008 – Following complaints by at least four major Hollywood stars whose photos were posted on Israel diamond mogul Lev Leviev ’s website , Leviev staff removed the entire celebrity photo section from his website http://www.leviev.com this week .
The photos ’ removal came after Adalah - NY and Jews Against the Occupation - NYC sent letters to and spoke with representatives for Salma Hayek , Halle Berry , Drew Barrymore , Brooke Shields , Andie MacDowell , Lucy Liu , Whitney Houston and Sharon Stone , all of whose names and photos , apparently wearing Leviev jewelry , were featured in a Celebrity section of Leviev ’s website .
After learning of Leviev ’s involvement in rights abuses in Palestine and Southern Africa , representatives of four of the stars told Adalah - NY that they had contacted Leviev to have the stars ’ photos removed .
Subsequently , on Monday , December 15th , Leviev staff removed the entire Celebrity photo section of the website .
Back in October , Oxfam Ambassador Kristin Davis ’ photo was removed from Leviev ’s website .
Ethan Heitner from Adalah - NY explained , “ We are gratified that these stars have joined UNICEF , Oxfam and a growing list of others who have distanced themselves from Leviev over his companies ’ settlement construction in violation of international law in Palestine , and rights abuses in Angola and Namibia .
Some immediately expressed concern when we explained that Leviev was using their photos to whitewash his unethical business practices .
Their actions show that Leviev ’s wealth and diamonds ca n’t buy impunity . ” From December 1st – 15th , Adalah - NY sent letters to and spoke with representatives of eight of the sixteen stars whose photos were featured on http://www.leviev.com
- Salma Hayek , Halle Berry , Drew Barrymore , Brooke Shields , Andie MacDowell , Lucy Liu , Whitney Houston and Sharon Stone ( December 8th screengrabs of their photos on the Leviev website are available on request by emailing info [ at ] adalahny.org ) .
Adalah - NY had not yet been able to contact the other celebrities on the site – HRH Princess Michael of Kent , Ginnifer Goodwin , Katharine McPhee , Teri Hatcher , Lauren Graham , Estelle Lefebure , Zara and Dita Von Teese – before all the photos were removed .
In addition to UNICEF and Oxfam ’s renunciation of Leviev over rights abuses , Leviev was also dropped from the sponsor list of the star - studded Carousel of Hope Ball last October .
On top of his companies ’ construction of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land in the Occupied West Bank in violation of international law , Leviev ’s companies have been accused of human rights abuses in the diamond trade in Angola and Namibia .
In December , the Israeli financial journal Globes published an expose of Leviev ’s serious rights abuses and failure to fully comply with the Kimberley process in Angola ( English translation ) .
Signaling growing outrage at Leviev ’s businesses ’ global rights abuses , on December 12th and 13th human rights advocates in Dubai , London and two West Bank Palestinian villages held protests against his settlement construction .
According to Gulf News , the December 12th Dubai protest , unprecedented in the UAE , focused on Leviev ’s sale of his diamonds through Arif Bin Khadra ’s Levant jewelry stores in Dubai , despite a commitment by a Dubai official to ban the sale of Leviev ’s jewelry .
In London , on December 13th , rights activists protested outside Leviev ’s Bond Street store .
The British government is under pressure not to rent space for its new Tel Aviv embassy from Leviev .
On December 12th in the West Bank , the villages of Bil’in and Jayyous protested the construction by Leviev ’s companies of settlements and the construction of Israel ’s wall on those villages ’ land .
Both Bil’in and Jayyous have been devastated by Israel ’s seizure of at least half the villages ’ agricultural land for settlement construction , despite hundreds of nonviolent protests .
Adalah - NY will hold yet another protest on Saturday , December 20th at 1:00 PM at Leviev ’s Madison Avenue store , with participants singing parody holiday carols highlighting Leviev ’s rights abuses .
Hey ladies , are you sick of air drying your bras and having it take forever ?
Me too !
That 's why I totally love this BraDryer concept , which is specially designed for drying off your support garments .

The great thing about the Bra Dryer is how unambiguously designed it is .
No one will have any doubts about what this thing is for when they find a pair of wire mesh breasts sitting in your laundry room .
And I like to think that if you run out of Bras to dry , you can just use it as a boob - shaped heat fan .
One question : what if your boobs are bigger or smaller than the shapes of the dryer ?
Will that warp your delicates ?
Oh , the questions I have about this thing .

South Africans will now need to provide fingerprints to enter the UK
South Africans visiting the United Kingdom will need a visa , under new rules issued by the Home Office .
Bolivia , Lesotho , Swaziland and Venezuela also failed a test of the threat posed by their citizens in terms of security , immigration and crime .
Nationals from the five countries will now need to provide fingerprints and pay a fee to obtain a visa before travelling to the UK .
The South African government said it respected the Home Office 's decision .
In 2007 , 419,000 people legally visited the UK from South Africa , including 168,000 tourists and 46,200 business visitors , while nearly 3,000 were given work permits .
They are the fifth largest group of non-EU visitors to Britain behind citizens of the US , Australia , Canada and Japan .
But a government review of visas has resulted in the five countries being added to a list that already covers three quarters of the world 's population , all of whom must apply for visas before travelling .
Fingerprint visas
" The government said it would get tough and we meant it , " said immigration minister Phil Woolas .
" Fingerprint visas make up one part of Britain 's triple ring of security , alongside high - tech watch - list checks at the border and ID cards for foreign nationals . "
First - time visitors to the UK from South Africa will need to apply for visas from 3 March 2009 , with the full visa regime coming into effect by mid-2009 , the government said .
Visitor visas lasting up to six months will cost £ 65 , and work visas £ 205 .
Six months ago South Africa and 10 other countries were warned to improve their passport security systems or face tougher visa requirements .
Six of these - Botswana , Brazil , Malaysia , Mauritius , Namibia , and Trinidad and Tobago - were adjudged to have improved sufficiently to escape the new rules .
Vitamin D is quickly becoming the " it " nutrient with health benefits for diseases , including cancer , osteoporosis , heart disease and now diabetes .
A recent review article published by researchers from Loyola University Chicago Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing concluded that adequate intake of vitamin D may prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and reduce complications for those who have already been diagnosed .
These findings appeared in the latest issue of Diabetes Educator .
" Vitamin D has widespread benefits for our health and certain chronic diseases in particular , " said Sue Penckofer , Ph.D. , R.N. , study co-author and professor , Loyola University Chicago Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing .
" This article further substantiates the role of this nutrient in the prevention and management of glucose intolerance and diabetes . "
Many of the 23 million Americans with diabetes have low vitamin D levels .
Evidence suggests that vitamin D plays an integral role in insulin sensitivity and secretion .
Vitamin D deficiency results in part from poor nutrition , which is one of the most challenging issues for people with diabetes .
Another culprit is reduced exposure to sunlight , which is common during cold weather months when days are shorter and more time is spent indoors .
One study examined for this review article evaluated 3,000 people with type 1 diabetes and found a decreased risk in disease for people who took vitamin D supplements .
Observational studies of people with type 2 diabetes also revealed that supplementation may be important in the prevention of this disease .
" Management of vitamin D deficiency may be a simple and cost - effective method to improve blood sugar control and prevent the serious complications associated with diabetes , " said Joanne Kouba , Ph.D. , R.D. , L.D.N. , study co-author and clinical assistant professor of dietetics , Loyola University Chicago Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing .
Diet alone may not be sufficient to manage vitamin D levels .
A combination of adequate dietary intake of vitamin D , exposure to sunlight , and treatment with vitamin D2 or D3 supplements can decrease the risk of diabetes and related health concerns .
The preferred range in the body is 30 - 60 ng / mL of 25 ( OH ) vitamin D .
" People at risk for diabetes should be screened for low vitamin D levels , " said Mary Ann Emanuele , M.D. , F.A.C.P. , study co-author and professor of medicine , division of endocrinology and metabolism , Loyola University Health System .
" This will allow health care professionals to identify a nutrient deficiency early on and intervene to improve the long term health of these individuals . "
Vitamin D deficiency also may be associated with hyperglycemia , insulin resistance , hypertension and heart disease .
In fact , Penckofer recently published another study in Circulation that reported on the role of chronic vitamin D deficiency in heart disease .
The Circulation study authors included Glen W. Sizemore , MD , emeritus professor of Medicine , Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism , Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine , and Diane E. Wallis , MD , Midwest Heart Specialists , Downers Grove , Ill .
A few years ago , credit card companies were throwing money at people to get them to sign up .
Now , as they struggle to contend with a wave of defaults , they may pay you to leave .
At least that 's the case with American Express , which is offering some card members $ 300 to pay off their remaining balance and close their accounts .

The Z3 by Konrad Zuse was the world ’s first working digital Turing - complete computer .
It did floating point arithmetic , had two registers accessible to the programmer , was microcoded , and clocked at about 5 Hz .
The original Z3 was destroyed in the second world war .
The Deutsches Museum in Munich has the only working replica , built by Zuse in the 1960s .
Here is a video of a demonstration of the Z3 , including a lot of biographical information on Zuse .
If you speak German , you will be blown away by the wit of the presenter ; if you do n’t , enjoy the clicking relays !
Zuse Apparatebau : Er kriegte sogar noch drei ArbeitskrĂ¤fte .
Das waren die , die sonst keiner mehr haben wollte .
Die Zuse - Firma bestand aus ihm selber , der Chef , dann ein vorbestrafter Buchhalter , ein blinder Mathelehrer – der hat die Filme gelocht … ja , der hat das Tag und Nacht gemacht – das war dem auch wurscht , ob ’s Tag oder Nacht war .
Und dann kam noch ein Konstrukteur aus einer Nervenheilanstalt .
Was sehen wir an der Story ?
In der Branche waren immer schon die abgefahrensten Typen !
It was good to see the president , ordinarily so cool , so accommodating , exhibiting some real fire the other night .
It seems to have done some good .
With the economy in deep , deep trouble , and Americans suffering by the tens of millions , the Republicans spent much of the week doing their same - old , bad - faith Neanderthal two - step : trying their best to derail the economic stimulus package working its difficult way through Congress .
“ This bill is stinking up the place , ” said Lindsey Graham , a Republican senator from South Carolina who not only opposed the legislation but wanted to make sure that no one would mistake him for a class act .
One of the goals of the package , of course , is to begin cleaning up the holy mess that resulted from the long , dark night of G.O.P. control in Washington .
President Obama went out of his way to get a substantial number of Republicans to make a genuine effort to move the economic revitalization process along , but was rebuffed , and in some cases contemptuously .
If roses wo n't do the trick , try Saint Raphael suggests the Catholic Church Britain 's Roman Catholic Church is advising lovelorn singles to direct their 14 February requests for love to St Raphael , rather than St Valentine .
Over the years
St Valentine has come incorrectly to be associated with finding love , the Church says .
He is the patron saint for those who have already found their soulmate .
St Raphael is the patron saint for happy encounters and it is to him those fearing the Valentine 's post should properly direct their prayers .
Divine intervention Clare Ward , spokeswoman for the Catholic Enquiry Office , the official body providing information on Catholic life , said that while the distinction between the saints has always been clear within the Church it has , over the years , been blurred outside .
" Saint Valentine passed a note to his jailer 's daughter , whose sight he is thought to have cured , " she said .
" The note had no romantic content , but it 's from this story that the tradition of sending notes of appreciation has come from .
Why not come along to a prayer group it could be your lucky night
Clare Ward ,
Catholic Enquiry Office
" If tomorrow you are still looking for your soul mate , the actual patron saint is St Raphael .
" He 's the person you should dedicate your day or pray to if you are looking for Mr or Mrs right . "
St Raphael , according to legend , helped Tobias enter into marriage with Sarah , who had seen seven previous bridegrooms perish on the eve of their weddings .
It is he within the canon of Catholic saints who is properly associated with helping to forge partnerships .
The oldest known Valentine 's message , dating from 1477 St Valentine is said to have been martyred in Rome in 269 .
While his exact history is unclear , Valentine is thought to have existed as archaeologists have unearthed an early church dedicated to someone of that name .
One theory is that he was a priest in Rome who continued to marry Christian couples in defiance of the law of the day .
On the eve of his execution , he is said to have signed a note to his jailer 's daughter : " From your Valentine . "
Spiritual networks
Those hoping for divine intervention to help their love lives may well appreciate the correction in target for their prayers , but Miss Ward also had some more advice .
" There is a lot of evidence to suggest that young people who have tapped into prayer groups have found partners , " she said .
" Those who have exhausted traditional routes like online dating should try spiritual networks .
" Why not come along to a prayer group - it could be your lucky night . "

Ben Blank , who as graphics director for CBS and later ABC television news introduced the concept of using logolike images behind anchors as signatures for major news coverage , died on Feb.
3 at his home in Teaneck , N.J. He was 87 .
The cause was complications of a stroke suffered three years ago , said his daughter Karen Blank .
Mr. Blank invented novel ways of presenting on - air visual information , illustration and symbols , and in so doing helped transform the appearance and content of network evening news .
“ He was , indeed , a pioneer of television graphics at a time when his artistry and genius were all we had to demonstrate a complicated story , ” the former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite said in an e-mail message reported on NorthJersey.com .

For most of the 1950s , television news broadcasts , in black and white , were visually austere .
Anchors sat at small desks with a simple clock or map hanging on the wall behind them ; often the name of a sponsor was displayed in front .
Mr. Blank , a cartoonist for four years in the Air Force who was hired by CBS as a graphic designer in 1953 , believed that to pique and retain the viewer ’s interest , it was necessary to provide a visual mnemonic that would serve as a logo for the story .
This was especially useful when a photograph or film was difficult to obtain on deadline .
The image , known in TV news - speak as the “ over - the - shoulder ” graphic , could be repeated as needed to show narrative continuity from day to day .
Mr. Blank also called it the “ think - quick visual . ”
House M.D. or House for short is a medical drama that ’s in its fifth season on the FOX TV network .
Gregory House , M.D. is a medical diagnostician who is recognized as an observational genius with the ability to see patterns in small things .
Not only is he smart , but he ’s a maverick who will do the unthinkable to solve medical puzzles in order to save lives .
The shows ’ episodes usually follow the repetitive pattern of his medical team drawing up sickness possibilities based on the patient ’s symptoms and running tests on each theory , all the while making the patient even more sick , until the problem is solved .
Most of the time , the patients survive , but sometimes , they die .
Then there ’s a bit of personal drama thrown in - between the tests that keeps the show growing and the audience hungry for each new episode .
While the episodes ’ outcome may be predictable , the girls playing on House keep you interested and engaged .
Dr. Lisa Cuddy ( played by Lisa Edelstein ) is the Dean of Medicine , hospital administrator at Princeton - Plainsboro Teaching Hospital , and specializes in endocrinology .
She often has to handle House ’s outlandish requests and is usually left to deal with the consequences of his erratic behavior .
One of her tasks is to force House to complete his required weekly duty at the free outpatient clinic .
Her position often requires her to make extremely difficult moral and ethical decisions regarding patient care ( particularly in situations where House insists that highly dangerous and often illegal procedures are a patient ’s only chance of survival ) .
Watch Dr. Lisa Cuddy perform a striptease for House ( in his imagination ) .
Dr. Allison Cameron ( played by Jennifer Morrison ) was hired six months prior to the pilot episode .
House explicitly informed her that he hired her based on her looks because he believed that a pretty girl who went into medicine shows greater dedication compared to an ordinary - looking student because the former could have easily used her looks to get an easier job .
Prior to working at PPTH , Cameron was a medical intern at the Mayo Clinic , and was one of the top students in her class in medical school .
Cameron is known for her honesty , sincerity , idealism and possesses a strong moral and ethical center .
Cameron is occasionally hesitant and unwilling to perform
House ’s bidding when she is required to deceive their patients and has gone to head - to - head with him before several times on the issue .
She has been effective in gaining patients ’ trust and approval of diagnostic procedures when the need arises , in contrast to House ’s strong - arm methods .
Watch a scene where Cameron says it ’s sexy time !
Dr. Remy Hadley ( played by Olivia Wilde ) or referred to as “ Thirteen , ” is one of many doctors temporarily hired by House with the intention of gradually screening them out .
She is called Thirteen because all the candidates were originally given numbers .
Thirteen was hired after she got distracted and failed to give the patient his pills , resulting in both his death and the death of his service dog , who ate the pills off the floor .
House fired the other candidates , but kept her , arguing that she would never make such a mistake again .
Thirteen suffers from an inner struggle in dealing with the fact that she has an incurable disease ; Huntington ’s Disease .
Olivia
Wilde is also mentioned in our article : television stars who are destined for bigger things .
See a bi-sexual scene involving Dr. Hadley .
Go watch some House or buy the DVDs and catch up on all you ’ve missed from Season 1 , Season 2 , Season 3 , and Season 4 .
Take a look at this correction from today ’s Contra Costa Times , which serves parts of the San Francisco East Bay .
It ’s tucked in the bottom right corner of page A15 , along with a black & white photo the size of a postage stamp .
( The online version does not include the photo . )
“ A photo of this mushroom on the cover of Wednesday ’s Food section was incorrectly identified as a giant morel .
It ’s actually either a death cap or a death cap look - a- like , a mushroom ethical foragers never harvest due to the danger of confusion .
These mushrooms grow all over Bay Area hills and are responsible for 95 percent of wild mushroom - related deaths . ”
Oops .
Every year around this time Bay Area newspapers report on folks who find and eat some delicious mushrooms , only to end up in fulminant liver failure .
If they ’re lucky they get an emergency liver transplant .
If not , they die .
I just hope that everyone who has started scouring the hills for tasty morels on the basis of the large color photo on the cover of Wednesday ’s food section also happens to see that tiny correction on page A15 .

A small - town Massachusetts police chief who authorities say promoted , organized and profited from a firearms exposition where children were encouraged to shoot machine guns and where an 8 - year - old killed himself with a Micro Uzi was charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter .
Although the event was promoted as an opportunity for children to fire machine guns under the supervision of certified instructors , 8 - year - old Christopher Bizilj had been supervised by a 15 - year - old boy who was “ knowledgeable about guns ” but not certified as a firearms instructor , Hampden County District Attorney William M. Bennett said in outlining charges against Pelham Police Chief Edward B. Fleury and two others .
The Oct. 26 death at the Machine Gun Shoot and Firearms Expo at the Westfield Sportsman ’s Club horrified the region and provoked outcry from parents , lawmakers and some gun enthusiasts who condemned it as a senseless tragedy .
In the event , the 8 - year - old ’s father , Dr. Charles Bizilj , stood 10 - feet behind his son while the boy aimed at a pumpkin with an automatic weapon that fires 1,700 rounds a minute and is notoriously difficult to handle .
When Christopher squeezed the trigger , the gun jerked out of control and fired a bullet into the right side of his head .
Thursday ’s indictment was authorities ’ attempt to assess responsibility for the death .
Bennett said the boy ’s father had taken Christopher to the gun show and chose the Micro Uzi for him to fire but would not be charged .
“ He is already being punished and will continue to be punished ” in mourning Christopher ’s death for the rest of his life , Bennett said .
Fleury , Pelham ’s police chief of 22 years , was singled out as the central force behind the expo .
He organized it through a business he ran , COP Firearms & Training , and marketed it in advertisements that said the $ 5 entry fee was waived for children under age 16 and that there was “ no age limit or licenses required to shoot machine guns . ”
Bennett said Fleury took a portion of the proceeds from the event .
He was charged with involuntary manslaughter , which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison .
Some rights groups say images from the conflict prove the illegal use of phosphorus
Israel insists its use of white phosphorus shells during its three - week campaign in Gaza was not illegal .
Foreign ministry spokesman Ygal Palmor said an internal investigation so far had found no evidence to support claims it was illegally fired near civilians .
White phosphorus is legal for making smokescreens in open battleground .
But rights groups and journalists say it was used in crowded civilian areas .
The weapon sticks to human skin and will burn through to the bone .
It can cause death or leave survivors with painful wounds which are slow to heal .
Its ingestion or inhalation can also be fatal .
Army investigation
The UN said its headquarters were hit by three white phosphorus shells during the offensive , causing a fire destroying much of its aid supplies .
Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and foreign journalists who have gone into Gaza since the operation ended say they have found evidence of its use in crowded residential areas .
The Israeli army said on Wednesday it would investigate the allegations .
But Mr Palmor told the BBC that the probe had so far found no evidence to support the claims .
" Parts of the Gaza Strip are open battlefield and I 'm not going to go into the specific circumstances of each and every incident because I have n't investigated and neither have you , " he said .
The government fears the ruling could set a worrying legal precedent A French court of appeal has overruled the decision to annul the marriage of two Muslims because the bride had lied about being a virgin .
They are now effectively married again - even though both partners said they accepted the original judgement .
That verdict had caused emotional debate and outrage among some feminists , who said it amounted to a " fatwa " against women 's liberty .
But the husband 's lawyers said the case had nothing to do with religion .
They argued that the wife had breached the wedding contract , and tricked her husband into marriage .
Under the French civil code , a marriage can be annulled if a spouse has lied about an " essential quality " of the relationship .
' Kandahar - style '
According to media reports , the husband , an engineer in his thirties , married the trainee nurse in the summer of 2006 , having been assured by her that she had never previously had a boyfriend .
The woman admitted having lied about being a virgin , and later accepted the court annulment .
Her lawyer said she did not want to contest the judgement , and simply wanted to get on with her life .
But Justice Minister Rachida Dati ordered a review of the verdict , which was referred to in some quarters as " a real fatwa against the emancipation of women " and " a ruling handed down in Kandahar " .
Feminists argued the decision was unfair because a woman would not be able to cancel her marriage if she thought her husband was not a virgin .
Critics have also asked if the judge would have ruled the same way if the marriage was not between two Muslims , and claimed the decision was incompatible with France 's secular principles .

One of Rasputin 's neighbours was much questioned about him by an unknown woman , who asked to be allowed to spend the night in her house .
Natalia , however , would not give her permission and told Rasputin about the episode the next morning ...

At eight o'clock in the evening Rasputin left his house , very red in the face , apparently in a slightly inebriated condition , in the company of Solovieva .

They came backin an hour 's time , Rasputin looking very pale .
11 July .
The wife of an officer , Patoushinskaia , came from Yaloutorovsk to see Rasputin .

Rasputin , accompanied by Dobrovolsky and the latter 's wife , paid a visit to Arapov .
He left his host 's house in a drunken condition and immediately repaired to the psalmreader 's wife .
On his return home at 5.40 in the afternoon he once more set out in spite of Dounia 's endeavours to prevent him ...
He rudely pushed her aside , telling her " to go to the devil , " and , drunk as he was , splashed through the mud without picking his way .
While walking along with the agents he discoursed on the war : " Last year , when I was lying in hospital , rumours were beginning to spread of the coming war ; I begged the Tsar not to fight .
I sent him about twenty telegrams of warning , one a very earnest one , for which I was told I was to be brought up for trial .
When , however , the Tsar was informed of this , he said Our domestic affairs are not subject to the law . "
He discussed also the newly - ordained priest , Father Sergey .
The topic was brought up by a chance remark about the religious procession and the Te Deum with the Blessing of the Waters , which had been arranged for the 20th of July and for the purpose of which four buckets of water had been , put ready .
On seeing the four buckets of water , the priest declared that he would not read four Te Deums , one for each bucket .
A few daring spirits among the congregation suggested that one Te Deum would suffice for the four buckets .
When the service was over , Father Sergey would not allow the parishioners to kiss the cross , saying that they could do so after mass .
This arbitrary treatment roused the people 's indignation , and the priest was finally compelled to concede their rights .
It seems that Father Sergey is very imperfectly acquainted with the rites of the church ; there is even a rumour that he comes from a Moscow family of merchants and is a nominee of Skvortzov , the editor ofthe magazine Kolokol [ The Bell ] .
In conclusion Rasputin said : " I do n't know what to do with Father Sergey . "

They both disappeared into the darkness .

The watch observed them near the house half an hour later .

During the journey he made the acquaintance of three unknown ladies , who left the train at Kamyshlov .
They were met by some staff officers , to whom the ladies pointed out Rasputin .
In their conversation they mentioned Gouseva 's attempt on Rasputin and said something about a hospital .
Having heard the ladies out , a Lieutenant - Colonel who was present turned to another field officer with the words " You see if they had gone with him a little further , the mother would have lost the daughter or vice versa .
There is no denying the fact that this individual has hypnotic powers . "
Before reaching the station at Boui , Rasputin came over to the carriage occupied by the agents who were travelling with him , and began to talk about the war .
In his opinion it was progressing very unfavourably and a drastic change was imminent at Petrograd .
" Soloviev has been subjected to a very disagreeable reprimand from Samarin for meeting me at Petrograd on the 31st of July .
But Samarin will not be Chief Procurator of the Synod for much longer . "
While speaking , Rasputin was staring hard at thea gents , and then suddenly asked : " Was it you who reported against Soloviev ? "
The agents replied : " That is not part of our business . "
" Then who could have done it ?
The Emperor questioned me in connection with this denunciation and suggested that detectives might have reported against Soloviev .
I said to him ' I do not know ; perhaps it was done by detectives . '
I am going home now , I do not know myself for how long ; perhaps for a week , perhaps for longer ; it all depends . "
He finished by saying that he had been to the palace twice and that the Emperor had offered him a private carriage but that he " had refused " " Once , when I was returning from Tsarskoe - Selo to Petrograd about midnight , I saw a detective hiding from me behind a lift .
' I felt quite sorry for him ; if I had succeeded in discovering his name , it would have gone badly with him .
" 9 August .
At Tiumen , Rasputin paid Martian a call and later went to the landing - stage , where he booked a private cabin and embarked for Pokrovskoe at eleven o'clock .
Two hours afterwards he emerged from his cabin , drunk , and joined some soldiers who were on board on their way from Tiumen to Tobolsk .
( They were privates ofthe local company of the Convoy , numbering about ten men . )
He entered into conversation with them , gave them a present of twenty - five roubles and ordered them to singto him .
After having listened for a little while , he retired to his cabin , whence he emerged once more , bringing the soldiers another 100 roubles .
The singing became louder .
This time Rasputin joined in the chorus .
At the end of an hour Rasputin took the whole lot of the soldiers into the 2nd class saloon , intending to treat them to a dinner , but the captain of the ship would not allow the lower ranks to stay in the 2nd - class apartments and ordered them out .
A little while later Rasputin joined the soldiers again , arranged them in a circle and , placing himself in the middle , conducted their singing with a great display of hilarity .
Having given them another twenty - five roubles , he told the steward to provide them with a dinner at the cost of fifteen roubles .
Then he disappeared into his cabin .
A few minutes later he was heard to complain of the loss of 3,000 roubles .
He was getting steadily more and more drunk , and shortly after dinner instigated a quarrel with a third - class passenger , Razoumovsky , who was travelling from Tiumen .
The latter could hardly be restrained from giving Rasputin a thrashing , but fortunately matters were settled without violence .
This incident was followed by an altercation with another Tiumen merchant , called Mikhailev .
This time the quarrel began in the course of a conversation about the provocative actions of Bishop Varnava .
Mikhailev ended the dispute by spitting on the floorand leaving Rasputin .
Trouble , however , was not yet over .
On meeting the steward , Rasputin accused him of stealing his 3,000 roubles and called him a thief .
The steward requested some of the passengers to stand witness for him , and sent acomplaint to the captain , who threatened to have the matter settled at Tobolsk by calling in the police .
This episode over , Rasputin went back to his cabin , where he sat down with his head resting on the table .
He lay there for a longtime , mumbling to himself , while the passengers on deck gazed at him with admiration .
Some of them were heard to say : " Rasputin ! long may you live , you holy man ! "
Others said : " He ought to be shaved or have his beard clipped . "
The porthole of the cabin was closed at the agents ' request .
An hour or two before the steamer 's arrival at Pokrovskoe , Rasputin fell off the table on to the floor , where he stayed till the ship landed at eight o'clock in the evening .
The agents had to ask the captain for two men to help them to remove Rasputin from the cabin , and with some difficulty they eventually succeeded in dragging him to the shore , where his two daughters , Katia and Dounia , were expecting him .
He was hoisted on to a cart and taken home to Pokrovskoe in an unconscious condition .
10 August .
At ten o'clock the following morning Rasputin came out of his house and began questioning the agents about yesterday 's happenings , sighing and wondering at having got so drunk , since , according to his own words , he had had only three bottles of vodka .
He repeated over and over again : " Ah , my dear fellows , that was an ugly business . "
Among other things he mentioned that Djounkovsky had been made to resign , expressing the fear that he was , perhaps , attributing his forced retirement to him , Rasputin ; he disclaimed all knowledge of him , however , and professed to have had nothing to do with his dismissal .
He further said : " Yourgovernor will soon be removed also , " and to the question , whether he was referring to Count Adelberg , replied : " No , I do n't know his name , " and changed the conversation .

Rasputin , on hearing this , spat vigorously on the ground , saying : " What is the governor to me ? " 6 September .
During a walk with the agents Rasputin said to them " Yes , my dear fellows , my soul is aching with sorrow ; I am quite numb with grief .
Sometimes I feel better for an hour or two , but it does not last - all the sorrow comes back again . "
The agents asked : " Why do you feel like that " " Because , you simpletons , the country is in a bad way and because the cursed papers write about me , causing me much annoyance .
I shall have to go to law .
" 9 September .
When Rasputin went to see his brother Nicolai , who had at the time several other visitors in the house , their father made his appearance .
The old man abused his son Grigory with the vilest expressions .
Rasputin , in a savage fury , jumped up from the table where he was sitting , pushed his father into the yard , knocked him down and belaboured him with his fists , while the old man yelled : " How dare you , miscreant ! "
They were separated with difficulty .
Examination proved that the father had received a large purple bruise , which completely closed his eye .
Having recovered , the indomitable old man again attacked his son , abusing him worse than before ; he threatened to tell everybody , that Grigory was an ignorant old fool , who only knew " how to fondle Dounia 's [ the maid 's ] soft parts . "

They all - including Rasputin's wife - put up at the monastry with Father Martian .
The watch inferred from Rasputin 's behaviour that he was anxious not to be seen in Tiumen ; he said to the agent Terekhov : " I have no time to go about , although I have many friends here . "
But he stayed behind the monastery walls all day long , doing nothing .
He walks with a slight limp , the result of having damaged his hip in his fight with old Rasputin.12 September .

The fact that you receive from the Stavka [ G.H.Q. ] telegrams in cypher proves that you have great influence .
Hence we , the chosen ones , ask you to arrange matters so that Ministers should be made responsible before the people and that the State Duma should be convened on the 23rd September of this year , in order that our country may be saved from ruin .
If you do not comply with our order , we shall kill you ; no mercy will be shown to you ; our hand will not shrink as did the hand of Gouseva .

I had not met him before .
The first thing he said to me was : ' Come with me ; undress .
'I took my clothes off and followed him through a door , leading into a room to the left .
He paid scant attention to my petition , but plucked my face , then my breasts , mumbling all the time : ' Kiss me , I have taken a fancy to you . '
When he had written the note I was asking him for , he began bothering me again : ' Kiss me , kiss me ; I love you . '
In the end he would not give me the note , saying : ' I am angry with you , come tomorrow . ' "

“ That was one - upmanship , ” Kidwai said , smiling proudly as we looked at a photograph of one test , which was hanging on his office wall .
“ India had conducted only five . ”
Below the photographs , Kidwai keeps a small fragment of the Chagai mountain under glass , displayed like a moon rock at the Smithsonian .
The explosion had turned it bright white .
NO SOONER HAD THE radioactive and diplomatic dust settled from the test site than Kidwai was called in by his army superiors , and ultimately , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , and told that he would now head an urgent project : to come up with a system to protect Pakistan ’s new weapon from all of its enemies — the Indians , Western Europeans and the angry Americans .
Kidwai knew speed was of the essence .
Pakistan ’s leaders feared that if the West thought that Pakistan had just a few weapons in its inventory , and no system to assure their safety , they would come under even more pressure to roll back the program and give up the handful they had manufactured .
The only way to resist that pressure , they knew , was to create a large arsenal quickly and to hide it in underground facilities where neither the Indians nor the Americans could seize or destroy the warheads .
Then they needed to convince the world that Pakistan could become a responsible nuclear power , one capable of securing its weapons as well as the Russians , the Chinese or the Israelis did .
That meant Kidwai had to learn the arts of nuclear safety from the Americans , but without teaching his teachers how to neutralize Pakistan ’s arsenal .
Kidwai got off to a rocky start .
The Pakistani nuclear program owes its very existence to the government - endorsed and government - financed subterfuges of A. Q. Khan , who then turned the country into the biggest source of nuclear - weapons proliferation in atomic history .
And while Khan may be the most famous nuclear renegade in Pakistan , he is not the only one .
Soon after Kidwai took office , he also faced the case of the eccentric nuclear scientist Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood , who helped build gas centrifuges for the Pakistani nuclear program , using blueprints Khan had stolen from the Netherlands .
Mahmood then moved on to the country ’s next huge project : designing the reactor at Khushab that was to produce the fuel Pakistan needed to move to the next level — a plutonium bomb .
An autodidact intellectual with grand aspirations , Mahmood was fascinated by the links between science and the Koran .
He wrote a peculiar treatise arguing that when morals degrade , disaster can not be far behind .
Over time , his colleagues began to wonder if Mahmood was mentally sound .
They were half amused and half horrified by his fascination with the role sunspots played in triggering the French and Russian Revolutions , World War II and assorted anticolonial uprisings .
“ This guy was our ultimate nightmare , ” an American intelligence official told me in late 2001 , when The New York Times first reported on Mahmood .
“ He had access to the entire Pakistani program .
He knew what he was doing .
And he was completely out of his mind . ”
While Khan appeared to be in the nuclear - proliferation business chiefly for the money , Mahmood made it clear to friends that his interest was religious : Pakistan ’s bomb , he told associates , was “ the property of a whole Ummah , ” referring to the worldwide Muslim community .
He wanted to share it with those who might speed “ the end of days ” and lead the way for Islam to rise as the dominant religious force in the world .
Eventually Mahmood ’s religious intensity , combined with his sympathy for Islamic extremism , scared his colleagues .
In 1999 , just as Kidwai was beginning to examine the staff of the nuclear enterprise , Mahmood was forced to take an early retirement .
At a loss for what to do , Mahmood set up a nonprofit charity , Ummah Tameer - e- Nau , which was ostensibly designed to send relief to fellow Muslims in Afghanistan .
In August 2001 , as the Sept. 11 plotters were making their last preparations in the United States , Mahmood and one of his colleagues at the charity met with Osama bin Laden and his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri , over the course of several days in Afghanistan .
There is little doubt that Mahmood talked to the two Qaeda leaders about nuclear weapons , or that Al Qaeda desperately wanted the bomb .
George Tenet , the C.I.A. chief , wrote later that intelligence reports of the meeting were “ frustratingly vague . ”
They included an account that there was talk of how to design a simple firing mechanism , and that a senior Qaeda leader displayed a canister that may have contained some nuclear material ( though almost certainly not bomb - grade ) .
In the weeks after 9/11 , the tales of the meeting were enough to set off panic .
Rolf Mowatt - Larssen , a longtime C.I.A. nuclear expert , was given perhaps the most daunting job at the agency in the aftermath of 9/11 : to make sure that Al Qaeda did not have a weapon of mass destruction at its disposal .
“ The worst nightmare we had at that time was that A. Q. Khan and Osama bin Laden were somehow working together , ” Mowatt - Larssen told me one day last winter in his basement office in a secure vault at the Energy Department , where he moved after his time at the C.I.A. to head up the department ’s intelligence unit .
As if to drive home the point to visitors to his underground lair , Mowatt - Larssen , who is leaving the government this month to become a senior fellow at Harvard , keeps a floor - to - ceiling centrifuge in the corner of his office , where most people might put a potted plant .
The gleaming silver device , which is meant to spin at terrifying speed to enrich uranium , was seized in Libya — part of the cache that Muammar el - Qaddaffi bought from Khan .
( CNN ) -- Denny 's restaurants across North America were jammed Tuesday with patrons hungry to take advantage of the restaurant chain 's Grand Slam breakfast giveaway .
Patrons line up early Tuesday outside a Denny 's restaurant in Salt Lake City , Utah .

Maybe he should have driven there in a hybrid car :
The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration spent more than $ 123,000 to charter a private jet to fly to Bogota , Colombia , last fall instead of taking one of the agency ’s 106 planes .
The DEA paid a contractor an additional $ 5,380 to arrange Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart ’s trip last Oct. 28-30 with an outside company .
The DEA scheduled the trip as the nation was reeling from the worst economic crisis in decades and the national debt was climbing toward $ 10 trillion .
Three weeks later , lawmakers slammed chief executive officers from three automakers for flying to Washington in private jets as Congress debated whether to bail out the auto industry .
William Brown , the special agent in charge of the DEA ’s aviation division , said he ’d asked DEA contractor L - 3 Communications to arrange the flight because the plane that ordinarily would ’ve flown the administrator was grounded for scheduled maintenance .
He said he did n’t question the cost at the time .
“ Was it excessive ?
I guess you could look at it that way , but I do n’t think so , ” he said .
Konarka Technologies , Inc. , a company we have been following on The Sietch for a long time , today announced the company has opened the largest roll - to - roll flexible thin film solar manufacturing facility in the world , preparing for the commercialization and mass production of its patent - protected thin film solar material , Power Plastic .
Located in New Bedford , Massachusetts , the 250,000 square foot building was previously the location for Polaroid Corporationâ€™s most advanced printing technologies .
â€ œThis facility has state - of - the - art printing capabilities that are ready for full operation , with the future potential to produce over a gigawatt of flexible plastic solar modules per year , â€ commented Howard Berke , executive chairman and co-founder of Konarka .
â€ œOur technical leadership and innovation in flexible thin film solar , along with this facilityâ€™s capabilities of producing in excess of 10 million square meters of material per year , will allow us to produce Power Plastic for indoor , portable , outdoor and building integrated applications.â€ 
With this U.S. based manufacturing location , Konarka further expands its presence in Massachusetts and accelerates its aggressive plans to develop and commercialize its polymer - based organic photovoltaic ( OPV ) technologies worldwide .
In addition to acquiring the fully automated roll - to - roll manufacturing line , the company has also hired the leading technology and process engineering teams from Polaroid , with plans to hire over 100 additional employees as production increases toward capacity over the next two to three years .
Konarkaâ€™s advanced photovoltaic technology started with the work of the late Dr. Sukant Tripathy , an internationally known polymer materials scientist , provost at UMASS Lowell and founder of the Plastic Innovation Center and Dr. Alan Heeger , Konarkaâ€™s chief scientist , who was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2000 .
The ground - breaking discoveries from both founding scientists led to Konarkaâ €™s underlying technology leadership , including a manufacturing process at relatively low temperatures , which enables the use of low - cost plastic substrate films .
As a result of these pioneering innovations , the company has secured over $ 100 million from leading venture capital and private equity funds , as well as $ 18 million in government agency research grants from the U.S. and Europe .
â€ œSince 2001 , Konarka has taken revolutionary lab discoveries from its founding scientists to pilot production for initial customers and now to full - scale manufacturing with the near future capacity of one gigawatt per year , which could contribute to the power and electricity needs of our nation and the avoidance of CO2 emissions , â€ commented Rick Hess , president and CEO at Konarka .
â€ œAs one of the original recipients of the Solar American Initiative ( SAI ) awards in 2007 , Konarka is furthering the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s ( DOE ) vision to reach its goal of making solar electricity from photovoltaics cost - competitive with conventional forms of electricity .â€ 
In addition to global and national interest , the project has been assisted by various Massachusetts departments and quasi-public agencies , including the Massachusetts Governorâ€™s Office , the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development , the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs , MassDevelopment and the Massachusetts Technology Collaborativeâ€™s Renewable Energy Trust Fund and Green Energy Fund .
â€ œWith our nationally recognized technology expertise and resources , Massachusetts is becoming a global center for alternative and renewable energy , and Konarka is helping to solidify our commitment to a clean energy future and ongoing economic development and job growth in the Commonwealth , â€ commented , Daniel Oâ€ ™Connell , Massachusetts Secretary of Housing and Economic Development .
The company has also partnered with the City of New Bedford to become a Certified Project under the Massachusetts Economic Development Incentive Program ( EDIP ) .
Under the EDIP , Certified Projects receive favorable state and local tax treatment in exchange for committing to certain job creation and private investment criteria .
The EDIP is designed to increase economic activity within the Commonwealthâ€™s identified Economic Target Areas ( ETAs ) and the City of New Bedford has historically utilized the EDIP as one of its key economic development planning tools .
Scott W. Lang , Mayor of New Bedford , added , â€ œWe are excited that Konarka is bringing new jobs to help further drive the economy and interest in the city of New Bedford , and we are proud that our city is home once again to an industry leading manufacturing plant.â€ 
Constructed and further expanded in the 1990â€™s for Polaroidâ€™s advanced technology development and large - scale manufacturing , Konarkaâ€™s New Bedford facility has been retrofitted to immediately begin initial production of Power Plastic .
Using multiple in - line processing stations with precision multi-layer manufacturing processes that are adaptable to a variety of printing and coating technologies , the facility will enable the company to further develop and advance nano - enabled polymer photovoltaic materials that are lightweight , flexible and more versatile than traditional solar materials .
So even in these dire economic times it seems that renewable energy is still a strong bet , I was very happy to hear that it was mentioned many times last night in the presidential debate .
Clearly if we want to continue to have an economy , it must be a smaller , more sustainable , and renewable energy based one .
