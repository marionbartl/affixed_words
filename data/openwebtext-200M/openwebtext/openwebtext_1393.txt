It also emerged that Medine had repeatedly tried to report to police that she had been beaten by her father and grandfather days before she was killed .
" She tried to take refuge at the police station three times , and she was sent home three times , " her mother , Immihan , said after the body was discovered in December .
The school district responsible for allegedly " spying " on a high school student in his own home has agreed not to remove webcam images from any of the 2,300 student - issued MacBooks .
In the meantime , both the ACLU and EFF have spoken out about the incident that has gotten privacy advocates up in arms , and a number of parents have begun weighing in on the controversy that may , in the end , be all thanks to a bunch of mistaken candies .
The Lower Merion School District ( LMSD ) was issued an order by the Philadelphia Federal court on Monday barring the district from removing any possible evidence from laptops issued to students .
Additionally , the court ordered LMSD to stop using the webcams to spy on students — something the district independently decided to do last Friday .
The school agreed to both terms without an injunction , which the attorney representing high school student Blake Robbins applauded .
" I think the school district admits in its own press releases that it was wrong , it should n't have been doing this , certainly without some notice , consent , informed consent of the parents that this was something that could be done , " attorney Mark Haltzman told KYW News Radio .
On top of the court order , the ACLU in Pennsylvania filed a " friend of the court " amicus brief ( PDF ) in support of Robbins ' lawsuit .
" No government official , be it police officer or school principal , can enter a private home , physically or electronically , without an invitation or warrant , " ACLU legal director Vic Walczak said in a statement .
" Assuming the allegations are true , this is an egregious invasion of privacy . "
The Electronic Frontier Foundation agreed , telling Laptop Magazine that LMSD 's actions were violations of Robbins ' fourth amendment rights .
All this comes just a day after news got out that the FBI had begun investigating the case for violations of the federal wiretapping law .
The school district also claimed at that time that the built - in webcams were never used to spy on students in the 42 times they had been activated , and the students themselves seem conflicted over whether they had actually been spied on in the past .
This was all topped off by a video of Haltzman telling NBC Philadelphia that the photo that started all this hubbub was of Robbins eating Mike & Ike candies , which school officials allegedly mistook for pills .
In the meantime , there are some pretty vicious rumors going around about Robbins ' extracurricular activities that could have gotten him in hot water with administrators , but Haltzman unequivocally denies that his particular laptop was stolen — an event that would have triggered a webcam check from the school 's IT department .
Additionally , a number of parents whose kids go to LMSD have created a Facebook group to discuss the issues ( many of which do not support the privacy argument at all as long as their kids get a good education , it seems ) .
Needless to say , this situation just keeps getting thicker and more bizarre , and we 'll continue to watch how it plays out in the courts .
VADODARA : Can the cricket trophy meant for young boys under 14 years , be given to grown up women many of whom are 20 years old ?
This is a question the Baroda Cricket Association ( BCA ) is unable to answer after the women ’s team won two out of three matches in a local tournament .
In fact , history had been made when the women ’s team played against the Kiran More Cricket Academy on January 4 in the first - ever official match between boys and women in the country in the under - 14 DK Gaekwad tournament .
This unique experiment was billed as the ‘ battle of the sexes ’ and gave women cricketers much needed match practice .
But at that time BCA officials did not consider the consequences if the women entered the final and won it .
Technically , a trophy meant for under - 14 boys ca n’t be given to overage women .
Many of the officials did not expect the women to win any of their matches .
But the problem is they have won two out of three matches — the first on first innings lead white the other was an outright win .
BCA women cricket wing ’s convenor Cavatina Patel says , “ I feel the women should be given the trophy if they win the final although we have not discussed the possibility yet . ”
“ No one had thought of a situation where the women would win , ” a BCA member admitted on condition of anonymity .
“ The women ’s team was included just to help them improve their standards , but , no rules regarding their victory were laid down .
Given the technical issues involved , we may reward the women suitably if they win . ”
“ What is the point if the women do n’t get the prize after doing all the hard work ? ” questioned a BCA official .

Who says Republicans do n’t want to solve the problems of small businesses , jobless people , below - water homeowners , the homeless , working poor , unwed mothers , and the destitute ?
I ’m very glad to see that the NDP is taking notice of the Harper government ’s participation in the ongoing Anti-Counterfeiting Treaty Agreement ( ACTA ) negotiations .
Despite a lack of transparency and public consultation , some controversial details of the proposed agreement have been leaked .
The proposed agreement would include a “ three strikes ” policy on suspected illegal downloading .
Under this policy , users would have their internet access cut off after being accused of copyright violations three times , whether or not those allegations are true .
In contrast to our constitutionally - entrenched presumption of innocence , the “ three strikes ” rule would allow rights holders and service providers to sanction users in the absence of any credible evidence or proof .
It would create an untenable imbalance of power between rights holders , service providers , and users by placing the onus of disproof on those least capable of defending themselves .
Loss of access to the internet would be a severe consequence for many users .
As Cory Doctorow has pointed out , online communication has become increasingly essential for daily life in terms of employment , access to government services , etc. :
I mean , it ’s not as though internet access is something important right ?
In the past week , I ’ve only used the internet to contact my employers around the world , my MP in the UK , to participate in a European Commission expert proceeding , to find out why my infant daughter has broken out in tiny pink polka - dots , to communicate with a government whistle - blower who wants to know if I can help publish evidence of official corruption , to provide references for one former student ( and follow - up advice to another ) , book my plane tickets , access my banking records , navigate the new Home Office immigration rules governing my visa , wire money to help pay for the headstone for my great uncle ’s grave in Russia , and to send several Father ’s Day cards ( and receive some of my own ) .
The internet is only that wire that delivers freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , and freedom of the press in a single connection .
It ’s only vital to the livelihood , social lives , health , civic engagement , education and leisure of hundreds of millions of people ( and growing every day ) .
This trivial bit of kit is so unimportant that it ’s only natural that we equip the companies that brought us Police Academy 11 , Windows Vista , Milli Vanilli and Celebrity Dancing
With the Stars with wire - cutters that allow them to disconnect anyone in the country on their own say - so , without proving a solitary act of wrongdoing .
Beyond the troubling “ three strikes ” proposal , the ACTA has troubling implications for privacy , freedom of association , and the innovative potential of collaborative online projects .
Negotiations are taking place at a time when Parliament is suspended , preventing opposition MP s from holding the government accountable in question period .
Privacy is important .
You should protect yours .
I think this judge had the right idea : if the members of a class action settlement are expected to be happy with a card that they have to use at the store that screwed them over in the first place , why not the lawyer ?
Last year , Los Angeles County Judge Brett Klein was presented with a proposed class - action settlement in which the plaintiffs ' attorney would get $ 125,000 , but class members would get only a $ 10 gift card , usable only at the store that allegedly violated the law in the first place .
That is an example of the much - maligned " coupon settlement , " in which a defendant can end up profiting from breaking the law because a consumer must buy something from the defendant to redeem the coupon .
These can sometimes be okay , but Judge Klein did n't think this settlement was fair .
A Gift for You !
Another L.A. County judge , Susan Bryant - Deason , had tentatively approved the settlement , but she became ill and Klein ended up presiding over the fairness hearing .
In a ruling that caught my eye when it came out last year , he ordered that the attorney also be paid in $ 10 gift cards , just like the people he represented .
Under Klein 's order , Neil Fineman was to receive 12,500 gift cards that he could put toward the purchase of any merchandise he liked , as long as he liked the women 's clothing at Windsor Fashions .
At 3:34 am local time , today , February 27th , a devastating magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck Chile , one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded .
According to Chilean authorities , over 400 people are now known to have been killed .
The earthquake also triggered a Tsunami which is right now propagating across the Pacific Ocean , due to arrive in Hawaii in hours ( around 11:00 am local time ) .
The severity of the Tsunami is still not known , but alerts are being issued across the Pacific .

Overweight people can still become healthier with excercise ( Image : Digital Vision / Getty )
Whether being overweight is an absolute bar to fitness has become one of the most hotly debated questions in exercise science .
Steven Blair at the University of South Carolina is one of those who does n’t accept what might at first sight seems plain common sense – that being fat means you must be unfit .
No one denies that there is a negative correlation between weight and aerobic fitness : overweight people tend , as a group , to be less fit .
This is partly because a sedentary lifestyle contributes to weight gain , and partly because fat people may feel discouraged from taking exercise .
It can be a vicious circle .
In a study published in 2007 Blair recruited 2600 people of varying weight and timed how long they could run on a treadmill before becoming exhausted , a proxy for fitness ( JAMA , vol 298 , p 2507 ) .
Among those who were mildly obese , only a third met a common definition of being physically unfit , and only half of those who were moderately obese were unfit .
Blair points out that measures of aerobic fitness – the body ’s ability to deliver oxygen to the muscles – have nothing to do with the amount of fat tissue present .
In the 12 years during which the subjects were followed , Blair ’s study found that the risk of dying was more closely linked to fitness than fatness .
People who were fit but obese had a lower risk of dying than people who were unfit but of normal weight .
That ’s important , says Blair , because while many overweight people find it hard to get slim , …

The 9 Most Shocking Conspiracy Theories
That Turned Out to be True
by www.SixWise.com
Most people can't resist getting the details on the latest conspiracy theories , no matter how far - fetched they may seem .
At the same time , many people quickly denounce any conspiracy theory as untrue ... and sometimes as unpatriotic or just plain ridiculous .
While intelligent cynicism certainly can be healthy , though , some of the greatest discoveries of all time were initially received ( often with great vitriol ) as blasphemous conspiracy theories -- think of the revelation that the earth was not the center of the universe , or that the world was not flat but actually round .
Have you heard ?
About five decades ago the CIA gave LSD and other drugs to people , without their consent , in an attempt to develop a truth serum .
What follows are some of these most shocking modern conspiracy theories that were apparently right all along .
( Of course , the counter - claims of conspiracy theory regarding some remain open ... and who knows ? )
The Dreyfus Affair :
In the late 1800s in France , Jewish artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus was wrongfully convicted of treason based on false government documents , and sentenced to life in prison .
The French government did attempt to cover this up , but Dreyfus was eventually pardoned after the affair was made public ( an act that is credited to writer Émile Zola ) .
The Mafia :
This secret crime society was virtually unknown until the 1960s , when member Joe Valachi first revealed the society 's secrets to law enforcement officials .
MK - ULTRA : In the 1950s to the 1970s , the CIA ran a mind - control project aimed at finding a " truth serum " to use on communist spies .
Test subjects were given LSD and other drugs , often without consent , and some were tortured .
At least one man , civilian biochemist Frank Olson , who was working for the government , died as a result of the experiments .
The project was finally exposed after investigations by the Rockefeller Commission .
Operation Mockingbird : Also in the 1950s to ' 70s , the CIA paid a number of well - known domestic and foreign journalists ( from big - name media outlets like Time , The Washington Post , The New York Times , CBS and others ) to publish CIA propaganda .
The CIA also reportedly funded at least one movie , the animated " Animal Farm , " by George Orwell .
The Church Committee finally exposed the activities in 1975 .
Watergate : Republican officials spied on the Democratic National Headquarters from the Watergate Hotel in 1972 .
While conspiracy theories suggested underhanded dealings were taking place , it was n't until 1974 that White House tape recordings linked President Nixon to the break - in and forced him to resign .
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study : The United States Public Health Service carried out this clinical study on 400 poor , African - American men with syphilis from 1932 to 1972 .
During the study the men were given false and sometimes dangerous treatments , and adequate treatment was intentionally withheld so the agency could learn more about the disease .
While the study was initially supposed to last just six months , it continued for 40 years .
Close to 200 of the men died from syphilis or related complications by the end of the study .
Operation Northwoods was a well - orchestrated plan by top U.S. military leaders to create public support for a war against Cuba -- by carrying out acts of terrorism on U.S. soil , hijacking planes , sinking Cuban refugee boats and more .
Operation Northwoods :
In the early 1960s , American military leaders drafted plans to create public support for a war against Cuba , to oust Fidel Castro from power .
The plans included committing acts of terrorism in U.S. cities , killing innocent people and U.S. soldiers , blowing up a U.S. ship , assassinating Cuban émigrés , sinking boats of Cuban refugees , and hijacking planes .
The plans were all approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff , but were reportedly rejected by the civilian leadership , then kept secret for nearly 40 years .
The Iran- Contra Affair : In 1985 and ' 86 , the White House authorized government officials to secretly trade weapons with the Israeli government in exchange for the release of U.S. hostages in Iran .
The plot was uncovered by Congress in 1987 .
1990 Testimony of Nayirah : A 15 - year - old girl named " Nayirah " testified before the U.S. Congress that she had seen Iraqi soldiers pulling Kuwaiti babies from incubators , causing them to die .
The testimony helped gain major public support for the 1991 Gulf War , but -- despite protests that the dispute of this story was itself a conspiracy theory -- it was later discovered that the testimony was false .
It was actually the creation of public relations firm Hill & Knowlton for the purpose of promoting the Gulf War.

Back in the early 80's , I spend many an afternoon in a cramped and stuffy office in King 's College , London , with an informally gathered group of mostly graduate students , going through Wittgenstein 's Philosophical Investigations paragraph by paragraph , line by line .
It was often terribly slow going .
We might ponder two or three sentences for a couple of weeks , coming back to the same point several times .
It felt a bit like Bible study .
Some might have wondered how much was being achieved in this group or what the point of it all was .
But for me it was absorbing , thrilling , adventurous .
My eyes were opened and my life was changed .
The professor at the centre of this little group was the genial Texan philosopher Norman Malcolm , a lifelong friend of Wittgenstein and one of his most notable students .
Part of the excitement – though nobody would have been quite so crass as to admit it – was to be learning philosophy at just one degree of separation from the master himself .
But that alone was not what made this group keen to keep coming back .
Many of us felt that something different was going on , that we were learning a new way of doing philosophy .
The big idea was that philosophy was n't so much a question of mastering arguments – though the they did form a small part .
There was n't any great sense that we were deriving firm conclusions from the logical combination of indubitable premises .
Rather it was as if we were being inducted into a certain sort of technique , almost a style of dealing with philosophical problems .
Philosophy was more like therapy , an attempt to understand and deal with the very heart of human puzzlement about various things .
Why , we asked , do certain sorts of situations or ideas seem odd to us and what do we hope to achieve by throwing philosophy at them ?
Famously , Wittgenstein had two phases in his philosophical development .
He published the Tractatus Logico - Philosophicus in 1922 .
He then gave up philosophy to become , variously , a schoolteacher and a gardener and an architect .
But after a break from professional philosophy he increasingly he came to see that there was something fundamentally wrong with his first book – not just that the arguments were mistaken , but that the whole way of doing philosophy represented by the Tractatus was completely wrongheaded .
In this second phase , Wittgenstein came to argue that the basic form of a philosophical problem was the inability properly to orientate oneself within a particular world of language .
To anticipate : we get into philosophical muddles because language misleads us in to thinking the world is a certain sort of way .
We get out of philosophical muddles by recognising how language really works , and specifically , that language is necessarily indexed to human practice , culture and behaviour – to what we do .
" In the beginning is the deed " – a phrase that Wittgenstein as fond of quoting from Goethe .
This series on Wittgenstein will attempt to expand on these points and try and explain how they constitute a new turn in the philosophical imagination .
So how does all this effect the God question ?
Well it does n't and it does .
In one sense , Wittgenstein 's later thought makes great play of the insistence that it leaves everything as it is .
That it is not the job of a philosopher to enter into questions about God and decide the matter .
The philosopher is not the master adjudicator .
But on the other hand , Wittgenstein can be said to dissolve certain sorts of anxieties about a religious worldview and steer a path away from the supposition that a religious person needs first to get the philosophical underpinning of his faith right before he or she can get on and practice that particular faith .
For Wittgenstein , it is the practice of something that is properly foundational , not the arguments of the philosophers .
Soon after I finished with Norman Malcolm 's group , I gave up any thought of doing philosophy permanently and joined the church .
I had discovered the excitement of Christianity quite by surprise , by reading Kierkegaard as an atheist philosophy undergraduate .
I found the music and liturgy of the church beautiful and profoundly moving .
And as a disappointed ex-Marxist , I still wanted to change the world .
But I could not give myself over to belief : too many philosophical problems blocked my path , too many questions about what sort of ontological commitment was being made by claims to God 's existence .
In Wittgenstein , I discovered a voice that advised me not to be endlessly detained these questions .
In the beginning was the deed .
One day I got up from my desk in the library at Kings and went out in search of the chaplain .
We had never met .
I did n't go to church .
" How do I become a priest " , I asked ?

RIP : SFWA Author Emeritus 1999 William Tenn
William Tenn , the pen name of Phillip Klass , died at home on today at the age of 89 .
Tenn was named Author Emeritus by SFWA in 1999 .
Primarily known for his humorous short stories and essays , he wrote only two novels both published in 1968 .
Theodore Sturgeon said of his fiction :
It would be too wide a generalization to say that every SF satire , every SF comedy and every attempt at witty and biting criticism found in the field is a poor and usually cheap imitation of what this man has been doing since the 1940s .
His incredibly involved and complex mind can at times produce constructive comment so pointed and astute that the fortunate recipient is permanently improved by it .
Admittedly , the price may be to create two whole categories for our species : humanity and William Tenn .
For each of which you must create your ethos and your laws .
I ’ve done that .
And to me it ’s worth it .
He leaves his wife Fruma and his daughter Adina .
Our thoughts are with them both .
Abstract
Context Antidepressant medications represent the best established treatment for major depressive disorder , but there is little evidence that they have a specific pharmacological effect relative to pill placebo for patients with less severe depression .
Objective
To estimate the relative benefit of medication vs placebo across a wide range of initial symptom severity in patients diagnosed with depression .
Data Sources PubMed , PsycINFO , and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 1980 through March 2009 , along with references from meta- analyses and reviews .
Study Selection Randomized placebo - controlled trials of antidepressants approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the treatment of major or minor depressive disorder were selected .
Studies were included if their authors provided the requisite original data , they comprised adult outpatients , they included a medication vs placebo comparison for at least 6 weeks , they did not exclude patients on the basis of a placebo washout period , and they used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) .
Data from 6 studies ( 718 patients ) were included .
Data Extraction Individual patient - level data were obtained from study authors .
Results Medication vs placebo differences varied substantially as a function of baseline severity .
Among patients with HDRS scores below 23 , Cohen d effect sizes for the difference between medication and placebo were estimated to be less than 0.20 ( a standard definition of a small effect ) .
Estimates of the magnitude of the superiority of medication over placebo increased with increases in baseline depression severity and crossed the threshold defined by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence for a clinically significant difference at a baseline HDRS score of 25 .
Conclusions
The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent , on average , in patients with mild or moderate symptoms .
For patients with very severe depression , the benefit of medications over placebo is substantial .

Editor ’s note :
Other than the names of the politicians , this interview has n’t aged much since it first appeared .
Our methods for electing our leaders are still problematic at best — and that ’s not even counting stuff like e-voting , voter ID laws , or the Electoral College .
It ’s heartening to know , as primary season begins , that ours may be the worst of all the voting systems in common use .
That ’s the takeaway from Gaming the Vote : Why Elections Are n’t Fair ( and What We Can Do About It ) , one of a dozen books penned by William Poundstone , a professional skeptic who studied physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before he began pumping out nonfiction in 1982 .
Poundstone is particularly fascinated with how scientific ideas — mathematics in this case — play out in everyday life .
His 2005 book Fortune ’s Formula : The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street was hailed by the New York Times as perhaps “ the world ’s first history book , gambling primer , mathematics text , economics manual , personal finance guide and joke book in a single volume . ”
The author became interested in voting theory after reading about Arrow ’s Impossibility Theorem , the work of economist Kenneth Arrow , now a professor emeritus at Stanford University .
Arrow identified what he perceived as a fundamental flaw in our democracy :
Put simply , he argued that devising a perfectly fair voting system is mathematically impossible .
Gaming the Vote entertainingly probes the combative history of voting over the past few centuries .
It covers unusual territory , such as Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland author Charles Dodgson ’s ( a.k.a. Lewis Carroll’s ) obsession with voting , the legacy of sleazy campaign tactics spawned by GOP political consultant Lee Atwater , and how the idiosyncrasies of our election system left Louisiana voters to choose between a notoriously corrupt liberal and a former Ku Klux Klan leader for governor .
( The crook won . )
I caught up with Poundstone for a debriefing on the various voting methods .
Mother Jones :
Is there a way around Arrow ’s Impossibility Theorem ?
William Poundstone :
For decades , there was almost a kind of despair among voting theorists of getting any better system than we had .
What ’s interesting , though , is that the impossibility theorem does n’t apply to systems where you score the candidates rather than rank them .
With scoring , you ’re essentially filling out a report card — if you think there are two candidates who deserve four stars you can give them both four stars — whereas with ranking you have to artificially give one a number one and one a number two .
That turns out to be crucial .
MJ : And yet plurality voting — where a person can vote for only one candidate for a particular office — is the most common system in use .
What ’s wrong with it ?
WP : Whenever you have two candidates whose support overlaps , that ’s bad for both of those candidates , the obvious example being Nader and Gore in 2000 .
So a candidate can be a spoiler and cause the second most popular candidate to win .
This is something that ’s been appreciated at least going back to the 18th century , and people have tried to devise different ways of dealing with it , but for a very long time this was one of those unsolvable problems .
About 11 percent of the time we have a spoiler and get the second most popular candidate , so we really want to do better .
MJ : Do you consider our plurality system to be undemocratic ?
WP : It ’s certainly democratic .
Anything that tries to allow people to make a decision collectively would qualify as democratic .
I think , rather , it ’s bad technology .
About 11 percent of the time we have a spoiler and get the second most popular candidate , so we really want to do better .
MJ : How does plurality voting play out in the primaries ?
WP : It ’s even worse in the primaries where you might have three or more strong candidates .
If someone likes Huckabee and Romney , they can only vote for one , so they ’re basically getting penalized .
MJ : Can you name some other instances where a spoiler has thrown the presidential election ?
WP : The famous one was the 1912 election .
You had William Howard Taft and Teddy Roosevelt each trying to get the Republican nomination , and of course at that time Roosevelt was maybe the most popular ex-president ever .
Taft was an incumbent and had an obvious lead , but there was bad blood between them .
When Roosevelt did n’t get the Republican nomination , he ran on his own as the Bull Moose candidate , and although the two collectively got more than 50 percent of the vote , they split the Republican vote and instead you had the Democrat Woodrow Wilson winning .
MJ : How have political consultants exacerbated the spoiler problem ?
WP : Just in the past few years , they ’ve started promoting the campaigns of spoilers they think are going to benefit their candidate .
The Republicans were paying for Nader signature drives in 2004 , but since then it ’s become thoroughly bipartisan and you ’ve had Democrats paying for radio ads for Libertarian or anti-immigrant spoilers and vice versa , so it has kind of become the new technique .
They ’ve learned that the spoiler effect can be profitable , because it ’s actually more cost effective in many cases to divert some of your candidate ’s money to a spoiler candidate than buy additional ads for your candidate .
MJ : If spoilers create such uncertainty , why do n’t the major parties support a method that eliminates the problem ?
With range voting , it ’s pretty clear Gore would have won Florida and New Hampshire , so Gore would have been the president .
WP : I think they ’re just so used to the current system .
The people in politics have a certain skill set that ’s geared to this .
They ’ve even discovered how in some cases they can make use of it , so there is n’t quite as much motivation for [ change ] , unless there would be an overwhelming popular outcry that this is something we want , and there has n’t really been that .
MJ : What does the Constitution say about how we elect people ?
WP : It ’s kind of funny .
When we first wrote the Constitution there ’d been a lot of thought in revolutionary France about what ’s the best way to vote , and they basically discovered the spoiler effect and a lot of these problems Arrow was addressing .
And because of that , the founders really did n’t guarantee anyone the right to vote for president or Congress or anything in the Constitution .
The democracy we have now is kind of a retrofit .
MJ : Which alternative methods have been tried in the United States ?
WP : Instant runoff voting has been used in San Francisco , Minneapolis , and they ’re phasing it in in the state of North Carolina .
That ’s where you rank the candidates and if your first choice is someone who is not one of the front - runners , your vote is basically transferred to the more preferable of those two front - runners .
Everyone gets to honestly say who they really like , but your vote also counts where it really needs to count — in the crucial matchup .
[ Editor ’s note :
In November 2010 , instant runoff voting helped Jean Quan defeat Don Perata to become the mayor of Oakland , California .
Perata got the most first - choice votes but not enough to win outright .
Quan overtook Perata with second - choice votes .
Perata , needless to say , is not a fan of IRV . ]
MJ : Briefly summarize the pros and cons of the various voting methods you cover in your book .
Let ’s start with our current system .
WP : Plurality voting is the simplest system possible because each person casts one vote for one candidate , so it ’s very easy to count votes and so forth .
The con , the one thing on which all the experts basically agree , is that plurality is the least fair of all the systems .
MJ : How about the Borda system ?
Borda basically said , “ My system is intended for honest men , ” and people were n’t entirely honest .
WP : The first modern system invented to try and better plurality voting was the Borda count , invented in 18th - century France by a guy named Jean - Charles de Borda .
Unfortunately , it ’s very easily manipulated .
It ’s used in sports a lot — for determining the Heisman Trophy , the most valuable player — where they basically take a poll or a ballot of sportswriters to find the best players .
Unfortunately , if you have a player you like and rank him high , you might want to rank his rival at the very bottom of your list to penalize that rival .
In fact , there ’ve been scandals in sports where they do that .
Borda basically said , “ My system is intended for honest men , ” and people were n’t entirely honest .
MJ : And Condorcet ?
WP : Condorcet was Borda ’s great rival .
He had a system where you rank the candidates , but the idea is that whichever candidate can beat all the other candidates in two - way races should be the winner .
The main problem is sometimes you do n’t have a candidate who beats everyone else .
You can actually have a very weird situation where candidate A beats B , B beats C , and C beats A . It is also possible to manipulate .
MJ : There ’s also “ approval ” voting .
WP : It ’s very simple .
It basically uses the same ballot we have now except , if you want , you can vote for more than one candidate , and whichever one gets the most votes tends to win .
I ’m not sure there ’s any real known disadvantage .
Approval is actually used in the U.N. for voting on the secretary general , and it was used in Renaissance Venice for 500 years and apparently it worked pretty well there .
MJ : Instant runoff ?
WP : The voters rank the candidates based on how much they like them .
It works quite well as long as you have what we might call a typical American election , where there ’s a Republican and a Democrat and you ’re sure one of those two is going to win .
The problem is when you have three or more strong candidates as you would in the race for a party ’s nomination , then it ’s subject to some of the same vote - splitting effects as the plurality vote .
MJ : You seem to favor the emerging system of range voting .
WP : Range voting is the newest in the sense of people being aware of it and promoting it :
If you ’re rating a video on YouTube you give it one to five stars , and they take that information and show you the average score of all the people who bother to rate it .
We use it with a report card .
The valedictorian of a school is the winner of a range vote by the teachers for each of their classes .
In the Olympics , they hold up those cards to rate someone ’s performance — that ’s another example .
People are pretty familiar with the idea .
Nobody has given a convincing argument that there ’s anything seriously wrong with it — the one thing you sometimes hear is it ’s complicated , but that ’s about it .
MJ : In 2000 , mathematician Warren Smith published a study where he ran simulations to determine which of the common voting methods gave the most satisfactory , or least regrettable , outcome for the greatest number of voters .
He found that range voting was the most fair .
WP : That one paper has convinced a lot of people that we ought to be taking range voting pretty seriously .
MJ : How did the other methods rank ?
WP : The second best was approval voting , which is the short - form version of range voting .
Instead of rating someone on one to five stars , or one to ten , you basically have two ratings — thumbs down and thumbs up — and it ’s almost as good .
Next is the Borda count , although this particular simulation does n’t factor in that there ’s an incentive to manipulate the vote , so I would n’t rate that as too great an endorsement — Condorcet voting is a little better .
Then you get into instant runoff and then plurality voting , which is the worst of all these systems .
MJ : What if we had adopted range voting in 2000 or 2004 ?
WP : It ’s pretty clear Gore would have won Florida and New Hampshire , so Gore would have been the president .
Bush ’s victory over Kerry in most of the states was less than the Nader effect , so you still would have had a Bush victory .
MJ : How might it have affected the congressional races ?
WP : Libertarian spoiler Stan Jones was basically responsible for Democrat Jon Tester winning the Senate seat in Montana .
That was the 51st Senate seat , so you can say this Libertarian spoiler was responsible for giving Democrats control of the Senate in 2006 .
If an extraterrestrial came to Earth and asked me to explain our political system , it would be tough to justify both our president and control of the Senate .
They ’re each kind of the opposite party that they should be .
MJ : Why should we trust a voting method most notably used by the website Hot or Not ?
WP : Hot or Not uses range voting but they invented it entirely independently , which actually is n’t so unusual .
Founder James
Hong explained that the reason they adopted this is they wanted it to be as simple as possible to look at these two pictures and decide which of them was hot or sexy or whatever .
One of the ideas was that you would be asked to say which one you prefer , but often that was difficult if you saw two people who looked about equally hot .
Another possibility is you ’d look at one picture and decide hot or not , and that , too , could be very difficult — if someone was in the middle , people would n’t know what to do .
But with the range - voting thing you just move this cursor wherever it feels right ; if someone ’s about a seven , you just move your cursor over to seven and click .
And they did studies and found the range - voting idea was actually the fastest and easiest of the various solutions .
MJ : If range voting is superior , why has n’t it been used in a real election ?
WP : People did n’t really have the idea this is something we should be trying in elections until 2000 and Smith ’s study .
So it ’ll be interesting to see how it plays out .
MJ : Of the alternatives , instant - runoff voting has the most momentum , and yet it ’s flawed .
Who ’s pushing it , and why not range voting instead ?
WP : The main organization is FairVote , founded by an activist named Rob Richie in 1992 .
They ’re involved in a lot of voting reforms — a direct popular vote for president , security of electronic voting , proportional representation — but one of the things they ’ve done very successfully is instant runoff voting .
When they started , no one was talking about range voting , so they kind of got locked into this , I think .
Richie does n’t seem to believe range voting would be practical — I ’m not terribly impressed with his arguments against it .
But he has done a lot of good just in getting people aware there are other ways to vote .
And he has been successful in getting IRV , which is definitely an improvement on what we ’ve got now .
I would like to see a few communities try range voting and see how that plays out , and get more of an idea of how both of these work in modern campaigns .
MJ : Have any politicians stepped up and said we should try this ?
WP : Not range voting .
They certainly have for instant runoff voting ; Barack Obama and John McCain have both endorsed IRV , and Howard Dean as well .
MJ : Which method most benefits the small parties ?
WP : Anything that addresses the spoiler effect .
The Greens and Libertarians would probably get many more first - place votes or high scores than they do now .
I think that would have the effect of legitimizing them and making it a little easier for them to raise money .
Once you legitimize them , there would start to be elections in some areas of the country where they would be able to win a few races .
MJ : Are some of these systems a no - go simply because they will confuse voters , or because they ’d be too difficult to implement or sell to the public ?
WP : Either you have a ranked ballot or a report card , scoring - type ballot , and I think both of those are really pretty easy .
If they get complicated , it ’s in how you count the ballots .
Some are more complicated than others , but that ’s for the vote counters — the public does n’t have to worry too much about that .
MJ : But could n’t a more - complicated method create all sorts of havoc after an election ?
We have enough problems with our current system , where it ’s supposed to be easy to count .
WP : There is a concern about IRV in that , unlike all of the other systems , you have to transmit all the votes to a central repository — you ca n’t count them at the precinct level the way the other systems can .
Some people are concerned about that .
My own feeling is that it ’s more a question of what is fairest and what you can actually sell to the public .
We ’re still in a situation where the people in politics really do n’t understand the various systems — it would almost have to be that the public would start having an outcry saying we want this , that , or the other thing .
And that ’s where FairVote has made a very useful contribution to the conversation , because they ’ve managed to get people in some cities quite interested in the spoiler effect and what we can do to change it .
MJ : Do you think America will ever scrap plurality for something better ?
WP : In a generation or two I think it is very possible .
MJ : You ’d think 2000 would have been the wellspring of such a movement .
WP : I spoke with [ New York University political scientist ]
Steve Brams , who is one of the co-inventors of approval voting , and that ’s basically what he said .
He figured if 2000 did n’t get people interested in changing our voting system , what would ?
And he just kind of shrugged .

We present a Haskell solution to the problem of enumerating the strings of a regular expression with respect to a regular preorder , a term we soon define .
A version of this problem was considered in a note by Jayadev Misra .
We have generalized the problem .
The use of Haskell was suggested by Edsger W. Dijkstra and our solution makes critical use of Haskell 's lazy evaluation .
Microsoft 's full - body game control system Project Natal will be launched in time for the holidays this year , in what promises to be a big year for Xbox 360 users .
The Xbox news was the highlight of CEO Steve Ballmer 's keynote opening the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Wednesday , which was delayed by a brief power outage and included a lengthy pitch for Microsoft 's recently launched Windows 7 operating system .
Ballmer also showed three new tablet PCs that will ship later this year , including a slender device from Hewlett - Packard that was running a PC version of Amazon 's Kindle software .
The device even looked a little like an e-reader , although it was apparently running Windows 7 .
It was n't the Courier tablet that Microsoft is reportedly working on and that some had expected to see at the keynote , however .
Courier , as reported by the tech blog Gizmodo last September , is a novel device with two multi - touch screens that open like a book , and some nifty features like the ability to " flick " items from one screen to another .
Ballmer did n't mention Courier , however , and the news for gamers was the most compelling part of the evening .
" 2010 is going to be a landmark year for all Xbox customers , " thanks to Project Natal , lots of new games and an online retro arcade service , said Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft 's Entertainment & Devices Division , who followed Ballmer on stage .
Project Natal was first previewed at the E3 show last year .
It 's a gaming control system that lets players use full - body gestures , like a kick or a punch , to interact with the action on screen .
It employs a 3D camera to track body movements and then translates them into actions on the screen .
Bach called it " the culmination of years of research . "
Artwork : Chip Taylor
He did n't give pricing or say how Project Natal will be sold , but he did say it will work with existing Xbox 360 consoles .
Also new for gamers , in the spring , will be Game Room .
It 's an online arcade where Xbox Live users can purchase classic video games from the 70s and 80s , from names like Atari and Activision , then invite the avatars of other Xbox Live users into their virtual arcade to play .
2010 will also be a big year for new Xbox games .
Microsoft will release the next installment of its successful Halo franchise , called " Halo Reach , " a prequel that will " tell the story of the epic battle before Halo 1 , " Bach said .
It will also introduce a new genre of games , " the psychological action thriller , " with a game called " Alan Wake " that tells the story of a mystery writer who gets trapped in his own novels .
" Think ' Lost , ' written by Stephen King and directed by David Lynch , " Bach said .
The evening began half an hour late after a power failure blackened out part of the stage at the Hilton center , along with a few of the computer screens on it .

With the recession on the brink of becoming the longest in the postwar era , a milestone may be at hand : Women are poised to surpass men on the nation ’s payrolls , taking the majority for the first time in American history .
The reason has less to do with gender equality than with where the ax is falling .
The proportion of women who are working has changed very little since the recession started .
But a full 82 percent of the job losses have befallen men , who are heavily represented in distressed industries like manufacturing and construction .
Women tend to be employed in areas like education and health care , which are less sensitive to economic ups and downs , and in jobs that allow more time for child care and other domestic work .
“ Given how stark and concentrated the job losses are among men , and that women represented a high proportion of the labor force in the beginning of this recession , women are now bearing the burden  or the opportunity , one could say  of being breadwinners , ” says Heather Boushey , a senior economist at the Center for American Progress .
Economists have predicted before that women would one day dominate the labor force as more ventured outside the home .
The number of women entering the work force slowed and even dipped during the boom years earlier this decade , though , prompting a debate about whether women truly wanted to be both breadwinners and caregivers .
One of the great things about the JRuby project is that it ’s easy to run Ruby programs without installing Ruby .
In fact , you do n’t even need to install JRuby .
All you need is a JVM runtime and jruby - complete .
Rationale
Check out this other post for a discussion of my reasons for locking down your JRuby runtime .
In summary , embedding jruby - complete gives you complete control of your Ruby runtime .
That ’s a good thing .
The downside is that discovering and executing commands through jruby - complete can be a pain .
The rest of this post describes how to ameliorate the pain .
Running jruby - complete
The base jruby - complete command is :
java - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0.jar
This gives you the same behavior as typing ruby or jruby .
java - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0. jar -e " puts ' Hello ' "
prints “ Hello . ” ( Of course , this depends on what your jruby - complete jar is named .
I usually put the version number in there so I know what it is .
I expect anyone reading this to be able to figure out what their jar is named and fill it in appropriately .
If this is a hurdle , then too bad for you . )
I lied .1
To get the same JVM heap and stack sizes as typing jruby , you need to pass a couple of JVM options :
java - Xmx500 m - Xss1024 k - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0. jar -e " puts ' Hello ' "
Want to run irb ?
Try this :
java - Xmx500 m - Xss1024 k - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0.jar -e ' load " META-INF / jruby.home/bin/jirb " '
1 2 3 4 irb( main ) : 001 : 0 > puts " Hello " Hello => nil irb( main ) : 002 : 0 > %
As you can see , the java command is getting to be a pain .
It ’s time to introduce some rake tasks to help us out .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 JRUBY_COMPLETE
= " jruby - complete - 1.4.0.jar " JRUBY = " java - Xmx500 m - Xss1024 k - jar #{ JRUBY_COMPLETE } " namespace : jruby do desc " Run JRuby help " task : help do sh %+ #{ JRUBY } -- help + end desc " Run any command with JRuby " task : run do sh %+ #{ JRUBY } -e ' #{ ENV [ " cmd " ] } ' + end end
Now I can type rake jruby : run cmd='puts " Hello " ' .
Shell escaping is becoming a real annoyance at this point .
Thankfully , I ’m usually not using jruby - complete to run silly little commands .
By the time I ’ve introduced a Rakefile I ’ve got a real application with tasks oriented around testing and running it , so it ’s rare that I ’m using a task like jruby : run very often .
Running my application may introduce a task that looks something like this :
1 2 3 task :run do sh " #{ JRUBY } lib/application_bootstrap.rb " end
Running it :
1 2 3 4 fletcher - git/github/jruby-complete-example( master ) rake run ( in / Users / fletcher/git/github/jruby - complete -example ) java - Xmx500 m - Xss1024 k - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0.jar lib/application_bootstrap.rb
Hello from application_bootstrap
Of course , my application comes with RSpec specs .
The standard jruby - complete distribution comes with RSpec built in .
How can I use it ?
The - S parameter runs files in JRuby ’s bin directory :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 namespace : spec do desc " Run RSpec against a specific file " task : run do raise " You need to specify a spec with spec= " if not ENV [ " spec " ] sh %+ #{ JRUBY } -S spec -f specdoc #{ ENV [ " spec " ] } + end end
Here ’s a spec :
1 2 3 4 5 describe " John Galt " do it " does not tolerate logical fallacies " do " A " . should == " A " end end
Running it :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 fletcher -git/github/jruby-complete-example(master ) rake spec:run spec=spec/unit/objectivism_spec.rb ( in /Users/fletcher/git/github/jruby-complete-example ) java - Xmx500 m - Xss1024 k - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0.jar - S spec -f specdoc spec/unit/objectivism_spec.rb
John Galt - does not tolerate logical fallacies Finished in 0.123 seconds 1 example , 0 failures
Is this more typing than the usual spec spec/unit/objectivism_spec.rb ?
Yes .
Do I care ?
No . I know how to use my shell .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 fletcher - git/github/jruby-complete-example( master ) which sp sp ( ) { rake spec:run spec=$@ } fletcher - git / github / jruby- complete-example ( master ) sp spec/unit/objectivism_spec.rb ( in /Users/fletcher/git/github/jruby- complete-example ) java - Xmx500 m - Xss1024 k - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0.jar - S spec -f specdoc spec/unit/objectivism_spec.rb
Alright , so now that my application has been built up , I might want to start compiling the .rb files into .class files .
Here comes jrubyc :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 require " rake / clean " namespace : jruby do output_directory = " classes " directory output_directory CLEAN .include output_directory desc " Compile Ruby files in lib " task : compile => output_directory do sh %+ #{ JRUBY } - S jrubyc - p com / atomicobject -t #{ output_directory } lib + end end
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 fletcher -git/github/jruby-complete-example(master ) rake jruby : compile ( in / Users/ fletcher/git/github/jruby-complete-example ) mkdir -p classes java - Xmx500 m - Xss1024 k - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0. jar - S jrubyc - p com / atomicobject -t classes lib Compiling all in '/ Users/fletcher/git/github/jruby-complete-example/lib'...
Compiling lib/application_bootstrap.rb to class com/atomicobject/lib/application_bootstrap fletcher-git/github/jruby-complete-example(master ) rake jruby : run cmd='require " classes/com/atomicobject/lib/application_bootstrap " ' ( in / Users/fletcher/git/github/jruby - complete -example ) java - Xmx500 m - Xss1024 k - jar jruby - complete - 1.4.0.jar -e ' require " classes/com/atomicobject/lib/application_bootstrap " ' Hello from application_bootstrap
Remember that since we ’re executing a java command , we can pass any typical JVM parameters before the - jar parameter .
We ’ve done this for things like :
enabling antialiasing in Apple ’s JVM via a Java property .
tweaking Substance ’s widget behavior via a Java property .
enabling Yourkit Java Profiler via the - agentlib parameter .
including libraries and directories in the JVM ’s classpath via the - cp parameter .
Since these parameters need to be passed before the - jar parameter , a more sophisticated method for setting up the JRuby command is needed than the constant I ’ve used .
A method like that is specific for your application and beyond the scope of this post , but is not be difficult to create .
Conclusion
There are an uncountable number of good things about JRuby and jruby - complete is one of them .
A little help from scripts and your shell means you can build and run your application with a controlled Ruby runtime .
Additional resources
The Rakefile , jruby - complete , and other files used in this post are available in this GitHub project .
JarJar Links is an ant library that is useful for combining multiple jar files together .
The AGI Production Simulator is built using the jruby - complete commands described in this post .
Replicating the true jruby behavior is way , way beyond the scope of this post .
Check out the jruby script if you really care .
Most of the time the JVM heap and stack sizes are the most important things to worry about .

( CNN ) --
In Philip Kaplan 's world , no credit card purchase is private -- not even the $ 70.06 " sexy gift " he bought from a gay - themed shop called " Does Your Mother Know . "
He posted that transaction online .
Kaplan is the co-founder of a new site called Blippy .
On the site , which launched last week , people enter their credit card information and Blippy automatically sends out short , public " blips " of information about what people are buying -- including the prices of the items and where they were bought .
It 's like the financial version of Twitter , and Kaplan , the 34 - year - old author of the book and former blog " F'd Companies , " who looks and talks somewhat like the actor Seth Rogen , says it 's going to change the way people think about privacy and money .
While people now may be hesitant to talk about what they pay in rent or how much they spend on coffee , Kaplan says all purchases may soon be public .
But what 's the benefit ?
And what are the dangers ?
I caught up with Kaplan by phone this week to talk about how Blippy could become a new form of advertising and why no purchase -- even revealing ones -- should be embarrassing to share .
Here is an edited transcript of our chat :
CNN : Maybe we should just start with a question from one of our Twitter followers :
What 's the point of Blippy ?
Kaplan :
Without getting too philosophical , I 'll just start at the beginning .
The big answer is :
We do n't know , which I think is funny but is also indicative of what we 're trying to do .
It was n't actually me who came up with the idea .
It was my co-founders Ashvin Kumar and Chris Estreich .
...
The question that Ash and Chris asked themselves was : " Well , what would happen if data that is traditionally private , like credit card data , becomes public ? "
Or another way to ask it is , " What happens if everybody knew what everybody else was paying for everything ? "
Consumers have never had the benefit of just knowing how much everyone else has paid for stuff .
When I go down to the local gym in my neighborhood and I say I want a membership and they tell me how much a membership costs , I have no idea what an actual membership costs .
I do n't know if I should ask for less , or if they 're giving me a deal .
I kind of just want to know what everybody else there is paying .
But of course the gym will never tell me that .
CNN : For someone who has n't heard of Blippy , if they go to the site , how does it work ?
Are the posts automatic ?
Can you post manually ?
Currently it 's automatic .
Typically what people do is they connect one credit card to Blippy , and then the rest of your credit cards are private .
So when you buy something that you think is vaguely interesting -- it could be from a restaurant that you are at , or , you know , getting a bagel for lunch , or literally just buying gas , something that 's not private -- you use your shared card , your Blippy card , and it 's automatically shared with your friends .
We personally like that .
We call it passive sharing , and we think it 's going to be a trend .
You do n't have to go to Twitter or Facebook and type to tell everybody what you 're doing .
You just sort of do your normal stuff and you 're automatically publishing .
That said , you can always pause the sharing if you 're buying birthday gifts or something like that .
Pete Cashmore calls Blippy " shocking and ingenious "
CNN : Why does the price have to be attached to the posts ?
In a way , Blippy is like looking at a menu , you know .
And if you have a menu without prices , like the first thing you want to know is " How much does it cost ? "
I saw that one of the people who I followed bought this scale on Amazon .
It said : Wi -Fi enabled bathroom scale ; $ 169 .
Now that 's not cheap for a bath scale , but " Wi - Fi enabled " sold me , so I bought it .
And when I bought it , somebody else bought it because they saw I bought it .
When they bought it , like three other people bought it .
It was the first time I 'd ever seen viral shopping .
It 's like a little flair went out and suddenly probably 10 people bought these scales within an hour , which was a lot of scales , and 10 more sales than they would have sold .
CNN : Is there the potential for anything bad to happen from all of this sharing of credit card information ?
The way that we say it is , the worst thing that could happen is you 're totally boring .
There are people on the site who all they do is buy gas and groceries .
Maybe that does n't look great for them , you know .
They should go to a restaurant or a bar or something .
I bought a bunch of holiday gifts for my wife on Blippy and they all showed up on Blippy ...
She was like , " Oh my god , I love you .
Thank you ! "
It was fine !
You know .
It was a new way to give a present , in a way .
CNN : Is there any potential that this would expose someone to an attack on their financial information , or that it could be used against them ?
I do n't -- we 've all been taught that this is just something you do n't do .
As an aside , when I was a kid , we were n't allowed to tell anybody we were going out of town , and we had timers in the house that would turn the lights on and off so it would look like we were home .
But now you tweet when you 're at dinner .
...
You put your whole schedule on Facebook so people can like plan their robberies ahead of time .
And I think the pros far outweigh the cons in that scenario .
... I think the risks in actuality are very small .
Similarly , I think we have this engrained thing that we 're taught , which is to not share this [ financial ] information , and we do n't really know why .
CNN : Are the companies and sites you integrate with paying you ?
[ People can choose to have their Netflix downloads posted , for instance , without entering credit card info ] .
No , they 're not paying .
What they 're doing is they 're encouraging their users to use us .
Which is kind of a ballsy move , because what if nobody buys anything from these stores , or what if people buy things from the stores and they do n't like it ?
So far it 's been stores that think that they sell cool stuff , and think they sell good products , and they say , " You know what ?
When somebody buys this , we want them to tell the world . "
CNN : Do you think this promotes brand names that everyone knows and national chains ?
It 's hard to tell .
The site 's only been open for a few days .
...
For me , and I presume for most people , the things that you have n't heard of are the most interesting .
So while , yes , it 's fun to look at what somebody bought from Target , and a lot of people buy stuff from Target , it 's more fun to see that I bought something from a store called " See Jane Run . "
CNN : What are your personal limits in using the site ?
Do you post everything ?
I post everything except places that only take cash , and that bums me out .
And if you 're a store and you only take cash you 're opting out of free advertising on Blippy .
I used to have two credit cards , one that was connected and one that was n't connected .
And it 's not like I 'm mister squeaky - clean and everything I buy is fit for public consumption , but I just realized that I was n't really using the private credit card for anything .
And I liked that credit card , so I connected them both .
But I 'm pretty far out there .
People were saying well , " What if I bought a dildo or something and it showed up ? "
So I actually went to a store called " Does Your Mother Know . "
I said first of all , the store has to have a name like that so everybody knows what it is .
So I found a store with a name like that in the Castro section of San Francisco .
So I went to that store and I bought a sexy gift for my wife , and of course it showed up on the site .
And it was funny !
I did n't really care .
CNN : You mentioned the idea of a Blippy Card .
Is Blippy going to become a credit card company over time ?
There has been some demand for an actual Blippy Card .
If someone only has one card and they want like a big orange card that they 're not going to forget is their Blippy card .
So we have a few solutions .
It could be as silly as just a sticker you could put on your card to remind you .
...
We might have a credit card .
We 're at the very beginning stages of looking into it .
In 1906 , Belle Gunness started running personal ads in Midwestern papers .
She described herself as an attractive widow with a lush Indiana farm property , interested in an equally affluent new husband .

Motorola is hoping to convince US trade regulators to ban the sale and import of certain BlackBerry phones , which it claims infringe on several patents .
The handset maker said Friday it has filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission ( ITC ) , asking for an investigation into RIM 's alleged unlicensed use of five " early - stage innovations " for mobiles related to Wi -Fi access , user interface , power management , data protection , and storing messages .
Motorola told El Reg in an email that RIM had originally entered into a license agreement for the technology back in 2003 , but has continued their use well after the deal expired in 2007 .
RIM said it typically declines to comment on litigation .
The filing comes after patent lawsuits laid down by Motorola against RIM in the northern district of Texas and the UK in early 2008 .
These are unresolved .
Motorola said it does n't have a " non-confidential version " of the complaint to share with us , but elaborated that the dispute concerns US patents 5,569,550 ( a battery pack with under- voltage and over - voltage protection ) ; 5,319,712 ( method for providing cryptographic protection of data in a communication system ) ; 5,359,317 ( a method for storing a received messages on a phone ) ; 6,232,970 ( a user interface design for small handheld devices ) ; and 6,272,333 ( a way to control how Wi - Fi data is delivered to a device ) .
" In light of RIM 's continued unlicensed use of Motorola 's patents RIM 's use of delay tactics in our current patent litigation , and RIM 's refusal to design out Motorola 's proprietary technology , Motorola has no choice but to file a complaint with the ITC to halt RIM 's continued infringement , " Jonathan Meyer , Motorola 's vice president of intellectual property law , said in a statement .
The filing asks the ITC to issue a ban on RIM from importing or selling any of the allegedly infringing products within the US , as well as halting marketing and advertising for those products .
In 2008 , RIM countered Motorola 's lawsuit with its own in Texas court , claiming Motorola infringed on several RIM patents .
It also accused its rival of anti-competitive conduct for demanding " exorbitant " licensing fees on technologies that are essential to various standards in mobile telecommunications .
The complaint also follows a lawsuit from Eastman Kodak against RIM earlier this month , claiming the company did n't license patents for previewing images in different resolutions . ®
Climate Crime Phishing Scam Cripples European Emissions Trading
Sneaky cyber - thieves have made millions by fraudulently obtaining European greenhouse gas emissions allowances and reselling them .
The scam has hampered trading of the credits , which are seen as an important tool in curbing climate change , in several European countries .
The sea -dwelling ancestors of modern - day mammals , reptiles and birds emerged from the water millions of years earlier than previously believed , according to new research published Wednesday .
A set of fossilised footprints pictured in the scientific journal Nature show the first tetrapods - a term applied to any four - footed animal with a spine - were waddling ashore 397 million years ago , well before scientists thought they existed .
An expert unconnected with the research said the find would force experts to reconsider a critical period in evolution when sea - based vertebrates took their first steps toward becoming dinosaurs , mammals , and - eventually - human beings .
" It blows the whole story out of the water , so to speak , " said Jenny Clack , a paleontologist at Cambridge University .
Until now , scientists through they had the evolution from fin to foot fairly well understood .
The earliest tetrapods had been traced to 385 million years ago .
Experts theorized that they had split from their close relatives , a fleshy - finned family of fish known as Elpistostealians , a few million years earlier and then gone on to conquer land .
But the new fossil footprints - uncovered between 2002 and 2007 in a disused quarry in central Poland - push the timing back by several million years , according to Grzegorz Pienkowski , the scientific director of the Polish Geological Institute in Warsaw , where most of the article 's authors are based .
He said the fossils had been securely dated from the deposits they were found with .
Pienkowski said that the footprints were first created in what was probably a lagoon - like environment at the time - arguing against the commonly accepted notion that fish came ashore from lakes or rivers .
Pienkowski said such a coastal location made sense because shifting tides could strand small marine animals , giving our fishy forebears an incentive to explore open land .
Clack said the new fossils would force scientists - herself included - to reconsider what it was that originally turned fish into land - lovers .
She said some theorised that tetrapods originally went ashore to lay their eggs out of reach of water - going predators or that their ancestors grew legs to scurry from pool to pool .
She said she had personally favored the notion that fish emerged from oxygen - deprived waters in order , quite literally , to catch their breath .
None of those theories was supported by the Polish find , she said .
It would n't be logical for fish to lay their eggs in a place where the tide would wash right over them , for example , and the pool - hopping behavior would n't make sense in a coastal environment .
As for her oxygen hypothesis , Clack said " that 's probably out the window . "
The fossils suggested that tetrapods evolved well before marine oxygen levels started to drop , she said .
Nevertheless , Clack warned against relying exclusively on the marks left by a small animal on the bottom of a muddy surface hundreds of millions of years ago .
She said it would be critical to see fossil evidence of the creature that made the footprints before coming to any definitive conclusion on exactly how , when and where vertebrates came to colonise the earth 's surface .
Chinese censors have reportedly " banned " sci- fi epic Avatar , amid fears it could provoke civil unrest , the Telegraph reports .
According to Hong Kong 's Apple Daily , the state - run China Film Group has ordered that the film be shown only in 3D , and since there are few cinemas equipped for this , the edict is tantamount to a ban .
The paper said : " The Central Publicity Department is said to have issued an order to the media prohibiting it from hyping up Avatar .
Reportedly , the authorities have two reasons for this check on Avatar : first , it has taken in too much money and has seized market share from domestic films , and second , it may lead audiences to think about forced removal , and may possibly incite violence . ”
As we reported last week , Chinese audiences were quick to see Avatar as an " allusion to the exploitation of China ’s weak by the powerful , the poor by the rich " .
Specifically , they saw a parallel between the plight of the Na’vi and those who stand up to China 's often forceful property developers .
Avatar will be replaced across China with " a patriotic biopic on the life of Confucius " , the Telegraph notes . ®
President says this is ' moment that cries out for US leadership ' as death toll estimated by aid agency hits 50,000
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Barack Obama today announced a large US relief effort for Haiti , where between 45,000 and 50,000 people are feared dead after a devastating earthquake .
The US president said America would give $ 100 m to the aid effort for the stricken Caribbean country and pledged that the people of Haiti " will not be forgotten " .
Obama said he had told US agency and department heads to put Haiti at the top of their agenda .
" This is one of those moments that cries out for American leadership , " Obama , flanked by his most senior officials , told reporters .
Obama 's impassioned remarks came as international rescue teams today began arriving in Haiti , where the death toll from Tuesday 's earthquake has been put at between 45,000 and 50,000 by the Haitian Red Cross , the first estimate released by a relief organisation .
Aid aircraft from China , France , the US and Spain flew into Port - au - Prince , while a British specialist rescue team that arrived overnight in the neighbouring Dominican Republic also arrived in the Haitian capital .
Gordon Brown described the earthquake as a " tragedy beyond imagination " and urged the British public to support emergency appeals .
" The past 24 hours have been truly horrific for the people of Haiti .
It is a catastrophe that is still unravelling , " he told a news conference .
He said many people were still buried in the rubble and in need of urgent rescue .
The British government announced a £ 6.15 m donation " to help kickstart humanitarian relief in Haiti " .
" The most pressing need is for international search and rescue teams , including firefighters from all over Britain , to get on with their work of saving lives , " Douglas Alexander , the international development secretary , said .
" But , at the same time , there is an overwhelming requirement for food , water , sanitation , shelter . "
The Lincolnshire chief fire officer , Mike Thomas , leading the British rescue team – many of whom were recently involved in a similar rescue operation in Sumatra – said it would immediately begin liaising with agencies on the ground .
" Our first priority is to assess the needs and start to identify areas where people are still trapped , " he told the BBC .
The party includes 71 rescue specialists , dogs , heavy equipment and a four - man team from the British government .
A US aircraft carrier , the Carl Vinson , was expected to arrive off the coast today , and the US navy said the amphibious assault ship Bataan , with a 2,000 - strong Marine unit , has been ordered to sail as soon as possible .
Another 3,500 US soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division are also heading to the country to assist with disaster relief and security , amid fears that law and order could collapse .
Three hundred US medics were also being sent .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , pledged long - term help for the crippled government .
Parliament , the national palace , and many government buildings collapsed and it was unclear how many politicians and officials survived .
The main prison also fell , allowing criminals to escape .
" The authorities that existed before the earthquake are not able to fully function .
We 're going to try to support them as they re-establish authority , " Clinton told CNN .
Hundreds of Cuban doctors already in Haiti helped treat the injured in field hospitals .
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said three planes touched down to evacuate around 60 injured people to hospitals on the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe .
He told France Inter radio that two additional French relief planes were also on their way .
Journalists in Port - au - Prince said the devastated city 's emergency services had been completely overwhelmed by the magnitude 7.0 earthquake , the largest to strike Haiti in two centuries .
" This is a particularly grim sight , " Matthew Price , a BBC correspondent speaking from a hospital in the capital , said .
" The stench is overwhelming .
There are over 100 bodies here , adults and , at my feet , a baby .
Perhaps even more uncomfortable is that there are people bedding down for the night … sleeping among the dead . "
Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) said head wounds , crushing injuries and severe trauma were the most common cases needing treatment .
Field treatment centres have been set up outside hospitals , while a refugee camp has been established near the airport .
Amid the gloom , there were moments of celebration when survivors were pulled alive from the rubble .
Among those rescued was Danielle Trépanier , a Canadian logistics co-ordinator with MSF , who spent almost 24 hours trapped in the debris of a staff house .
The International Committee of the Red Cross set up a website to help survivors locate relatives and friends .
About 1,360 Haitians , mostly in the US and Canada , registered on the site within hours of it going live .
The earthquake is the latest disaster to hit Haiti , which has suffered a succession of hurricanes in recent years .
" This is much worse than a hurricane , " Jimitre Coquillon , a doctor 's assistant working at a makeshift triage centre , said .
" There 's no water .
There 's nothing .
Thirsty people are going to die . "
The International Red Cross estimated that three million people – one - third of the population – could need emergency relief , while the Haitian president , René Préval , said the damage was " un­imaginable " .
The prime minister , Jean - Max Bellerive , told CNN the final death toll could be well over 100,000 , while Youri Latortue , a senator , told the Associated Press that 500,000 may be dead .
Both admitted that they had no way of knowing .
Alexander said 32 Britons were thought to be living in Port - au - Prince .
Half had yet to make contact with the UK 's ambassador to Haiti , he said , but he added : " There are no indications of British casualties . "
The American Red Cross said the aid organisation had already run out of medical supplies , with spokesman Eric Porterfield explaining that the small amount of medical equipment and medical supplies available in Haiti had been distributed .
The Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) , a coalition of 13 relief agencies , is taking donations on a special phone line , 0370 60 60 900 , and through its website .
It is expected to launch a television appeal tomorrow .
A spokesman said giving money was the best way for people to help , enabling supplies to be bought as close to the disaster area as possible and sent straight to those in need .
Some aid agencies had already started trying to help those in affected areas but the spokesman said : " The aid effort is n't on the scale that 's required … we need people 's help to scale it up urgently . "
Save the Children said 2 million children could have been affected .
Jasmin Whitbread , the chief executive , said children were particularly vulnerable in the disaster .
" Many have lost or been separated from their parents , " she said .
" They are living outside among the devastation .
They are shocked and traumatised , and need to be in a safe place . "

Something every saver knows ...
From Stephanie Strom at the NY Times : At Tiny Rates , Saving Money Costs Investors
The elderly and others on fixed incomes have been especially hard hit .
Many have seen returns on savings , C.D. ’s and government bonds drop to niggling amounts recently ...
" ... what ’s going to happen now as C.D. ’s mature is that retirees and the elderly are going to take anywhere from a half to three - quarters ... cut in their incomes , ” said Joe Parks , a retired accountant in Houston ...
“ What the average citizen does n’t explicitly understand is that a significant part of the government ’s plan to repair the financial system and the economy is to pay savers nothing and allow damaged financial institutions to earn a nice , guaranteed spread , ” said [ Bill Gross of PIMCO ] ...
Mr. Gross said he read his monthly portfolio statement twice because he could not believe that the line “ Yield on cash ” was 0.01 percent .
At that rate , he said , it would take him 6,932 years to double his money .
That is what my statement says too - not exactly the best return .
But in less than 7,000 years the money will double !
Nearly three years after its introduction , the Apple TV remains a hobby in the eyes of Apple .
This view was confirmed by CEO Steve Jobs during a post-iPad Town Hall meeting among employees , where he reiterated that the company still views the set - top box as experimental .
Many other details about the Town Hall have already leaked online .
As noted by Wired , Jobs thinks Google 's " do n't be evil " mantra is less - than - genuine and that Adobe is lazy ; he said that no one will be using Flash in the future and the world is moving to HTML5 .
MacRumors added that Apple plans to release aggressive updates to the iPhone and that the iPad ranks with the iPhone and the Mac as important products that Jobs has been party to .
We confirmed all of these details with our own sources ; it 's clear that Apple is very confident in its iPhone and iPad strategy for the coming years .
One detail not mentioned by any other publications was Jobs ' brief discussion of the Apple TV .
According to sources speaking to Ars , an employee asked during the meeting if Apple 's stance on the device had changed .
Jobs confirmed what most of those who own Apple TVs had feared : no , it 's still a hobby .
Of course , the company said several times in 2007 that the Apple TV was nothing more than a hobby , so the latest revelation is less of a surprise and more of a disappointment .
In 2007 , Jobs told the company that he hoped the Apple TV would be as big as the Mac , iPod , and iPhone , but that it was still in experimental stages .
That remains to be the case , it seems , despite numerous efforts by Apple to make it attractive to both users and content providers .
In 2008 , the company introduced HD movie rentals to the iTunes Store , but they were restricted to the Apple TV only .
That was apparently a failed attempt at offering extra value in the set - top box ( and also " protecting " HD content from those nasty computer users ) , as Apple then opened up rentals to the Mac and PC a year later .
Since then , the Apple TV has gotten one major UI makeover ( one that continues to be finicky for some of us ) , but has otherwise seen little overt attention from Apple .
The overall movie selection on iTunes continues to float somewhere between " mediocre " and " decent , " and there 's still an obnoxious release window between the time when you can buy a new movie and rent it .
Sure , this is a downfall of the iTunes Store itself , but the Apple TV is the living room extension of the iTunes Store .
If the iTunes Store is n't compelling , neither is the Apple TV .
In a way , the iPad brings some hope for the Apple TV because of its focus on media consumption .
With more devices in more hands , Apple can use that exposure to push for smaller release windows and more content .
And , of course , that long - rumored TV subscription plan would n't hurt in boosting the Apple TV either , though it sounds as if there 's still a long way to go before media companies get on board .
Until then , the Apple TV can remain a hobby all it wants as customers ( myself included ) subscribe to Netflix to get their set - top fix .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife , Laureen , stand above the Huangpu River as they look out over Shanghai on Saturday .
( ( Sean Kilpatrick / Canadian Press ) )
Canadian beef exporters have regained access to the Hong Kong market following a meeting between Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the former British colony 's chief executive .
Regaining access to Hong Kong sends a strong signal to all Asian markets that Canadian beef is safe , Harper said in a statement late Saturday night .
Hong Kong , a key market for the Canadian agriculture sector , is worth more than half a billion dollars for the nation 's farmers and processors .
In 2008 , Hong Kong was Canada 's fourth - largest export market for beef .
On Sunday , the prime minister participated in the annual commemorative service at the Sai Wan War Cemetery honouring the Canadian soldiers who defended the territory during the Second World War .
" Today , we acknowledge our eternal debt to those who have served our country , " Harper said .
" We are also reminded of the gratitude we owe to those who continue to defend our values in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world . "
A vastly outnumbered contingent of Canadians , along with troops from Hong Kong , the United Kingdom and India , defended the territory against Japanese invaders for 17 days , finally surrendering on Christmas Day , 1941 .
Canada 's losses were heavy , with 290 soldiers killed and 493 wounded .
More than 550 Canadians who fought in Hong Kong died in the campaign or in captivity .
Harper arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday after telling a business meeting in Shanghai that Canada can do better to forge business ties with mainland China .
Before flying to Hong Kong , Harper met with Canadian business leaders in the coastal city .
He said Canada secured some concrete benefits during his four - day visit to mainland China , but added the two countries still need to push forward with comprehensive economic agreements .
" Canada has made a real significant impact here [ but ] at the same time we all sense we are only scratching the surface , " he told them .
According to the Canadian government , two - way trade has expanded at the rate of 14 per cent a year since 2008 , but in relative terms Canada is losing the race to gain a foothold in the country .
Canada 's share in trade volume compared to other foreign countries has fallen to one per cent from an earlier 1.8 per cent .
Summing up his trip , Harper concentrated on the " achievables , " including finally securing a tourism deal that could bring $ 100 million a year to operators in Canada , and China 's lifting of a ban on pork imports .
PM as tourist
The prime minister played the role of tourist Saturday during a hectic half day in Shanghai as he and wife , Laureen , visited the popular Yu Garden market , where he bought some tea for his mother .
The couple walked hand in hand along the curb as crowds gathered , in part attracted by the fleet of limousines signalling a VIP was present .
Some in the crowd recognized the Canadian prime minister and began shouting " Stephen , Stephen . "
After picking up some tea , Harper crossed the street to shake hands and pose for photographs .
The previous night in Shanghai , the prime minister did not appear to win any fans in a gathering of the city 's business elite , when he said his government will continue to be a " vocal advocate " of human rights reform in China .
That section of the speech was greeted with silence from the crowd of businessmen , who had applauded previous statements focusing on trade and the removal of protectionist policies .
No news from here today ; just rumination .
Those of us in the book business have to choose which anti-social position we want to take .
Some people are for the most rapid possible adoption of ebooks .
They can be cheaper .
They do n’t require paper which pollutes when you create it and adds carbon footprint every time you ship it around .
They have much greater functionality , or at least the potential for it .
They enable business models that do n’t require capital - intensive infrastructure .
But have you thought about this ?
If you are for the most rapid possible adoption of ebooks , you are for killing bookstores faster .
Although there are probably few people reading this blog who expect bookstores to be around in 15 or 20 years ( and those who do will undoubtedly leave a comment ! ) , there are many who would like to keep them around as long as possible .
There is a magic to being in a building surrounded by 40,000 , 60,000 , 100,000 different books .
Bookstores are inherently community centers .
They make possible the wide dissemination and promotion of great writing .
They enable people to see heavily - illustrated books before they purchase them .
But have you thought about this ?
If you are for bookstores lasting as long as possible , you want to slow down the uptake of ebooks .
As individuals , which side you ’re on is a matter of personal preference .
Although I have mostly read ebooks for more than 10 years and have n’t read a printed book in two years , I am for bookstores lasting as long as possible .
It ’s a “ health of society ” and a “ health of my industry ” question for me .
I think both will be much poorer when bookstores go away .
My societal preference is n’t enough to motivate a self - indulgent guy like me to inconvenience myself , so I read electronically , not on paper .
But it does not distress me to remain part of a small minority .
It helps keep bookstores alive .
Individuals decide this question on personal preference ; businesses think about competitive advantage .
Barnes & Noble and the biggest legacy publishers clearly have an interest in slowing down ebook uptake .
Even though B&N and the big publishers are now in the ebook business , their competitive advantage exists heavily on the print side .
They recognize that they have to live in the ebook world to serve the authors and customers they ’ve had for years , so they do .
But I do n’t think a single big player in legacy publishing could give you a convincing description of how they maintain their scale and power when digital becomes the rule and print the exception .
Can that day possibly be more than 20 years away ?
Might it be 10 ?
I know a man that will take a bet that it will be five .
Apple and Kobo and Google and a slew of new players clearly have an interest in accelerating the growth of the ebook business because that ’s the only part of the book business they ’re in .
Amazon sells mostly print , but they sell print online .
As sales migrate from print to electronic , it is still good for the print business at Amazon .
Reducing print sales drives bookstores out of business , one by one .
They go out because their sales went down 10 % or 20 % or 30 % .
But the remaining 70 % or 80 % or 90 % of their print book business is demand to be redistributed .
When a store disappears , some of those sales migrate to online purchases .
And most of that moves to Amazon .
And , as we observed on this blog nearly a year ago , Amazon ’s position as an online print retailer would be much harder to dislodge than their position as a leading ebook retailer ( particularly with a major weapon — discount pricing on hot new titles — apparently being taken out of their hands by Agency pricing . )
Even though I believe that ebook hegemony will be harder for Amazon to defend than their dominance of online print , their strategy of pushing the move to digital reading has paid big dividends so far .
Amazon delivered the Kindle , which was the first really great catalyst to move people from print to digital .
( The iPhone was probably the second . )
It is clear that Amazon gained an enormous first mover advantage by doing that and succeeded in converting a large number of their best book - buying customers to digital .
Both Barnes & Noble and Borders have suffered same - store sales declines for the past two years .
Lots of those Kindle owners might have stopped buying some of their books in stores because they switched to electronic reading .
They ’re locked in to buying from Amazon until either there ’s another way to put books on their Kindle or they move on to another device .
Amazon created high switching costs for many of the best bookstore customers in the country .
So they now own business they used to compete for and , at the same time , diminish their brick - and - mortar competition driving more print book business to the web .
The big legacy publishers ’ greatest strength is their unique ability to handle print book distribution .
There really are only a handful of companies in this country ( the Big Six plus a few distributors and a tiny number of other publishers ) that can put a book into every brick - and - mortar outlet where a customer might buy one .
Doing that requires capabilities and relationships that you either have now or never will .
Although the big publishers and big authors have been allies fighting Amazon ’s selling policies because they want to preserve print - driven book pricing , in the longer run their interests diverge .
As ebook sales keep rising as a percentage of the total , the big publishers ’ position weakens and the big authors ’ position strengthens .
The book business has always been one with very low financial barriers to entry .
Ebook publishing makes getting into the game even cheaper .
It is also going to bring increased competition to book publishers from content - creators outside publishing .
None of this is appealing if your power as a publisher is the ability to control shelf space and get fast reprints .
I do n’t think anybody would want to be accused of being in favor of killing bookstores faster .
And very few of us would be comfortable having it said we were trying to slow down the progress of digital technology , strategizing to slow down ebook uptake .
But you are for one or the other , unless you do n’t have any opinion at all .

VALENTINE ’S DAY 2010 : Singles search for love by creating profiles on dating Web sites or posting ads on Craigslist or connecting to a far - flung network via social media .
It sounds so ... futuristic .
Except it ’s not .
Americans have been writing and reading personals  anonymous love notes , laments of missed connections , offers of marriage  for generations .
In the 19th century , as cities experienced enormous population growth , men and women invented new ways to find partners in an increasingly atomized world .
Amorous advertisements abounded in newspapers around the country ; the ads became so popular that one letter - writing manual even offered model replies .
Victorian critics derided the mostly male advertisers as wicked seducers , but the ads were a favorite among readers , who found them titillating glimpses into the hearts of strangers .
Though the ads below , taken from the pages of The New York Herald , are certainly less racy than what readers might find in publications today , they also feel surprisingly familiar , reminding us , perhaps , that we are not so different from our 19th - century counterparts  at least when it comes to looking for love .

PRESS RELEASE
Date Released : Thursday , January 14 , 2010
Source : KUSI-TV
Climate researchers have discovered that NASA researchers improperly manipulated data in order to claim 2005 as “ THE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD . ” KUSI - TV meteorologist , Weather Channel founder , and iconic weatherman John Coleman will present these findings in a one - hour special airing on KUSI - TV on Jan.14 at 9 p.m .
A related report will be made available on the Internet at 6 p.m. EST on January 14th at www.kusi.com.
In a new report , computer expert E. Michael Smith and Certified Consulting Meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo discovered extensive manipulation of the temperature data by the U.S. Government ’s two primary climate centers : the National Climate Data Center ( NCDC ) in Ashville , North Carolina and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) at Columbia University in New York City .
Smith and D’Aleo accuse these centers of manipulating temperature data to give the appearance of warmer temperatures than actually occurred by trimming the number and location of weather observation stations .
The report is available online at http://icecap.us/images/uploads/NOAAroleinclimategate.pdf.
The report reveals that there were no actual temperatures left in the computer database when NASA / NCDC proclaimed 2005 as “ THE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD . ”
The NCDC deleted actual temperatures at thousands of locations throughout the world as it changed to a system of global grid points , each of which is determined by averaging the temperatures of two or more adjacent weather observation stations .
So the NCDC grid map contains only averaged , not real temperatures , giving rise to significant doubt that the result is a valid representation of Earth temperatures .
The number of actual weather observation points used as a starting point for world average temperatures was reduced from about 6,000 in the 1970s to about 1,000 now .
“ That leaves much of the world unaccounted for , ” says D’Aleo .
The NCDC data are regularly used by the National Weather Service to declare a given month or year as setting a record for warmth .
Such pronouncements are typically made in support of the global warming alarmism agenda .
Researchers who support the UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) also regularly use the NASA / NCDC data , including researchers associated with the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia that is now at the center of the “ Climategate ” controversy .
This problem is only the tip of the iceberg with NCDC data .
“ For one thing , it is clear that comparing data from previous years , when the final figure was produced by averaging a large number of temperatures , with those of later years , produced from a small temperature base and the grid method , is like comparing apples and oranges , ” says Smith .
“ When the differences between the warmest year in history and the tenth warmest year is less than three quarters of a degree , it becomes silly to rely on such comparisons , ” added D’Aleo who asserts that the data manipulation is “ scientific travesty ” that was committed by activist scientists to advance the global warming agenda .
Smith and D’Aleo are both interviewed as part of a report on this study on the television special , “ Global Warming : The Other Side ” seen at 9 PM on January 14th on KUSI - TV , channel 9/51 , San Diego , California .
That program can now be viewed via computer at the website http://www.kusi.com/.

Polls in Key States show Public Option is Far More Popular Than Senate Plan
And yet only 20 senators of the 59 who caucus with the Democratic Party have signed the letter .
20 Democratic Senators have now signed on to a letter to their Senate leadership asking to push the public health care option through the United States Senate using the budget reconciliation process which only requires a total of 51 votes and would avoid a Republican filibuster .
But more surprising than the number of Senators who have signed on is the composition of the group .
At first the letter was drafted by four very progressive members of the Democratic caucus .
That was only a few days ago now , and no one expected that number to climb much higher because the budget reconciliation process has been seen as too partisan or at least too aggressive of a strategy for Democrats and a White House hell - bent on bipartisan cooperation .
Nonetheless , everyone from socialist Bernie Sanders to the very moderate Dianne Feinstein have now signed on .
Even the incredibly conservative Democrat Evan Bayh has expressed openness to the option in recent days .
Just two days ago , Chuck Schumer signed on , the first member of the Democratic leadership to do so .
And just yesterday Senate Majority Leader expressed his own willingness to push a public option through reconciliation .
The Public Option Comeback
As expected , there 's No Public Option in Obama Health Care Plan
But the adminstration is not opposed to it .
And it appears to understand that reconciliation likely is the only way to pass any reform bill :
While White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer insisted it was just a starting point for discussion , he also conceded that it was designed so that if no compromises can be cut with the GOP , it can be passed under the budget reconciliation loophole that needs just 51 votes .
snip " This plan provides the flexibility to do that if the Republican Party Decides to filibuster , " Pfeiffer said .
NY Daily News
We all know why politicans might be afraid of doing what 's popular .
Let 's keep the pressure on the Senate to include a public option in a reconciliation bill .
A reconciliation bill can include a public option .
It 's more popular than the rest of the bill .
And the adminstration does not oppose it .
So , let 's get it done .
We need more than 20 Democratic senators to sign the letter .

Former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska has signed on as a contributor to the Fox News Channel .
Jim Watson / Agence France - Presse — Getty Images
The network confirmed that Ms. Palin would appear on the network ’s programming on a regular basis as part of a multiyear deal .
Financial terms were not disclosed .
Ms. Palin will not have her own regular program , one person with knowledge of the deal said , though she will host a series that will run on the network from time to time .
This person would not elaborate , but the network does have a precedent for such a series .
Oliver L. North is the host of an occasionally running documentary series on the military called “ War Stories . ”
Many suspected that when Ms. Palin retired as the governor of Alaska last summer she was doing so to pursue some sort of career in television .
The Fox News deal , however , would not seem to be all - encompassing , and would appear to give her room for other pursuits , as well .
The deal was formally announced on Monday afternoon .
Robert Barnett , Ms. Palin ’s lawyer , did not respond to a call for comment .
“ I am thrilled to be joining the great talent and management team at Fox News .
It ’s wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news , ” Ms. Palin said in a statement .
WASHINGTON — Laws that forbid motorists from using hand - held phones or texting while driving do n't appear to result in a significant decrease in vehicle crashes , according to a new study by the Highway Loss Data Institute expected to be released Friday .
The study , expected to be released at a conference in Washington , D.C. , Friday , comes amid stepped - up efforts by federal highway - safety regulators to ban texting while driving and curb other forms of driver distraction .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood earlier this week announced rules to forbid commercial truck and bus drivers from text messaging while driving .
Mr. LaHood has said he would ban all texting while driving if he could .
The Transportation Department in a statement Friday criticized the HLDI findings , saying " it is irresponsible to suggest that laws banning cell phone use while driving have zero effect on the number of crashes on our nation 's roadways .
A University of Utah study shows that using a cell phone while driving can be just as dangerous and deadly as driving drunk .
We know that by enacting and enforcing tough laws , states have reduced the number of crashes leading to injuries and fatalities . "
The HLDI , a research organization sponsored by the insurance industry , studied data on monthly collision claims in four states that banned the use of hand - held phones by motorists before and after the bans went into effect .
The HLDI also compared collision data from states that enacted bans on driving while texting or phoning to accident claims in states that did n't enact such bans .
In New York , HLDI said its researchers found that collision claims decreased compared to other states , but the decrease began before the state 's ban on hand - held phoning took effect .
Falling in love is as crazy as bungee jumping .
Sometimes it gives you the feeling that you ’re on top of the world and you just want to fly high , or it makes you feel like jumping out of happiness when your special someone tells you that he or she loves you too .
But sometimes when the feeling ’s not mutual , it would make you feel like jumping to a bottomless pit out of humiliation , rejection , hurt and anger while asking yourself why you ever took the risk of revealing your true feelings to this person .
There is usually this “ special moment ” that would tell you if your friendship is going on the romantic side .
It could be the exchange of “ I love you , ” kissing , or a conversation where the other would tell you “ You are very special to me and I do n’t know what to do if I lose you .
You are everything to me . ”
Those are signs that would tell you that the other person is indeed crazy about you , and you are definitely more than just a friend .
There are some situations where you had your first kiss and it gives you the idea that you have crossed the boundaries of being friends to being lovers , but the following day the other starts acting strange , ignoring or avoiding you .
There are some people who are afraid of commitment and acts in a weird manner after the first kiss .
This would tell you that this “ something ” you shared with each other could be going nowhere though he or she felt that you are very special .
If ever this happens then how would you deal with it ?
Advice # 1
Back off for a bit , or in other words disappear for a while .
Give yourself time to think if this person is worth loving or not because of the way he or she acted .
There are people who ca n’t take too much pressure especially when they are not sure if what they did was what they really wanted , or they were just blown away by the intensity of the moment .
If this person likes you then he or she would definitely miss you the moment you disappear and eventually would come back for you .
Doing this would actually force the other to take some action , but if not , and he or she just let it go , then you have your answer .
Advice # 2
Be courageous to confront the person and ask his or her feelings towards you .
This is all or nothing but it is the simplest and most direct way to find out if the other person feels the same way .
This is a huge risk and you have to prepare yourself for what the other might say .
If the feeling is n’t mutual then you do n’t have to waste your time on this person who cannot love you the way you do to him or her .
You have this chance to find someone who can reciprocate the feeling that you have and be happy with that person .
But if the feeling is mutual , then would n’t it be a great relief that things are clear and both of you can concentrate on loving each other and improving your relationship ?
Friendship opens doors to a whole new world .
It can also lead to something special and romantic , but it can be at times confusing , difficult and crazy once feelings towards the other develop into something romantic .
So , are you just a friend or are you more than that ?
When we talk of love , we talk of risks , and once you chose to fall in love with a friend , you chose to take the risk that comes with love .
David Nexon had a big problem .
An early version of national healthcare legislation contained a $ 40 - billion tax aimed squarely at members of the medical device trade association he represents .
Nexon , a former advisor to the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) , went to work .
He marshaled 14 people like himself -- lobbyists who were once congressional aides , many of them from staffs of congressional leaders or committees that had a hand in crafting the healthcare overhaul .
When Senate Democrats unveiled their bill in mid-November , Nexon ’s handiwork was evident .
Though still large , the tax on device makers was halved .
Nexon ’s team is an illustration of how deeply the healthcare industry has embedded itself on Capitol Hill , using former aides of lawmakers and ex-lawmakers themselves .

An analysis of public documents by Northwestern University ’s Medill News Service in partnership with the Los Angeles Times Washington bureau and the Center for Responsive Politics found a revolving door between Capitol Hill staffers and lobbying jobs for companies with a stake in healthcare legislation .
At least 166 former aides from the nine congressional leadership offices and five committees involved in shaping healthcare overhaul legislation , along with at least 13 former lawmakers , registered to represent at least 338 healthcare clients since the beginning of last year , the analysis found .
Their healthcare clients spent $ 635 million on lobbying over the last two years , the study showed .
The total of insider lobbyists jumps to 278 when non-healthcare firms that reported lobbying on health issues are added in .

Part of the pressure on current members and staffers may come simply from the prospect of post - congressional jobs .
“ There ’s always a worry they may be thinking about their future employment opportunities when dealing with these issues , particularly with healthcare , because the stakes are so high and the breadth of the issues -- pharmacies , hospitals , doctors , " said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz .
Lobbyists ’ earnings can dwarf congressional salaries , which top out at $ 174,000 annually for members and $ 156,000 for an aide , though committee staffers can earn slightly more .
In the healthcare showdown , insider lobbying influence has magnified the clout of corporate interests and helped steer the debate away from a public insurance option , despite many polls indicating majority support from Americans , said Rutgers University political scientist Ross K. Baker .
Advertisement
“ It imposes a kind of conservative bias on the discussion , ” said Baker , himself a former Senate staffer .
“ The effect of it , for example , was to make single - payer a nonstarter from the very beginning . ”
The lineup of insiders working for clients with healthcare interests includes at least 14 former aides to House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) and at least 13 former aides to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , a key overseer of the healthcare overhaul .
Nexon , now senior executive vice president of the Advanced Medical Technology Assn. , is among at least half a dozen former Kennedy aides lobbying on healthcare .
Nexon said congressional connections had value , “ but in the end , it ’s not who I know , it ’s what I know . ”

It makes sense to hire former staffers for the healthcare showdown , Nexon said , because they tend to be “ more generalists , dealing with a broad range of issues ” -- something in demand for legislation that sprawls across at least half a dozen federal agencies and encompasses issues ranging from tax policy to hospital reimbursement rates .
But specific issues also get specialized help .
This year the Christian Science Church hired a former Kennedy staffer , Carolyn Osolinik , and three of her colleagues at the Mayer Brown law firm , all Capitol Hill veterans .
The firm has been paid at least $ 110,000 to push a provision requiring insurers to consider covering Christian Science prayer treatments .
The largest insider lobbying cadre belongs to the Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America , which employs at least 26 former members and staffers , according to the Medill / CRP research .
Two other drug interests , biotech firm Amgen and the Biotechnology Industry Organization trade group , with at least 24 and 16 insiders respectively , ranked second and fourth among entities that reported hiring former staffers or members over the last two years involved in healthcare issues .
“ The numbers should n’t surprise anyone , ” said Ken Johnson , a PhRMA senior vice president .
“ Former staffers have a unique understanding of how the legislative process works .
And when you are trying to advocate on behalf of smart public policies , you want smart people on your team . ”

But Bob Edgar , president of the citizens watchdog Common Cause , said “ a toxic cocktail of insiders and money ” had short - circuited a government - run plan that would have competed with private health insurers .
“ We ’ll get a bill .
And the president will sign it .
But it ’ll be less than the country deserves , ” said Edgar , a former six - term member of the House .

Earlier this week , the weather in Barcelona was very , very windy .
Little did we know at the time , but as we chattered our teeth in unison , Spain was about to set a world first .
From 3 am until 8 am on Sunday 8th November 2009 , more than 50 % of Spain ’s electricity was generated by wind – according to the Spanish Wind Energy Association , “ For several moments , wind energy had the honor of delivering up to 53 percent of total needs ” .
With high winds gusting across much of the country , Spain ’s huge network of windfarms jointly poured the equivalent of 11 nuclear power stations ’ worth of electricity into the national grid .
Driving around Andalucia with my family over the last couple of years , we ’ve often found ourselves in discussions about whether the wind farms are actually more of a blight on the environment ( at least aesthetically ) than a solution to the problem of generating energy sustainably .
Are we generating sustainable energy at the expense of our pristine landscapes forever ?

It may seem counterintuitive , but with the government reporting stronger - than - expected economic growth at the end of last year , now is the time to think about renewed recession  and to act to avoid it .
The economy grew at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
But well over half of that growth came from large adjustments to business inventories that are unlikely to be repeated on a similar scale in the months to come .
As such , they are evidence that the sick economy is recovering , not that it is healthy .
Another chunk of growth was due to government stimulus spending , which will wane in 2010 .
Much of the recent upsurge in business purchases of equipment and software was likely due to a rush to take advantage of an investment tax break before it expired in December .
So , what does it take to translate an incipient recovery into a sustained expansion ?
In a word : jobs .
Employment leads to income and to spending .
As sales deplete inventories , businesses restock , which creates more jobs and so on in an upward spiral .
is an unusual philosopher with unfashionably inflexible left - wing views .
He also loves Hollywood classics .
The 59 - year - old academic has written more than 30 books on subjects as diverse as Alfred Hitchcock , Lenin and 9/11 .
A self - proclaimed Leninist , the
thinker believes that “ communism will triumph finally ” .
On his first visit to India this week , Zizek spoke about global capitalism , Gandhi , Bollywood and Buddhism .
Excerpts from the interview :
You call yourself a Leninist but the media in the West has called you a ‘ rock star ’ and the ‘ Marx Brother ’ .
How do you react to such labels ?
You also do n’t care when they say that you glorify political violence .
But what ’s your stand on political violence ?
How can you dismiss Buddhism so easily ?
It ’s the fastest growing religion in the world .
You have also been critical of Gandhi .
You have called him violent .
Why ?
A lot of people will find it ridiculous to even imagine that Gandhi was more violent than Hitler ?
Are you serious when you say that ?
I guess you have no respect for Gandhi who is a tall figure in this country .
In your new book , ‘ First as Tragedy , Then as Farce ’ , you have analyzed the recent financial crisis .
Do you see it as an opportunity for the Left ?
You are a leftist philosopher who loves Hollywood classics .
Do n’t you see a contradiction there ?
You seem to have ignored Bollywood ...
You ca n’t be here just to see Bollywood flicks ?
With resigned melancholy .
They try to say that this guy may be interesting and provocative but he is not serious .
To them , I am like a fly that annoys you and provokes you but should not be taken seriously .
Though , of late , they have been dubbing me as someone more threatening .
In the last two years , the tone has changed .
First , there were Marx Brothers ’ jokes and now they say I am the most dangerous philosopher in the West .
But I do n’t care .
For me , the 20th century communism is the biggest ethical - political catastrophe in history , greater catastrophe than fascism .
But in the first years of the October Revolution , in spite of the so - called Red Terror , there was sexual liberation and literary explosion before it turned into a nightmare .
I do n’t accept the right - wing critique that says it was evil from the very beginning .
In an abstract sense , I am opposed to violence .
But nobody is actually against violence .
Look at the Buddhists .
They say you should n’t kill , but then they have all the exceptions .
During the 40s , one of the great Zen philosophers was writing articles not only justifying Japanese invasion of China but also giving advice on how Buddhist enlightenment allows you to kill without guilt .
In the West , Buddhism is the new predominant ideology .
Things are so unstable and confusing that with one speculation you can lose billions of dollars in a minute .
The only thing that can explain this is Buddhism which says that everything is an appearance .
That ’s why the Dalai Lama is so popular in Hollywood .
It ’s crucial to see violence which is done repeatedly to keep the things the way they are .
In that sense , Gandhi was more violent than Hitler .n
Yes .
Though Gandhi did n’t support killing , his actions helped the British imperialists to stay in India longer .
This is something Hitler never wanted .
Gandhi did n’t do anything to stop the way the British empire functioned here .
For me , that is a problem .
I respect him .
But I do n’t respect him for his peaceful ways , vegetarianism , etc .
I do n’t care about that .
But Gandhi somehow succeeded in carrying on his principled attitude with pragmatic spirit .
It ’s very difficult to maintain this balance .
But again I feel Ambedkar was much better than Gandhi .
My favourite one - liner from Ambedkar is “ no caste without outcasts ” .
I am for Ambedkar ’s radical approach towards the caste issue .
I do n’t believe my leftist friends who say this is a wonderful opportunity for the Left .
That ’s the tragedy of the Left .
There may be hundreds of protest movements against global capitalism but there is no alternative proposal .
A majority of the leftists today want global capitalism with a human face .
Hollywood is ambiguous but it ’s worth analysis .
The Hollywood products are the best indicators of where we are moving in our collective ideology .
If you look at reality , it ’s confusing , but in Hollywood you get the distilled version of reality .
At the same time , on the margins of Hollywood you have wonderful filmmakers such as Robert Altman and Woody Allen .
If you ignore Hollywood , you end up copying the worst of Hollywood .
That ’s why I am here .
It ’s chaotic and too colourful for us but I like this experience .
It ’s a different type of narrative .
It ’s like the medieval painting where you do n’t have to make a distinction between the foreground and background .
I like even the fake Bollywood like Slumdog Millionaire .
First , I resisted the movie , but I liked how it showed the brutality of life .
This is something unimaginable in the West .
It ’s a happy story but nonetheless the reality remains .
In the West , a feel - good story cannot be combined with brutal social reality .
No , I am here to study how the modern systems like the IT industry in Bangalore , and traditional way of life co-exist amid contradictions of globalization .
I have more hopes from India than China .
In China , we are witnessing the rise of authoritarian capitalism .
That ’s very scary .
The media loves stories .
They just love to sink their teeth into something , make it sound so much sweeter and run with it .
As with anything that comes out of the Super Bowl you need to have that story that can lead you into the 2010 season .
The New Orleans Saints shock the world , rebuild and become world champs … check !
Will Brett Favre return in 2010 … check !
Will we have football in 2011 … check !
Now the story that is making me scratch my head now is the story the media has developing for the Super Bowl XLIV runner - ups , the Indianapolis Colts .
Now the media needed to develop something for the Indianapolis Colts because the day after the Super Bowl … scratch that , HOURS after the Super Bowl … scratch that too , MINUTES after the Super Bowl they need to give a story to lead into next season for the Colts .
Now I am not an Indianapolis Colts fan , I do n’t like them , I do n’t hate them but the story the media developed for them going into the offseason made me ask my television if it still had integrity .
My television of course did not respond .
Moments after the Super Bowl , I tuned into the great four letter network located in Connecticut .
The network had a good NFL analyst on who at one time ( I ca n’t believe I ’m going to write this ) lead his team to a Super Bowl Championship .
His name is Trent Dilfer .
The story he brought up that the media would run with the next day on the Indianapolis Colts is something weeks prior we would never even consider .
He asked : “ Could Peyton Manning win the big one again ? ” I feel like I have heard that questions asked before … hmmm … let me go back a couple years back prior to the Super Bowl that pitted the Indianapolis Colts and the Chicago Bears and people were asking the same exact thing .
How would this game affect the legacy of Peyton Manning ?
Peyton Manning and the Colts ended up winning the Super Bowl .
Peyton ’s quest was complete as he could officially say he could win “ the big one . ”
So now we are asking ourselves whether or not the only 4 - time NFL MVP can make it back to the Super Bowl and win another Championship .
We are asking ourselves now whether or not Peyton ’s legacy will be remembered for the 4 NFL Championships or not being able to rack in massive amount of Vince Lombardi trophies .
I get it .
The NFL analysts love to compare Tom Brady and Peyton Manning .
They are the two top Quarterbacks in the NFL … wait a second , now all of a sudden people are putting Drew Brees into that exact same category .
Remember when Drew Brees was fighting for his job in San Diego and people were questioning what was next for Brees ?
Now all of a sudden ( and rightfully so ) Drew Brees popularity is higher then that of President Obama following his inauguration .
Republicans should run Brees in 2012 .
My personal opinion is Peyton Manning is one of the best Quarterbacks of all - time , if not the best .
Can you ever remember a Quarterback who could truly affect the performance of his team every Sunday ?
Peyton has carried that franchise on his back since he was drafted .
He made receivers like Reggie Wayne , Pierre Garcon and Dallas Clark into great players ; one of the reasons why Manning is such a good player , he makes the players around him better , similar to that of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls .
So here we are again trying to develop some sort of pressure upon the shoulders of the best Quarterback / player in the NFL today .
Screw asking ourselves whether or not Peyton can win a Championship …he ’s already done that !
We should now ask ourselves whether or not we will see # 18 on the field on Super Bowl Sunday ever again .
Let ’s create some pressure so we keep an eye on Peyton throughout the rest of his amazing , first ballot hall - of - famer career .
Will we see # 18 back on the field on Super Bowl Sunday ?
Who knows , I ’m a Green Bay Packers fan that was convinced in 1998 after losing to the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl that Favre would be back in a Super Bowl someday .
As we know , that has never happened since .
One never knows what will happen to a career but I would n’t bet against Peyton Manning .
To try and define someone ’s career on whether or not they can reach the pinnacle of their sports is something we all understand .
To be the man , you must beat the man .
Peyton has climbed that mountain before and it will have it struggles , but to ask ourselves whether or not someone can do it again is a little much .
The sports media needs to look at the negative of a situation and create an obstacle for a team or an athlete .
Manning and the Colts will be motivated going into 2010 , it ’s a young team , a different version of the Super Bowl Championship team and I ’m not going to put money down on saying Manning will never get there again .
When it ’s all said and done Manning will probably hold just about every Quarterback record , making him statistically the greatest of all - time .
The argument of who is the greatest is another story but when it comes to reaching that championship pinnacle again how could you bet against a 4 - time NFL MVP , the only one in the history of the NFL ?

His pristine Ferrari 512 BBi “ Boxer ” sits in the middle of Holger Schubert ’s living room in Brentwood , right next to stylish furniture , a built - in bookcase and a flat - screen TV that slides on tracks past walls of glass that frame an ocean view .
But Los Angeles officials are about to slam shut forever the garage door that leads to the city ’s most extravagant parking space .
City planners have withdrawn permission for Schubert to use a bridge to connect his Ferrari ’s third - floor resting spot with North Tigertail Road .
The ruling by the West Los Angeles Area Planning Commission tosses a mechanic ’s wrench into Schubert ’s hopes of using the showpiece garage that last year won Architectural Digest magazine ’s Design Driven contest .
Neighbors complained about the bridge , alleging that the city erroneously approved its construction to create both a safety hazard and a development precedent that could degrade hillside neighborhoods throughout the city .
Schubert , a 43 - year - old product designer , contends that neighbors turned against the bridge in retaliation for his home - remodeling project taking so long -- about five years , so far .
The ruling sets the stage for the city to issue an enforcement order that will force Schubert to tear down the 10 - foot - long , 15 - foot - high bridge if he does not obtain a zoning variance for it or win a court reprieve that preserves it .
That would mean that his prized gray 1984 Ferrari would have to give up its unique living - room parking spot .
Schubert blames the lengthy structural engineering design work needed for the garage for slowing down the remodeling project that he and wife , Yuriko , have undertaken at their two - acre property in the Brentwood hills .
Along with its ocean view , its crisp skylight - accented ceiling and modernist furniture , the garage features a hydraulic ramp that lifts the front end of the Ferrari up to allow Schubert to coast his gleaming car back out onto his bridge without starting the engine .
No Ferrari fumes in this house .
“ I wanted to create a backdrop for the car as a piece of art , ” Schubert said last year after winning the architectural magazine ’s contest .
“ This is a space whose only purpose is to enjoy the car . ”
Neighbors say that Schubert first tried to get permission to build a pedestrian bridge to connect the living room area with the street .
They say they balked at that on grounds that such a walkway did not comply with the city ’s building rules .
Critics contend that Schubert then sought permission to build an even wider driveway bridge .
At Wednesday evening ’s commission session , they argued that the city approved the bridge only after being told that the top - floor garage was necessary for Schubert to comply with city off - street parking rules .
In reality , Schubert had ample parking space near a three - car garage that he demolished in order to make room for the remodel , said Victor de la Cruz , a lawyer for neighbor William Burnside .
De la Cruz said Schubert was warned as he began building the driveway bridge that there was opposition to the bridge and that he was constructing it at his own risk .
Burnside , 58 , a senior vice president of a Los Angeles consulting group who has lived on Tigertail Road for 22 years , said neighbors and the Brentwood Homeowners Assn. oppose the bridge for a variety of reasons -- not because Schubert ’s remodeling project has dragged on seemingly forever .
“ I think the major issue here is the precedent it would set in the city ” he said .
Residents are also worried about the safety of Schubert backing his Ferrari over the narrow bridge and onto the curving hillside street .
“ That , plus he has a two - acre property that has perfectly good access from elsewhere , ” Burnside said .
Schubert said he has spent about $ 1.5 million on the remodel and does n’t relish the thought of losing his Ferrari garage or ripping out the bridge .
He only drives the rare , vintage sports car when Westside traffic is light , he said .
He hunted for 11 years before he found the car and purchased it .
“ This is how people with money and power can make white seem black , ” Schubert said after the commission vote .
His attorney , Jerold B. Neuman , complained to planners that after Schubert received the permit to build the bridge 18 separate city inspections occurred “ and no one raised an issue ” signaling any problem with its legality .
“ They ’ve set the stage for the city to say , ‘ Tear down the bridge , ’ ” Neuman said .
That means the next rumbling sound heard from Tigertail Road will probably be lawyers ’ copy machines churning out court briefs , not the throaty full - throttle of a Ferrari 512 BBi .

• US military warns of imminent Chinese attack on the island •
Ties strain as China deploys 1,000 missiles opposite Taiwan
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
US military officials said today they would provide Taiwan with weapons to protect itself from a possible Chinese attack , despite Beijing 's warning that such sales could lead to conflict .
The officials told a congressional hearing that China was preparing for a fight against the island .
The military build - up , which includes 1,000 ballistic missiles deployed opposite Taiwan , is in contrast to the improved ties between the rivals since the 2008 election of Taiwan president Ma Ying - jeou .
The comments follow China 's announcement that it intercepted a missile during a test of new technology .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Despite revelations in a congressional investigation of a subsidiary 's mismanagement and questionable vetting of employees , the company formerly known as Blackwater could soon win millions of dollars in new job orders for work in Afghanistan .
A subsidiary of Xe , the new name for Blackwater , is eligible to win Department of Defense work worth tens of millions of dollars to train Afghan police , according to a Pentagon official .
Five companies were qualified to bid on the training and training - support contracts , including Raytheon , Northrop Grumman , Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems , ARINC and the U.S. Training Center .
U.S. Training Center is a subsidiary company owned by Xe .
The Pentagon contract is to be announced next month .
Xe has not been officially notified whether it will be awarded the contract , according to a company spokesman .
" We have not been awarded either and have no knowledge of the status of those contracts , " said Xe spokesman Mark Corallo .
An industry official told CNN that Xe made bids on two task orders under the training program , one for the actual training of Afghan police and one for logistics support for such training .
Once awarded , the new orders would be in effect until August 2012 , according to a Department of Defense statement .
Since 2007 , the company , then called Blackwater , has held the rights to bid against the other four companies on a pool of jobs worth as much as $ 15 billion .
Xe still holds numerous contracts under three company names in Afghanistan for support of military and intelligence operations .
Those companies are US Training Center , Greystone and Presidential Airways .
The company has a troubled past both in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was banned from operating in Iraq by the government there after a shooting incident left Iraqi civilians dead and injured .
That incident strained relations between the United States and Iraq .
In May 2009 , four contractors in Kabul were involved in a shooting incident that left two Afghan civilians dead .
Two of the contractors are now facing charges in the United States .
A congressional investigation found evidence that the company that hired them , a Xe subsidiary called Paravant , armed the employees despite having no permission to do so from the U.S. military .
The probe also found that the company illicitly obtained the guns used in the shooting , and hundreds of others , from a stockpile of weapons meant for the use of the Afghan military and police .
On Wednesday Xe officials were called before the Senate Armed Service Committee to discuss that shooting incident .
The committee 's chairman , Carl Levin , D - Michigan , said an Army investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had " violated alcohol consumption policies , were not authorized to possess weapons , violated use - of - force rules and violated movement - control policies . "
He said one of the keys to beating the Taliban in Afghanistan is the ability of U.S. forces to win support from the Afghan people , many of whom do not distinguish between U.S. contractors and the U.S. military .
Xe Services Vice President Fred Roitz acknowledged the company 's culpability in the 2009 incident in his opening statement to the panel .
In the statement , Roitz said , " the new Xe Services would act differently today .
We simply will not send our personnel overseas without a proper authorization for a weapon ( where needed ) and without full compliance with all requirements . "
He said the company has " put in place new leadership and procedures to help ensure this commitment is kept . "
On Thursday , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell defended the military 's oversight of contractors .
" We 've made a lot of mistakes in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
And we 've tried to address those mistakes in a number of ways , " Morrell said .
" But as far as I know , people are being held to account for the mistakes and the violations that they have made . "

Custom UV Stickers Printing – Guerrilla Marketing
“ Guerrilla Marketing is an advertising strategy that focuses on low - cost unconventional marketing tactics that yield maximum results .
It is about taking the consumer by surprise , make an indelible impression and create copious amounts of social buzz .
“ Guerrilla marketing is said to make a far more valuable impression on consumers compared to more traditional forms of advertising and marketing .
This is because most guerrilla marketing campaigns strike consumers at a more personal and memorable level .
Check out some of these examples :
You can use different promotional materials to execute guerilla marketing such as posters , print cards , street art and more .
A great guerilla marketing campaign that took place in 1989 which was dubbed as Andre the Giant Has a Posse , used stickers .
The campaign was fueled by the creative genius of Frank Shepard Fairey and started as an inside - joke for the skater and hip - hop community .
By the early 1990s , tens of thousands of stickers were being made and put in public places around the world !
By observing and learning from the success of “ Andre the Giant Has a Posse ” , we can learn a few tips on how we too can succeed at this affordable and viral marketing concept .
1. Laughter is contagious and worth sharing .
Because Fairey and friends chose to use an inside joke for their sticker design that many people could relate to , they set the stage for viral distribution .
The natural response from the community was to share a laugh with friends .
2. Good design never fails .
As a renowned graphic illustrator and designer , Fairey had a good eye for good design .
If you do not have the expertise to create an amazing design yourself , do n’t fail to invest in finding the right person .
3. Familiarity promotes recognition .
Using something that your audience is familiar with and can relate to is important .
The use of a famous / notorious wrestling star like Andre the Giant helped the sticker grab people ’s attention .
4 . Keep your initial investment low .
Guerilla marketing can be a hit or miss .
Fairey did n’t intend to make an international viral sticker campaign .
The use of stickers was a safe decision since you can be creative in your design and mass produce them at low costs .
The success of any marketing campaign starts with a goal , proper timing and execution .
It is also important to choose the right materials for your campaign and know how to use them wisely .
Be sure to study each element of your campaign and understand how they ’ll work well altogether .
Yves Rossy , aka " Jet man " and " Fusion Man , " has grabbed headlines with his jet - powered flights with an 8 - foot wing strapped to his back .
But he could be joined sometime soon by commandos on an airborne assault .
Last year , Rossy successfully flew 22 miles across the English Channel .
Last week 's attempt to cross from Africa to Europe by flying from Morocco to Spain was less successful .
Strong winds were against him , and Rossy ended up in the sea three miles short of the coast .
Undaunted , the Swiss former military pilot now plans to fly across the Grand Canyon .
Rossy has reportedly refused requests from the military and stated that his powered wing , which cost more than $ 190,000 to develop , is only for aviation enthusiasts .
However , he 's not the only one in the wingsuit business .
The Special Parachute and Logistics Consortium , is a German venture between two companies with expertise in this area .
SPELCO produces a variety of parachute systems , helmets , oxygen supplies and other gear and services .
But their most eye - catching project is the Gryphon Next Generation Parachute System ( PDF , pictured ) .
This is described as a modular upgrade for parachute systems for use in " high - altitude , high - opening " jump missions , typically carried out by Special Forces .
This 6 - foot wing gives a glide ratio of 5:1 , which means that a drop from 30,000 feet will allow you to glide about 30 miles .
The makers estimate that this would take around 15 minutes , giving an average speed of about 60 miles an hour .
" All equipment is hidden in a lifting body optimized for stealth , the radar - signature is extremely low , " says the Gryphon data sheet ( PDF ) .
" Detection of incoming Gryphon soldiers by airborne or ground radar will be extremely difficult . "
Gryphon has a guidance system and heads - up display navigation .
Best of all , the company are looking at an option for bolting on small engines similar to those used in Yves Rossy 's setup .
These will increase the range to more than 60 miles , but will also make it possible to cover long distances from low altitude so that the entire mission can be more stealthy .
The company does not seem to have had any public offers for Gryphon yet – although , given the nature of likely customers , those offers might be kept relatively quiet .
Wingsuits are an addition to normal parachutes that allow better gliding .
A parachute has to be deployed in order to land .
However , wingsuit skydivers want to overcome this and are developing techniques to land safely without a parachute .
This sounds like a practically suicidal manuever , but it seems likely that in the next few years technology and the careful application of technique will make it possible to land with a wingsuit alone .
It 's certainly possible from a theoretical aerodynamic point of view , but whether it 's practical may be another matter .
This might just be the future for ultrastealthy airborne assault .
Aided by extremely precise instruments and a flight computer , the wingman comes in at low level and high speed , before pulling up and dropping gently to the ground at exactly the right spot .
It might sound wild , but it would certainly surprise the bad guys .

One of the cushiest and least risky assignments over the past year for the big bond funds has been their agency assignments on various Treasury - mandated security purchasing programs to bail out the market : these have been the definition of free money .
The PPIP program has been a good case in point , which in recent months has been somewhat dormant ever since the administration realized it could generate a much greater IRR by purchasing index futures than toying around with AAA - rated CMBS , in which bond fund TCW was a key partner of the Treasury .
Yet in a striking example of rational thought , the government has demonstrated it knows what " key man " provisions are .
And after TCW fired Gundlach for having " too lofty " an aspiration , the Treasury has decided to fire TCW as a PPIP manager for the Treasury in turn .
Poetic justice .
Market News points out that " the government has gone to great lengths to ensure it retains the right to end the partnership if certain conditions are not met , including the departure of key individuals from the private partner . "
" Treasury was careful to ensure the legal documents that implemented PPIP contained many provisions designed to protect taxpayers ' investments , " Williams told Market News International .
" One of these grants Treasury additional rights if certain key professionals leave the firm . "
In the case of TCW , the clause was triggered after Jeffery Gundlach , chief investment officer of TCW 's UST / TCW Senior Mortgage Securities Fund -- and said to be one of the top - performing bond managers of all time -- was fired on Dec. 4 .
This moved led the Treasury to freeze the $ 1 billion public - private facility set up by TCW to buy toxic assets , with the firm unable to make investments or dispositions , other than those necessary to avoid losses .
" The initiation of the wind - down of the TCW PPIF because of key person departures is a good example of how provisions like these can be used to protect taxpayers ' interests , " Williams said .
He said that as a result of " certain key investment professionals " at TCW leaving the firm , Treasury , the private investors and TCW have agreed , after careful consideration , that it is in the best interest of all investors to end the TCW PPIF investment period , release each limited partner ( including Treasury ) from its capital commitment to the fund and to liquidate the fund in manner that maximizes value to all investors .
Whether the $ 1 billion reduction in AUM will hit TCW 's broader assets under management is unknown , but explaining to their LPs why they had to drop even this token amount over some unchecked pride and hubris should be amusing .
The beneficiaries of this action will be the other 8 leftover managers , of which one of the primary ones , ironically , is Howard Marks '
Oaktree , which is a minority investor in Gundlach 's new firm .
The long running case of Jacobsen v. Katzer has been settled on terms favourable to Jacobsen , a developer of the Java Model Railroad Interface project .
The case came about when Katzer incorporated Jacobsen 's code into it 's proprietary model trail software , after deleting the copyright notices that existed in the code .
The court first found that the code in question was sufficiently original to be entitled to copyright protection ; a legal hurdle which had to be overcome to assert copyright claims .
The court also found that although the JMRI project made its work available for free , there was evidence of a monetary value in the work performed by contributors , and therefore a basis for monetary damages .
Finally , the court ruled that the removal of the copyright and author information was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
The court did not agree to enter an injunction against Katzer , but it appears Katzer decided to settle with Jacobsen and end the proceedings .
According to the settlement documents , Katzer will pay Jacobsen $ 100,000 over the next 18 months , stop using the projects code and not attempt to trademark or register domains using the names of JMRI projects .
The settlement means that the law suit is dismissed with prejudice and cannot be refiled by either party .
In a posting on ConsortiumInfo.org , lawyer Andy Updegrove said " F/OSS has achieved a significant victory that will provide comfort to developers that their expectations will be satisfied when they contribute code to a software project " .
He pointed out that although other US court circuits are not bound by the decision , the California court is well respected and its conclusions will be influential .

A CABINET - MAKER has been ordered to destroy his skimpy work shorts after exposing himself to eight women while performing renovations on their kitchens , a court has been told .
Mark Stephen Owen , 50 , pleaded guilty in the Brisbane Magistrates Court today to 12 counts of performing indecent acts at various Brisbane homes between 1999 and 2008 .
Prosecutor Lewis Shillito told the court Owen wore skimpy shorts or stripped down to his underwear while he worked , allowing what the women described as an " extremely large " penis to poke out from the fabric .
The court was told Owen would also masturbate in front of the women , aged between 45 and 83 , and rub cream onto his exposed genitals while complaining of a rash .
Mr Shillito said Owen 's actions made the women feel uncomfortable but that all allowed him to finish the renovations .
Only one woman initially reported Owen to the police but more came forward after police made a public appeal for help .
Owen , from Victoria Point , was given a nine - month jail term for the offences but was released immediately on probation for three years .
He was also fined $ 1000 after pleading guilty to two counts of possessing child abuse computer games .
Magistrate Noel Nunan ordered
Owen 's work shorts , which were seized by police , be destroyed .
He also refused Owen 's request for the return of penis rings he had worn to work to enlarge his genitals .
WASHINGTON — Overruling two important precedents about the First Amendment rights of corporations , a bitterly divided Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the government may not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections .
The 5 - to - 4 decision was a vindication , the majority said , of the First Amendment ’s most basic free speech principle — that the government has no business regulating political speech .
The dissenters said that allowing corporate money to flood the political marketplace would corrupt democracy .
The ruling represented a sharp doctrinal shift , and it will have major political and practical consequences .
Specialists in campaign finance law said they expected the decision to reshape the way elections were conducted .
Though the decision does not directly address them , its logic also applies to the labor unions that are often at political odds with big business .
The decision will be felt most immediately in the coming midterm elections , given that it comes just two days after Democrats lost a filibuster - proof majority in the Senate and as popular discontent over government bailouts and corporate bonuses continues to boil .

A federal appeals court this week ruled that a California police officer can be held liable for injuries suffered by an unarmed man he Tasered during a traffic stop .
The decision , if allowed to stand , would set a rigorous legal precedent for when police are permitted to use the weapons and would force some law enforcement agencies throughout the state -- and presumably the nation -- to tighten their policies governing Taser use , experts said .
Michael Gennaco , an expert in police conduct issues who has conducted internal reviews of Taser use for the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department and other agencies , said the ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals prohibits officers from deploying Tasers in a host of scenarios and largely limits their use to situations in which a person poses an obvious danger .
“ This decision talks about the need for an immediate threat .
. . .
Some departments allow Tasers in cases of passive resistance , such as protesters who wo n’t move , ” he said .
Tasering for “ passive resistance is out the door now with this decision .
Even resistance by tensing or bracing may not qualify . ”
The weapons , which resemble handguns , can be fired from about 20 feet away and project two dartlike electrodes .
The electrodes send an electrical charge coursing through the target -- a shock that temporarily paralyzes the person ’s muscles and causes extreme pain .
Almost all of the stun guns used by law enforcement agencies in the United States are manufactured by Taser International Inc. , including the one fired in the current case .
Advertisement
Though stun guns have been in use for about three decades , the number of police departments issuing them to officers has proliferated in the last 10 years .
Advocates tout the weapons as a less - than - lethal alternative to firearms and say they help resolve dangerous face - to - face confrontations with combative suspects .
But several controversial Taser incidents , some involving fatalities , have led to widespread debate over when police should be allowed to deploy the weapons .
Last year , a National Institute of Justice study found that the weapons were employed safely in the vast majority of cases , but concluded that more research is needed to determine the health effects of shocking small children and the elderly , among other groups .
The unanimous ruling , issued Monday by a three - judge panel , stemmed from a 2005 encounter in which a former Coronado , Calif. , police officer , Brian McPherson , stopped a man for failing to wear a seat belt while driving .
The driver , Carl Bryan , who testified that he did not hear McPherson order him to remain in the car , exited the vehicle and stood about 20 feet away from the officer .
Bryan grew visibly agitated and angry with himself , but did not make any verbal threats against McPherson , according to court documents .
McPherson has said he fired his Taser when Bryan took a step toward him -- a claim Bryan has denied .
Bryan ’s face slammed against the pavement when he collapsed , causing bruises and smashing four front teeth .
Advertisement
The appellate court did not rule on whether McPherson acted appropriately , but simply cleared the way for Bryan to pursue a civil case against the officer and the city of Coronado in a lower court .
Based on Bryan ’s version of events , though , the judges found that McPherson used excessive force in firing the Taser , since Bryan did not appear to pose any immediate threat .
In spelling out their decision , the judges established legally binding standards about where Tasers fall on the spectrum of force available to police officers , and laid out clear guidelines for when an officer should be allowed to use the weapon .
The judges , for example , said Tasers should be considered a more serious use of force than pepper spray -- a distinction that runs counter to policies used by most law enforcement agencies in California and elsewhere , according to Greg Meyer , a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain and consultant on use - of - force issues .
The ruling does not appear to affect the LAPD , which has a relatively strict policy on Taser use .
Gennaco said that the same is more or less true of the Sheriff ’s Department , but that he would discuss with Sheriff Lee Baca the possible need for “ tweaking ” the policy and training .
The Orange County Sheriff ’s Department seems more likely to be affected .
Spokesman John McDonald said the department ’s policy allows officers to fire Tasers at people who try to flee an encounter with police or who refuse , for example , to comply with an officer ’s order to lie down during an arrest .
Those scenarios appear to be prohibited under the court ’s ruling .

“ It sounds like this court is attempting to raise the bar for nonlethal use of force , ” Meyer said .

SINCE the start of 2010 , your correspondent has amused himself by interpreting the date as a binary number , and then converting that into its decimal equivalent .
Expressed internationally as dd.mm.yy , the first day of this year was 010110 .
In decimal form , that works out to be 24+22+21=22 .
The game is pointless , of course .
But it has made him ponder the whole date and time arrangement people take for granted .
There are only four years a century when you can play this little game .
In the current century , two years ( 2000 and 2001 ) have already passed .
Like the previous pair , the two that remain ( 2010 and 2011 ) contain only three days ( 1st , 10th and 11th ) in three months ( January , October and November ) that lend themselves to this phoney binary treatment .

Obviously , the smallest binary number in this century 's set was January 1st at the turn of the millennium ( 010100 ) .
The largest will be November 11th next year , when all the bits in the six - digit sequence are present ( 111111 ) .
In decimal terms , that is equal to 25+24+23+22+21+20= 63 .
There is nothing magical about such a number , though November 11th does happen to be the birthday of a member of your correspondent 's family .
For his own amusement , 63 of something will figure in the celebration .
All this playing around with binary numbers has made him wonder why binary time — or , for that matter , decimal time — never caught on in the Western world .
Decimal time has been tried on many occasions .
Indeed , a decimal calendar based on a ten - month year was used by Romans during the time of Romulus and Remus .
Their calendar ran from March to December .
The two missing months needed to make up a solar year were dismissed as winter when nothing grew or happened — and therefore not worth worrying about .
The ancient Egyptians were far smarter .
For three millennia before Christ , they used a 12 - month calendar , with each month comprising three ten - day weeks .
Five rogue days were tacked on the end of the cycle to complete the solar year .
By the time of Augustus , the so - called Alexandrian calendar had even incorporated an additional day for leap years .
This was essentially the decimal calendar that the French introduced during the revolution .
But the French Republic 's official ten - day week lasted for little more than a dozen years before Napoleon abolished it in 1806 .
Ironically , when the French invented the metric system in 1795 , two years after they changed the calendar , they decimalised everything except time .
There were base units for length , area , volume , weight and even currency .
But seconds and minutes , hours and days , weeks and months were left unscathed .
That , along with the failure to decimalise the compass , was perhaps the metrication commission 's biggest setback .
Its august president , the noted mathematician Joseph - Louis Lagrange , tried in vain to get the Republic to adopt the déci- jour and centi-jour ( a tenth and a hundredth of a day , respectively ) .
But the decimal calendar was deemed enough of a gesture to the new age of rationalism , even though it did not comply with the strict divisions and multiples of ten , and used none of the metric system 's prefixes ( milli - , centi- , deci- , deca- , hecto- , kilo - , etc ) .
Even so , the idea of a centi-jour ( 14.4 minutes ) has cropped up on several occasions since .
One reason is that a ten - hour clock , with each hour divided into 100 decimal minutes , and each decimal minute sub - divided into 100 decimal seconds , would make navigation easier — provided , of course , you had a decimal sextant and compass to go with it .
Decimal time and longitude would then correlate directly without the need for logarithmic conversion tables .
Even the Royal Geographical Society in Victorian England was keen on decimal navigation , and published tables to convert sexagesimal angles and hours into centi-jours and their decimal subdivisions .
Numerous clocks were made in France and elsewhere during the 19th century with faces showing both the numbers 1 - 12 for standard time and 1 - 10 for decimal time .
The supposed advantage was that any observer with a decimal chronometer and a view of the sun 's height above the horizon would then know instantly where on the planet he was .
With 100 decimal degrees ( or “ gons ” as they became known ) to a right - angle , and the distance from the pole to the equator being almost exactly 10,000 kilometres , 1 km along the surface subtends an angle of one centigon ( a hundredth of a decimal degree ) at the centre of the Earth .
Had it come to pass , decimal time and decimal angular measurement might have done for the 19th century what GPS did for the 20th .
But the French were not the first to think of the ten - hour day , nor even the centi-jour .
Like the Egyptians with their decimal calendar , the Chinese used decimal ( not to mention duodecimal ) time several millennia before Christ .
Since the beginning of history , they have divided the day into a 100 equal parts called ke ( 14.4 minutes ) , and split each of those into 60 fen ( 14.4 seconds ) .
When Jesuit missionaries introduced Western clocks to China in the 17th century , the local inhabitants simply changed the number of divisions in a day from 100 to 96 , making a ke equal to exactly 15 minutes .
To this day , the term ke is used in China to denote “ a quarter of a hour ” .
In Japan , the same character ( pronounced either “ koku ” or “ kizamu ” ) translates roughly into “ carving out a small amount of time ” and was used , until the Meiji era , to signify “ hour ” , while the character for fen ( pronounced “ fûn ” in Japanese ) is used to this day to denote “ minute ” .
Ultimately , the only unit of time that really matters is the second .
Originally , the internationally accepted system of units known as SI ( Système International d'Unités ) defined the second as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day — simply the inverse of the number of seconds in 24 hours .
But irregularities in the rotation of the Earth made that unreliable .
Thus , in 1967 , SI adopted a more precise definition based on the frequency of the radiation a caesium atom emits when it flips between two energy states .
No ifs and buts , at absolute zero temperature , this is exactly 9,192,631,770 hertz .
Physicists have no trouble using , on the one hand , picoseconds ( trillionths of a second ) or even femtoseconds ( quadrillionths of a second ) to discuss time at the atomic scale .
They also talk cheerfully of 1018 seconds needed for light to travel from the farthest reaches of the universe .
Likewise , in computing , “ Unix Time ” gives the date and time in terms of the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 , and Microsoft's “ Filetime ” is recorded as multiples of 100 - nanosecond units since January 1st 1601 .
But computer scientists are just as likely to divide their day into hexadecimal hours , with each hour broken up into hexadecimal minutes .
( The 16 - base hexadecimal system uses the numbers 0 - 9 followed by the letters A - F. )
The hexadecimal day begins at midnight at .0000 .
One second after midnight , the time is .0001 .
Half a day later , noon arrives at .8000 .
A second before the next midnight is .
FFFF .
Got it ?
Your correspondent neither .
In normal life , people have to go to work , arrange schedules , catch planes and trains , and pick up children from school at given times .
The number of seconds needed to do such useful things has to be given names everyone recognises and agrees upon .
It would be nice if such units of time were decimal multiples of one another .
Unfortunately , here on planet Earth , with its decidedly undecimal sidereal year of 365 - and - a- quarter days , that is just not going to happen .

Even in 1978 , the very year he orchestrated the mass - suicide that ended over 900 lives in Jonestown , cult leader Jim Jones could count on people as influential as politician Harvey Milk – recently the subject of an Academy Award - winning movie – to fight his corner in his absence .
With Jones and congregation relocated to Guyana following increased speculation about the church in San Francisco , Milk – an advocate of Peoples Temple and personal correspondent of its founder – wrote the following letter to then - President Jimmy Carter in an effort to defend Jones ’ reputation in light of comments made by former member Timothy Stoen .
Nine months later , on November 18th , 1978 , Congressman Leo Ryan and four others were shot dead as they attempted to leave Jonestown following an inspection of the settlement and then , fearing the end was near , Jim Jones instructed his followers to poison themselves and commit ‘ revolutionary suicide ’ .
Just days later , as San Francisco began to come to terms with the loss of many former residents , both Harvey Milk and Mayor Moscone were shot to death by Dan White .

CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
CITY HALL , SAN FRANCISCO 94102
SUPERVISOR HARVERY MILK February 19 , 1978 President Jimmy Carter
The White House
Washington , D.C. 20500 Dear President Carter : I am the Supervisor for District Five in the City of San Francisco .
The Peoples Temple Christian Church is not located in my District , so I have no political ties or obligations to this church .
I am writing to call an urgent concern of theirs to your attention .
I am concerned at what I understand is the endorsement of some of our Congressmen for the efforts of Timothy Stoen against Rev. Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple .
There are some facts I feel you should be informed of : Rev. Jones is widely known in the minority communities here and elsewhere as a man of the highest character , who has undertaken constructive remedies for social problems which have been amazing in their scope and effectiveness .
He is also highly regarded amongst church , labor , and civic leaders of a wide range of political persuasions .
Our own Board of Supervisors has presented Rev. Jones with a Certificate of Honor , unanimously passed by all members , praising the church for its many projects “ which have been so beneficial to all the citizens of the Bay Area . ”
On the same occasion , he was also presented with a unanimously passed resolution by a Republican State Senator , Milton Marks representing that legislative body .
Timothy and Grace Stoen , the parties that are attempting to damage Rev. Jones ’ reputation , and seriously disrupt the life of his son , John , have both already been discredited in the news media here .
The most widely - read columnist in the area , Herb Caen , printed Mr. Stoen ’s sworn testimony that John is not his child but rather Rev. Jones .
Grace Stone is reported involved in what could be considered a blackmail attempt against another leader in the minority community , Dennis Banks , reported in the two major dailies with her name also given in Mr. Banks ’ sworn affadavit about the attempt .
It is outrageous that Timothy Stoen could even think of flaunting this situation in front of our Congressmen with apparently bold - faced lies .
I have learned in addition , that he has pressured these Congressmen towards unwitting compliance with promoting State Department intervention in the custody case now pending in Guyana .
Not only is the life of a child at stake , who presently has loving protective parents in Rev. and Mrs. Jones , but our official relations with Guyana could stand to be jeopardized , to the potentially great embarassment of our State Department .
Mr. President , the actions of Mr. Stoen need to be brought to a halt .
It is offensive to most in the San Francisco community , and all those who know Rev. Jones to see this kind of an outrage taking place .
Respectfully , ( Signed , ‘ Harvey Milk ’ ) Harvey Milk cc : Rep. John Burton ; Rep. Phillip Burton ; Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally
STEPHEN Conroy has been a guest of the three main commercial television networks at some of Australia 's biggest sporting events during his time as Communications Minister .
Parliamentary documents reveal that Senator Conroy has attended soccer , football , motor racing and horse racing events as guest of the networks and other companies that depend on his decisions for millions of dollars in revenue .
The disclosures come as Senator Conroy faces continuing pressure over his decision to grant a rebate to the free - to - air networks worth $ 250 million over the next two years .
Days after that decision , it emerged Senator Conroy had been skiing in Colorado with Seven Network chairman Kerry Stokes last month .
According to the parliamentary documents , some of the freebies enjoyed by Senator Conroy include :
eso1005 — Photo Release
The Stars behind the Curtain
ESO is releasing a magnificent VLT image of the giant stellar nursery surrounding NGC 3603 , in which stars are continuously being born .
Embedded in this scenic nebula is one of the most luminous and most compact clusters of young , massive stars in our Milky Way , which therefore serves as an excellent “ local ” analogue of very active star - forming regions in other galaxies .
The cluster also hosts the most massive star to be “ weighed ” so far .
NGC 3603 is a starburst region : a cosmic factory where stars form frantically from the nebula ’s extended clouds of gas and dust .
Located 22 000 light - years away from the Sun , it is the closest region of this kind known in our galaxy , providing astronomers with a local test bed for studying intense star formation processes , very common in other galaxies , but hard to observe in detail because of their great distance from us .
The nebula owes its shape to the intense light and winds coming from the young , massive stars which lift the curtains of gas and clouds revealing a multitude of glowing suns .
The central cluster of stars inside NGC 3603 harbours thousands of stars of all sorts ( eso9946 ) : the majority have masses similar to or less than that of our Sun , but most spectacular are several of the very massive stars that are close to the end of their lives .
Several blue supergiant stars crowd into a volume of less than a cubic light - year , along with three so - called Wolf - Rayet stars — extremely bright and massive stars that are ejecting vast amounts of material before finishing off in glorious explosions known as supernovae .
Using another recent set of observations performed with the SINFONI instrument on ESO ’s Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) , astronomers have confirmed that one of these stars is about 120 times more massive than our Sun , standing out as the most massive star known so far in the Milky Way [ 1 ] .
The clouds of NGC 3603 provide us with a family picture of stars in different stages of their life , with gaseous structures that are still growing into stars , newborn stars , adult stars and stars nearing the end of their life .
All these stars have roughly the same age , a million years , a blink of an eye compared to our five billion year - old Sun and Solar System .
The fact that some of the stars have just started their lives while others are already dying is due to their extraordinary range of masses : high - mass stars , being very bright and hot , burn through their existence much faster than their less massive , fainter and cooler counterparts .
The newly released image , obtained with the FORS instrument attached to the VLT at Cerro Paranal , Chile , portrays a wide field around the stellar cluster and reveals the rich texture of the surrounding clouds of gas and dust .
Notes
[ 1 ]
The star , NGC 3603 - A1 , is an eclipsing system of two stars orbiting around each other in 3.77 days .
The most massive star has an estimated mass of 116 solar masses , while its companion has a mass of 89 solar masses .

Kurtzman :
You know what ’s funny about that , though ?
That was the episode where it felt like we were going back to the Alias template , in a way .
That was the kind of thing we would have done on Alias .
Lindelof :
Well , you had no Sloane , on Fringe , until then .
There was conflict to play , in the Fringe Division , but you always had to manufacture it from outside .
So like some FBI guy would come in and say " What are you guys up to ? " or whatever .
But from Broyles to Walter to Peter to Olivia and Astrid — they all kind of get along with each other .
By having Sloane in Alias as a regular from the word " Go , " you had built - in antagonism .
Kurtzman :
That ’s true .
Lindelof :
Not to make this about Lost , but when we introduced Ben Linus in the middle of Season 2 — I can’t imagine the show without that .
Cuse :
We were struggling , because we did n’t have any force of antagonism .
It was n’t the tenth iteration of a cop show , or a law show , or a medical show — and that was a real struggle , at the beginning of the show , to figure out every week , " What is the force of antagonism ? "
Abrams :
That ’s why I think your instinct , so early on , to bring the Others in sooner …
Lindelof :
That was always the issue — when are we going to bring them in ?
Cuse :
And then once we ’d brought in Benjamin Linus and established him as the leader of the Others , it kinda helped kick things into a higher gear .
Because we were kind of out of the natural - disaster - of - the - week zone at that point .
It ’s funny , because the networks always make you write out synopses of possible stories , and try to get you to pitch things out , and it ’s a completely ridiculous and ludicrous ercise .
The only way to basically find a show is to make it .
And hopefully , somewhere during the first season of the show , you start to figure out what the show is .
But it ’s a process of trial and error .
You do certain things and they work , you do certain things and they do n’t work .
You have to treat the show organically , and the show will sort of tell you what ’s working and not working , and eventually you ’ll figure out , " Okay , this is what we need to make an episode . "
So now we have a paradigm for Lost episodes .
We kind of know what the elements are that it takes to put together the cocktail that is a Lost episode .
Lindelof :
It ’s like saying to a pregnant woman , " So you ’re having a girl — would you like to sign her up for soccer , or ballet ? "
And you go , " I do n’t know , all things being equal , ballet sounds great , I like ballet " — but you have n’t had the baby yet .
Until you get to know your kid , you ca n’t really make any plans whatsoever .
It ’s a farce .
But you do it every time .
My favorite story is that those guys who do 24 had to basically do this same ercise .
Because 24 is a premise that everybody thought would never work in a million years , myself included .
Like , how do you do a real - time show ?
And the pilot promises — someone is threatening to assassinate this presidential candidate , David Palmer , and Jack Bauer , Keifer Sutherland , has to stop the assassination , and the plan that they pitched the network was , in episode 24 , he stops the assassination .
And then they got into the writing of it , and they realized , " Because it ’s a real - time show , we have to move up our entire timetable . "
So he stops Palmer from being assassinated in episode 5 or 6 .
And then they had to wing it !
They were only a quarter of the way through .
That ’s why the Others thing is so interesting .
Because the first day that Bryan and JJ and myself , and a couple other guys — Jeff Pinkner and [ Lost co-ecutive producer ]
Jesse Alexander were there too — were talking about Lost , JJ pitched the Hatch .
He said , " They find a hatch . "
We talked about the Others .
We talked about Rousseau .
We talked about all that , in the very first meeting .
It ’s like you ’re a football coach , and you have these plays , but you do n’t know when to run the play .
You ’re basically like , " Okay , when is the right time ?
When should they find the hatch ?
When do we need to bring the Others in ?
And how do we bring them in ? "
So the compromise was , Ethan starts farting around with Claire , and you realize he was n’t on the plane .
Where did he come from ?
But that ’s all you get in Season 1 .
It is n’t until the end of Season 2 , or midway through Season 2 , that you start to see the faces of these indigenous people .
There ’s a story of an ex hausted tenor at La Scala who , facing repeated cries of “ Encore , ” responded that he could n’t go on .
A man rose in the audience to say , “ You ’ll keep singing until you get it right . ”
That seems to be the defining principle of the Obama administration — whose response to every problem , every setback , every hiccup and challenge has been , simply , “ more Obama . ”
Indeed , for people who are n’t sticklers for political jargon , it will be a shock that last night was Obama ’s first State of the Union Address , since it was his third formal address to a joint session of Congress .
Yet for all of the political déjà vu , what was most surprising last night was the degree to which Obama delivered even more of the same .
OBAMA TRIES TO REBOOT PRESIDENCY
SPENDING FREEZE ?
PUH-LEEZE
OBAMA : ONE MORE SHOT AT HEALTH CARE
EVEN FELLOW DEMS SLAMMING PREZ
JUSTICE ALITO STUNG BY OBAMA BLAST
Washington graybeards and pundits have been insisting that Obama needs to “ start over , ” “ reboot ” and “ tack to the middle ” after Scott Brown ’s win in Massachusetts .
But Obama ’s response last night was to recommit himself to the agenda that has gotten him in so much trouble .
In fairness , the president took a French - bath of Clintonism before he took to his beloved TelePrompTer .
He doused himself with the scent of the deficit - fighter and trade - promoter .
He unveiled a slew of small , easy , applause - gathering proposals and populist appeals that he knows will go nowhere .
He also indulged in a lot of feel - your - pain pathos , trying to connect with the real Americans suffering from the recession and the misdeeds of a “ Washington ” that Obama seems to think is run by someone other than him .
But the eau - de - Clinton could n’t mask the stench — and Obama , in his supreme arrogance , did n’t really seem to care .
There was no “ pivot to the center , ” no serious accounting for the Massachusetts miracle or his misfortunes .
Instead , there was an innumerate , inaccurate and distinctly unpresidential whine — blaming George W. Bush for nearly all of his problems ( leaving out , among other things , that the Democrats have been controlling Congress and crafting budgets since 2006 ) .
The White House insists that the new wave of populism created by Democratic governance is , in fact , the same populist wave that carried Obama to victory in 2008 .
In other words , Obama was elected president by the backlash against his own presidency .
This novel theory allows Obama to stick to his view that there ’s nothing wrong with his health - care plan , and anyone who feels differently has n’t heard or understood the president ’s explanations .
So , he not only implored Democrats not to “ run for the hills ” on the health - reform bill , but insisted that as “ temperatures cool , ” hot - tempered opponents will , of course , realize they were wrong about the bill .
Obama began his presidency insisting that government is the answer to our problems .
A year later , he still believes that the era of big government is upon us .
In the same speech in which he preened over a gallingly gimmicky “ spending freeze , ” the president promised more jobs bills , more “ investments ” in schools , roads , trains and factories .
He even reaffirmed his support for his carbon - tax legislation — which would send far more jobs overseas than it would create here at home .
But Obama has a bigger problem : Aside from a few throwaway lines of self - deprecation , whenever he grew passionate , it was to blame others .
His predecessor topped his list , of course .
But also everyone else who disagrees with him .
Obama insists that Americans need to muster the courage to agree with him , to sign on to his agenda .
Just as at Omaha Beach and Bull Run , Americans need to show their mettle .
“ Again , we are tested .
And again , we must answer history ’s call . ”
That “ call ” is the call of Obama .
“ I never suggested that change would be easy , or that I can do it alone . ”
So come on , you slackers , fall into line .
He decried the politicians who are in “ permanent campaign ” mode — the same week he brought into the White House his campaign manager .
Other politicians are vain , cowardly and insubstantial .
They need the courage to change .
Meanwhile , Obama is great the way he is .
That is the attitude that has gotten the president in so much trouble .
And last night ’s State of the Union speech showed us that change really is n’t easy , particularly for the president .

AUSTIN — Theologians and ministers at a news conference here said they were wary of the State Board of Education injecting too much religion into the new social science curriculum standards it will vote on this week .
The 15 - member board will take a tentative vote Thursday on new standards that will influence Texas public school history and government textbooks for at least the next decade .
Final action is scheduled in March .
A public hearing today will start the process , with more than 130 people signed up .
Some want the new standards to include more Hispanic historical figures ; some want to see a more positive spin on Texas and U.S. history .
Some will bring up religion .
Clergy organized by the Texas Freedom Network , a watchdog group that advocates for church - state separation , said they were concerned that board members will seek to enshrine a view of the country 's Founding Fathers that inflates Christian influences .
“ What violates the Constitution is presenting material that either prefers Christianity over other faiths or depicts the Untied States as a Christian nation in some legal sense or constitutional sense , ” warned Derek Davis , dean of humanities at the Baptist - based University of Mary Hardin - Baylor and director of its Center for Religious Liberty .
It 's debatable whether society has become over - secularized , but to assume it is and “ to blame it on the separation of church and state , which they claim is hostile to the Founders ' intentions , is patently false , ” he said .
The Rev. Marcus McFaul , senior pastor at Highland Park Baptist Church in Austin , said “ the instruction of religious faith , discipleship and a life of service — one shaped by devotion and piety — is the responsibility of each faith community , whether church , synagogue or mosque .
It is the responsibility of parents and parishes , not public schools . ”
Board member David Bradley , R- Beaumont , a leader of the board 's seven social conservative members , said he respected the Baptist theologians “ but I listen to my own pastor . ”
Bradley said he 's certain “ there will be efforts ( by board members making amendments ) to preserve , protect and strengthen America 's godly heritage . ”

El exdirigente nacional del PAN , Manuel Espino Barrientos , consideró que ese partido “ no se afecta con tan poquito ” , luego de la renuncia de Margarita Zavala , a quien calificó como una buena persona , pero con muy poco peso político .
Entrevistado por El Economista , el diputado federal sin partido aseguró que Zavala se precipitó con su salida y estimó que Felipe Calderón , a quien calificó como un “ estorbo ” para todos los dirigentes de Acción Nacional , se quedará en el partido .
“ Margarita no representa la fuerza del PAN , que tiene fuerza propia sin ella .
Tan es así , que ahora que se fue — se han hecho ya algunas encuestas — como candidata independiente ( y ) ya no pinta como pintaba antes .
No hay que sobredimensionar a Margarita , que tampoco tiene una trayectoria política importante , realmente no la tiene .
Pesaba por el peso que llegó a tener su esposo ( Felipe Calderón ) en el partido , pero ese peso también le afecta .
“ Margarita se desesperó , se precipitó y se fue y creo que ella es la más afectada .
Y creo que el PAN no se afecta , conozco muy bien al PAN , no se afecta con tan poquito .
Ha pasado peores tormentas y ahí está el partido , tiene sobrada capacidad , experiencia y militancia , como para salir adelante de esta sacudida política , que no llega a sismo ” , afirmó .
Espino Barrientos opinó que Margarita Zavala fue “ víctima ” de su propio esposo , Felipe Calderón , por provocar divisiones al interior del partido .
“ La fractura al interior del PAN ya estaba , no con Margarita .
La fractura viene desde Felipe Calderón , su esposo .
Pero también es cierto que la salida de Margarita representa una oportunidad para el PAN , un punto de partida , no un punto final .
“ En los últimos años , el peso político , el fardo político más fuerte que tenía el PAN era Felipe Calderón y su grupo y Margarita es parte de eso .
Desafortunadamente ella es la principal víctima de los desatinos de su esposo , pero yo creo que no hay un daño severo con la salida de Margarita ” , comentó .
El diputado Manuel Espino consideró que en los medios de comunicación se ha sobrestimado la renuncia de la ex primera dama al PAN .
“ A Margarita siempre se le ha visto en el partido , hija de un personaje destacado , y en el PAN a los hijos de los personajes siempre se les trató con cariño , independientemente de que tuvieran o no capacidad para desempeñar un cargo público o de partido .
Ella fue de esas personas .
Siempre se le vio ahí , es una buena persona , que quiere al PAN sin lugar a dudas , pero no es una persona que haya destacado por haber desempeñado un cargo en el partido , que lo haya ganado .
“ Ella tuvo posiciones en el partido por el apellido , como también Felipe Calderón , y lo aprovecharon , bastante .
Usufructuaron bien esa militancia en el PAN , pero hoy que se va , habrá seguramente quienes la extrañen , pero no se va con ella el talento del PAN , no se va un personaje que le haya representado grandes triunfos o avances al partido ” .
Y remató : “ El PAN no pierde , gana la posibilidad de una pronta recuperación , ya sin la influencia del grupo de Calderón ” .
Espino consideró que Felipe Calderón no renunciará al PAN , pues esperará mejores tiempos para tener posiciones políticas para su grupo .
“ Su esposo ( Felipe Calderón ) y su grupo seguramente querrán permanecer en el partido y esperar mejores tiempos para estorbarle a la dirigencia actual , como siempre le estorbaron a todos los dirigentes mientras estuvieron en el Comité Ejecutivo Nacional , siempre fueron un estorbo para la dirigencia .
“ Es una estrategia y van a estar ahí , molestando a la dirigencia , como lo hicieron con Carlos Castillo Peraza , con Luis Felipe Bravo Mena , como lo hicieron conmigo .
Ése es el estilo de Felipe Calderón : ser antidirigencia ” , sentenció .
Finalmente , luego de que Zavala afirmó que una motivación para su salida es que el actual dirigente del PAN , Ricardo Anaya , acaparó el cargo para quedarse con la candidatura presidencial , Espino dijo que Anaya debe responder a esa acusación .

The Global Wind Energy Council this week announced that the world ’s wind power capacity grew by 31 % in 2009 , adding 37.5 gigawatts ( GW ) to bring total installations up to 157.9 GW .
A third of these additions were made in China , which experienced yet another year of over 100 % growth .
The main markets driving this significant growth continue to be Asia , North America and Europe , each of which installed more than 10 GW of new wind capacity in 2009 .
“ The continued rapid growth of wind power despite the financial crisis and economic downturn is testament to the inherent attractiveness of the technology , which is clean , reliable and quick to install .
Wind power has become the power technology of choice a growing number of countries around the world , ” said Steve Sawyer , GWEC ’s secretary general .
“ Copenhagen did n’t bring us any closer to a global price on carbon , but wind energy continued to grow due to national energy policy in our main markets and also because many governments in prioritized renewable energy development in their economic recovery plans . ”
China was the world ’s largest market in 2009 , more than doubling its wind generation capacity from 12.1 GW in 2008 to 25.1 GW at the end of 2009 with new capacity additions of 13 GW .
“ The Chinese government is taking very seriously its responsibility to limit CO2 emissions while providing energy for its growing economy .
China is putting strong efforts into developing the country ’s tremendous wind resource .
Given the current growth rates , it can be expected that the even the unofficial target of 150 GW will be met well ahead of 2020 , ” said Li Junfeng , secretary general of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association .
Newly added capacity of 1,270 MW in India and some smaller additions in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan make Asia the biggest regional market for wind energy in 2009 , with more than 14 GW of new capacity .
The U.S. wind energy market installed nearly 10 GW in 2009 , increasing the country ’s installed capacity by 39 % and bringing the total installed , grid - connected capacity to 35 GW .
In early 2009 , some analysts had foreseen a drop in wind power development of as much as 50 % , but the implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act with its strong focus on wind energy development in the summer reversed this trend .

Europe , which has traditionally been the world ’s largest market for wind energy development , continued to see strong growth , also exceeding expectations .
In 2009 , 10.5 GW were installed i n Europe , led by Spain ( 2.5GW ) and Germany ( 1.9 GW ) .
Italy , France and the UK all added more than 1 GW of new wind capacity each .
39 % of all new capacity installed in 2009 was wind power , followed by gas ( 26 % ) and solar photovoltaics ( 16 % ) .
Europe decommissioned more coal and nuclear capacity than it installed in 2009 .
Taken together , renewable energy technologies account for 61 % of new power generating capacity in 2009 .
Investment in new European wind farms in 2009 reached € 13 billion , including € 1.5 billion offshore .
10,163 MW of wind power capacity was installed across the European Union – a 23 % increase compared to 2008 installations – made up of 9,581 MW onshore ( up 21 % from last year ) and 582 MW offshore ( up 56 % from last year ) .
“ It is a remarkable result in a difficult year ” said Christian Kjaer , CEO of the European Wind Energy Association ( EWEA ) .
“ The figures , once again , confirm that wind power , together with other renewable energy technologies and a shift from coal to gas , are delivering massive European carbon reductions , while creating much needed economic activity and new jobs for Europe ’s citizens . ”
Wind power ’s total capacity in the European Union has now reached 74,767 MW , up from 64,719 MW by the end of 2008 with Germany remaining the EU country with the largest installed capacity , followed by Spain , Italy , France and the UK .
The wind capacity installed by the end of 2009 will in a normal year produce 163 terrawatt - hours of electricity , meeting 4.8 % of total EU power demand .

Time now for Lost in Showbiz to train its tractor beam on Myleene Klass , the gimlet - eyed girl next door who must surely be acknowledged as one of the hardest - working operations in showbiz .
I say operations , of course , because behind every third - tier presenter is a team of agents and publicists working tirelessly to ensure their client is in the right kind of headlines – and you have to say that this week , Myleene 's operation has been a tour de force .
There might conceivably be the odd member of a remote Amazon tribe who is still unaware that Myleene saw two teenagers acting suspiciously in the garden of her Hertfordshire home last Thursday night , but such benighted individuals are very much a minority of Earth 's population , and the tale is expected to have full spectrum dominance by noon today .
But what makes this story so leggy , my darlinks , is that – according to her account and that of her agent , Jonathan Shalit – Myleene brandished a knife at the trespassers from behind her french windows , and when the police arrived on the scene they admonished her for this action , explaining " you are not allowed to protect yourself " and that " the law did not allow her to defend herself in her own home " .
Immediately , shadow home secretary Chris Grayling decided to make a comment about what the incident " showed " , and it was when David Cameron joined in by calling the situation " ridiculous " that Hertfordshire police seem to have felt moved to make a statement in which they denied issuing a warning about the knife .
" The story , based on quotes from Ms Klass 's publicist and interpreted by some national newspapers , does not reflect the events of that night in an accurate way , " they said .
" Ms Klass was treated with respect and sympathy by the police officers who came to her home . "
The force has since pointed out that no reference was made in the incident report to use of a weapon , countered that the law allows householders the proportionate use of defence to protect themselves and their property , and added that " words of advice were given in relation to ensuring suspicious behaviour is reported immediately " .
Why was advice on prompt reporting given ?
Having bothered to establish the chain of events , Lost in Showbiz discovers that the initial call to police was not placed by Myleene but by a man believed to be her agent or publicist , to whom she was naturally on the phone at the time .
Truly , the fourth emergency service .
It was one or other of these men who called the Met in London , who then passed the matter on to the Hertfordshire force who attended Myleene 's address in the small hours of Friday , by which time she had also been in touch with police .
As for the story 's appearance in the Sun the very next day , Hertfordshire police state : " We believe the media found out about the incident following a phone call from Ms Klass 's publicist to Emma Cox from the Sun . "
Alas , despite having given copious quotes and assistance on the story all week , both publicist and agent declined to discuss this yesterday , so we shall simply marvel at the manner in which Myleene comes to embody any number of hot - button issues .
There 's an unsatisfactory NHS , which she tackled in a 2008 interview – the Sun again – used to promote her new show and range of baby clothing .
" I am very , very fortunate , but I just wanted to be treated like everybody else , " Myleene explained of the birth of her daughter , before claiming , " I used a false name , Angela Quinn , when I gave birth . "
Must have been an awkward charade , what with the medical records .
Anyway , all this happened in the private wing of St Mary 's in Paddington – the hospital tells me no one could possibly ever keep their real name off their patient notes – but back in the NHS system after the birth , Myleene claimed to have been unable to get a midwife to make a home visit until she used her real name .
At which point " I had two midwives on my doorstep immediately .
But what about all the other Angela Quinns out there ? "
Mm .
Then , of course , Myleene was " targeted by the Taliban " , as the Sun had it , during a visit to Kabul in 2006 .
At the time , this column questioned that " targeted " , wondering whether a crack team of insurgents really had lain in wait in the inhospitable desert climes for weeks , allowing hundreds of military aircraft to pass unhindered above them , before finally getting a positive ID on the craft whose precious cargo was Myleene Klass and putting their fiendish assault into action .
Still , the RAF scrambled a fighter jet to escort her plane , according to Myleene 's obligingly full quotes on the matter .
Finally , I 'm reminded by a Guardian commenter of the story the illusionist Derren Brown tells of bumping into the charlatan Derek Acorah , whom he naturally holds in righteous disdain , but found himself unwilling to harangue in person .
As Derren puts it , " my own apparently strong feelings gave way to the simple social code of being nice . "
And yet , according to a report that subsequently appeared in the Sun , " The pair started rowing but Myleene Klass , Derek 's co-host for the new series of Ghost Stories , stepped in .
The insider said : " Myleene told Derren to leave Derek alone .
She said , ' You 're obviously threatened by him . ' "
What a heroine she is – and with such frequency .
Whether Myleene is being styled as a new generation celebrity Conservative remains unclear , but we shall continue to watch her fastidiously charted progress with interest .
I believe that Carl Jung was a genius , and since he said the things that people attack are quite often a reflection of the things they despise and fear in themselves , I 'm beginning to wonder if perhaps James O'Keefe is simply another self - loathing Republican closet case .
I mean , look at his long track record of ridiculing the poor , ethnic minorities and otherwise marginalized groups - his choice of targets might be part of a larger picture .
Yesterday this interesting story ran in the Washington Independent .
Could this be part of that picture ?
Ben Wetmore , the 28 - year - old conservative activist whom James O’Keefe called a “ mentor , ” has stayed out of the headlines since it was revealed that he housed O’Keefe and the other participants in the bungled sting of Sen.
Mary Landrieu ’s ( D - La. ) office .
When I reached Wetmore by phone yesterday , he politely declined to talk about the situation until it settled down .
Still , the Wetmore - O’Keefe friendship was , in gonzo journalism terms , a productive one .
In 2008 , after O’Keefe had left the Leadership Institute , the two men recorded hidden camera video of themselves going to three state offices in Massachusetts , applying for marriage licenses , openly admitting that they were straight men who wanted to get married to take advantage of the benefits .
In the video , O'Keefe asks his friend if his girlfriend minds them getting married , and he says she does n't .
O'Keefe does n't mention a girlfriend himself .
Then again , maybe he 's just a shy , awkward sort who covers it up with bravado , the kind of socially - handicapped guy who 's just trying to fit in any way he can - as evidenced by this picture showing O'Keefe at a performance by his Rutgers glee club at Carnegie Hall .
I guess that makes him a " Gleek " - only without the charm .
Or the humanity .
Formal Verification
Other than exhaustive testing , formal verification is the only known way to guarantee a system free of bugs .
This approach is not well known and seldom used , because it is considered expensive and only applicable to very small bodies of code .
However , a small microkernel is amenable to formal verification , as the project demonstrated .
The technique used for formal verification is a refinement proof using interactive theorem proving .
Refinement shows a formal correspondence between a high - level " abstract " and a low - level " concrete " model .
Refinement proves that all possible behaviors of the concrete model are captured by the abstract one .
In this case , the abstract model is the specification of kernel behavior , essentially its ABI , expressed in a language called " higher - order logic " ( HOL ) .
The concrete model is the kernel 's implementation -- the C code processed by a C compiler to produce an executable kernel .
Refinement then proves that the kernel truly behaves according to its specification , i.e. , it is functionally correct .
Functional correctness means that implementation always strictly follows the high - level abstract specification of kernel behavior .
Provable functional correctness encompasses traditional design and implementation safety properties such that the kernel will never crash , and will never perform an unsafe operation .
Functional correctness also enables prediction of precisely how a kernel will behave in every possible situation .
Such assurances rule out any unexpected behavior .
One implication is that it becomes impossible to inject arbitrary code into the kernel as happens with popular " stack - smashing " attacks -- our kernel is provably immune to such attacks .
At the concrete level , the translation from C into HOL is correctness - critical ; the team took great care to model the C subset semantics precisely , treating C semantics , types , and memory model exactly as the standard prescribes , e.g. , with architecture - dependent word size , padding of structs , type unsafe casting of pointers , and arithmetic on addresses .
The actual proof was conducted with and checked by an interactive theorem prover called Isabelle / HOL .
Interactive theorem proving requires human intervention and creativity to construct and guide the proof .
However , it has the advantage of not being constrained to specific properties or finite , feasible state spaces , unlike more automated methods of verification , such as static analysis or model checking .
Kernel Design for Verification
To facilitate verification , kernel design should minimize the complexity of its components .
Ideally , kernel code ( and associated proofs ) would consist of simple statements that rely on explicit local state , with simple invariants .
These smaller elements could then be integrated into larger elements that avoid exposing underlying local elements .
Unfortunately , OS kernels are not usually so structured and instead feature inter-dependent subsystems , as is the case for a small , high - performance microkernel , such as the various members of the L4 microkernel family .
By removing everything from the kernel that can securely be implemented in user space , the microkernel is the " essence of OS messiness , " and its components are highly interconnected .
A major design goal of OK : Verified was suitability for real world use , requiring performance comparable to the fastest existing microkernels .
Therefore , the kernel design methodology aims to minimize proof complexity without compromising performance .
OS developers tend to take a bottom - up approach to kernel design .
They strive for high performance by managing hardware efficiently , leading to designs governed by low - level details .
In contrast , formal methods practitioners tend toward top - down design , as proof tractability is determined by system complexity .
A top -down approach results in designs based on simple models with a high degree of abstraction from hardware .
As a compromise that blends both views , we adopted an approach based around an intermediate target , readily accessible to both OS developers and formal methods practitioners .
We used the functional programming language Haskell as a tool for OS developers , while at the same time providing an artifact for automatic translation into the theorem - proving tool .
This resulted in a high - level prototype of the kernel , implemented in Haskell , ( a general - purpose , purely functional programming language , with non-strict semantics and strong static typing ) that is itself an executable program .
The prototype required design and implementation of algorithms that manage the low - level hardware details , and as such shares many implementation details of the real kernel .
To execute the Haskell prototype in a reasonably realistic setting , the team linked it with software derived from QEMU , a portable processor emulator that relies on dynamic binary translation for speed .
Normal user - level execution is enabled by the emulator , while traps are passed to the kernel model which computes the result of the trap .
The prototype modifies the user - level state of the emulator to appear as if a real kernel had executed in privileged mode .
This arrangement provides a prototyping environment that enables low - level design evaluation from both the user program and kernel perspective , including low - level physical and virtual memory management .
It also provides a realistic execution environment that is binary - compatible with the real kernel .
Employing the standard ARM tool chain for developing software and executing it on the Haskell kernel had the nice side effect of letting the team port software to the new kernel and get experience with its ABI before the " real " kernel existed .
Although the Haskell prototype provides an executable model and implementation of the final design , it is not itself the final production kernel .
We manually re-implemented the model in the C programming language for several reasons .
Firstly , the Haskell runtime is a significant body of code ( much bigger than our kernel ) , which would be hard to verify for correctness .
Secondly , the Haskell runtime relies on garbage collection which is unsuitable for real - time environments .
Additionally , using C enables optimization of the low - level implementation for performance .
Although an automated translation from Haskell to C would have simplified verification , the team would have lost most opportunities to optimize the kernel , required for adequate microkernel performance .
Instead , we could build a kernel that performs on par with the fastest kernels .
Other elements of the kernel design , such as incorporating global variables , memory management , concurrency , and I/O are fully described in seL4 : Formal Verification of an OS Kernel .
The kernel implementation used a slightly restricted subset of the C language to ease verification .
Specifically we outlawed goto statements , fall - through in switch statements , and the use of functions with side effects in expressions -- all features good programmers avoid anyway .
The most serious restriction was prohibiting passing of pointers to stack variables as function arguments ( but pointers to global variables are allowed ) .

An international team of astronomers has identified two new tidal streams in M31 , the Andromeda galaxy .
They are more - or - less intact remnants of dwarf galaxies that M31 has otherwise ripped to shreds .
One team – using the Suprime - Cam camera on Subaru – discovered two new dwarf galaxy shards by mapping the sky density of red giants in M31 ’s outskirts ; the other – using the DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck II – separated the M31 red giant wheat from the Milky Way chaff .
In a project led by collaborators Mikito Tanaka and Masashi Chiba of Tohoku University , Japan , the astronomers used the Subaru 8 - meter telescope and Suprime - Cam camera to map the density of red giants in large portions of M31 , including the hitherto uncharted north side .
This led to the discovery of two tidal streams to the northwest ( streams E and F ) at projected distances of 60 and 100 kiloparsecs ( 200,000 and 300,000 light - years ) from M31 ’s nucleus .
The study also confirmed a few previously known streams , including the little - studied diffuse stream to the southwest ( stream SW ) , which lies at a projected distance of 60 to 100 kiloparsecs ( 200,000 to 300,000 light years ) from M31 ’s nucleus .
The Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda ’s Stellar Halo ( SPLASH ) collaboration , a large survey of red giants in M31 lead by Puragra Guhathakurta , professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California , Santa Cruz , has followed up with a spectroscopic survey of several hundred red giants in Streams E , F , and SW , using the Keck II 10 - meter telescope and DEIMOS spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii .
Analysis of the spectra from this survey yields estimates of the line - of - sight velocity of the stars , which in turn allows M31 red giants to be distinguished from foreground stars ( in the Milky Way ) .
The spectral data confirmed the presence of coherent groups of M31 red giants moving with a common velocity .
Stars spread over the vast reaches of a halo in a big galaxy like the Milky Way or M31 are characterized by old age , few elements other than helium and hydrogen ( i.e. low metallicities ; astronomers call all elements other than hydrogen and helium “ metals ” ) , and high velocities .
The exceptional nature of these halo stars , when compared to stars in a galaxy ’s disk , reflects the early dynamics and element formation of the galaxy when its appearance differed significantly from what we see today .
Consequently , the halo provides important insights into the processes involved in the formation and evolution of a massive galaxy .
In the best Big Bang model we have today – ΛCDM ( Lambda Cold Dark Matter ) – the outer halos are built up through the merger and dissolution of smaller , dwarf , satellite galaxies .
“ This process of galactic cannibalism is an integral part of the growth of galaxies , ” said Guhathakurta .
The smooth , well - mixed population of halo stars in these large galaxies represents the aggregate of the dwarf galaxy victims of this cannibalism process , while the dwarf galaxies that are still intact as they orbit their large parent galaxy are the survivors of this process .
“ The merging and dissolution of a dwarf galaxy typically lasts for a couple billion years , so one occasionally catches a large galaxy in the act of cannibalizing one of its dwarf galaxy satellites , ” Guhathakurta said .
“ The characteristic signature of such an event is a tidal stream : an enhancement in the density of stars , localized in space and moving as a coherent group through the parent galaxy . ”
Tidal streams are important because they represent a link between the victims and survivors of galactic cannibalism – an intermediate stage between the population of intact dwarf galaxies and the well - mixed stars dissolved in the halo .
The Andromeda galaxy is a unique test bed for studying the formation and evolution of a large galaxy , said Guhathakurta , “ Our external vantage point gives us a global perspective of the galaxy , and yet the galaxy is close enough for us to obtain detailed measurements of individual red giant stars within it . ”
One of the next steps will be to measure the detailed elemental compositions ( “ chemical properties ” , in astronomer - speak ) of red giants in these newly discovered tidal streams in M31 .
Comparing the chemical properties of tidal streams , intact dwarf satellites , and the smooth halo will be of particular significance , Guhathakurta said .
Mikito Tanaka put it this way : “ Further observational surveys of an entire halo region in Andromeda will provide very useful information on galaxy formation , including how many and how massive individual dwarf galaxies as building blocks are and how star formation and chemical evolution proceeded in each dwarf galaxy . ”
At the present time , detailed studies of the chemical properties of tidal streams , intact dwarf satellites , and smooth stellar halos are possible only in the Milky Way and M31 galaxies and their immediate surroundings .
Existing telescopes and instruments are simply not powerful enough for astronomers to carry out such studies in more distant galaxies .
This situation will improve greatly with the advent of the planned Thirty Meter Telescope later in this decade , Guhathakurta said .
Tanaka ’s team published their survey results in a recent Astrophysics Journal ( ApJ ) paper ( the preprint is arXiv:0908.0245 ) , and Guhathakurta ’s team presented their results on the newly discovered tidal streams earlier this month at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington , D.C. ; they hope to have an ApJ paper on these results published later this year .

What 's missing in Congress these days is real progressive leadership and real political courage .
Over the past several decades , the Democratic Party has been entirely taken over by corporate shills and money - grubbing sleazes while those who might still have some vestigial remnant of a conscience or genuine concern for the plight of the common person have been co-opted or intimidated into silence or powerlessness .
Look at Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .
He says all the right things .
He 's fought all the good fights .
And yet after 15 years in Congress , he is chair of what ?
The House subcommittee on domestic policy of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Heck , his post does n't even merit capitalization in the AP Stylebook !
And when he submits an important bill , like his articles of impeachment of both former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney , he can't even get a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee .
Which , of course , is chaired by another long - standing allegedly progressive House member , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
Conyers , despite being chair of the House Progressive Caucus ( the largest , and least powerful Democratic Party caucus in the Congress ) and despite his having served 22 terms in the House , could n't even manage to get " permission " from the Speaker ( Rep. Nancy Pelosi - - once a member of the Progressive Caucus ! ) to hold a hearing on impeachment during the Bush / Cheney years in the Judiciary Committee that he chairs .
And more recently , he was even barred from having his own health reform proposal -- an expansion of Medicare to cover all Americans -- get a lousy hearing in the House .
Progressives in the Democratic Party are both joke and oxymoron .
It is time for any real progressives in House or Senate to admit the truth -- that they are boxed in and effectively neutered by the Party leadership -- and that if they really want to be defenders of the public interest and the progressive cause , they must give up their sinecures , cut themselves loose from the shackles of the Democratic Party , and form a new and independent national progressive party .
They have a model : Bernie Sanders , the independent self - described socialist senator from Vermont .
Of course , even Sanders is boxed in , given that he is alone in the Senate as an independent progressive , so that if he wants a committee assignment he has to agree to vote with the Democrats on the key issues of party control .
But that is because there is nobody standing with him in the Senate .
This could change if the progressive caucus members of both houses were to quit the sell - out Democrats and form the nucleus of a new party , instead of just a caucus within the sclerotic and rancidly corrupt Democratic Party .
There is a huge ferment across the land .
Americans of all political persuasions are angry , fearful , frustrated and ready for change .
That 's why so many of them voted for a black presidential candidate promising " real change " in 2008 .
The trouncing of Democratic senate candidate Martha Coakley this week in the Massachusetts special election to fill the seat of the late Sen .
Edward Kennedy was a direct result of the anger that those same voters feel at being betrayed by that president , who instead of change has given them more of the same pro-corporate , anti-common - citizen politics that they were trying to escape .
We on the left know that nothing much is going to change in America until there is a genuine people 's party on the ballot , but for years we have watched in despair as well - meaning third parties like Peace & Freedom , the Green Party , the Socialist Party - USA and others ( including parties not on the left like the Libertarians ) have tried and failed to become national political forces .
These efforts have been stymied because American voters , sensibly , have not wanted to " waste their votes " by casting ballots for Third Party candidates who stand no chance of being elected .
They have been stymied because Americans have either been forced to accept a " lesser of two evils " approach to voting , or to simply not vote .
But true progressives in Congress who have the advantage of incumbency -- people like Kucinich , Conyers , Feingold and others -- could run as independents , or better , as third party candidates and win .
And if they were to choose to run as a new third party , they would open the door for many other new candidates to run with them .
They would give legitimacy to the idea of voting for something other than a corrupt Republican or a corrupt Democrat .
Americans are not stupid .
They recognize that the two big parties are both acting in collusion in selling them all out to monolithic corporate interests , and that Washington is thoroughly owned by the rich and the powerful .
That 's why only half of Americans even bother to vote ( actually far fewer than that in off - year elections like the one coming up this November ) .
And those who do vote , vote for major party candidates , for the most part not out of enthusiasm , but out of desperation .
If they had candidates on the ballot whom they really thought were on their side , and who really had a shot at winning , they would abandon the Democratic Party frauds in a heartbeat .
A secession by true progressives in Congress from the Democratic Party and the formation of a new party by that group of rebels -- and remember , there are 80 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus -- would hit the Democratic Party like a perfectly placed explosive charge detonated in the foundation of an old building slated for demolition .
The whole edifice would collapse in a cloud of smoke and dust .
No Democratic incumbent would be safe .
Upstart candidates would come out of the woodwork to challenge them from the left in virtually every state in the country .
Republican candidates too would face real challenges , not from centrists , but from real left candidates .
Too much can be expected of electoral politics , and certainly , even in the highly improbable event that every member of the Progressive Caucus were to quit the Democrats , run for re-election as an independent or as the member of some new progressive party , and win the first time out , the dominant Democrats and Republicans and the corporate lobbyists behind them could still keep the government in the hands of the existing corporate power structure .
But even if only some of the caucus were to bolt , the door would suddenly be open for a new national politics .
Workers and their labor unions would no longer feel bound to support Democratic hacks , and many could be expected to shift their allegience and financial backing to the new party , as could environmentalists , health care reform advocates , anti-war activists , education reformers and all the other progressives who have had nowhere to turn politically for years .
So here 's the call :
If you have a so - called progressive as your Senator or Representative , tell him or her that you will no longer giver them your vote unless they first quit the Democratic Party .
Although these are often treated as synonyms , there is a difference .
You are envious of what others have that you lack .
Jealousy , on the other hand , involves wanting to hold on to what you do have .
You can be jealous of your boyfriend ’s attraction to other women , but you ’re envious of your boyfriend ’s CD collection .

Probably the most controversial claim in my work with John Mearsheimer on the Israel lobby is our argument that it played a key role in the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 .
Even some readers who were generally sympathetic to our overall position found that claim hard to accept , and some left - wing critics accused us of letting Bush and Cheney off the hook or of ignoring the importance of other interests , especially oil .
Of course , Israel ’s defenders in the lobby took issue even more strenuously , usually by mischaracterizing our arguments and ignoring most ( if not all ) of the evidence we presented .
So I hope readers will forgive me if I indulge today in a bit of self - promotion , or more precisely , self - defense .
This week , yet another piece of evidence surfaced that suggests we were right all along ( HT to Mehdi Hasan at the New Statesman and J. Glatzer at Mondoweiss ) .
In his testimony to the Iraq war commission in the U.K. , former Prime Minister Tony Blair offered the following account of his discussions with Bush in Crawford , Texas in April 2002 .
Blair reveals that concerns about Israel were part of the equation and that Israel officials were involved in those discussions .
Take it away , Tony :
As I recall that discussion , it was less to do with specifics about what we were going to do on Iraq or , indeed , the Middle East , because the Israel issue was a big , big issue at the time .
I think , in fact , I remember , actually , there may have been conversations that we had even with Israelis , the two of us , whilst we were there .
So that was a major part of all this . "
Notice that Blair is not saying that Israel dreamed up the idea of attacking Iraq or that Bush was bent on war solely to benefit Israel or even to appease the Israel lobby here at home .
But Blair is acknowledging that concerns about Israel were part of the equation , and that the Israeli government was being actively consulted in the planning for the war .
Blair ’s comments fit neatly with the argument we make about the lobby and Iraq .
Specifically , Professor Mearsheimer and I made it clear in our article and especially in our book that the idea of invading Iraq originated in the United States with the neoconservatives , and not with the Israeli government .
But as the neoconservative pundit Max Boot once put it , steadfast support for Israel is " a key tenet of neoconservatism . "
Prominent neo-conservatives occupied important positions in the Bush administration , and in the aftermath of 9/11 , they played a major role in persuading Bush and Cheney to back a war against Iraq , which they had been advocating since the late 1990s .
We also pointed out that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and other Israeli officials were initially skeptical of this scheme , because they wanted the U.S. to focus on Iran , not Iraq .
However , they became enthusiastic supporters of the idea of invading Iraq once the Bush administration made it clear to them that Iraq was just the first step in a broader campaign of " regional transformation " that would eventually include Iran .
At that point top Israeli leaders from across the political spectrum became cheerleaders for the invasion , and they played a prominent role in helping to sell the war here in the United States .
Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington , DC in April 2002 and spoke in the U.S. Senate , telling his audience " the urgent need to topple Saddam is paramount , " and that the campaign " deserves the unconditional support of all sane governments . "
( It sure sounds like he was well aware of the discussions in Crawford , does n’t it ? )
In May , foreign minister Shimon Peres said on CNN that " Saddam Hussein is as dangerous as bin Laden , " and that the United States " cannot sit and wait . "
A month later , former Prime Minister Ehud Barak wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post recommending that the Bush administration " should , first of all , focus on Iraq and the removal of Saddam Hussein . "
This chorus continued through the summer and fall , with Barak and Netanyahu writing additional op - eds in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal , each calling for military action to topple Saddam .
Netanyahu ’s piece was titled " The Case for Toppling Saddam " and said that " nothing less than dismantling his regime will do . "
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ’s official spokesman , Ra’anan Gissen , offered similar statements during this period as well , and Sharon himself told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee in August 2002 that Iraq was " the greatest danger facing Israel . "
According to an Aug. 16 article by Aluf Benn in Ha’aretz , Sharon reportedly told the Bush administration that putting off an attack would " only give [ Saddam ] more of an opportunity to accelerate his program of WMD . "
Foreign Minister Peres reiterated his own warnings as well , and told reporters in September 2002 that " the campaign against Saddam Hussein is a must . "
( For sources , see pp. 233-38 ) .
If that ’s not enough evidence of where Israel ’s leaders were in the run-up to the war , consider that former President Bill Clinton told an audience at an Aspen Institute meeting in 2006 that " every Israeli politician I knew " ( and he knows a lot of them ) believed that Saddam Hussein was so great a threat that he should be removed even if he did not have WMD .
Nor is this testimony at all surprising , given that we are talking about the leader who had fired Scud missiles into Israel during the first Gulf War in 1991 and had been giving money to the families of suicide bombers .
If the Bush administration was bent on taking him out and then turning its gun-sights on Syria and Iran , one can easily understand why Israelis would welcome it .
Now , what about key groups in the lobby itself ?
If the neoconservatives deserve the blame for dreaming up the idea of invading Iraq , key groups and individuals in the lobby played an important role in selling it on Capitol Hill and to the public at large .
AIPAC head Howard Kohr told the New York Sun in January 2003 that one of the organization ’s " success stories " over the previous year was " quietly lobbying Congress " to approve the resolution authorizing the use of force , a fact confirmed by journalists such as Nathan Guttman of the Forward , Michelle Goldberg of Salon.com , John B. Judis of the New Republic , and even Jeffrey Goldberg in The New Yorker ( see p. 242 ) .
Pundits at pro-Israel think tanks like the Brookings Institutions ’s Saban Center were openly backing war by the fall of 2002 , with Martin Indyk , the head of the center , and Kenneth Pollack , its director of research , playing especially prominent roles .
Moreover , in this same period both the Jewish Council on Public Affairs and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations voted to endorse the use of force " as a last resort . "
Mortimer Zuckerman , a well - connected businessman and publisher who was then the chairman of the Conference of Presidents , was especially convinced about the futility of U.N. inspections and the need to topple Saddam , and wrote several editorials making that case in his magazine ( U.S. News and World Report ) .
Still skeptical ?
Consider the following passage from an article by Matthew Berger of the Jewish Telegraph Agency , published just after President Bush ’s September 2002 appearance at the United Nations , where he threatened military action if Iraq did not comply with U.N. resolutions :
Despite their caution and without specifying a formal policy , Jewish leaders predominantly expressed support for Bush ’s words at the United Nations .
They said he detailed a strong case that Saddam has consistently ignored U.N. resolutions , that he was seeking to obtain weapons of mass destruction and that Saddam has shown a propensity towards using them .
" Iraq is the single most important threat right now to world peace and to our safety , " said Dr. Mandell Ganchrow , executive vice president of the Orthodox Religious Zionists of America .
He described Saddam as a " maniac " who " has proven that he will gas his own people . "
" The fanaticism that exists throughout the Middle East is best addressed by first dealing with Iraq , " agreed Rabbi Eric Yoffie , president of the Reform movement ’s Union of American Hebrew Congregations .
Many American Jewish leaders expressed the fear that Saddam has not been quiet for the past decade because of a loss of will , but because he has been using the time to garner weapons for an eventual attack on U.S. interests and allies .
" Do we have to wait until a target is hit , and the world says , ‘ Ah , yes , he did have weapons of mass destruction , ’ " asked David Harris , executive director of the American Jewish Committee . "
Not to be outdone , the editor of Jewish Week , Gary Rosenblatt , wrote an editorial in mid-December 2002 saying that " Washington ’s imminent war on Saddam Hussein is . . . an opportunity to rid the world of a dangerous tyrant who present a particularly horrific threat Israel . "
He went on to say " the Torah instructs that when you enemy seeks to kill you kill him first .
Self - defense is not permitted ; it is commanded . "
Even the relatively liberal Rabbi David Saperstein of the Union of Reform Judaism ’s Religious Action Center told journalist Michelle Goldberg that " the Jewish community would want to see a forceful resolution to the threat that Saddam Hussein poses . "
" Forceful resolution " means war , and Saperstein also offered comparisons to the Bosnian conflict and the Nazi era to reinforce his call for military action .
Finally , consider the following passage from an editorial in the Jewish newspaper Forward , published in 2004 :
As President Bush attempted to sell the war .. in Iraq , America ’s most important Jewish organizations rallied as one to his defense .
In statement after statement community leaders stressed the need to rid the world of Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction .
Some groups went even further , arguing that that the removal of the Iraqi leaders would represent a significant step toward bringing peace to the Middle East and winning America ’s war on terrorism "
The editorial also noted that " concern for Israel ’s safety rightfully factored into the deliberations of the main Jewish groups . "
The Forward , it is worth noting , is well - connected and has a well - deserved reputation for probity in its reporting on the American Jewish community .
It is hard to see how its editors could be mistaken about such an important issue or why they would lie about it .
And they never issued a retraction .
We can therefore assume that the writers of this editorial knew what they were talking about : key groups in the lobby supported the war .
Reasonable people can disagree about how important their influence was , of course , but at a minimum these groups reinforced the Bush administration ’s resolve and made it less likely that other politicians or commentators would conduct a serious debate about the wisdom of the invasion .
Finally , it bears reiterating that I am talking about key groups and individuals in the Israel lobby , and not about the American Jewish community in toto .
Indeed , my co-author and I have repeatedly pointed to surveys showing that American Jews were less supportive of the decision to invade Iraq than the American population as a whole , and we have emphasized that it would be a cardinal error ( as well as dangerous ) to try to " blame the Jews " for the war .
Rather , blame should be reserved for Bush and Cheney ( who made the ultimate decision for war ) , for the neoconservatives who dreamed up this foolish idea , and for the various groups and individuals — including those in the lobby — who helped sell it .
Nor am I suggesting that these individuals advocated this course because they thought it would be good for Israel but bad for the United States .
Rather , they unwisely believed it would be good for both countries .
And as we all know , they were tragically wrong .
That misconception helps us understand why the Israelis and their American friends who promoted the Iraq war did n’t do a better job of covering their tracks and obscuring their enthusiasm for the endeavor .
I suspect it is because they genuinely believed that the war would be easy and would bring great benefits for both Israel and the United States .
If the war was a smashing success , then they would reap the credit and no one would spend that much time probing the war ’s origins .
And even if someone did , its proponents would be hailed as strategic geniuses who had conceived and planned a stunning victory .
Once the war went south , however , and numerous people began to probe how this disaster came about , an extensive dust - kicking operation to veil the role of Israel and the lobby was set in motion .
This campaign wo n’t work , however , because too many people already know that Israel and the lobby were cheerleaders for the war and with the passage of time , more and more evidence of their influence on the decision for war will leak out .
The situation is analogous to what happened with the events surrounding the infamous Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in August 1964 .
The Johnson administration could dissemble and cover its tracks for a few years , but eventually the real story got out , as will happen with Iraq .
Indeed , Blair ’s testimony is evidence of that process at work .
For sure , many Israelis and their friends in the United States will continue to maintain that the Sharon government actually tried to stop the march to war and that groups in the lobby – including AIPAC — stayed on the sideline and did not push for war .
But these post hoc fairy tales will be increasingly hard to sell to the American people , not only because there is a growing body of evidence which directly contradicts them ( see pp. 261-262 ) , but also because the internet and the blogosphere is allowing the word to spread .
Thankfully , we no longer have to rely on the mainstream media to get the story straight .
Finally , let ’s not forget that while the Iraq war has been a disaster for the United States , it has also been very bad for Israel , not just because its principal patron has been stuck in a quagmire in Iraq , but also because the biggest winner from the war was Iran , which is the country that Israel fears most .
All of this shows that despite the lobby ’s openly - stated commitment to promoting policies that it thinks will benefit Israel , it did not work out that way with the Iraq war .
Nor is it working out that way with its unyielding support of Israel ’s self - destructive drive to colonize the Occupied Territories , a process that is turning Israel into an apartheid state .
And the same warning applies to its efforts to keep all options - including the use of force — " on the table " vis -à - vis Iran .
Given all the problems that the lobby ’s prescriptions have produced in recent years , you ’d think U.S. leaders would have learned to ignore its advice .
But there ’s little sign of that so far , which means that these past errors are likely to be repeated .
Do n’t say I did n’t warn you .
That 's what life is like if you 're US secretary of state , I suppose .
You see President Obama to discuss the future of the Middle East at the White House on Thursday , then fly to New York the next day to be at the bedside of a 63 - year - old former US president who has had emergency coronary artery surgery - and who also just happens to be your husband .
Then , within 48 hours , you find yourself in Qatar , making international headlines by telling students on al - Jazeera that Iran is moving towards a military dictatorship , before hopping on your modified US Air Force 757 to fly to Saudi Arabia , where you find yourself cracking jokes about camels with 86 - year - old King Abdullah at his luxurious desert retreat an hour north of the capital Riyadh .
So what made the determinedly low - profile former senator Hillary Clinton poke her head above the parapets in Qatar and say such inflammatory things about Iran ?
The reason , I 'm told , is that the White House is " trying to drive a wedge " between Iran 's 70 million population and its 125,000 - member Revolutionary Guard , following President Ahmadinejad 's declaration that Iran is now a " nuclear state " .
Hence Clinton and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , were dispatched to tell Middle East leaders a thing or two about how dangerous Iran has become .
Foreign policy tragedy
Nothing , of course , is more likely to make the Iranian people embrace the Revolutionary Guard than stern lectures from the US that they should not do so .
But we should not blame Clinton for yet another American foreign policy debacle , because she is determined to be seen as a loyal foot soldier for Obama , despite the hatred she and her husband still harbour for the 44th US president following the rancorous primaries in 2008 .
Ahmadinejad 's announcement on uranium enrichment had the White House running in all directions .
" Quite frankly , [ he ] says many things and many of them turn out to be untrue , " responded Robert Gibbs , Obama 's chief spokesman , immediately .
" We do not believe they have the capability to enrich [ uranium ] to the degree to which they now say they are enriching . "
But Obama himself apparently saw it all quite differently .
" Despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use , [ Iran ] , in fact , continue [s ] to pursue a course that would lead to weaponisation , " he had insisted in an impromptu press conference at the White House just two days before .
A week before that , Gibbs had said that Iran posed no threat .
In other words , a conventionally confused US foreign policy tragedy - like so many before , but this time with Obama mouthing the predictable clichés - looms .
Hillary Clinton , I suspect , has done her duty and will now duck down below the parapet again , happily leaving Obama to extricate himself from the shambles to come ( although , lest we forget , Iran was one of the few political issues on which Clinton stood to the right of Obama in the 2008 campaign , threatening to " totally obliterate " the country ) .
Taking a post in the Obama administration might have been an agonising choice for Clinton , but for Obama it was clear - cut : he could not afford to alienate half the Democratic Party , which had supported her rather than him .
Remember : Clinton won nine of the final 16 contests , picking up 600,000 more votes and 37 more delegates than him .
By the time she withdrew , only 150,000 votes out of 36 million divided the two .
In the fortnight after Obama 's victory , Clinton faced the choice of continuing her rather humdrum , eight - year career as a New York senator while simultaneously having to raise $ 12 m to repay debts the Clinton campaign had run up - or taking up the prestigious post of US secretary of state and having the Obama campaign , which was left with surplus funds after her withdrawal , take care of the debt .
Sixteen days after Obama had defeated John McCain , Senator Clinton finally decided she would accept Obama 's offer and become the 67th US secretary of state .
Her curriculum vitae for the post was unusual : she had visited 82 countries as a presidential wife , and delivered countless speeches overseas , but she had never actually been a diplomat .
Justice for Hillary
You would hardly know it from the media , but since taking office 13 months ago Clinton - despite a very painful elbow fracture - has visited 45 countries and flown around a quarter of a million miles in that adapted 757 ( the latest trip being the first that was announced by the US state department on Twitter , before the mainstream media had been informed ) .
With­in three days of leaving her husband 's bedside , however , she was back in her six - bedroom house in Whitehaven Parkway , just south of the British embassy in Washington DC .
So what does the future hold for her ?
She says she can't envisage a second term ( assuming Obama gets one , that is ) , being constantly exhausted by travel ; and insists , about as convincingly as any politician could , that she wo n't run for the presidency again .
That means either an unlikely return to politics , or the ghastly prospect of retirement with Bill in Chappaqua in upstate New York .
There is one ultimate prize a loyal soldier and lawyer such as Hillary Clinton still has in her sights , however : a nomination to the US Supreme Court .
John Paul Stevens , the most liberal of the nine judges , will be 90 this year ; Ruth Ginsburg will be 77 and is in bad health .
Supreme Court Justice Clinton ?
Now that would lead to the mother of all nomination battles

K Street prospered in 2009 despite the lingering recession , as many firms reported sharp revenue increases thanks to a busy Democratic agenda .
On Wednesday , at least 18 firms out of the top 25 reported growth in their lobbying revenue from 2008 to 2009 , according to new records released under the Lobbying Disclosure Act .
Lobbyists credited the surge in revenue to Washington actively looking to turn around the downturn as well as an aggressive legislative agenda by the incoming Obama administration and substantial Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It was an amazing year in terms of the number of things that came up and the momentous nature of them , ” said Mark Ruge , co-chairman of the policy group at K&L Gates .
“ I have never even seen anything remotely like this year in terms of intensity and magnitude . ”
K&L Gates earned $ 18.5 million in lobbying fees in 2009 , a 23 percent improvement on its performance in 2008 .
Calling it a “ once- in-a- generation ” year , Ruge said some of the debates that dominated 2009 — from the stimulus package to healthcare reform — alone were enough to keep lobbyists busy .
But with so much being done at once by President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE and Democrats on Capitol Hill , business for lobbyists went into overdrive .
Ruge was not alone in having a good year in lobbying .
Several other firms matched K&L Gates ’s climb , if not surpassed it .
The Podesta Group has now firmly established itself as one of the very top earners among lobby firms .
The firm earned more than $ 25 million in lobbying fees in 2009 , or a 60 percent increase from the nearly $ 16 million it earned in 2008 .
Holland & Knight also saw profits rise in 2009 , finishing with more than $ 21 million , or $ 6 million more than its 2008 earnings .
Patton Boggs kept its top spot among K Street firms , however .
The firm earned more than $ 40 million in lobbying fees in 2009 , showing 4 percent growth over its 2008 figures .
Runner - up Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &
Feld saw its lobbying revenue decline by 6 percent from 2008 , posting more than $ 32 million in lobbying earnings this past year .
“ You had an uptick from the business community in general that was concerned by the Obama administration and significant Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress , ” said Al Mottur , managing partner of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck .
“ That is probably why you see so many firms showing increases this year . ”
Brownstein had 57 percent growth in lobbying revenue from 2008 to 2009 , earning more than $ 23 million last year .
Corporations of all stripes flocked to Washington over the past year and hired lobbyists to deal with the president ’s policy agenda .
From following through on the Wall Street bailout to battling back financial regulatory reform — including a proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency and a bank fee — the banking industry has not been light on lobbying lately .
In addition , climate change legislation has inspired intense opposition from oil and gas companies .
But several lobbyists said it was unlikely that their firms would be able to maintain the 2009 revenue levels this year .
Several major pieces of legislation are unlikely to come up this year , such as a climate change bill , or are coming to a close , such as healthcare reform legislation .
Coupled with the elections that will drag lawmakers out of town and onto the campaign trail , lobbyists expect there will not be a repeat of 2009 ’s action on Capitol Hill .
“ We were not going to have another stimulus .
Climate change legislation is looking unlikely , ” Mottur said .
“ It is not going to generate as much new interest from clients . ”
Others said the surprise election of Scott Brown ( R ) to the Massachusetts Senate seat will slow Congress down and thus require less lobbying .
Democrats will no longer have their supermajority of 60 seats in the Senate when Brown is sworn in .
“ You will probably see a scaled - back agenda with a survivalist tendency , going back to bread - and - butter issues that played in the Massachusetts election , like jobs and taxes , ” said Mike Ferrell , chairman of the legislative group for Venable .
“ I do n’t know how you are going to see the same kind of revenue growth that you did in 2009 .
And I am an optimist . ”
Venable was another firm that showed marked gains in 2009 .
The firm earned $ 12 million in lobbying fees , 40 percent growth from 2008 .
Nevertheless , some lobbyists are expecting a busy year .
Lawmakers will want to swing into action , boosting job creation and reforming Wall Street to ward off election defeats , according to Jack Quinn , chairman of Quinn Gillespie & Associates .
“ The trajectory of a host of policy issues is going to change .
I think we are going to see a lot of work , ” Quinn said regarding Brown ’s election .
His firm showed a decline of 17 percent in lobbying revenue from 2008 , taking in more than $ 13 million last year .
Despite the decline , Quinn said he is planning on expanding his firm and will build out its public relations arm this year .
“ We did an incredible job of controlling costs and were able to maintain the same profit margin we have had for years , ” Quinn said .
“ That has allowed us to start out on a rebuilding effort . ”
Not all firms had reported their lobbying revenues to The Hill as of Wednesday .
Check back on thehill.com in the coming days to see how more firms fared in 2009 .

Accusations of raping a 12 year - old are just the beginning .
When Joshua Beadle goes to trial this month for attempted rape of a child , he will be easily identified .
Joshua Beadle was in interesting garb as he appeared in Criminal Court Friday .
The 22 - year - old man will be the only one in Criminal Court wearing a spit mask -- a protective hood of plastic and mesh -- that a judge said Friday he has earned by his behavior in court and in jail over the past year .
Beadle has been written up 50 times since last year for incidents including spitting and flinging urine , feces and other bodily fluids at jailers ; striking jailers ; refusing to obey orders ; fondling himself in front of female attorneys ; and attacking a jailer while holding a 3 - inch metal shank .
In previous court hearings , Beadle has screamed and cursed , fought with deputies and kicked furniture , but Friday he said he would behave in trial if the judge would removed the mask , shackles and jail officers who escort him everywhere he goes . "
He 's asking this court ' Judge , trust me again , ' but this court is not willing to take that risk , " said Criminal Court Judge Lee Coffee .
" There are no measures less restrictive .
He has left this court with no alternative .
" Charges Beadle has picked up since he was jailed include eight counts of assault , three counts of indecent exposure , two counts of disorderly conduct and one count of aggravated assault .
His record also includes arrests for robbery , burglary , evading arrest , criminal trespass , theft and domestic assault .
" I let my temper take control of me , " Beadle said through his mask Friday in explaining a previous outburst in court .
" I have been doing better .
" His last incident in the jail , however , occurred just this week , said state prosecutor Marianne Bell .
Case law , she added , allows a judge discretion in how to maintain courtroom safety with the least drastic measures .
Defense attorney Greg Carman argued that the mask and shackles would unfairly prejudice his client in the eyes of jurors , but the judge said that was the only way to maintain security .
Coffee said he would instruct jurors not to allow the security measures to influence their verdict .

Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen will race for Lotus next year , after the newly - formed Formula 1 team confirmed its line - up in a press conference held in Malaysia today .
Malaysian - born Fairuz Fauzy was also announced as the team 's third driver .
The Lotus line - up was officially revealed by Malaysia 's sports minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek in a press conference in Kuala Lumpur , and the minister emphasised the government 's expectations from its support of the new team .
" I 'm very pleased that local talents have been recognised to help drive the team , with key appointments being made among Malaysians in particular , " Cheek was quoted as saying .
" I 'm very elated that the driver development programme is already underway to promote motorsports as an affordable sporting activity among Malaysians .
" This project will not only make the country proud but will be a launch pad for Malaysia towards future growth , especially towards high - tech industry .
Indeed , this project should be 100 per cent supported by Malaysians , individuals or corporations to ensure it becomes a success .
" Since the prime minister announced the 1 Malaysia project in September , I 'm very happy to note that the team has achieved significant progress , with the car being fully built and tested and I believe they are on track to make an impact next season "
The Malaysian minister further congratulated Lotus on its experienced choice of drivers , stating : " I 'm personally impressed with Lotus F1 Racing driver line - up for next year , with its good combination of experience , drive and stamina . "
Trulli joins Lotus from Toyota , after the Japanese team pulled out of F1 last month ; while Kovalainen has left McLaren , where he will be replaced by world champion Jenson Button .
Lotus team principal Tony Fernandes also outlined the drivers ' experience , but also said the Italian and Finn will bring exuberance to the team .
" Trulli will bring us a lot of experience to develop the team .
Heikki is a young driver with a lot of experience so I think we have fantastic drivers , with Fairuz as well .
It is a wonderful mix of experience , youth and passion . "
Lotus is one of four new teams to join the 26 - car F1 grid in 2010 , along with Campos , US F1 and Manor .
Fernandes stated the team 's objective is to be the best of the newcomers .
" We are not setting any big targets , we want to at least be the best of the new teams , " he said .
" But I think it shows our seriousness today by announcing two really world class drivers . "
For Trulli , this will be the third time in his F1 career that he will team up with technical director Mike Gascoyne , having worked with the Briton at Renault and then Toyota .
And the Italian admitted this was one of the main reasons he elected to join Lotus .
" I have been impressed by the long - term vision of the team management and technical staff , " Trulli said in a statement .
" Tony has set out very ambitious plans and I am ready to help the team achieve these high targets .
" I am also pleased to be back working alongside Mike Gascoyne , someone with whom I have enjoyed previous success at other teams .
I get on very well with him and I respect his working style . "
Kovalainen too emphasised how impressed he is with the team 's progress , saying : " I recently visited our factory and was so impressed by seeing how far the team has come in such a short time since it was launched in September , and by how determined everyone is to meet Tony 's ambitious targets .
" I knew immediately it would be a fantastic opportunity to help them achieve their goals . "
As for Fauzy , the 27 - year - old Malaysian driver said joining Lotus was the highlight of his racing career , which includes testing for Spyker in F1 , racing in the GP2 series and in A1GP , and most recently racing in Formula Renault 3.5 , where he finished second in the 2009 championship .
" There is no greater honour than having the chance to drive for your country , " the Malaysian said .
" I was given the opportunity to do that for A1 Team Malaysia in A1GP for a couple of years , but to have the chance to join Malaysia 's first fully fledged Formula 1 team is very special for me and the highlight of my career so far .
" I look forward to working closely with Jarno and Heikki on developing the car and the team in our first season together in Formula 1 .
I am sure we can do Malaysia as a nation proud . "
Recently the Chief of the met office went on UK TV to say :
“ OUR SHORT TERM FORECASTS ARE AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD . ” ( see video here )
Yesterday , the UK Met Office had to make a rare mea culpa , saying they had botched their own recent snow forecast , it is useful to point out that they are n’t the only one with egg on their faces .
In early October , the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) took an unexpected dip into deeply negative territory , which led to the sixth snowiest October on record in the Northern Hemisphere and the snowiest on record in the US .
If you look at the 14 day forecast at the bottom of the graph below , you can see that the dip caught NOAA forecasters off guard .

Hi all
Well I have my own article on where the heck is global warming ?
We are asking that here in Boulder where we have broken records the past two days for the coldest days on record .
We had 4 inches of snow .
The high the last 2 days was below 30 F and the normal is 69 F , and it smashed the previous records for these days by 10 F .
The low was about 18 F and also a record low , well below the previous record low .
This is January weather ( see the Rockies baseball playoff game was canceled on saturday and then played last night in below freezing weather ) .

The fact is that we ca n’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a
travesty that we can’t .

Once again , this begs the question – if the GCMs ca n’t forecast the AO two weeks in advance , how can they possible forecast snow and cold 70 years in advance ?
University of Colorado professor Mark Williams used climate models in 2008 to come up with a remarkable prediction ( below ) in a year when Aspen broke their snowfall record .
Study : Climate change may force skiers uphill
From the From the Associated Press
Tuesday , December 16 , 2008
DENVER —
A study of two Rocky Mountain ski resorts says climate change will mean shorter seasons and less snow on lower slopes .
The study by two Colorado researchers says Aspen Mountain in Colorado and Park City in Utah will see dramatic changes even with a reduction in carbon emissions , which fuel climate change .
University of Colorado - Boulder geography professor Mark Williams said Monday that the resorts should be in fairly good shape the next 25 years , but after that there will be less snowpack — or no snow at all — at the base areas , and the season will be shorter because snow will accumulate later and melt earlier .
If carbon emissions increase , the average temperature at Park City will be 10.4 degrees warmer by 2100 , and there likely will be no snowpack , according to the study .
Skiing at Aspen , with an average temperature 8.6 degrees higher than now , will be marginal .
Since the first of October , Colorado is averaging two to eight degrees below normal , as is most of the US :

In December 2009 , Colorado averaged three to fifteen degrees below normal , once again correlating with a strongly negative Arctic Oscillation

Climate models are iterative through time , which means once they go off in the weeds they can not recover .
If AO trends can not be forecast more than a few days in advance , it would seem problematic to make any sort of meaningful long - term climate projections using GCMs .

Britain 's rudest place names
As locals in West Yorkshire win their battle to reinstate the name of Tickle Cock Bridge , we list the rudest place names in the country .
Joel , the owner of an extract manufacturing plant , constantly finds himself in precarious situations that steadily worsen by the minute .
First , his soon - to - be floor manager acquires a serious injury in a machine malfunctioning accident that subsequently endangers the wellbeing of his company .
Second , his personal life does n't fair much better when he takes the advice of his bartending friend Dean during a drug - induced brainstorming session on how to test his wife 's faithfulness .
Finally , compounding these catastrophes is new employee Cindy , who happens to be a scam artist intent on milking the company for all its worth .
Now , Joel must attempt to piece his company and his marriage back together all while trying to figure out what he 's really after in life .
Written by The Massie Twins
When the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on March 2 , 2010 in the landmark gun rights case McDonald v. Chicago , the Second Amendment wo n't be the only thing on the justices ' minds .
That 's because when it comes to protecting constitutional rights from the depredations of state and local governments , the Court must obey the 14th Amendment , which commands : " No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . "
McDonald will therefore turn on whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to Chicago via the 14th Amendment 's Privileges or Immunities Clause or via its Due Process Clause .
That distinction matters because the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been a dead letter since the controversial Slaughterhouse Cases of 1873 , which gutted the clause while upholding a state - sanctioned slaughterhouse monopoly in Louisiana .
And despite overwhelming historical evidence that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was specifically written and ratified after the Civil War in order to secure individual rights against state abuse — including the right to armed self - defense — Slaughterhouse has never been overturned .
So the stakes in McDonald are high indeed .
And they are n't just limited to gun rights .
Consider this :
Among the legal experts lining up in support of overturning Slaughterhouse and reviving the Privileges or Immunities Clause is liberal law professor Akhil Amar of Yale University .
Nobody 's idea of a gun nut , Amar is a supporter of progressive politics .
And in his opinion , so were the authors of the Privileges or Immunities Clause .
" The framers of the 14th Amendment were radical redistributionists , " Amar told The Wall Street Journal .
" The 13th Amendment frees the slaves and there 's no compensation .
It 's the biggest redistribution of property in history . "
Under this interpretation , the privileges or immunities of citizenship might include the right to health care , to a living wage , or to some other welfare right fancied by today 's progressive activists .
It 's a clever argument , but it does n't hold up .
Amar conveniently ignores the 14th Amendment 's origins in the free labor philosophy of the Radical Republicans , who drafted and spearheaded its ratification in 1868 .
Remember that the anti-slavery movement that produced those Republicans rejected human bondage as a violation of natural rights , or as the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison put it , " man can not hold property in man . "
The escaped former slave Frederick Douglass made the same point in the famous letter he wrote to his former master .
" You are a man and so am I , " Douglass declared , echoing the Lockean idea of possessing a property right to your own body .
" In leaving you , I took nothing but what belonged to me , and in no way lessened your means for obtaining an honest living .
Your faculties remained yours , and mine became useful to their rightful owner . "
That 's not redistribution , it 's restitution .
Douglass simply reclaimed his own stolen property from the unjust regime that took it .
In the aftermath of the Civil War , the former Confederate states sought to resurrect that vile regime with a web of laws and regulations that robbed the freed slaves ( and their white allies ) of their civil , political , and economic rights .
Mississippi's Black Code , for example , declared " that no freedman , free Negro , or mulatto … shall keep or carry firearms of any kind , " while Louisiana 's Black Code mandated that , " Every negro is required to be in the regular service of some white person , or former owner , who shall be held responsible for the conduct of said negro . "
That 's the historical context that produced the 14th Amendment .
As the Institute for Justice writes in the friend of the court brief it filed in McDonald , " To enslave a class of people requires three basic things : destroy their self - sufficiency , prevent them from fighting back , and silence any opposition .
Southern states did all of those things both before and after the Civil War , and the point of the Fourteenth Amendment was to make them stop . "
In sum , the 14th Amendment was designed to protect an individualistic and market - oriented form of self - ownership , one that includes the right to armed self - defense , the right to private property , the right to liberty of contract , and the right to pursue an honest living free from arbitrary and unnecessary government interference .
That 's the libertarian promise of the Privileges or Immunities Clause .
And that 's why Tuesday 's arguments in McDonald v. Chicago matter for both gun rights and economic liberty .
Damon W. Root is an associate editor at Reason magazine .
Steve Jobs announced the iPad this week , and technologists have run the gamut of responses .
Some people think it will fart rainbows .
Some think its reason - defying sorcery and closed software will inveigle unsuspecting hackers into a gloomy extinction .
For the most part , however , the response has amounted to a banal whine about Flash , multitasking , and maxi pads .
Why anyone would complain about not being continually tortured by Flash is beyond me — but that 's another post entirely .
I 'm continually led to appreciate the history of Computer Science .
I write software for a living , and I 've used a number of different languages .
I began in O - BASIC , and I 've taken an analogous path to the one described by Paul Graham in Revenge of the Nerds :
If you look at these languages in order , Java , Perl , Python , you notice an interesting pattern .
At least , you notice this pattern if you are a Lisp hacker .
Each one is progressively more like Lisp .
Python copies even features that many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes .
You could translate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line .
It 's 2002 , and programming languages have almost caught up with 1958 .
" Programming languages have almost caught up with 1958 . "
Something about that really resonates with me , and I do n't think it 's only because I 've been drinking the Lisp - flavored Clojure Kool - Aid .
In fact , I 'm sure it 's not .
I remember the day I had the MVC epiphany .
I 'd worked a little bit in Spring 's framework and had recently dove into the relatively soothing balm of Rails .
My prior projects had n't had any really clean separation .
" Man , " I thought , " what a great , new invention .
I do n't know how people developed web applications before MVC existed . "
Then I discovered that MVC originated in Xerox PARC in the 70s .
Of course , I should have known better — I had to read all sorts of PARC papers in school .
Never underestimate your own capacity to forget important and interesting information .
Here 's the interesting thing : we 're constantly leaving what 's rooted in history and rigor for the technique du jour .
Lisp is n't for everyone , but enough incredibly smart people swear by it that it should give you pause .
There may be a good alternative to MVC for your application , but chances are you 've exchanged it for a fragile pile of highly - coupled , poorly organized classes .
You may think it 's OK to treat a Java interface like a C header file ( yes , I maintained code that had this charming characteristic ) , but this simply indicates that you do n't know the first thing about object - oriented programming .
Now , it would be silly of me to quote Revenge of the Nerds and then make some ( de ) moralizing point about " industry best practices . "
My point thus far is this : for a given problem , it 's likely that an efficient and elegant solution exists already ( even if only in concept ) .
And very often , it was invented years ago .
It is good to be well - versed in the history of your trade .
This will help you know how to think about whole classes of problems .
And this — finally — brings me back to the iPad .
Critics are right to be at least a little disappointed , but not due to the likes of Flash or multitasking .
The iPhone and iPad are still behind research prototyped at PARC ( yes , them again ) in the late 80s .
Mark Weiser 's Ubiquitous Computing research conceived of and built a variety of devices for home and office use — called tabs , pads , and boards — sized just like iPhones , iPads , and large LCD screens .
They even wrote software and built networking devices to stitch the environment together .
It 's obvious that Xerox has had a profound impact on Steve Jobs , from the Lisa to the iPhone .
When I first heard about the iPhone in 2007 , I instantly thought of the ParcTab .
Hardware has improved tremendously since the ParcTab experiments and papers .
Apple now reaps the benefits of faster and cheaper processors , ram , and storage .
Wireless networking is pervasive and fast .
Screens are vastly better , and touch inputs have obviously improved .
The device is supremely capable .
But the ubiquitous user interface is completely absent .
I recently advised a nontechnical friend about purchasing an iPhone .
She wanted to know how it interfaced with her computer and TV .
" It really does n't , " was my response .
But she expected it to .
It does n't take an engineer to see that devices like the iPhone and iPad ought to operate as an extension to the computer or TV .
Instead , we have this media syncing model that 's reminiscent of some lousy corporate PDA .
Technology pundits who are quibbling about little features are missing the point : the iPad should have made the jump to seamless , ubiquitous integration .
This would have been a technological revolution equivalent to the introduction of the iPhone .
This is the next step .
Both the iPhone and the iPad should operate as stand - alone devices .
But they could bring so much more power and flexibility if they also acted as extensions to a desktop , laptop , or distributed network .
A general - purpose , network - aware , hand - held device that can continue operating without the network .
Access this computer and that ; give a presentation on this screen ; share files with these people ; receive and send email ; play a game ; order lunch — and use any of your iPhone , iPad , or MacBook at any point in the progression , with the others automatically and wirelessly synced .
This is what I expected of Apple .
Indeed , Mark Weiser accurately predicted our current systems in 1996 .
In The Coming age of Calm Technology , he describes a transition from the internet and distributed computing to " The UC Era " — and he said it would take place between 2005 and 2020 .
He describes the philosophy of UC with four tenets :
The purpose of a computer is to help you do something else .
The best computer is a quiet , invisible servant .
The more you can do by intuition the smarter you are ; the computer should extend your unconscious .
Technology should create calm .
This is the standard to which Apple should be held .
We 're collectively forgetting how good the iPad should be , because we 're forgetting how much brilliant computer science research has already been done .
Like Java , Perl , and Python , the present incarnation will inch towards superior and older definition .
And although I disagree with them philosophically about the openness of their systems to hackers , I believe they will soon reach the ubiquitous computing standard .
This will be good for technology all around .
Just remember to peer back a few decades occasionally and recall exactly how much we should expect from modern - day engineering .
What has been is what will be ,
and what has been done is what will be done ,
and there is nothing new under the sun .
Ecclesiastes
Jay Leno , expressing what he called " surprise and disappointment " with NBC executives , said yesterday that he believed his performance as the host of the " Tonight " show should have more than satisfied the network and that he did not deserve to be threatened with losing the leading show in late - night television to David Letterman .
" Am I crazy ? " Mr. Leno said in a telephone interview .
" The ratings are going up , the advertisers are happy and so are the affiliates . "
And yet Mr. Leno said he had not received any assurances from NBC executives in New York that he would not be dropped in favor of Mr. Letterman by Jan. 15 .
That is the deadline NBC is facing to match a CBS offer to give Mr. Letterman about $ 16 million to star in a nightly talk show at 11:30 , the same time as the " Tonight " show .
" I am disappointed , " Mr. Leno said .
" I feel like a guy who has bought a car from somebody , painted it , fixed it up and made it look nice and then the guy comes back and says he promised to sell the car to his brother - in - law . "
Go Elsewhere ?
' Of Course '
Mr. Leno said he would " obviously leave NBC immediately " if the network decided to give the " Tonight " show to Mr. Letterman .
He said he would absolutely refuse to do a show in the 12:30 A.M. spot now occupied by Mr. Letterman 's show , " Late Night , " and would indeed consider creating the same problem for NBC that Mr. Letterman 's proposed deal with CBS caused .

Peter Olenick , a 25 - year - old freestyle skier and gold medalist in the Big Air skiing competition at last weekend ’s 2010 Winter X Games , vividly recalls the first time he tried the Whiskey Flip , his self - invented marquee trick , a twisty , somersaulting double flip executed 20 feet or so above the halfpipe ’s lip .
‘‘ It was terrifying , ’’ he says .
‘‘ I did n’t even know if it could be done .
But I ’d been doing it over and over in my head , so I figured I could make it go right . ’’
Some deep breaths , some mental finger - crossing and ‘‘ I just kind of hucked it , ’’ he says , landing cleanly , exhilarated .
A second attempt was even ‘‘ scarier .
Now my body knew what was happening .
But I did it .
Fear kind of keeps all of us going . ’’
Fear may be the signature emotion of the Winter Olympics , prickling the skin hairs and sharpening the senses of all those athletes moving fast over slick , unforgiving surfaces .
‘‘ Everybody feels fear out there , and I mean everybody , ’’ says Ross Hindman , the founder and program director of the International Snowboard Training Centers in Colorado and California , which specialize in training midlevel and elite snowboarders .
Fear affects those of us too who recreationally strap on skis , snowboards , skates or , more rarely , a skin suit in advance of a bobsled run .
‘‘ The issue is how you deal with fear , ’’ Mr. Hindman says .
A study first published online in December by the journal Nature suggests one method of dealing with fear , at least the kind caused by the painful tumbles so common in winter sports .
The method has long been practiced in sports but not always , the study suggests , to fullest advantage .
In the experiment , conducted at New York University , volunteers were conditioned to be afraid of blue squares flashing on a computer screen when the sight was paired with a mild shock to the wrist .
The next day , researchers tried to extinguish that fear by having the volunteers watch the squares without being shocked .
The hope was ‘‘ to rewrite the emotional component ’’ of the fearful memory ‘‘ with something that makes it feel safe , ’’ says Daniela Schiller , a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and lead author of the study .
‘‘ That ’s kind of like what we do sometimes , ’’ said Mr. Olenick , the freestyle skier , when told of the technique .
‘‘ You watch video of yourself ’ ’ — flailing , crashing , lying inert at the base of the halfpipe .
‘‘ Then you can start imagining how you ’ll do it better the next time . ’’
What Ms. Schiller ’s team found , though , was that such facing up to and revising memories of a frightening event has to be done within a particular time frame to be effective .
Only if the memory is uppermost and fresh in your mind can it be rewritten .
In the N.Y.U. study , this was apparent in a subset of the volunteers whose memories of the shocks were reactivated by being exposed to the blue squares again only minutes before the extinction process .
They had the fearful memory vividly before them , so when they started seeing blue squares stripped of menace , they rewrote their feelings about blue squares .
They were no longer afraid of them .
Volunteers who were not made to replay the fearful memory just before the extinction process did n’t permanently lose their fear .
It returned the next day .
Revising a fearful memory is a mental , neurological process .
You are calling up from memory circuits the unpleasant vision of yourself tumbling down the mountainside and overlaying it with a vision of yourself staying upright .
If you ca n’t practice the technique right there on the slope , that ’s probably O.K. , Ms. Schiller says .
The key seems to be reliving the experience ( as quickly as possible ) and then , without delaying or turning away , rethinking it .
You have only a short window in which a memory is ‘‘ vulnerable to revision , ’’ Ms. Schiller says , before it ’s returned to long - term brain storage .
This technique wo n’t , by the way , rid you of the memory .
‘‘ We think that you ca n’t change the content of a memory , ’’ Ms. Schiller says .
‘‘ But you can change the emotions around it . ’’
You can make that fall , in memory , tolerable .
And if trepidation still dogs you on the slopes or , as it does to me , keeps you from approaching situations where you could fall , there ’s always foam .
‘‘ Protective pads , ’’ says Jeff Mugleston , the manager of the renowned snow sports school at Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico , ‘‘ are a huge confidence booster .
Helmets , wrist guards , kneepads , butt pads .
We recommend people load up ’’ when they are learning new skills and tricks .
The pros do n’t stint , either .
‘‘ Shaun White had a whole halfpipe built with a foam pit in it , ’’ Mr. Hindman says , in order to practice safely the 30 - some - foot - high twists of the now - famous Double Cork trick .
“ The best thing about fear , ” Mr. Mugleston concludes , “ is that it makes you act smarter . ”
I am going on leave to work on a book related to all I ’ve been writing about in the Phys Ed column .
I will be back in the spring .
In the meantime , I ’d love to hear from you .

Se argumenta que en la Constitución no hay un concepto de familia ni un modelo ideal de la misma , por lo que proteger ese hipotético modelo implicaría dejar sin protección a otros
[ email protected ]@eluniversal.com.mx
La evolución del concepto y de los tipo de familias que han surgido en México durante los últimos 35 años sustentaron la defensa principal del gobierno de la ciudad a las reformas de ley que permiten los matrimonios entre personas del mismo sexo y su posibilidad de adoptar .
Ayer , la consejera jurídica del gobierno capitalino , Leticia Bonifaz , entregó a la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación ( SCJN ) el informe que fija la postura de las autoridades locales sobre esas uniones .
El documento forma parte del proceso que se sigue en el tribunal , y busca desvirtuar los argumentos de la PGR al promover la acción de inconstitucionalidad contra de las reformas al Código Civil local .
En el informe de las autoridades locales se destaca que estudios recientes de sociólogos han formulado diversas tipologías de familia , como la unipersonal , las parejas sin hijos o con hijos , las madres sin cónyuge , las parejas del mismo sexo y las personas unidas en segundas nupcias .
Se argumenta que en la Constitución no hay un concepto de familia ni un modelo ideal de la misma , por lo que proteger ese hipotético modelo implicaría dejar sin protección a otros tipos de familia .
Luego de entregar el informe en la oficialía de partes de la SCJN , Bonifaz dijo que , en el caso de la adopción , se aclara que la Asamblea Legislativa del DF ( ALDF ) no realizó reforma alguna .
Además “ señalamos que un niño adoptado no va a criarse en un esfera aislada , sino que va a tener primos , abuelos , tíos y otros parientes como cualquier familia mexicana ” , expresó la funcionaria .
Diputados defienden ley Alejandra Barrales , presidenta de la Comisión de Gobierno de la ALDF , anunció que solicitará a la Corte que haga público todo el expediente sobre las reformas que permiten el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo y su derecho a adoptar , ya que los detractores de esa reforma tratan de confundir a la opinión pública .
Luego de presentar ante la Suprema Corte los argumentos de la ALDF sobre esas reformas , la diputada señaló que hay quienes mencionan que en las reformas realizadas se hicieron cambios al tema de adopción , lo cual no es cierto .
“ Aquí estamos confirmando que es falso , no se ha tocado ni un punto ni una coma sobre el tema del régimen de adopciones , y el Distrito Federal es de los más rigurosos ” , insistió .
Acompañada por los legisladores David Razú y Maricela Contreras , principales impulsores de esta reforma , Barrales dijo que la PGR no tiene ningún argumento y sólo ha dado a conocer señalamientos que son falsos .
“ Le corresponderá comprobar su dicho al procurador general y nos preocupa que una institución tan importante de justicia de manera poco responsable haga este tipo de señalamientos cuando es evidente que ni siquiera ha leído la reforma a los Códigos Civil y de Procedimientos Civiles del Distrito Federal ” , lamentó .

In fact , according to one recent report I ’ve read , you ’d have to eat seven to nine 2009 peaches to get the same nutritional content packed into one 1950s peach .
What ’s the bottom line ?
Unless you eat a dozen peaches , two heads of lettuce , and 25 tomatoes a day , you might not be getting all the vitamins and minerals you need .
Start with a solid multivitamin that ’s got at least 25 mg of B1 , B2 , and B6 .
This is an excellent litmus test for whether or not your multivitamin is any good .

Ed Henry , on CNN with Candy Crowley :
“ CROWLEY : It is .
And despite the fact that you ’ve covered both the stories for us , you ’ve had time for a little sleuthing into the background of — in the high school background , in particular , talking to some of the people who knew President Barack Obama when he was there .
What did you find out ?
HENRY : Well , I talked to a couple of his classmates from the class of ‘ 79 .
He was on the basketball team that won the state championship .
They knew him as Barry back then .
And a couple of funny things , one the basketball court , they say he was a slasher , and one of his colleagues , it was the point guard , told me that that sort of slashing , take no prisoners attitude he thinks is carrying over into the presidency because this is why Barack Obama is now not afraid to make tough decisions .
He also said he ’s a real trash talker on the court , even today , because some of friends still get together to play with him .
The funny thing was : his high school classmates were telling that me that a young Barry Obama used to scoop ice cream at Baskin - Robbins .
They said one the side , he used to slip them some free ice cream and frozen yogurt .
I sort of have coaxed it out of them because they did n’t want to acknowledge it first .
And I said , look , the statute of limitations is past , it ’s been 30 years now .
They laughed and said , “ OK , he gave us free ice cream . ”
So , while working at one of the precious few jobs Obama has ever had , he stole from his employer .
And CNN ’s reporter , Ed Henry thought he was sharing a cute Obama story .
Liberals can argue that pilfering a little ice cream from a big , mean corporation is not Madoff level larceny .
But , what does it say about the character of the man who is now president of the United States ?
The moribund mainstream media does n’t find anything wrong with a little embezzling as long as it ’s their beloved Obama doing the stealing .
Ask a small business owner to appreciate the quaint humor of this beguiling little story from Obama ’s youth .
Henry ’s glaring ignorance about security clearances is an excellent illustration of why nobody trusts the debauched media any more :
“ I think he , clearly , passed the FBI background check .
So , there ’s no worry about the future president stealing or giving out free ice cream , Candy . ”
Ed , you dolt , there is NO background check for POTUS .
Should n’t these geniuses at the mainstream press know something about how we elect presidents ?
Numerous government positions require some level of security screening , as do sensitive jobs in the private sector involving certain types of government contracts .
The job of President of the United States , regrettably , does not require any level of security clearance .
An Army private who may come into contact with classified documents must be cleared .
The Commander in Chief is exempt from any such scrutiny .
The president also decides who within his administration should be cleared and at what level .
In 1995 , Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12958 - Classified National Security Information , as Amended .
To no one ’s astonishment , Clinton amended the previous order to facilitate the declassification of information .
With emblematic liberal disregard for threats to the nation ’s security , Clinton ’s order required that classifiers would have to “ justify ” the classification of any information .
Employees would be “ encouraged ” to challenge “ improper ” classification .
In a press release dated April 17 , 1995 , Clinton said : “ We will no longer tolerate the excesses of the current system .
For example , we will resolve doubtful calls about classification in favor of keeping the information unclassified . ”
Setting aside for the moment , the hilarity of Bill Clinton condemning excesses , the message was fairly unambiguous .
Radical left wing groups cheered Clinton ’s move as an unmistakable cue that the country ’s security was likely to be compromised .
In 2003 , President Bush amended 12958 by Executive Order 13292 .
The bulk of Clinton ’s order remained intact .
Bush did , however , remove the burden on government employees who sought classification of foreign information .
Bush also expanded the authority of the vice president in making decisions about classification of sensitive information .
Plainly , Bush , like the rest of us , never foresaw a Vice President Joe Biden .
Nor did anyone presage that the American people would install a national security risk in the White House .
Lamentably , the President of the United States has the authority to classify information or delegate classification authority .
The populous seems to believe that to become president , a candidate surely has been screened and been granted some kind of security clearance .
If that were true , we never would have had the Clintons .
The first step in applying for a national security clearance is the SF86 - Questionnaire for National Security Positions .

The US military 's takeover of emergency operations in Haiti has triggered a diplomatic row with countries and aid agencies furious at having flights redirected .
Brazil and France lodged an official ­protest with Washington after US military aircraft were given priority at Port - au - Prince 's congested airport , forcing many non-US flights to divert to the Dominican Republic .
Brasilia warned it would not ­relinquish command of UN forces in Haiti , and Paris complained the airport had become a US " annexe " , exposing a brewing power struggle amid the global relief effort .
The Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières also complained about diverted flights .
The row prompted Haiti's president , René Préval , to call for calm .
" This is an extremely difficult situation , " he told AP .
" We must keep our cool to co-ordinate and not throw accusations at each other . "
The squabbling came amid signs that aid was reaching some of the hundreds of thousands of people in desperate need of water , food and medicine six days after a magnitude 7 earthquake levelled the capital , killing more than 100,000 , according to Haitian authorities .
The UN was feeding 40,000 and hoped to increase that to 1 million within a fortnight , said the secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , as he arrived in Port - au - Prince yesterday .
" I am here with a message of hope that help is on the way , " he said , speaking outside the severely damaged national palace .
He also acknowledged " that many people are frustrated and they are losing their patience . "
Ban said he has three priorities in Haiti : saving as many lives as possible , stepping up humanitarian assistance and ensuring the co-ordination of aid coming into the country .
" We should not waste even a single item , a dollar , " he said .
The plight of 80 elderly people at a partially collapsed municipal hospice just a mile from the airport , now a huge aid hub , showed the desperate need .
The body of a dead 70 - year - old man rotted on a mattress , nearly indistinguishable from the exhausted , hungry and thirsty people around him .
" Others wo n't live until tonight , " an administrator , Jean Emmanuel , told the Associated Press .
The Haitian government has established 14 food distribution points and aid groups have opened five emergency health centres .
Water - purification units – a priority to avert disease and dehydration – were arriving .
But with aftershocks jolting the ruins , bloated bodies in the street and severe shortages of water and food many survivors had had enough : an exodus trekked on foot out of the city to rural areas .
The security situation worsened , with some looters fighting with rocks and clubs for rice , clothing and other goods scavenged from debris .
In places the embryonic aid machine did not even try to organise distribution .
Aid workers tossed out food packets to crowds and US helicopters took off as soon as they offloaded supplies , prompting scrambles in which the fittest and strongest prevailed .
" They are not identifying the people who need the water .
The sick and the old have no chance , " Estime Pierre Deny , ­hoping to fill a plastic container with water amid a scrum of people , told Reuters .
Frustration over aid bottlenecks among donors became tinged by national rivalry as it became clear the US was taking ownership of the crisis .
A vanguard of more than 1,000 US troops was on the ground and 12,000 were expected in the region by today , including marines aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson which anchored offshore as a " floating airport " .
The Haitian government , paralysed by the destruction of the presidential palace and ministries , signed a memorandum of understanding formally transferring control of Toussaint L'Ouverture airport to the US .
Former president Bill Clinton said he will travel to Haiti today to meet with government officials and deliver much - needed emergency supplies .
The UN mission , which had a 9,000 - strong peacekeeping force in Haiti before the quake , seemed too stunned by its own losses to take control .
Its dead include its Tunisian head , Hédi Annabi , his Brazilian deputy , Luiz Carlos da Costa , and the acting police commissioner , Doug Coates , a Canadian .
Flights seeking permission to land continuously circle the airport , which is damaged and has only a single runway , rankling several governments and aid agencies .
" There are 200 flights going in and out every day , which is an incredible amount for a country like Haiti , " Jarry Emmanuel , air logistics officer for the UN's World Food Programme , told the New York Times .
" But most flights are for the US military .
Their priorities are to secure the country .
Ours are to feed .
We have got to get those priorities in sync . "
France , which as the former ­colonial power expects a prominent role , ­protested when an emergency field hospital was turned back .
The foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said the airport was not for the international community but " an annexe of Washington " , according to France 's ambassador to Haiti , Didier Le Bret .
Brazil , which saw its leadership of the UN peacekeeping mission as a calling card of its burgeoning influence , was also indignant when three flights were not allowed to land .
The foreign ministry reportedly asked Hillary Clinton to grant Brazil priority over chartered flights .
Nelson Jobim , the defence minister , said Brazil would not relinquish command duties and suggested it , not Washington , would continue to lead UN forces .
Analysts said it was vital command issues be resolved .
The Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières complained about flights with medical staff and equipment which were redirected to the Dominican Republic .
" We are all going crazy , " said Nan Buzard , of the American Red Cross .
The Obama administration has enlisted former presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton to spearhead relief efforts .
In a series of interviews both men deflected right - wing accusations that the White House was seeking political advantage from the disaster .

The Legacy of 1989 , in Two Hemispheres
Noam Chomsky
In These Times , December 3 , 2009
November marked the anniversary of major events in 1989 : “ the biggest year in world history since 1945 , ” as British historian Timothy Garton Ash describes it .
That year “ changed everything , ” Garton Ash writes .
Mikhail Gorbachev ’s reforms within Russia and his “ breathtaking renunciation of the use of force ” led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 — and to the liberation of Eastern Europe from Russian tyranny .
The accolades are deserved ; the events , memorable .
But alternative perspectives may be revealing .
German chancellor Angela Merkel provided such a perspective — unintentionally — when she called on all of us to “ use this invaluable gift of freedom to overcome the walls of our time . ”
One way to follow her good advice would be to dismantle the massive wall , dwarfing the Berlin wall in scale and length , now snaking through Palestinian territory in violation of international law .
The “ annexation wall , ” as it should be called , is justified in terms of “ security ” — the default rationalization for so many state actions .
If security were the concern , the wall would be built along the border and made impregnable .
The purpose of this monstrosity , constructed with U.S. support and European complicity , is to allow Israel to take over valuable Palestinian land and the main water resources of the region , thus denying any viable national existence for the indigenous population of the former Palestine .
Another perspective on 1989 comes from Thomas Carothers , a scholar who served in “ democracy enhancement ” programs in the administration of former President Ronald Reagan .
After reviewing the record , Carothers concludes that all U.S. leaders have been “ schizophrenic ” — supporting democracy if it conforms to U.S. strategic and economic objectives , as in Soviet satellites but not in U.S. client states .
This perspective is dramatically confirmed by the recent commemoration of the events of November 1989 .
The fall of the Berlin wall was rightly celebrated , but there was little notice of what happened one week later : on Nov. 16 , in El Salvador , the assassination of six leading Latin American intellectuals , Jesuit priests , along with their cook and her daughter , by the elite , U.S. - armed Atlacatl battalion , fresh from renewed training at the JFK Special Warfare School at Fort Bragg , N.C .
The battalion and its cohorts had already compiled a bloody record through the grisly decade in El Salvador that began in 1980 with the assassination , by much the same hands , of Archbishop Oscar Romero , known as “ the voice of the voiceless . ”
During the decade of the “ war on terror ” declared by the Reagan administration , the horror was similar throughout Central America .
The reign of torture , murder and destruction in the region left hundreds of thousands dead .
The contrast between the liberation of Soviet satellites and the crushing of hope in U.S. client states is striking and instructive — even more so when we broaden the perspective .
The assassination of the Jesuit intellectuals brought a virtual end to “ liberation theology , ” the revival of Christianity that had its modern roots in the initiatives of Pope John XXIII and Vatican II , which he opened in 1962 .
Vatican II “ ushered in a new era in the history of the Catholic Church , ” theologian Hans Kung wrote .
Latin American bishops adopted “ the preferential option for the poor . ”
Thus the bishops renewed the radical pacifism of the Gospels that had been put to rest when the Emperor Constantine established Christianity as the religion of the Roman Empire — “ a revolution ” that in less than a century converted “ the persecuted church ” to a “ persecuting church , ” according to Kung .
In the post - Vatican II revival , Latin American priests , nuns and laypersons took the message of the Gospels to the poor and the persecuted , brought them together in communities , and encouraged them to take their fate into their own hands .
Reaction to this heresy was violent repression .
In the course of the terror and slaughter , the practitioners of liberation theology were a prime target .
Among them are the six martyrs of the church whose execution 20 years ago is now commemorated with a resounding silence , barely broken .
Last month in Berlin , the three presidents most involved in the fall of the Wall — George H. W. Bush , Mikhail Gorbachev and Helmut Kohl — discussed who deserves credit .
“ I know now how heaven helped us , ” Kohl said .
George H.W. Bush praised the East German people , who “ for too long had been deprived of their God - given rights . ”
Gorbachev suggested that the United States needs its own perestroika .
No doubts exist about responsibility for demolishing the attempt to revive the church of the Gospels in Latin America during the 1980s .
The School of the Americas ( since renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation ) in Fort Benning , Ga. , which trains Latin American officers , proudly announces that the U.S. Army helped to “ defeat liberation theology ” — assisted , to be sure , by the Vatican , using the gentler hand of expulsion and suppression .
The grim campaign to reverse the heresy set in motion by Vatican II received an incomparable literary expression in Dostoyevsky ’s parable of the Grand Inquisitor in “ The Brothers Karamazov . ”
In this tale , set in Seville at “ the most terrible time of the Inquisition , ” Jesus Christ suddenly appears on the streets , “ softly , unobserved , and yet , strange to say , everyone recognized him ” and was “ irresistibly drawn to him . ”
The Grand Inquisitor “ bids the guards take Him and lead Him away ” to prison .
There he accuses Christ of coming to “ hinder us ” in the great work of destroying the subversive ideas of freedom and community .
We follow not Thee , the Inquisitor admonishes Jesus , but rather Rome and “ the sword of Caesar . ”
We seek to be sole rulers of the earth so that we can teach the “ weak and vile ” multitude that “ they will only become free when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to us . ”
Then they will be timid and frightened and happy .
So tomorrow , the Inquisitor says , “ I must burn Thee . ”
Finally , however , the Inquisitor relents and releases “ Him into the dark alleys of the town . ”
The pupils of the U.S. - run School of the Americas practiced no such mercy .
SEOUL , South Korea —
It all started with a Halloween party at a bar in 2004 .
Most everyone was wearing a risque costume ; the women were showing a lot of skin .
Many foreign English teachers attended .
When the photographs made their way to the internet , the English teachers were blamed .
Critics objected to the revealing costumes , worn by both foreigners and locals , saying they undermined Korean women .
At around the same time , news reports were circulating in Korea about foreign English teachers getting involved in drugs and sexual crimes , stirring up concern among parents and the public .
An upswing in animosity toward foreign English teachers ensued , during which the group , " Citizens of Right Education " was formed .
Citizens of Right Education has taken it upon itself to rid the country of foreign , unqualified English teachers .
The group now has more than 17,000 members .
Many of the more than 22,000 English teachers in South Korea find the movement disturbing , and say they are coming up against racism in their adopted home .
Racism has n’t been a huge issue for South Korea in the past .
But as the country continues to climb the economic ladder , the presence of foreigners is growing — as is the multitude of cultural problems that come along with them .
The number of migrant workers , English teachers and bi-racial marriages is on the rise , with the total number of registered foreigners in South Korea at more than 854,000 in 2008 — nearly double the roughly 437,000 from five years ago , according to the Korean Statistical Information Service .
The Association for Teachers of English in Korea ( ATEK ) , founded in 2009 to be an advocate for foreign English teachers in the country , believes the Citizens of Right Education is distorting the image of foreign teachers .
“ It is a vocal group of Koreans who are very xenophobic and really focused on English teachers , ” ATEK ’s Vice President Darren Bean said .
The police are currently investigating a written death threat sent to ATEK ’s president , which the association believes was sent by the Korean online group , Bean said .
The head of Citizen ’s of Right Education strongly denies the allegation .
“ We have said that we will catch the person behind everything and alert the police , but instead they ’re saying I did it , ” said Yi Eun-ung , the head of the online group .
Yi said he is baffled at the accusations and emphasizes that his group is not targeting legitimate teachers who are doing good jobs .
Korea first saw a rise in animosity against English - speaking foreigners more than five years ago when two middle - school girls were killed in an accident caused by U.S. troops stationed in the country .
Anti-American sentiments sparked at the time and led to scuffles in bars and in some cases the barring of foreigners from certain facilities .
However , discrimination has been more of an issue for migrant workers from Southeast Asian countries or Chinese ethnic Koreans working in the country .
Amnesty International last year called on the country to protect migrant workers saying that they are “ exposed to abusive work conditions including discrimination , verbal and physical abuse , ” according to a statement posted to their website .
Last year , the country saw its first citizen convicted for making racist comments to a professor from India , while using public transportation .
The offender was slapped with a fine for hurling slurs such as “ Arabs are dirty , ” at the scholar .
Lawmakers have since drafted legislation related to racial discrimination but have yet to pass the bill .
Analysts point out that deeply embedded in the Korean psyche is the belief that all Koreans are from a single bloodline — something that could become problematic for a country with a rising foreign population .
ATEK ’s Bean believes the local press coverage is biased when it comes to news related to English teachers .
Drug use , sexual crimes and violence are some of the dominant issues that have made headlines in the country about foreign English teachers .
The number of arrested English teachers who are on employer - sponsored visas was at 114 in 2007 and 99 in 2008 , according to local Yonhap News Agency , citing data provided by lawmaker Lee Koon - hyon from the ruling Grand National Party .
However , these numbers are merely near the 0.5 percent range of the sponsored teachers in the country .
It is still those small numbers that Yi’s online group is after .
“ We ’re not trying to say all those with English - teaching - visas are criminals , ” Yi said .
When asked whether his activities , which include tailing teachers in question to find evidence , could be seen as invasive , Yi said his group is simply addressing blind spots in the law enforcement .
Postings from the past on the Citizens of Right Education , Yi admits , have contained racist remarks .
However , the leader said inappropriate content has been removed and that he consistently monitors postings to ensure they do n’t include racist content .
Yi said that most of the members of Citizens of Right Education are concerned parents , and he asks foreign teachers to try to see things from their point of view .
His group will try to do the same , he added .
* Investors anticipate a close GOP win
* Health insurer index up 4.9 pct
* Tenet , Community Health shares fall
NEW YORK , Jan 19 ( Reuters ) - Health insurer shares rose on Tuesday , while hospital stocks fell as investors anticipated a Republican victory in the special Massachusetts election for a new U.S. senator that would throw healthcare reform into uncertainty .
The latest opinion polls in the neck - and - neck race suggested state Senator Scott Brown could defeat Democrat state Attorney General Martha Coakley , which would be a huge upset in the traditionally Democratic state .
[ ID :nN18159712 ]
The special election is to fill the seat of the late Edward Kennedy , a political giant and staunch proponent of health reform who died of brain cancer in August after holding office for 46 years .
The loss of one seat in the Senate could hurt the Democrats ’ ability to proceed to a vote on the planned healthcare overhaul that seemed to be in the final stages of the legislative process .
“ The Street prefers a simple narrative , ” Miller Tabak healthcare analyst Les Funtleyder said .
“ The narrative is Coakley in Massachusetts is in trouble and therefore the healthcare reform bill is also in trouble . ”
The reform bills under debate in Congress would reshape the insurance market through new regulations , taxes and other changes .
The health overhaul is President Barack Obama ’s top domestic priority .
“ We would expect a broad healthcare rally upon a Brown victory , given that many generalists perceive Obamacare as unfavorable to the sector , ” Avik Roy , a healthcare analyst with Monness Crespi Hardt , said in a research note .
Shares of the S&P Managed Health Care index .
GSPHMO of large health insurers rose 4.9 percent in morning trading .
Shares of Humana Inc HUM .N jumped 7.3 percent , Coventry Health Care CVH.N rose 5.7 percent and Aetna AET.N gained 5.1 percent .
The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index .DRG of large drugmakers also rose 1.6 percent , while the S&P Health Care Equipment index .
GSPMED of medical device makers rose 1.1 percent , outpacing smaller increases for the broader market .
Hospital companies , which may gain more insured customers under health reform , saw their shares slump .
Community Health Systems CYH.N fell 4.9 percent while Tenet Healthcare THC.N dropped 4.5 percent .
Wall Street was busily sorting through scenarios for health reform in the event of a Brown win , an outcome thought to be unfathomable only weeks ago .
Wells Fargo analyst Matt Perry said a Brown victory raises the chances that healthcare reform fails to 25 - 30 percent from 0 - 10 percent .
“ We still think that the Congress will pass a health - care reform bill in the next several weeks , but a Brown victory would increase the chances that health - care reform fails , ” Perry said in a research note .
( Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf , editing by Maureen Bavdek )
On a sticky Peshawar afternoon in 1998 , Mark Taylor clipped a Test triple - hundred while Pakistan 's spinners tossed and chased and collected one wicket for 327 runs .
Next morning Abdul Qadir , who was not any more a Pakistani Test spinner , and had n't been for eight years , found himself in a car bound for Princes Park in one of Melbourne 's lovelier suburbs .
Carlton was playing Footscray that day .
Carlton was Abdul Qadir 's new club .
Driving the car was Carlton 's vice - president , Craig Cook , who was relating the contents of an email his legspinning son Calum had sent - something about a Footscray batting wiz named " Larko " .
" Tell Abba , " the email went , " that Larko only picks wrong 'uns from off the track , not out of the hand . "
Qadir stared out the windscreen .
The car pulled up at the oval .
" Hey Abdul , " roared Ian Wrigglesworth , Carlton 's captain .
" Listen .
Larko can't pick a wrong 'un .
You set it up , do whatever you want . "
Qadir nodded and said nothing .
Not until many minutes later , as they were walking out to field , did he ask politely : " When does this Larko come in ? "
Larko was Rohan Larkin , an ex-state batsman , and he stepped out that day at No. 4 .
Qadir watched him approach , stuck a fielder at close gully .
And bowled .
Wrong 'un .
Larkin , failing to pick it , went to square cut .
The ball smacked the bat 's edge and whistled through first slip 's hands for two .
" Great , " Larkin thought , " I 'm off the mark and I 've seen his wrong 'un .
I 'll be right from here . "
Qadir 's second ball was faster ; wicketkeeper Micky Butera rocked back instinctively on his heels .
It was also wider .
" Very close to the edge of the pitch , " says Larkin .
It was too wide to make mayhem , so wide that the umpire cleared his throat and gave a preliminary twitch of his arms .
Larkin flung his own arms high , his bat even higher - " to allow the ball to travel through harmlessly " .
Instead the ball dipped - swooped , more like - as if by remote control .
It landed , veered headlong in the wrong direction , then hit middle stump , like Shane Warne dumbfounding Mike Gatting all over again .
In reverse .
" Abdul spun this wrong 'un one and a half feet , " gasps Butera .
" Sounds ridiculous when you say it . "
" I would play that ball the same way a hundred times out of a hundred , " believes Larkin .
" There was an element of luck in the Warne ball , " Cook points out .
" Whereas Abdul 's was absolutely contrived . "
The only person not surprised was the contriver himself .
Deep down , Qadir knew that by rights he should have been in Peshawar that Saturday , playing for his country not a suburb .
His Carlton team - mates knew that he knew it .
He did not need to say so ; though sometimes he said it anyway .
There was and remained only one wonder of Pakistani spin .
But Qadir was 43 .
His face was unwrinkled .
Brown eyes still danced with mischief .
But selectors of Test teams have no love for 43 - year - olds .
That was why he was n't in Peshawar .
It does not explain how he came to be playing park cricket in Melbourne .
****
IT HAPPENED , like many of the best ideas , after a long and jolly lunch .
The Carlton Cricket and Football Social Club was the setting .
Big Jack Elliott , football club president and one - time prime ministerial aspirant , glared at the cricket club vice - president and barked : " Why ca n't you bastards win like us ? "
" Well , " said Craig Cook , " we 've lost a little bit of flair .
We really need a big - name player . "
Big Jack barked again .
" You get the player and we 'll pay for it . "
" On his last weekend in Melbourne he was handed the new ball , not for the first time that summer .
And for the umpteenth time , from mid-day till sundown , he bowled and bowled and bowled "
Cook , a legspin fanatic , thought of Qadir .
He phoned an old pal , Javed Zaman Khan , cousin of Imran .
An evening net tryout was arranged and Cook 's ticket to Lahore booked .
" We took Abdul down to the Lahore Gymkhana Club nets , where he bowled for an hour .
And he looked beautiful .
We signed him up on the spot . "
Forty thousand dollars Carlton paid him .
They put him up in a flat in Brunswick , not far from the practice nets .
Larkin was one of eight men from Footscray he fooled that Saturday .
At spectator - less playing fields all over Melbourne , the ranks of the befuddled grew : at Windy Hill , at Arden Street , at Ringwood 's Jubilee Park .
Arms bucked and swayed and his tongue kept licking his fingers when Qadir skipped in and bowled .
The passing of decades had taken a few spikes out of his flipper , which now slid more than it spat .
But the miracles of his legbreak remained two - fold : the sheer stupendous size of the spin , and the way he could vary it at will .
Wrong 'uns , meanwhile , arrived in threes .
" Three types , " Butera confirms .
There was a lightning wrong 'un , a mid-paced wrong 'un lobbed up from wide of the stumps , and a slow wrong 'un .
" It looked like a lollipop , " Butera says of this last invention , " and the batsman would think , here 's an opportunity to come down and score .
But it would drop incredibly late , and as soon as the batsman got there he'd realise he did n't have as much time as he thought he had . "
The lollipop wrong 'un left more batsmen licked than any of Qadir 's other variations , helping Butera rewrite the Victorian Cricket Association record books for most catches and stumpings in a season .
" Best time of my life .
Abdul put me on the map , " he says .
That is not just rosy - glassed affection talking .
Nine days after the Larkin ball Butera , previously unheralded , made his state 2nd XI debut .
Mid-January came ; an encounter with the competition 's in - form batsman beckoned .
Geelong 's Jason Bakker , tall and lumbering and toe - tied against even the gentlest spin bowling , had heard all about Qadir 's variations .
His coach Ken Davis tried to replicate them , hurling balls down , floating them up , while Bakker watched Ken 's hand in the hope of reading what might happen .
After a week of this it was time to face the real thing in a match .
And it felt , to Bakker , as if he were still in the practice nets .
With eyes wide open he'd stare at Qadir 's wrist .
He left balls he was supposed to leave .
He defended others comfortably .
If he could get to the pitch of the ball , he 'd drive .
When it was wider , he 'd cut , but softly , never forcing anything .
Bakker had heard batsmen more debonair than him talk about being in " the zone " , and for the first time he really understood it .
" This sounds incredibly vain but I felt like I did n't play a false stroke . "
They paused for drinks .
Captain Wrigglesworth despaired .
He trotted up to his star bowler .
" Listen .
This bloke 's picking your wrong 'un . "
And just like that Qadir stopped bowling it .
No flipper or flotilla of multi-speeded googlies .
The magic act was over .
Every ball was a legbreak , landing on or slightly outside off stump .
Every ball twisted harmlessly away .
This went on for an hour .
It was a scorching afternoon , a flat deck .
Bakker cruised past 50 .
" I 'd broken him . "
And something else had happened too - " I was getting more confident , more relaxed , less vigilant . "
So when another one wafted down , as ho -hum as all the others , Bakker took one stride forward and shouldered arms , intent on letting the thing whirr past , and then just as it was about to bounce , inches from his nose , he noticed that this particular delivery was actually a touch wider , and the seam looked different , and by then it was too late to do anything other than think , " Shit I hope it misses " , which it did n't .
It knocked back middle stump .

Eleven years on , Bakker 's head is still shaking .
" An hour - he was prepared to wait an hour .
There was I falsely thinking I had broken him , when all that time he was working up a trap for me .
I mean , my God , the mentality of the man , the mindset . "
Later Qadir would boast , " I saw it in his eyes " - saw that microscopic let - up in the batsman 's vigilance , which was what he had been waiting for all along .
****
HE LIVED for Saturdays , his new team - mates sensed .
In his inner-city flat he was on his own .
The club vice - president drove him to matches , to training .
Most nights he ate at the vice - president 's house .
" Abdul had never cooked a meal in his life , " Cook explains .
" Never made a cup of tea in his life .
So if he was n't eating at our place I 'd organise the Pakistani community to bring food in .
And he got a bit lonely , so I 'd have to go around and see him . "
He would clap opposition batsmen 's fine strokes .
He would tell people what a pleasure it was to meet them .
" No , no , " he politely informed his captain one gusty Saturday , " I will bowl downwind . "
Another Saturday , batting against a fast bowler and a spinner , he insisted that his team - mates jump the fence to alternately ferry out and fetch his helmet at the end of every over .
He did not swear .
When Qadir was around , Butera used to soften his own language .
" But I do n't think the rest of the boys did . "
He did not lairise , throw high - fives or drink beer .
" I would n't have thought he made a friend while he was here , " says Wrigglesworth .
" I do n't know what he did from Monday to Friday and I would n't have thought many people do .
As soon as the game finished on a Saturday he was pretty much off .
I do n't think he sang the team song once . "
The song , in fairness , was seldom aired , for Carlton kept losing despite Qadir 's wickets .
By the eve of the season 's final match at Northcote Park he had 66 - only seven shy of the post - war record set by Richmond quick Graeme Paterson in 1965 - 66 .
Qadir thought about that record often .
" He never , " Cook reflects , " reckoned he should have been left out of the Test side .
So when he came over here it was n't a holiday .
He was wanting to show what he could do . "
On his last weekend in Melbourne he was handed the new ball , not for the first time that summer .
And for the umpteenth time , from mid-day till sundown , he bowled and bowled and bowled .
His preoccupation with the record and those seven elusive wickets had become something close to an obsession .
Nobody except Wrigglesworth and the Carlton committee men realised this - until , that is , the fall of Northcote 's ninth wicket , Qadir 's sixth , at which point he bounced into the team huddle and shrieked : " One more ! "
" If he had just shut his gob , " says Wrigglesworth , " no one else would have known .
Instead the boys were all going : ' Hey , hang on a minute ! ' "
One more , alas , did not come easily .
Northcote 's last - wicket pair looked untroubled .
Runs flowed .
Wrigglesworth thought about taking Qadir off .
Wrigglesworth could n't take him off .
" By this stage , " he says , " I was a puppet of the president and the committee .
And they wanted to see Abdul get this record . "
" A few short years later Douggie was picked for Australia 's team of intellectually disabled cricketers .
He has since represented his country in South Africa and England , this stranger who had never bowled a wrong 'un until the day he met Abdul Qadir and asked how it was done "
Qadir kept going .
He ran through all his variations .
The partnership kept swelling - to 95 by the tea break .
Forty - six overs Qadir had bowled unchanged .
" Should I take him off now ? "
Permission was granted .
Five balls later the wicket fell .
The Ryder Medal he won as the competition 's best player still hangs on his wall in Lahore .
His 492 overs in a season might never be surpassed .
Seventy - two wickets at 15.87 in the era of covered pitches at the age of 43 is a feat carved in club cricket legend .
It could have been 73 , the record should have been his , he told the Age 's gossip columnist the day before he flew home ; if only the captain had listened , if only the captain had bowled him a bit more .
" Oh , Abdul , " sighed Wrigglesworth when he saw the paper next morning .
" Where 's this come from ? "
****
WHEN Jason
Bakker remembers the day that he did not play a false stroke and was deceived by the most mysterious ball he ever faced , he thinks of the heat .
At tea - time he galloped upstairs to the Kardinia Park dining room and began gulping down water .
" I was tucking into rockmelon and watermelon and whatever else I could find . "
That 's when he glanced out the window and saw that Qadir , who had bowled through the entire afternoon session without a rest , was still on the oval .
Qadir was out there with Craig Whitehand , known to all at Geelong Cricket Club as " Douggie " , the guy who fronted up every Saturday in his whites and his spikes to drag off the pitch covers and carry out drinks and take care of the equipment .
As Qadir was walking off , Douggie had stopped him at the players ' gate and asked , how do you bowl a wrong 'un .
Now the two of them were standing on the grass , metres apart .
A couple of balls lay between them .
Qadir would wave his arms and talk a bit .
Then he'd bowl a few .
Then Douggie would bowl a few .
After a while Qadir would wander across and say something .
Then Douggie would bowl a few more .
Bakker went back to his watermelon and forgot what he 'd seen .
Twenty minutes went by before he thought about strapping the pads back on .
" As I was coming down the stairs , " Bakker recalls , " I looked out on the ground .
And the two of them were still there .
Abdul had given his whole break on a hot day to this guy from Geelong who he knew nothing about . "
At Geelong training the next week Douggie was gleefully flighting wrong 'uns .
A few short years later he was picked for Australia 's team of intellectually disabled cricketers .
He has since represented his country in South Africa and England , this stranger who had never bowled a wrong 'un until the day he met Abdul Qadir and asked how it was done .
There were some who were ready to count Paramount Pictures out .
Many of its longstanding franchises , especially Star Trek , were looked at more with nostalgia than with a bright future , and other studios like Warner Bros .
were knocking everyone around with its deeply diverse portfolio with everything from DC Comics movies like “ Batman Begins ” to the Harry Potter series .
Paramount by far does n’t release the number of films it used to — about half of what it did even two years ago — but what it has put in theaters is drawing plenty of attention .
With the year about to end , the studio will end up second in domestic box office take with a whopping $ 1.5 billion in receipts , behind only the $ 1.9 billion from Warner Bros .
( who also produced nearly double the films ) , and the studio might have “ Star Trek ” and “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ” to thank for it .
“ They ’re now gaining some momentum in finding their own franchises , ” said Richard Greenfield , a media analyst with Pali Capital , according to The New York Times .
Those franchises include Star Trek , the latest film from J.J. Abrams possibly serving as a catalyst to the studio ’s future offerings similar to what “ Batman Begins ” did for Warner Bros .
While Greenfield would n’t admit if this current momentum at the box office could be sustained , it does put Paramount “ in a far , far better position than they were . ”
Even better , Paramount is actually turning a profit now .
This time last year , it was $ 19 million in the red .
Right now , the studio has done an about - face , earning $ 69 million for investors .
The best news , however , comes for “ Star Trek ” director Abrams himself .
Paramount chief executive Brad Grey said he not only wants a new Trek film from him , but now he ’s interested in a fourth “ Mission : Impossible ” film ( Abrams directed the third one ) .
And that wo n’t be all , Paramount is looking at putting Abrams in charge of yet another tentpole franchise for Paramount that has yet to be named .
No matter what , it will be a busy year for him .
In terms of genre films this year , Paramount had success with all four of its major properties .
“ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ” led all of them with a whopping $ 402.1 million in domestic box office , followed by “ Star Trek ” with $ 257.7 million .
“ G.I. Joe ” surprised observers with $ 150 million while “ Paranormal Activity , ” which was filmed on a budget of $ 15,000 , earned $ 107.4 million .
I first used gray water in the 1960s before I even had a term for it .
( Even now we seem to be divided on spelling — gray vs. the English grey . )
Back then it was whatever had little soap and could be collected in buckets and hauled to the sprawling vegetable garden I helped create in the northern California countryside .
During those dry summer months , our two families ’ potable water needs were met with the contents of an 18 - foot - tall redwood water tank , replenished each winter from a seasonal spring .
We had no water to spare for laundry — we toted that to the nearest town — or even toilets .
In the dry months , we used an outhouse .
Of course , there was nothing for our burgeoning veggies , except what we recycled and hauled to the crops .
The dry days
Two weeks ago I was reminded of those summers when I met up with Paul Morgan at the Southeastern Flower Show in Atlanta .
I had been invited to speak at the show , and on the last day I cruised the floor for any displays and booths I might have missed earlier .
Along the back wall , Paul featured the newest innovations for handling gray water .
His company , Rainharvest , has responded to the growing consumer awareness of just how finite our freshwater resources are .
The recent flooding notwithstanding , Georgia ’s seven drought years left a lasting impression on residents .
I had missed Paul ’s booth earlier because showgoers were often three deep there , checking out the plastic tank , about the size of a large water heater , with a filtration device fitted to the top .
This was a small version of what could be installed for a whole home .
By gathering gray water and sending it to holding tanks where it is filtered and then piped into drips systems in the garden , recycled water can be part of every gardener ’s picture .
I liked the idea that tanks like this could be buried under driveways and parking pads , thus not disturbing the roots of established plantings .
And if the pads are made of a permeable paving — see my last post — rainwater can be collected , too .
Free water research
Hauling our gray water back in the day , we did n’t know about the worries of phosphates and stray bacteria , or how the water should be handled by piping it underground only — all things that have since been legislated into the use of gray water around the United States .
Most municipalities have a myriad and byzantine set of regulations .
For instance , according to the Colorado State Extension website , rainwater collection in Colorado is preferable to gray - water collection , and everything must be installed by licensed plumbers .
So , can you use gray water there or not ?
That ’s just the beginning .
Because recycling water involves dealing with one of the largest items you will ever purchase — your home — you need to thoroughly investigate your options , especially if you are considering a DIY design for your system .
Fortunately , plenty of solid information — and some loopy advice as well , so buyer beware — is out there on the Internet .
Saving money on water
Is recycling water worth it ?
In those long - ago dry summers , the price of carrying buckets was laborious sweat - equity .
Now it costs considerably more to put in a new system or retrofit a home .
However , Paul says a homeowner can save huge amounts of money normally spent on watering gardens .
Add rain roof collection to the system , and you can take advantage of that available water , too .
The other expense is an environmental one that tends to be hidden from the economic bottom line .
Any installation today will pay off in the future when fresh water begins to reflect its actual value as an extraordinarily precious resource .
According to Steve Solomon in his iconic book , " Water , " the world ’s fresh water supply is only 2.5 percent of all water , with less than three - tenths of 1 percent on the earth ’s surface .
Of that , rivers and streams make up the hard - to - grasp figure of six - thousandths of 1 percent .
In other words , we ’re all living with a redwood water tank .

“ HOMELAND IN PALESTINE ” HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH ZIONISM
By Gordon Duff STAFF WRITER / Senior Editor
As an editor and writer for a military , veterans and foreign affairs publication , the term “ Zionism ” seems to have become a polarizing element .
Some of our writers are Jews or have Jewish families .
Some are Palestinians , many are Muslims .
Most are atheists , from my very personal and private poll , as are vast numbers of Americans and , frankly , people around the world , many who attend religious worship out of social pressure and even fear .
Most of the Jews and Christians I know are atheists , well educated and fine people , frankly much much better people than the “ church goers ” I know .
But this is a talk about Zionism and ideas of religious freedom have little to do with it .
There is not going to be an honest dialog about Zionism or “ Restorationism ” or Jews returning to Palestine or how evil Arabs were planning on killing everyone in their sleep as we see in the movies .
Everything we read about the establishment of Palestine is , other than the documents themselves , entirely a lie .
Yes , I believe there was a holocaust .
The idea of killing people because of race , religion or ethnicity is a European tradition .
Europe killed millions , Huguenots , Cathars , Protestants and Catholics , “ witches ” , “ heretics ” and finally 6 million Jews as part of a frenzy of brutality that began , quite frankly , when the Roman Empire hijacked the Christian religion under Emperor Constantine .
From then on , one group after another was being killed off for believing something slightly different , having an “ evil eye ” or , as is almost always the case now , having the misfortune of living on land someone else wanted .
The “ Cathars , ” perhaps the original followers of Christ , were killed off in the 13th century because they lived too well , had too much money and the Pope in Rome who was their supporter had been replaced by a “ pretend ” Pope that worked for the King of France .
They called this the Albigensian Crusade .
We even had a crusade that attacked and burned the Christian city of Constantinople .
Anyone who thinks the holocaust was something new is nuts .
It simply took practices established during Constantine and continued on and added trains and poison gas .
Consider the holocaust an industrialized version of European religion .
What are the lies ?
It always seems our job to pick out the “ whoppers ” out there .
Well , Jews , at least 95 % of them are not Semites from the “ holy land . ”
They are Europeans , the vast majority originated from areas of Russia , and some , Sephardic Jews , from Spain .
They are traced back by some historians to the time of Solomon .
The Catholics killed most of them off , tens of thousands , while killing many other people off .
Many converted to Christianity by force .
Anyone who thinks only Islam does that is nuts .
So , who are the Jews ?
They are Europeans who did n’t buy in on the Roman empire ’s version of Christianity and went thru hell over it , much as did the Cathars and endless others that the Catholic Church burned alive for centuries for one idiotic reason or another over belief systems that were and continue to be totally sociopathic .
What was special about Hiter and his Nazi friends ?
Well most were Catholics , some very devout Catholics and felt they were killing Jews as part of “ God ’s plan . ”
We try to lie about this but the Catholic Church was deeply involved in the holocaust and Naziism .
Deal with it .
These guys were Christians , no matter how much the History Channel and Indiana Jones try to tell you they were all “ mystics ” of some kind .
SO , WHAT THE HELL IS “ ZIONISM ” AND WHY DO WE LIE ABOUT ISLAM AND THE JEWS
Back in the middle of the 19th century , Jews talked about going back to Israel and rebuilding the Temple .
They never came from Israel but their religious beliefs are strongly tied to the history of that region .
This was n’t a huge number of Jews .
When you look at Germany during the First World War , you find the German and Austrian armies full of Jews with European Jews making up much of the intellectual leadership , the authors , musicians , scientists and philosophers .
Jews controlled the banks , much of the commercial life but were also cab drivers , tailors and factory workers .
Jews were also married into “ Gentile ” families .
After centuries only a magician could tell a Jew from one of Hitler ’s “ Aryans . ”
The biggest influx of Jews into the Middle East was into Turkey under the Islamic ruled Ottoman Empire .
Jews were being expelled from Europe during the 15th and 16th century and were all asked to settle in the Ottoman empire , which stretched from the Balkans thru the Holy Land and beyond .
The Sultans looked on the Jews as a way of rebuilding their cities and establishing an economy .
Jews held , not only nearly full autonomy under Islamic rule but also held some of the highest positions in state .
Remember , the Ottoman empire was the entire Islamic world during this period .
This makes the entire history we are taught about Islam and the Jews a total lie .
If there were Jews in the Islamic world , they were there because they were invited , valued and helped rule the Ottoman empire .
This is history , not propaganda .
During the holocaust , when no other country , including and especially the United States would take in Jewish refugees , Islamic Turkey took in 100,000 European Jews who were saved from the gas chambers .
No other country did as much .
“ Despite the harsh policies of ethnic homogenization during the early republican period , the Turkish stance towards Jews in German - occupied Europe remained relatively positive .
Even though Turkey remained neutral during World War II ( until its symbolic declaration of war on Nazi Germany on 23 February 1945 ) and officially forbade granting visas to German Jews , individual Turkish diplomats ( such as Necdet Kent , Namık Kemal Yolga , Selahattin Ülkümen and Behiç Erkin ) did work hard to save Jews from the Holocaust . [ 28 ]
According to Prof. Stanford J. Shaw “ some 15,000 Turkish Jews from France , and even of some 100,000 Jews from Eastern Europe ” were saved because of Turkish efforts . [ 29 ]
On the other hand , Turkey has been implicated in the Struma disaster , due to its refusal to allow the Jewish refugees on board to disembark in Turkish territory . ”
When we describe relations between Islam and the Jews , we do n’t talk about the half million Jews who lived in and helped rule the Ottoman Empire or that controlled the vast all Jewish Khazar empire for centuries , not Jews that had ever originated in the Holy Land but invited there , saved from Europe , the Catholic Church or centuries later from Nazi persecution .
Instead , we replace the truth with childrens stories about persecution that never happened , not where and when our Zionist friends love telling us it did .
If we remember that the Ottoman Empire lasted until well into the 20th century , we only have a short period , practically only a few years to discuss where the British decided that Jews should be settled in land the British never owned and controlled only through war .
You can watch the movie Exodus to learn some of it , almost 100 % false , or get some background from Lawrence of Arabia , but really common sense and truth have been set aside so long that there is no longer any hope .
HOLOCAUST GUILT BRINGS ABOUT A NEW HOLOCAUST
The holocaust happened .
America and Britain allowed it , know that for certain .
When American troops found concentration camps they were surprised , not because we did n’t know but because we chose not to tell anyone .
After all , America was extremely anti-Semitic itself .
Jews were hated across America , denied seating in restaurants , use of resorts and restricted from many neighborhoods and , in fact , entire states .
The holocaust was very “ convenient ” for America , Britain , France , Poland , the Netherlands , Hungary , Romania , Czechosolvakia and many other countries that now pretend they had no part in it .
Blaming Germany is one thing , a way of picking out one country to pin the crimes of many on but blaming Islam is an obscenity of lies .
So why then were the Jews resettled in Palestine , an area they never came from , an areas already totally populated ?
Jews could n’t go back to their homeland , really the Ukraine .
Stalin hated Jews .
Palestine had , until a few years before , been part of the Ottoman Empire .
Britain ruled for a few years , years filled with strife where Britain fought a war against Jewish extremists , some of the originators of terrorist attacks of the kind we are seeing today .
When Britain tried to stop terrorist groups operating in Palestine , terrorist groups run entirely by Jews , the British headquarters in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was destroyed by a massive bomb .
The group responsible for this early “ 9/11 ” type attack later became the government of Israel .
The British make movies about this , Jews are terrorists and the British are trying to create a peaceful state .
Their movies have Jews as European terrorists attacking British military to take land away from Palestinians who have lived there for centuries .
Maybe throwing the Palestinians off their land is ok , if our movies , which are made so much better than theirs , draw larger crowds .
This seems to be the standard of truth we are operating on .
CHRISTIAN ZIONISTS AND RECOGNIZING ISRAEL
Back during the 1800s , the major religion in America had been “ spiritualism . ”
Millions tried to talk to the dead and religion , in order to keep its customers took on some odd beliefs so that seances could be part of “ Christian ” worship .
We wrote this out of our history but it is true just the same .
Then came the “ tent revival ” and “ faith healing ” charlatans that became the backbone of America ’s “ Christian Evangelism ” of today , a religion based on distortions of scripture , snake handling , speaking in tongues and replacing religious scholarship with “ bible stories ” and theatrics .
The most fertile area for this group of predatory “ used car salesman ” preachers to work was biblical prophesy .
This had all the “ sex ” of talking to the dead plus the imagery of the rapture , naked people floating in the air , Armageddon with millions of people , children , pets , the entire planet being mercilessly destroyed and the promise to the “ select , ” those with money to buy their way out of suffering , sitting at the side of baby Jesus cheering while their enemies suffer .
If only I were making this up .
These “ snake charmers ” and con-men , we now call them “ televangelists ” needed to have Jews back in Israel to start their business going .
This was the “ prophesy . ”
They do n’t like Jews , in fact these are the same people who cheered on the Nazis during the holocaust .
Their beliefs do n’t even allow Jews to remain Jews .
When Christ returns , Jews all have to convert or go to hell .
Does this sound a bit like the Spanish Inquisition ?
It should .
However , it got Israel allies , got them weapons , billions in aid and allowed them to build a military state they do n’t seem to have sufficient common sense to control .
Welcome to that one .
Israel is n’t stupid , “ take the money and run . ”
Any of us would do it .
WHEN IS THE BALONEY GOING TO STOP ?
Israel is n’t a country of devout Middle Eastern Jews returning to a homeland promised them by g-d .
It is a country settled by Europeans who had been thru hell but who also had learned to play dirty and not follow any rules .
No country on Earth has more opposition , has faced more sanctions than Israel .
The number of times the US has had to veto sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Israel for humanitarian violations is countless .
Israel is not a country surrounded by powerful enemies trying to destroy them .
On one border is Egypt , a country that is happy to do business with Israel all day long .
Israel will never have a threat from Egypt .
On the north is Lebanon , a powerless state subject to continual civil war , half Christian , half Islamic .
If anyone needs worrying about in Lebanon , its the Christians , not the Jews .
Do we want to talk about Syria ?
Why does nobody talk about Syria ?
That threat is gone also .
Then we can look at Jordan .
They and Israel are so close , you can barely tell you have moved from one country to another .
That leaves Iraq , a country that will never threaten Israel and Iran .
Ah , Iran .
What is Iran .
Why do we find , when we look under the table a bit , so much business between Israel and Iran and so much talk of war ?
I am having reality problems here .
Iran is trying to buy a decent air defense system .
They have a 3rd rate army , a 4th rate air force , a navy made up of small boats and no nuclear weapons .
They are nowhere near Israel and could never attack Israel unless they flew their army in on commercial planes .
As half of Iran is on the terrorists “ no fly list ” they would have to pay off the Mossad to even get thru airport security .
( like other terrorists do )
Now we have Israel and India working together as one country .
Israel has all of Americas defense technologies and India has a billion people and massive manufacturing capabilities .
Combined they are in the process of becoming a superpower , not regional , but on a world scale .
India is going to be building fighters easily the equivalent of the F22 Raptor soon , something America is secretly shocked by .
We wonder where that technology came from .
We are dealing with countries with huge nuclear arsenals , world class armies , massive 1st rate air forces , nuclear submarines and we are sitting up nights thinking an army of Arabs on camels is going to take them over .
Have we lost our minds ?
Is the idiocy we see on TV so convincing that we have given up all rational thought ?
TWISTED RELIGION , THE ENEMY OF HUMANITY AND TRUTH
America is based on separation of church and state .
No matter how much our recent bible - thumping neo-Federalists like to lie about it , the Founding Fathers were a pack of atheists .
This is one of those nasty secrets of our history .
These were people of the “ Age of Enlightenment . ”
This means they were atheists .
Get over it .
It is n’t like we were even dealing with anything a rational religious scholar would call “ Christianity . ”
The Christian Zionist version of Protestantism is little more than back - woods hokum that conveniently gives billions to Israel , helps our military front for oil company greed and has written a history of recent years that will be the shame of humanity for centuries .
Every time an Evangelist starts ranting about Mary Magdalene , the “ whore of Babylon ” instead of the wife of Rabbi Jesus and mother of his children , I wonder which is real .
I then ask our Evangelist friend to open his bible and show me where Magdalene is shown to be a whore ?
It is n’t there , not one word of it , like half of the other idiocy they rant on about .
They simply make it up .
Actually get a bible , if you do n’t already have one , and really read it without the “ Fox News ” version being explained to you by a “ televangelist ” with a 20,000 square foot home and a fleet of Mercedes .
Remember WWJD ?
I have a good idea and a lot of people would n’t like it .

WASHINGTON — Two of the three men arrested on Monday along with “ ACORN pimp ” James O’Keefe for “ maliciously tampering ” with Sen.
Mary Landrieu ’s ( D - LA ) phones in her New Orleans office have ties to the United States intelligence community .
The three accused by the FBI of “ aiding and abetting ” O’Keefe are Stan Dai , Robert Flanagan and Joseph Basel .
O’Keefe is 25 , and the other three are 24 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Dai ’s links to the intelligence community appear to be particularly strong .
He was a speaker at Georgetown University ’s Central Intelligence Agency summer school program in June 2009 , and is also listed as an Assistant Director at the Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence at Trinity in D.C .
The university ’s president Patricia McGuire told The Associated Press that it promoted careers in intelligence but denied that it trains students to be spies .
The Trinity program received a “ $ 250,000 renewable grant from the U.S. Intelligence Community ” upon launching in 2004 , according to its Web site .
The program ’s goals are stated :
The IC CAE in National Security Studies Program was established during 2005 in response to the nation ’s increasing need for IC professionals who are educated and trained with the unique knowledge , skills and capabilities to carry out America ’s national security objectives .
The CIA summer school packet also notes that Dai “ served as the Operations Officer of a Department of Defense irregular warfare fellowship program . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Dai has been an undergraduate fellow with the Washington - based national security think tank Foundation for the Defense of the Democracies ( FDD ) , according to his College Leadership Program award biography at the Phillips Foundation — as Lindsay Beyerstein first reported .
FDD claims that it ’s partly funded by the US State Department .
Its Leadership Council and Board of Advisers comprise many high - profile conservative politicians and public figures — including former House speaker Newt Gingrich , Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) , Weekly Standard editor William Kristol , Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) , former Bush official Richard Perle and columnist Charles Krauthammer .
Dai traveled to Israel for two weeks in 2004 on an FDD - sponsored trip , the Daily Herald reported .
“ All expenses ( room , board and travel ) will be assumed by FDD , ” FDD ’s Web site said of its Israel program .
ADVERTISEMENT
A host of FDD testimonials from Academic Fellows reveal that many fellows have traveled to Israel for training and field trips .
The Foundation says the course includes “ lectures by academics , diplomats , military and intelligence officials , and politicians from Israel , Jordan , India , Turkey and the United States . ”
FDD proclaims that “ Like America , Israel is at the forefront in the war on terrorism . ”
Further explaining its interest in Israel , FDD declares :
ADVERTISEMENT
Both the United States and Israel are democracies , and both face the same enemy .
It is this connection between Israel ’s experience and the future of the United States that is the essence of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies .
One FDD testimonial , by 2004 - 2005 fellow Dr. Cathal J. Nolan , highlighted the group ’s bond with high - level intelligence and government officials in Israel :
The access which FDD provided to top government officials–and to academic , police , security service , and intelligence experts at the highest levels –was truly remarkable .
I know of no other foundation or fellowship program which is able to provide so much top - level access and first - hand intelligence and security service information in so compact a form , or in such an intellectually stimulating environment .
ADVERTISEMENT
The CIA and Office of Director of National Intelligence have both told Politico that despite Dai ’s evident connections to the intelligence community , he never officially worked for them .
Dai ’s co-conspirator Robert Flanagan is currently seeking a Master of Science degree from the Missouri State University ’s ( Fairfax , Virginia ) Defense and Strategic Studies program , according to his Linked In profile ( which was captured by Beyerstein before it was taken down Tuesday . )
The DSS Web site description affirms its connections to “ the intelligence community ” :
The program ’s location also provides DSS with the opportunity to draw adjunct faculty members from the top ranks of government , the defense industry , and the intelligence community .
ADVERTISEMENT
The program also appears to have a close relationship with the conservative establishment .
Inside Higher
Ed reported in 2007 that the program ’s “ full - time faculty of three and its nine affiliated lecturers tend to come mainly from positions in Republican administrations and conservative - leaning institutions . ”
It appears to be an elite program and one Facebook group bills it as ardently conservative on national security and foreign policy issues .
“ We Do Defense ( far ) Right ! ” it proclaims :
Are you preparing for the inevitable U.S. v. ChiCom War ?
Are you praying every night for the employment of Ballistic Missile Defense ?
Do you think nuclear weapons are important for American security ?
Do you think MAD is a trashy liberal theory ?

Flanagan has also blogged for the conservative Pelican Institute until as recently as this month .
In one post last month , he highlighted criticisms directed at Landrieu .

Flanagan ’s father , William Flanagan , is currently the acting US Attorney for Louisiana ’s western district .
But because Flanagan was arrested in the state ’s eastern district , his father will not oversee his prosecution .
The New Orleans newspaper NOLA.com , which first broke the news , reported that “ one of the four was arrested with a listening device in a car blocks from the senator ’s offices . ”
The FBI ’s affidavit noted that Flanagan and Basel were in the building with O’Keefe , and a federal law enforcement official confirmed to AP that Dai was the one in the car .
The New York Times pointed out that “ [t ] he [ FBI ] affidavit did not accuse the men of trying to tap the phones , or describe in detail what they did to the equipment . ”
But the optics of the situation have led to suspicions that bugging Landrieu ’s phones was their intention .
Although Robert Flanagan ’s Facebook page has been removed , the other three all list each other as “ friends ” on the social networking site .
All four of the men arrested in the plotMonday have well - documented conservative ties , The Associated Press revealed .
Three of the suspects wrote for conservative publications while in college , and Flanagan has written for the national Pelican Institute .

Flanagan ’s blog , flanaganreport.com , has also been deleted , but some of its content can still be found in Google ’s archives .
In one post , Flanagan criticized former vice president Dick Cheney .
Joseph Basel was listed by the University of Minnesota , Morris in 2005 as one of its fifteen “ College Republicans . ”
The publications O’Keefe and Basel wrote for while in college allegedly received money from the nonprofit education foundation The Leadership Institute .
“ Leadership Institute Vice President David Fenner said in a phone interview this morning that the group had ‘ informal , above - board relationships ’ with both James O’Keefe and Joseph Basel when they were college students , ” Talking Points Memo reported Wednesday .

Landrieu ’s office released the following statement on the incident , according to NPR :
Because the details of yesterday ’s incident are part of an ongoing investigation by federal authorities , our office cannot comment at this time .
The community activist group ACORN slammed O’Keefe , who angered them after unveiling their ostensibly dodgy practices .
“ Could n’t have happened to a more deserving soul , ” the group posted on its Twitter feed .
The incident “ is further evidence of his disregard for the law in pursuit of his extremist agenda , ” ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis told AP in a statement .

While Stern acknowledged on yesterday morning 's Sirius XM radio show that he had not spoken to Lange since the weekend attempt — which police said the 42 - year - old carried out with a 13 - inch kitchen knife — cohost Robin Quivers had .
" He 's doing well , physically , " she said .
But while the team offered nothing but support and well - wishes to their troubled colleague , they had a different set of feelings for the person and paper responsible for first leaking the morbid details .
" I 'm so upset about the story , " Stern said .
" I was actually hoping it would n't come out .
I thought we were out of the woods with that ... I really would love to know who the scumbag is who releases that information to the press .
You know , who sneakily finds something out and tells the press , ' cause this really is a private matter and something that has gotten me so distressed , so upset and so bewildered , I do n't even know what to think .
" I 'm angry about it , I 'm sad about it , I 'm just all over the place emotionally about this whole thing .
" I 'm pissed off that this story got out there .
I 'm pissed off at the s-- thead who maybe got paid 10 bucks to tip off Page Six .
And honestly .
I do n't know what to say about this story .
It 's such a mind - boggling thing that 's gone down , I do n't even wanna in any kind of way say the wrong thing , or — I think the word is — exacerbate the situation . "
Stern , who refused to read the then - unconfirmed self - stabbing report on air , said he has " always tried to maintain my loyalty to Artie , " and now would be no exception , even if he was at a loss at to how , exactly , to do that .
" I do n't know what to do in this situation .
There 's nothing to do .
Artie 's demons ran deeper than I ever knew .
" I certainly wish Artie well , " he continued .
" I 'm just freaked out .
The whole thing 's a mess . "
Though a mess with a better than expected ending .

Ralph Nader ’s new novel , “ Only the Super - Rich Can Save Us , ” is a window into the world the consumer advocate and independent presidential candidate wishes he could create .
It is a world where the corporate state is dismantled , citizens are restored to power and the inequities and injustices meted out to the poor and the working classes are reversed .
Nader describes his book as a “ practical utopia . ”
“ Basically this book was written out of frustration , ” Nader tells me when we meet on a Saturday afternoon in Princeton , N.J. “ Increasingly over the last 30 years the doors have shut on a lot of citizen groups in Washington , D.C .
And every year , you put in your mental imagination , at least I did , ‘ What did we need to have kept those doors open ? ’
Did we need more organizers ?
Did we need more media ?
Did we need more money ?
Did we need better strategies ?
Did we need ways to motivate millions of people who have n’t figured it out yet ?
And that ’s why this book was so easy to write . ”
The engines of reform in the bulky novel are 17 mega - billionaires or millionaires .
It is an odd decision for a man who has spent his life making war on the power elite , but , as Nader notes , popular movements , along with labor and the press , are largely ineffectual or dead .
The super - rich , he laments , “ are probably all we have left . ”
His main characters include figures such as Warren Buffett , George Soros , Ted Turner , Yoko Ono and Phil Donahue .
The names of the villains , also often real - life characters , are mangled .
Grover Norquist , for example , becomes Brovar Dortwist .
The evil Dortwist owns a Doberman named Get ’Em .
The super - rich ignite a progressive revolution using their enormous wealth .
They recruit and fund citizen movements to challenge corporate power and its political puppets in Washington .
The rich bring to the citizen movement what in reality it desperately lacks — billions in funding .
The money , some $ 15 billion , makes it possible to sustain grass - roots movements to topple the oil industry , the insurance industry , arms manufacturers , the corporate media and Wall Street .
The book is Nader ’s quixotic answer to Ayn Rand ’s 1957 novel “ Atlas Shrugged , ” a celebration of raw capitalism and one of Alan Greenspan ’s favorite works .
Rand ’s book is more than 1,000 pages long , so Nader , coming in at just above 730 pages , has at least beaten his nemesis in economy of style .
By the end of the book , everything Nader has fought to achieve for decades is accomplished .
Popular democracy triumphs .
There is an ascendancy of independent third parties .
An independent press challenges the status quo .
There is universal not - for - profit health care for all Americans .
Vibrant labor unions defend the working class .
Flourishing public schools educate the rich and poor alike , and pot is legal .
There is something endearing and even touching about Nader ’s faith in the good .
“ It ’s probably the most important book I ’ve ever written , ” he says .
“ There is a magnitude and critical mass to the money necessary to facilitate the political and civic energies of the people , to put a lot of them on the ground full time . ”
“ Do liberals and progressives think that by putting out great documentaries , great books , great exposés — and we ’re in the golden age of muckraking — something is going to change with the two - party tyranny , oligarchic and corporate control of Washington ? ” he asks .
“ If they think they ’re going to change anything , year after year , they are living a dystopia .
And between a dystopia on the ground , one that ’s at least 30 years old , and this proposal , I think this one has a higher probability . ”
The trigger to the popular revolt occurs when Buffett is watching the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on television .
The fictional Buffett reacts to the disarray and human suffering by taking truckloads of supplies to the embattled residents of New Orleans .
An elderly woman encounters him delivering relief supplies , grabs his hands and tells him , “ Only the super - rich can save us ! ”
This call to arms haunts Buffett on his way back to his home in Omaha .
He decides to convene a gathering of the wealthy , or at least wealthy people with a conscience , in Maui in January 2006 to retake America .
The fantasy of the rich going to the rescue of ordinary Americans is born out of Nader ’s deep despair over the decline of our democratic mass movements .
It will take angels — and this is what the super - rich become in the book — to descend from the heights to save the country from corporate neofeudalism .
“ I think something ’s happened — 50 years of looking at screens , ” Nader reflects .
“ The young generation is spending 50 hours a week at least in front of the Internet , television and video games .
Two - to - 5 - year - olds , in a survey [ published in October ] , … watched 32 hours of television and DVDs a week .
Two - to - 5 - year - olds !
We do n’t tend to weigh the consequences .
When you ’re in virtual reality — it ’s not like they ’re watching a re-creation of the Federalist discussion — then something happens .
They do n’t know what a town meeting is like .
They do n’t know what the words civic engagement mean .
”
“ The other thing is the massive entrenchment of corporate power , ” he says .
“ The corporations have weakened the labor movement .
The two parties , under the influence of corporate power , are converging .
These corporations game the electoral process .
Money and politics is cleverly distributed .
They have deregulated the regulatory state .
They are beginning to block the courtroom door .
All the countervailing forces , which were built up in the late 19th century and the early 20th century to curb corporate power , are powerless . ”
In the book , set in 2006 , the handful of wealthy renegades work in secret for the first six months .
They form alternative sources of power such as a People ’s Chamber of Commerce to organize tens of thousands of small businesses .
They buy time to saturate the airwaves with populist messages and distract right - wing talk show hosts , who have names like Bush Bimbo and Pawn Vanity , with the kind of faux controversies that are the staple of trash - talk television and radio .
The movement , for example , proposes changing the national anthem from “ The Star - Spangled Banner ” to “ America the Beautiful . ”
The talk show hosts swallow the bait .
“ The dialogue is rather good on that , ” Nader says .
The movement also persuades hundreds of inner-city schoolteachers to instruct pupils , when they pledge allegiance to the flag , to end with the phrase “ liberty and justice for some , ” instead of “ for all . ”
“ Pawn Vanity and Bush Bimbo , they went nuts on that one for weeks , ” Nader laughs .
“ And there ’s even a congressional hearing on that .
I put a lot of my frustrated experiences in this book .
All the things you could n’t really do , because the money was n’t there .
Can you imagine the sense of freedom ?
I did n’t have to use one footnote either .
See , there ’s utopian fiction in all of us , all of us who have struggled to improve their community or nation or world .
And when we have n’t won , we do consciously or subconsciously say ‘ If we only had this , ’ or ‘ If we only had that . ’
If we do n’t continue to elevate our imaginations we cannot envision possibilities . ”
No progressive vision of heaven would be complete without the destruction of Wal - Mart , which occupies many pages , as well as electoral reform .
“ There ’s a section of the book on how they [ those in the new movement ] organize the most redneck , right - wing district in southwest Oklahoma against the chairman of the House Rules Committee , ” Nader says .
“ I put a lot of my frustration in that too .
There ’s a lot of conversation about how conservative people started gravitating towards this movement , and why , and on what issues .
As I said , they did n’t write anybody off .
It ’s a way to show that when you go down the abstraction ladder , to the daily lives of people , the so - called labels of conservative and liberals are not indelible .
A conservative worker in Wal - Mart who wants a living wage will not say ‘ I want to be paid $ 7.50 an hour because it helps Wal - Mart ’s bottom line . ’
When Toyota recalls cars because the throttle is sticking to the floor mat , is your reaction to the recall different if you ’re a liberal or a Republican ?
Are you going to say ‘ I still want the freedom to go onto a highway ’ ?
The discussions on cable and radio are about abstract , ideological conflicts .
They are empirically stark .
I wanted to show what would happen if you brought it down to people ’s daily lives to appeal to their value system and sense of fair play .
If I wrote this as nonfiction nobody would believe me .
You have to write it as fiction .
It gives you that imaginative elbowroom . ”
“ I went to Princeton and Harvard Law School , ” Nader says .
“ We never talked about the commonwealth that the people owned .
One - third of America ’s public lands , plus what is offshore , belongs to the people .
We own them .
But the oil , gas , uranium and the gold and silver industries control them .
They take our resources for nothing or five bucks an acre .
A Canadian gold company discovered $ 9 billion worth of our gold in Nevada in public lands over a decade ago .
They got ownership of it for $ 30,000 under the 1872 Mining Act .
The Department of the Interior had to sell them the projected acreage over the mine for five bucks an acre .
We grow up corporate , even in the Ivy League universities .
The public owns the airwaves , along with trillions of dollars of government research and development , along with the pension funds that the corporations control .
The corporations do n’t care who owns anything , as long as they control it .
All this money that Wall Street played around with , they did n’t own most of it .
It was other people ’s money .
It was pension funds , mutual funds , but they controlled it .
So what they [ the new movement ] did in this book was they educated people .
They got hundreds of people around TV station buildings , two , three hours before the early evening news , and they had signs saying ‘ PAY RENT , ’ because the television stations use our airwaves free and have since radio started .
We ’re the landlords .
They are the tenants , but they decide who says what and who does n’t on radio and TV , and they do n’t pay rent to the Federal Communications Commission .
”
“ What would the framers of the Constitution say about the state of our country today ? ”
Nader asks .
“ Well , they would say that the important parts of the Constitution are a dead letter .
They are being ignored .
Look at the equal protections clause between corporations as entities and real human beings .
The declaration - of - war clause is dead .
The one thing the framers never anticipated was that a branch of government — judicial , executive or legislative — would ever give up its power willingly to another branch .
They did n’t anticipate Congress abdicating its power to the executive branch .
And it ’s getting worse and worse . ”
“ Appropriation power is supposed to start in the House , ” Nader says .
“ Who ’s kidding who ?
It starts in the Office of Management and Budget .
So as a result they did n’t give us any revenue .
No American can challenge this in a court of law , because they would not have any standing to sue .
The case would be thrown out .
And members of Congress do n’t have standing to sue over this violation of the Constitution , of their own authority .
The only one who may have standing to sue is the attorney general , and the attorney general is not going to sue the president .
So that ’s a very serious situation .
We ’re getting a de facto destruction of the separation of powers .
Madison and others did not want anybody but Congress to deliberate and take our country to war .
They were adamant about this .
In The New York Times , after Obama ’s [ Dec. 1 ] speech , they had on the jump page a little paragraph that said President Obama will expand the war into Pakistan , if he can work with a weak and dysfunctional Pakistan government .
Hello ?
Who gave him authority to do that ?
Is he going to the Air Force Academy in a year to talk about the war in Pakistan ?
We have accepted , as a people , that the president can go anywhere in the world , with any troops , at any time , under any pretext .
Period . ”
“ There are a lot of good people in this country who may not agree on some things , but they agree a lot on things that the mass media never emphasizes , ” Nader says .
“ But they ’ve persuaded themselves they ’re powerless .
Why did n’t you show up ?
It does n’t make any difference .
I was busy .
Busy , doing what ?
Well , I had to take the kids to soccer practice .
Half of democracy ’s showing up .
There is demoralization .
How do these super - rich people turn the motivation to action ?
How do they turn a demoralized , powerless population to action ?
You start with imagination .
William Blake said his residence was his imagination .
That ’s what ’s been squeezed out of us and out of our children .
And children are the most imaginative human beings , but they have their imagination squeezed out of them with standardized testing and rote learning , etc. , etc .
We ’ve got to make real - life discussions like this exciting so they happen again and again . ”
Chris Hedges , whose column is published on Truthdig every Monday , has written nine books , the most recent being “ Empire of Illusion : The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle ” ( 2009 ) .
Homeland Security Chairman Sen. Joe Lieberman told Fox News ’ Chris Wallace that he wants the Department of Defense to launch an investigation into the shooting rampage at Ft. Hood .
Lieberman said evidence indicates that Major Nidal Malik Hasan was probably a “ self - radicalized , homegrown terrorist . ”
The New York Times reports , however , that investigators have tentatively concluded it was not part of a terrorist plot .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If the reports that we ’re receiving of various statements he made , acts he took , are valid , he had turned to Islamist extremism , and , therefore , if that is true , the murder of these 13 people was a terrorist act and , in fact , it was the most destructive terrorist act to be committed on American soil since 9/11 , ” Lieberman said Sunday .
According to this morning ’s New York Times , investigators have not ruled out the possibility Major Hassan “ believed he was carrying out an extremist ’s suicide mission , ” but so far they have no evidence he was directed into violence or “ ever traveled overseas to meet with extremist groups . ”
Lieberman wants the Department of Defense to conduct a special investigation to see if the shootings could have been predicted .
“ While the Army and the FBI are conducting the criminal investigation about exactly what happened and what Dr. Hasan should be charged with , the U.S. Army , the Department of Defense has a real obligation to convene an independent investigation to go back and look at whether warning signs were missed , both the stress he was under , but also the statements that he was making , ” he said .
Officials quoted by The New York Times say a continuing search of Hasan ’s computer has found email messages exchanged with ideologically radical Muslims , though there is no evidence he communicated with “ known terrorists or anyone else who encouraged or helped him to orchestrate the shootings . ”
Lieberman told Fox , “ The new face of terrorism in America would not just be the attacks as 9/11 organized abroad and sending people in here , it would be people within this country , homegrown terrorists , self - radicalized , often over the Internet , going to jihadist websites . ”

Editor 's Note : Steve Chapman is on vacation .
The following column was originally published in January 2006 .
It 's hard to describe the views of the Rev. Fred Phelps without feeling soiled by the association , but I 'll do it anyway .
He attests that God is disgusted with America 's tolerance of homosexuality .
In his view , the Almighty is punishing the nation by using improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) to kill American troops in Iraq .
God wants our soldiers dead .
Phelps , pastor of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka , Kan. , is not content to deliver this message to his congregation .
He also communicates it in the least welcoming venue he can find : the funerals of men and women who died in combat .
He and his parishioners have staged protests at more than 60 military funerals , holding signs with messages like " Thank God for IEDs " and " God Hates Fags . "
These vicious demonstrations have elicited a predictable but mistaken response : demands that they be outlawed .
Kansas passed a law banning such protests for one hour before a funeral begins and two hours after it ends .
As lieutenant governor of Illinois , Pat Quinn pushed a law requiring demonstrators to stay far away from such a service .
Quinn sees the issue as simple .
" No grieving military family should be subjected to vile epithets and signs at the funeral service of their loved one who has made the ultimate sacrifice for our country , " he declared .
The bill , he said , would merely uphold " the First Amendment religious rights of families to bury their dead with reverence . "
Some parts of the bill do exactly that — making it illegal for protesters to block access to funeral parlors and churches , and restricting the sound levels of protests .
But the concern is selective .
The bill does n't prohibit rock bands or motorcycles from making noise near a funeral — only protesters .
The heart of the bill is meant to circumvent the First Amendment , not uphold it .
One section forbids any protest , no matter how quiet or unthreatening , within 300 feet of a building where a service is being held , from half an hour before it starts until half an hour after it ends .
Another forbids signs featuring " veiled threats " — which could include the message that God will kill Americans if they do n't change their ways .
The obvious goal is to stop demonstrators from presenting mourners with a message they may find deeply offensive .
But the whole reason for the First Amendment 's guarantee of freedom of speech is to protect unpopular , obnoxious , and even horribly vile messages .
Messages that are popular and palatable , after all , do n't need constitutional protection , since they are in no danger of being censored .
No one would seriously argue that the government can forbid Phelps to say " Thank God for IEDs " from his pulpit , in a public park , on a street - corner soapbox , or at a political rally .
But the intent of these measures is to prevent him from saying it , even on a placard , at the site of a military funeral .
Why ?
Because the message can only wound the feelings of the family and friends of the deceased .
It 's reprehensible of Phelps to go out of his way to add to their trauma .
But as University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone put it , " There is not a funerals exception to the First Amendment . "
Granting one exception would lead to others .
If we silence demonstrators to protect us from emotional upset at funerals , what 's next ?
Protecting us anytime we visit a cemetery ?
On our way into Sunday worship ?
When we 're entering a hospital ?
Arriving at a psychiatrist 's office ?
Once we decide citizens should be free of unwanted messages in some public places , we invite censorship whenever anyone takes offense .
Civil rights activists would n't have been permitted to jar the sensibilities of white Southerners .
Antiwar demonstrators would be kept away from the Pentagon .
Nazis would n't have been allowed to march in Skokie .
Victims of priestly molestation would have to stay away from Catholic churches .
It 's no justification to say Phelps could exercise his right to protest at other places and other times .
Part of the right to free speech is the right to decide when and where to speak in order to achieve the desired impact .
I think his message is wrong .
But if it were right , who would need to hear it more than those mourning a soldier 's death ?
When Americans enacted the First Amendment , they agreed that none of us has a right to avoid being offended .
If we had , a tranquil silence would fall over all the subjects that we now debate so vigorously and indecorously .
The silence of the graveyard .

Tuesday 's announcement that Fritz Henderson is stepping down as chief executive of General Motors vividly demonstrates the central role that the company 's board of directors is playing as the nation 's largest auto maker continues its progress toward full private control .

1. Generation Kill ( HBO , 2008 )
It ’s no coincidence that this intense , impressive seven - episode look at the early days of the Iraq War was the work of the men who made The Wire ; the two projects share the same love of internal argot , the same sensitivity to men doing a dangerous job that some of them do n’t really believe in , and most of all , the same cutting perspective on how those at the bottom of a broken system are perpetually frustrated by the bad decisions of those at the top .
Embedded reporter Evan Wright was the perfect choice for Ed Burns and David Simon ’s source material ; his slightly skewed but perfectly sound journalistic approach mirrors their own , and helps imbue Generation Kill with humor and humanity .

2. Planet Earth ( BBC , 2006 )
It ’s a testament to how successful Planet Earth has been that it ’s spawned so many imitators , look - alikes , and spin - off products .
In 2002 , the BBC ’s Natural History Unit set out to reinvent the nature documentary .
Equipping their crews with unprecedented resources — including a full range of high - definition cameras and experimental filming methods — they spent more money making Planet Earth than had ever been imagined for such a project .
Money does n’t always equal artistic success , but in this case , the end product is breathtaking .
Planet Earth visits every conceivable climate and environment , never forcing nature to conform to its agenda , and comes back with footage of animals and habitats that left viewers spellbound .
The resources , personnel , and time involved resulted in film of events that had never been seen before by human eyes , and the excitement of everyone involved is tangible .
Planet Earth is not only the filmed evidence of dedicated , skilled scientists at work , but the most successful nature documentary ever made .

3. Recount ( HBO , 2008 )
The ’00s began with the fallout from the most bizarre presidential race in American history .
But the inevitable movie about the 2000 election — and the subsequent Bush Vs. Gore Supreme Court decision that settled it — almost did n’t happen .
Director Sydney Pollack , who was slated to film it , died before he could complete any work , but veteran Jay Roach stepped in and delivered a stand - up job , thanks largely to an engaging script by Danny Strong and a powerhouse cast that included Laura Dern , John Hurt , Tom Wilkinson , and Bob Balaban .
Predictably , when Recount aired , both ends of the political spectrum complained that it was a Hollywood fable that did n’t accurately reflect the events of the election .
But then again , looking back , the election itself seems more unreal as the years go by .

4. Angels In America ( HBO , 2003 )
HBO had a real job of work on its hands when it decided to give over seven hours of programming to an adaptation of Tony Kushner ’s award - winning play Angels In America .
There were those who thought that Kushner , adapting his own work , would get overindulgent , and others who thought the play — written a dozen years previous and set at the height of the AIDS panic — was past its sell - by date .
HBO disagreed , and went all - out with the production .
They hired Mike Nichols to direct , populated the cast with heavy hitters like Al Pacino and Meryl Streep , and commissioned Thomas Newman to provide a memorable score .
Angels cost a fortune , and though not every one of its 352 minutes works , it ’s rightly remembered as a masterful miniseries , and home to one of Pacino ’s finest latter - day performances .

5. Band Of Brothers ( HBO , 2001 )
Unlike Generation Kill , HBO ’s World War II miniseries Band Of Brothers dealt with more traditional “ men on a mission ” stories , letting audiences get to know a group of soldiers as they journeyed from basic training to the European theater , before ending at Hitler ’s abandoned “ Eagle ’s Nest . ”
But though this Steven Spielberg / Tom Hanks - produced event is more about the grand bonding adventure of war than about murderous psychopaths and dangerous incompetents , Band Of Brothers does n’t shy away from the real - world effects of combat , such as shell shock , alcoholism , a general hardening of the heart , and — not incidentally — death .
The series has a narrative sweep and some emotional swells , but it never feels less than truthful .

6. Torchwood : Children Of Earth ( BBC , 2009 )
For the third season of the popular Doctor Who spin- off Torchwood , Russell T. Davies cut back to a single five - hour , five - episode story , and created the science - fiction equivalent of a pulse - pounding policier .
When a powerful , grotesque alien race descends on Earth and orders humanity to give up 10 percent of its children , the demand exposes past corruption , festering class divisions , and the limits of capitulation .
By the end of Children Of Earth , major characters have died , and the show ’s ever - mercurial hero Captain Jack Harkness has shown more personal weakness than he can abide .
All this plus cool gadgets , shocking deathtraps , humorous asides , and quietly moving conversations .
Children Of Earth is a full - service miniseries .

7. Life With Judy Garland : Me & My Shadows ( ABC , 2001 )
This two - part , three - hour biopic covers an entertainer as troubled as she was gifted , and does so with an eye for detail and sense of scope that some Oscar - bait biopics ca n’t summon .
But the reason it belongs on this list is simple :
As Garland , actress Judy Davis gives the best performance of her formidable career , conveying the singer ’s vulnerability and vitality in equal measure .
Life With Judy Garland is n’t one long wallow in booze , pills , and self - destructive love affairs ; it finds plenty of room for Garland ’s creative triumphs , and the personal warmth that endeared her to her fans and co-workers .
Davis sells the prickly parts — as she ’s done often in movies — but she also shows enough of Garland ’s spark that it ’s easier to understand why we should care .

8. Broken Trail ( AMC , 2006 )
The Western may be out of fashion at the multiplex , but the genre has thrived on television over the past decade , thanks to agreeably old - fashioned projects like Walter Hill ’s Broken Trail .
Robert Duvall plays an aging loner ( very Randolph Scott - like ) who tries to raise the money to buy a ranch by driving 500 horses to Wyoming , but gets sidetracked when he and his nephew Thomas Haden Church discover a human trafficking ring .
A well - balanced mix of classic Western heroism and harsh historical lessons , Broken Trail feels like the past and the future of a quintessential American form .

9. John Adams ( HBO , 2008 )
Like the best historical dramas , HBO ’s eight - hour study of America ’s second president succeeds at making the past look curious and alien , while making the people and their interactions with each other look familiar .
Credit the performances of Paul Giamatti as the cranky , idealistic - yet - oft - traditionalist John Adams , and Laura Linney as his wife , who was frequently abandoned on the front lines .
Their lifelong romance — through brutal political maneuvering , troubles with their kids , and more travel than nearly any other couple of their generation had to endure — grounds A Tale Of Important Figures in something clear and common .

10 . When The Levees Broke ( HBO , 2006 )
Spike Lee ’s exhaustive , essential documentary lines up what must be a hundred interview subjects to talk about the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina , the flood that ensued , and — the most underreported part of the whole tragedy — the nightmare of trying to rebuild the city .
The flood footage is as startling as ever , right down to the bloated bodies floating in submerged streets .
But even more disturbing is the exhausted unanimity of the people Lee talks with .
Whether they ’re black or white , rich or poor , they ’re all victims of a presumption that became more widely vocalized in the months after Katrina : that they were somehow asking for it .
When The Levees Broke focuses on the frustrations of people who were stranded in a post - apocalyptic wasteland , facing gun-toting government agents telling them where they could and could n’t go .
Just for recording their descriptions of being herded into pens and scattered across the country , When The Levees Broke is as significant a piece of documentary reporting as The Sorrow And The Pity .

And ca n’t forget …
The Corner ( HBO , 2000 )
A precursor to The Wire , this six - part HBO miniseries looks at one inner-city Baltimore family ’s attempts to get clean , get straight , and get their piece of the American dream .
Co-written by David Simon , Ed Burns , and David Mills and directed by Charles S. Dutton , The Corner takes the bleak realism that Simon brought to Homicide : Life On The Street and drains it of nearly any trace of levity , telling a story that plays more like a documentary than a scripted drama .
Yes , it ’s based on a true story , but in the hands of Simon , Burns , Mills , and Dutton ( as well as stars Khandi Alexander , T.K. Carter , and Sean Nelson ) , The Corner feels truer than true .
It ’s like an unsparing dissection of how the world really works .
UPDATED see the end .
The Python standard library has a module called getpass you can use to get a password from the prompt :
>>> import getpass >>> password = getpass.getpass ()
Password : <-- non-echoed typing here >>> print password worked
That ’s nice , and Distutils uses it to ask for your password when you register or upload a release at PyPI , if it ’s not found in your pypirc file .
But this is annoying to type and type again your password , so you end up saving it in clear text in pypirc .
Thats sucks .
And the getpass module gets pretty useless if you want to store and retrieve passwords from other places than the user brain .
But wait … we have the Keyring project now .. what about making getpass use Keyring so you can safely read a password from your favorite keyring ( Keychain , KWallet , etc . . ) ?
I ’ve started to write a new getpass module that could do this .
But instead of adding a keyring dependency in it and struggling for months ( years ) to get the addition of Keyring into the stdlib , I have made getpass pluggable .
In my improved version , you can define in a small configuration file ( getpass.cfg ) an arbritrary function that will be used by getpass for the getpass .
getpass API .
Here ’s such a file :
[ getpass ] getpass - backend = keyring : get_pass_get_password
Here I am configuring get pass to use the get_pass_get_password function from the keyring package .
That ’s a function that gets installed in your Python once Keyring is installed .
This function has the same interface than the default getpass .
getpass API and calls keyring .
The modified getpass module is here : http://bitbucket.org/tarek/getpass/
And works against the current trunk of Keyring .
What I would like to do now is to propose the small changes I ’ve made in Python ’s getpass for inclusion in the stdlib .
They are backward compatible changes and offers a simple , yet powerfull way to extend getpass without adding any other module in the stdlib .
And maybe adding a setpass in there too would make sense .
Update from python-ideas
So I brought up the idea in the mailing lists and it turns out ( thanks to the folks at Python - ideas ) that the way I want to introduce this feature is not good for these reasons :
getpass is just a function that is used to get a password from the prompt .
you can consider it as a potential , dummy backend for Keyring for example .
Trying to make it extendable just denaturates its original purpose .
the only use case right now in the stdlib is for Distutils , so it does n’t really make sense to have a keyring in there .
People can just use the Keyring project directly .
Now if other parts of the stdlib have the same need , it will be time to think about how it could be included in the stdlib level rather than in Distutils .
So , I ’ll work for its inclusion at Distutils level rather thah on getpass level .
Even though quantum computers are still in their crawling phase , computer scientists continue to push their limits .
Recently , a group of scientists used a two - qubit quantum system to model the energies of a hydrogen molecule and found that using an iterative algorithm to calculate each digit of the phase shift gave very accurate results .
Their system , while not directly extensible , has the potential to help map the energies of more complex molecules and could result in significant time and power savings compared to classical computers .
There are some situations , like quantum states of particles , that classical computers can only approximate , and they often do so quite poorly , with high degrees of uncertainty despite extensive computing time .
For modeling quantum situations , there 's no better tool than another quantum system that can be used to store and process the relevant data , as quantum computers can explore many possible states at once ( though only one state can be measured as the outcome ) .
First , a quick rundown on quantum computers : while a regular computer processes and uses bits comprised of zeroes and ones , a quantum computer processes qubits , or bits that can store a superposition of both zero and one that will be in only one of these states when read out .
In other words , when a qubit is measured , its superposition collapses to one of its available states ( in this case , zero or one ) .
Modeling the energy levels of molecular hydrogen requires calculating the distance between the two atoms and the effect of different levels of excitation .
A group of scientists designed a three - step method to handle this : encode the wave function of the molecule using qubits , simulate time evolution with quantum logic gates , and then use an iterative phase estimation algorithm to reduce the error , using the output of each trial as the input for the next .
To get the energy , they calculated the phase shift of the molecule 's wave function as a series of bits , and calculated one bit at a time with the qubit system .
To model a hydrogen molecule ( two bonded hydrogen atoms ) , scientists injected two photons into an optical circuit , with each photon 's polarization representing the encoding for a " control " qubit and a " register " qubit .
The register represents an eigenstate , or one accepted energy configuration of the hydrogen molecule , and the control is in an equal superposition of a vertical and horizontal polarization .
The photons are then passed through a logic gate that represents an evolution of the wave function over time .
The gate polarizes the control photon , forcing it to collapse into either a vertical or horizontal state .
It also performs an operation on the register photon if the control comes out of the gate horizontally polarized , or leaves the register photon alone if the control becomes vertically polarized .
The position of the control photon is measured and converted to a bit — 0 for horizontal , and 1 for vertical .
This represents one pass through the optical circuit .
The algorithm used 31 samples , or photon pairs , for each bit , and a " majority vote " was taken using all the samples — the resulting number is used as one digit in the binary expansion of the phase shift .
The next iteration put all the photon pairs through the same circuit again , using the output of the first iteration as input for the second .
With each new time around , the output was used to simulate a different time point in the evolution of the hydrogen molecule .
The least significant digit was always calculated first , then the next most significant , as this order allows for the best estimation of the most significant digits .
The finished product looks something like 0.01001011101011100000 , and varies depending on the excitation of the atoms and their distance from each other .
Researchers found that they could calculate the phase shift out to 20 significant digits before the least significant digit stopped strongly favoring one value over another .
The results of the experiment mirrored very closely the energy curves of a hydrogen molecule as a function of the atomic separation , indicating that this is an excellent method for studying the energies of molecules .
While the general approach to the problem , in particular the use of an iterative algorithm to estimate the phase of the wave function , proved accurate , the system that was used is only applicable to the hydrogen molecule .
Simulating larger molecules requires more qubits and logic gates , which decrease the accuracy of measurements .
The precision in the hydrogen molecule system is high because the error introduced by one gate is always a constant , and can be corrected for by the classical method of the majority vote .
If it were possible to look at the system after each gate , correct the error , and continue on , large systems requiring multiple logic gates would work pretty well .
However , a quantum system can only be observed once it has run its course , and each logic gate roughly doubles the error each time the photons pass through it .
Therefore , some new quantum correction techniques will have to be introduced before quantum computers can take on larger molecules .
Despite these limitations , the work is an important demonstration of the promise of quantum computing , and shows that the techniques we already have can be put to practical use .

NEW BRUNSWICK --
The brand - new , $ 185 million public high school in New Brunswick will have energy - providing solar panels on the roof , state - of - the - art lighting for its athletic fields and touch - sensitive , internet - connected " Smart Boards " instead of traditional blackboards .
But when it opened last week , it did n’t have a couple of comparatively low - tech necessities — a crosswalk and a stoplight .
Now , two off - duty police officers have been hired to direct traffic for four hours during peak traffic until the light and walkway are completed this spring .
And the tab is being sent to the state , which built the new New Brunswick High School and is responsible for Route 27 , where the school is located .
" The state did n’t do its job , " Superintendent Richard Kaplan said .
Costs for the officers are estimated to reach $ 38,000 by April , when the traffic light is expected to be installed , said Sarah Clarke , vice president of Devco , the city ’s non-profit development agency .
Devco designed and managed construction of the school , which replaces the old high school on Livingston Avenue that was built in 1964 .
A stoplight is crucial to keeping students safe , Kaplan said , because 22 school buses make turns into and out of the school parking lot exit across from Churchill Avenue , the site where the stoplight will be built .
The state Department of Transportation was ultimately responsible for the stoplight , Kaplan and Clarke said .
Devco first sent proposals for the stoplight to the DOT in July 2008 , Clarke said .
But DOT spokesman Tim Greeley defended the agency , saying the school was built eight months early and that was n’t enough time for the DOT to coordinate building a stoplight just yards from a Conrail line and manage appeals by neighboring property owners .
Kaplan confirmed the school was originally supposed to open this fall .
The DOT was informed in May 2009 of the new start date , he said .
" We expedited reviews and held meetings on short notice , " Greeley said in an e-mail .
The two police officers are working from 7 to 9 a.m. and 2 to 4 p.m on school days , Kaplan said .
Other than the stoplight , the 400,000 - square - foot facility is complete , Clarke said .
Finishing touches still to be added to the 1,300 - student school include lighting for four athletic fields behind building and solar panels on the roof that will power up to half the school ’s energy needs , Clarke said .
One afternoon last week , several students , parents and a bus driver said they ’re frustrated with the school ’s busy traffic .
Aside from the missing stoplight , there ’s no crosswalk in front of the school , causing some children to jaywalk through zipping cars to get to the other side , several said .
" They built this nice new school , but they never figured out the traffic problem before they built it , " said Bob Hartan , a bus driver for Iselin - based George Dapper Inc. , as he picked up students on Wednesday afternoon .
" The only thing they think about is throwing up the school real quick . "
In 1985 , Central Mexico , including Mexico City , was hit by an earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale – much larger than the one that hit Haiti on January 12 of this year .
Hundreds of buildings collapsed and thousands were killed .
As in Haiti , buildings were not up to code .
Corrupt builders saved money by using substandard materials and construction methods , and corrupt officials let them do it .
Many newer apartment and office buildings , as well as hospitals and schools , collapsed while older ones , such as the magnificent 17th century cathedral on the Zocalo ( main square ) came through without major damage .
Mexico City rebuilt , but there was a political change effectuated by the earthquake .
In the center of the city , sweatshops collapsed on top of entire shifts of underpaid , overworked employees .
The owners , as soon as they managed to extract their more expensive machinery , abandoned the buildings and the workers , including some , living and dead , who were still trapped in the rubble .
Undaunted , the surviving garment workers , mostly women , did what they could to dig their comrades out , and then formed the nucleus of a variety of new grassroots organizations that not only engaged in self help , but also challenged the power structure in Mexico .
Through militant but flexible tactics , they backed the PRI government down so effectively that Mexico City ended up with an elected government rather than the previous appointed one .
And in the next presidential elections , in 1988 , the left - center candidate almost certainly won and would have taken power away from the PRI had it not been for fraud .
The initiative taken by the seamstresses and others when the government proved unable to deal with the aftermath of an earthquake has borne valuable political fruit .
I was reminded of those days when reading John Ross ’ amazing new book “ El Monstruo : Dread and Redemption in Mexico City . ”
I remember well a visit of some of the Mexico City seamstresses to Chicago where I lived at the time .
There was no sign of pitiful “ victimhood ” .
Listening to them , we all knew that the Mexican working class and nation would move forward , in spite of national disasters and corrupt politicians .
Though the 1985 Mexico City earthquake was a full point stronger on the Richter scale , the damage in Haiti has been vastly greater .
The Haitian government has announced that in the capital of Port au Prince alone the death toll is 150,000 .
Everything is destroyed , but everything is also slowly coming back to life .
There has been much outside help , but the Haitian people have been getting together to help themselves also .
Everywhere we read about local committees in destroyed neighborhoods and refugee camps making plans for reconstruction and restoration of a nation .
This should not surprise us ; this has been the story of Haiti from the beginning .
A nation acutely conscious of its history of having arisen from a revolution made by slaves is not to be kept down .
Haiti will be rebuilt and , with some help , the Haitian people will rebuild it .
But this frightens certain people .
Already we here voices on the U.S. right advancing the discredited idea that the Haitian people are poor because they are culturally inferior .
Jonah Goldberg , writing in the reactionary National Review , after falsely claiming that Haiti is descending into violence and chaos , says that there is no explanation for Haiti ’s poverty except that there is something wrong with Haitian society .
“ The sad truth about Haiti is n’t simply that it is poor , ” Goldberg alleges , “ but that it has a poverty culture … Haiti will never get out of grinding poverty until it abandons much of its culture . ”
David Brooks , writing in the New York Times two days after the earthquake , said much the same thing , except that he blamed much of the problem on “ voodoo ” and what he alleges are irresponsible child raising practices , which he read about in some book or other .
Since , according to these gentlemen and a host of others , the Haitian people are to blame for their own suffering , they ca n’t very well be left alone to rebuild their country .
They will need an extended period of tutelage under the gentle but firm of wiser , lighter skinned foreigners , such as the U.S. Marines .
The large U.S. military presence in Haiti , and especially the suggestion that it is going to stay there for a long time , is causing alarm in the region .
Specifically , Haiti has an election scheduled on February 28 , and there is controversy because the electoral commission has ruled that a number of political parties , including the large left - wing Fanmi Lavalas party of exiled former president Jean Bertrand Aristide , can not participate .
There are sure to be protests by the large Lavalas base among the poor against this exclusion .
The protesters will be portrayed as a dangerous rabble , and if the Marines are still present , there will be strong pressure to use them to suppress the protests .
We can not allow that .
But the right wing in the United States will specifically want that to happen .
They are already saying that the United States must keep Haiti from falling into the hands of ALBA , the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of Our America , a left - wing political and trade bloc led by Cuba , Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador which is offering countries in the region a more generous alternative to the trade and development policies pushed by the IMF , the World Bank and U.S.A .
Therefore , now that the main emergency rescue phase is over , we must push for the expeditious removal of the U.S. military and its replacement by UN , NGO and volunteer efforts , always to supplement and never to supplant the efforts of the Haitian people themselves to rebuild .
There must be no interference in the February elections and no retribution if the Haitian people choose leaders and policies that Wall Street does not like .
Freedom is a right the Haitian people have earned with their blood .

Way , way back in 2007 , I put up a short post about a scandal involving the Hoboken , New Jersey SWAT team , which claimed to have gone on a humanitarian aid trip to help victims of Hurricane Katrina , but ended up partying it up at Mardis Gras , with ensuing photos involving Hooters girls , Jello shots , and SWAT chief Lt. Angelo Andriani posing as a member of the Ku Klux Klan .
Andriani was later sued by five Hispanic police officers alleging him to be an " unabashed white supremacist . "
Andriani is back in the news , after apparently flashing his badge and berating some TSA employees for allowing a flight crew to move ahead of him in a screening line .
Pick your poison in the " rogue cop vs. TSA " squabble .
The story within the story linked above is the punishment Andriani received for his exploits in New Orleans : a two year paid suspension .
Hoboken taxpayers are " punishing " Andriani by paying him $ 11,000 per month for 24 months to do absolutely nothing .

We had to ask him to leave because a lot of the guests were getting disgusted at seeing an old man with a trail of blood walking around the hotel , touching doors , etc .
I feel really bad for him because his family basically ditched him and I tried to help him as much as I could :(
I never heard from him since .
He actually left a big suitcase of medicine in his room and the hazmat team took it away when they stripped the place of everything .

Who knew Peter Jackson would be such a big Modern Warfare 2 fan ?
The legendary director and producer is currently enjoying the game “ more than films ” at the moment , he revealed in a recent interview ( thanks , VG247 ) .
“ [ Spec Ops ] is hard , I know , and to get to that final level , which is what ?
Echo is it ?
… I have still got to crack through a lot of things to open up that one level , but it ’s a great game , ” said Jackson .
“ I ’m enjoying these games more than I am enjoying films at the moment .
“ And they are using a lot of the film techniques now , especially the cinematic areas or those little movie things , ” he added .
“ They are starting to really blend them in and you get the feeling that you are watching substantial bits of prerecorded animation which is still great , though , because they are dynamic and done well .
They did n’t used to be done very well in the old days , but there are people that actually know what they are doing . ”
So , aside from playing Modern Warfare 2 , what else is Peter Jackson up to ?
He ’s currently working on a few new titles , two of which are games .
“ At the moment I am kind of involved with a Tintin game and obviously the beginning of The Hobbit game , so those two in terms of the gaming at the moment with all of the other scripts we are working on at the moment , those are the gaming things we are focusing on , ” he explained .
Jackson is also against the idea of creating tie - in games based on his movies .
He explains that he has ideas that could work both as video games and films , but rather than create both , he ’d rather stick to games because it ’s becoming such an “ interesting ” medium .
“ I ’ve got ideas that could be a movie or they could be a game , ” continued Jackson , “ and I think that they should , rather than just make a movie and then do a spin - off game , …I ’d rather do them as a stand alone game because that world is getting more and more interesting . ”

Does healthcare insurance save lives ?
Megan McArdle touched off a discussion about this with a recent short article in the Atlantic which points out that when uninsured 64 - year - olds go on Medicare , there ’s no noticeable effect on mortality .
I ’ve been a little uninterested in this debate , though , since ( a ) any short - term effect from Medicare is almost bound to be so small that it ’s barely measurable , and ( b ) mortality is a tiny part of the reason I support universal health coverage anyway .
Even if universal coverage did n’t save a single life , I ’d still think it was a good idea for reasons of efficiency , social justice , cost saving potential , and basic human decency , as well as its medical effect on things that are just shy of mortality : preventive care , pain reduction , life improvement , employability , stress reduction , medical bankruptcies , etc .
Over at Austin Frakt ’s place , Harvard ’s Michael McWilliams basically agrees .
He surveys the full literature and concludes that looking for differences in mortality over a period of a year or two is n’t likely to produce firm results one way or the other , but that the effect of insurance on overall health is pretty much indisputable :
To date , numerous studies have found consistently beneficial and often significant effects of insurance coverage on health across a comprehensive set of outcomes and a broad range of treatable chronic and acute conditions that affect many adults in the U.S. , including hypertension , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , stroke , diabetes , HIV infection , depressive symptoms , acute myocardial infarction , acute respiratory illnesses , and traumatic injuries ( McWilliams 2009 ) .
In particular , several studies have robustly demonstrated positive effects of near - universal Medicare coverage after age 65 on self - reported health outcomes and clinical measures of disease control , particular for adults with cardiovascular disease or diabetes who make up two - thirds of the near - elderly ( Decker and Remler 2004 ; McWilliams et al. 2007 , 2009 ) .
…. How many lives would universal coverage save each year ?
A rigorous body of research tells us the answer is many , probably thousands if not tens of thousands .
Short of the perfect study , however , we will never know the exact number .
In the meantime , we can let perfect be the enemy of good .
Or we can recognize the evidence to date is sufficiently robust for policymakers to proceed confidently with health care reforms that promise substantial health and financial benefits for millions of uninsured Americans .
I ’d toss in a cool chart on some aspect of this debate , but unfortunately the scholarly version of McWilliams ’s piece costs $ 41.19 ( plus tax ! ) , which exceeds my research budget for the month .
But the bottom line is pretty simple : health insurance improves health , and improved health almost certainly saves lives .
But remember : even if it does n’t , it improves health .
That ’s what everyone should be focused on .
UPDATE : Friend - of - the - blog RSA sends along a copy of McWilliams ’s article , but sadly it contains no charts .
However , it does contain a table outlining the results of his literature review .
Basically , his goal was to review results since 2002 , and what he found was 30 studies that showed positive and statistically significant correlations between insurance and health outcomes , compared to nine that showed no significant results .
Details below :
Two Greenpeace activists who were arrested after attempting to expose embezzlement in Japan 's whaling fleet will go on trial tomorrow in a case campaigners hope will spark a domestic backlash against the heavily - subsidised industry .
Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki were detained in June 2008 , two months after intercepting a consignment of whale meat they claimed had been stolen by a member of the crew on the Nisshin Maru , the Japanese Antarctic whaling fleet 's mother ship .
The activists – who claimed the meat was destined for the black market – face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of theft and trespass .
They said the package , retrieved from a warehouse in Aomori , northern Japan , was marked " cardboard " but contained 23kg of salted whale meat worth around 350,000 yen ( £ 2,477 ) .
Greenpeace said it had evidence to prove that at least 23 of the ship 's crew smuggled more than 90 boxes of salted whale , disguised as personal baggage , and accused them of defrauding the Japanese taxpayer with the approval of Kyodo Senpaku , which operates the whaling fleet .
Kyodo Senpaku insisted the packages were a " bonus " for crew members who had spent several months in the inhospitable waters of the southern ocean .
Prosecutors , who initially agreed to pursue the embezzlement claims , dropped the investigation on the day Sato and Suzuki were arrested in early - morning raids on their homes .
According to Greenpeace , , Japanese taxpayers contribute an estimated 500 m yen to the " scientific " whale hunts each year .
Earlier this month , a UN human rights body condemned the detention of Sato and Suzuki and warned Japan that it had breached several articles of the UN declaration of human rights .
During their 26 days in custody , 23 of which saw them held without charge , the suspects were denied access to lawyers , strapped to chairs and interrogated for up to 12 hours a day .
Their interrogators likened them to members of Aum Supreme Truth , the doomsday cult that carried out the fatal gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995 .
Suzuki protested by going on hunger strike for nine days and refusing to talk to investigators for four more .
" They have taken a stand in the public interest , " Kumi Naidoo , Greenpeace 's executive director , told reporters in Tokyo .
" It has come at a personal and professional cost .
To be in detention day after day , tied down , with no lawyer , is a terrifying thing for anyone to endure .
" To have that happen to them when all they were trying to do was draw attention to the abuse of public funds is beyond scary .
It is wrong . "
Naidoo urged the Japanese prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , to reopen the investigation into alleged embezzlement by the whaling crew and to ensure Sato and Suzuki were given a fair trial .
" The eyes of the world are on Japan , " he added .
Since the arrests , more than 250,000 people have signed a petition demanding justice for 32 - year - old Sato and Suzuki , 42 .
Anti-whaling campaigners have accused the authorities of staging a politically motivated trial , designed to depict peaceful activists as " terrorists " , with the eventual aim of closing down Greenpeace 's office in Japan .
In an interview with the Guardian after he was released on bail , Suzuki remained unrepentant .
" Since my arrest , I have not lied once about what I did , " he said .
" But the whalers have had to make up one story after another .
Their lies will come back to haunt them . "
Two years ago , Greenpeace abandoned its pursuit of the whaling fleet to focus on building an anti-whaling coalition among the Japanese people .
A provision in the International Whaling commission 's 1986 ban on commercial whaling permits Japan to conduct " lethal research " into about 1,000 whales in the Southern ocean each year .

Travel and accommodation in Chamonix , Zermatt and Breuil - Cervinia .
The cheapest hotel in Zermatt is probably the Bahnhof , with rooms and dormitories .
Find the necessary information about the huts from the excellent Swiss Alpine Club or Club Alpin Francais pages
Plan your bus or taxi connection , between Champex and Bourg - St - Pierre , with these useful links : SBB.CH and Champex info Essential Gear Ski-mountaineering gear , ice axe , crampons , harness , rope , carabiners , slings , a couple of ice screws .
The Haute Route , between Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn , is the most coveted ski-mountaineering tour in the Alps , attracting people from all over the world .
A summer route connecting Chamonix and Zermatt was originally charted by members of the Alpine Club in the mid 19th century and was dubbed the " High Level Road " .
By 1861 many of the notable Club members had walked the route .
The first traverse on skis was undertaken in 1903 ( or 1911 depending on itinerary ) and the ski route , including the passage of Plateau du Couloir , became known as the classic " Haute Route " .
Even though the route is not too difficult , it should not be underestimated .
Rope and crampons are likely be used at some point and , while route finding should not be a problem in good weather , in poor visibility it can be problematic .
The best time for the ski tour is late March to May , when the huts open .
The traverse can be completed in five days , but you could be forced to wait out bad weather at some hut , allow for extra days in your plan .
The record for the traverse , from the church in Chamonix to the church in Zermatt , is 16 hours and 35 minutes set on 21 March 2016 by Bastien Fleury and Oliver Meynet via Col de la Grande Lui / La Fouly .
From the village of Argentiere , a short distance from Chamonix , take the cableway to Grand Montets 3297 m and reach the Col des Grands Montets , just outside the arrival station .
Descend the Glacier des Rognons , aiming East , to the glacier d'Argentiere , at about 2600 m .
Cross the glacier and reach the foot of the ridge between the glacier de Chardonnet and the glacier du Milieu .
Climb the rocky lower slopes ( steep ) toward the glacier de Chardonnet .
Once on the glacier keep right and away from the icefall .
When the slope eases move into the center of the glacier and aim for the Col du Chardonnet 3323 m , easily reached with a final short climb .
From the col descend the steep couloir on the NE side , usually down - climbing or abseiling , the steep section is about 60 m .
Once on the glacier de Saleina make a slightly descending traverse NE passing below the rocky spur of the Grande Fourche ( lower point about 3080 m ) .
Climb the north basin of the glacier de Saleina to the narrow gap of the Fenetre de Saleina 3267 m , the final section is steep and is usually climbed on foot .
The north side of the col opens on the huge and flat upper plateau of the Glacier du Trient .
From the col traverse NE around the north spur of the Aig.
Dorees and cross the plateau NE toward the Col d'Orny 3098 m .
The Cabane du Trient 3170 m is on a buttress just above the col and is reached by the slope on the left of the buttress .
From the hut descend to the plateau du Trient and follow the right side of the glacier north .
Reach a flat area of the glacier with an icefall to your left at about 3000 m over a step of the glacier .
Keep to the right and descend a steep slope / gully between the seracs to your left and the rocks on the right .
Traverse right NE with a diagonal below the rock wall heading for the obvious notch of Col des Ecandiens 2796 m reached with a short ascent on foot .
At the col you stand at the top of the long and beautiful Val d'Arpette , with good snow a fine descent of about 1300 m .
Descend to the right side at first , and reach the small village of Arpette 1627 m .
Follow a piste down into the wood until you reach the road .
Turn right E and reach Champex 1477 m with a short walk .
At the first cafe` you find on the road it is possible call a taxi and arrange the transfer to Bourg - St - Pierre .
A cheaper option is to take the bus from the center of Champex , a short distance further on , but you may have to wait and delay the ascent to the Valsorey hut too much .
Ask for the bus schedule as soon as you can ( or make a plan in advance ) and decide the best option depending on the time you arrive in Champex .
If you arrive in Champex late spend the night in Champex , Orsieres or Bourg - St - Pierre , as the ascent to the Valsorey hut is long ( 4hours ) and can be unsafe in the afternoon heat .
The trail - head to the Valsorey hut is on the main road ( Orsieres Gr- St - Bernarde ) and is sign posted .
If you take a taxi the driver will drop you at the trail head , from Bourg - St - Pierre pass under the main road to gain the Valsorey valley .
Follow the right bank of the Valsorey valley ( to your left ) .
With a long and slowly ascending track pass by Cordonna 1834 m and reach a wide and flat area below Chalet d'Amont 2197 m .
On the right the path to the Velan hut crosses a bridge .
Keep to your left until you enter a narrow gorge at about 2240 m .
Climb the gorge E until you reach easier grounds , turn NE to the Grand - Plans 2501 m and head for the rock spur leading to the Valsorey hut .
Climb right of the spur E a steep slope until it is possible to traverse left to the hut .
From the hut climb NE toward the Grand Combin de Valsorey on moderate slopes at first .
After 200-300 m the slope becomes very steep and it may be difficult to proceed on skis if snow condition is less than perfect .
Slant right E and aim for a point where the snow slope merges with the rocks of the Combin du Valsorey , left of the Col leading to Plateau du Couloir .
Traverse right , just below the rocks , and gain the Plateau left of Point 3664 m ( Bivacco Musso , painted red , is perched on the top of this Point ) .
The final traverse is quite exposed , and rocks and ice surface from the snow , it is best to proceed with rope , axe and crampons .
From the Plateau descend SE on the upper Sonadon Glacier , do not descend too much , make an arch E - SE to reach Col du Sonadon 3504 m with a short climb .
From the col do not attempt a direct descent to the Glacier du Mont Durand , a serac wall bar the way .
From the col you have two options : descend SE and reach a terrace over the icefall , traverse right S to the lower rocks of the Grand Tete de By at 3400 m , traverse S and descend a steep slope to the lower rocks of the Grand Tete de By .
Descend the right side of Glacier du Mont Durand passing near the rocks of Tete Blanche .
Always keep on the right side of the glacier and keep going E and then SE to reach the rocks and the lateral moraine at about 2700 - 2800 m .
Start a slightly rising traverse to a plateau and cross the NE ridge of Mont Avril at the Point 2735 m .
Descend SE and then turn NE to reach the stream somewhere left of pt. 2207 m .
Cross the stream and start the final climb N passing by some chalets to reach the Chanrion hut 2462 m .
There are at least three options to reach the Cabane des Vignettes .
The original route follows the Otemma Glacier all the way to Col de Chermotane .
This is a boring haul up a long and flat glacier , with no downhill skiing , but this is also the shortest and safest option in case of bad weather .
A second route follows the Glacier du Brenay directly to Col du Brenay , and over Pigne d'Arolla .
This route pass a short steep section with possible avalanche risk between the lower rocks of La Serpentine and the icefall of the Glacier du Brenay .
The third route is via Glacier du Brenay , Glacier de la Serpentine , Col de la Serpentine , Col du Brenay and over Pigne d'Arolla .
This is the longest but is a good option to fill a fine day .
Here follows the description of the third option .
From the hut go N traversing the lower slopes of P.te d'Otemma .
When you reach the shoulder turn NE and cross the moraine near pt. 2624 m .
Traverse on a gently rising line and reach the glacier .
Gradually move to the right side of the glacier ( your left ) toward the confluence of the Glacier de la Serpentine .
Turn N and enter Glacier de la Serpentine keeping the crevassed and seracs area to your right .
When you have passed the crevassed area move into the middle of the glacier and aim for Col de la Serpentine 3547 m .
From the col turn E .
You should see the Pigne d'Arolla with its ice dome , but the iced shoulder of the NE ridge of la Serpentine is in the way .
Go over the shoulder and descend SE to Col du Brenay 3639 m .
This traverse is not too steep but is exposed and ice usually surface , consider proceeding with axe and crampons .
Climb NE the easy slope of Pigne d'Arolla to the col 3730 m , and from here to the summit 3796 m .
Return to the col and enjoy the descent E on the wide slope to about 3300 m at about the same level with a serac area to the left .
From this point you have two options :
Traverse left E below the seracs by a narrow passage then turn left N , go over a ridge , Col des Vignettes , turn right E and reach the Cabane des Vignettes 3160 m .
Descend the slope S toward Col de Chermotane , do not reach the col , drop only 150 m and make turn NE , almost a U - turn .
Traverse on a steep slope and reach a saddle leading shortly to Col des Vignettes and the hut .
( There is a line , probably a water pipe , suspended over Col des Vignettes ) .
The Vignettes hut is perched on a cliff high on the abyss below , you wont forget the airy traverse to the toilette .
From the hut go back to Col des Vignettes , go S toward the saddle and traverse on steep slope to Col de Chermotane 3053 m .
Turn SE , go around the north face of Petit M. Collon and aim for Col de L'Eveque , the second saddle right of the prominent piramyd of l'Eveque .
Gain the col by an easy climb 3392 m .
From the col descend E keeping to the right side and aiming for Col Collon , stay to the left of the col , turn NE and go around La Vierge .
Near the base of La Vierge turn E and climb the gentle slopes of the higher basin of Glacier d'Arolla toward Col du M.Brule ' 3213 m .
This col is not an obvious notch and , in bad visibility , will be difficult to locate , from the base of La Vierge the col is due East .
The final slope before the col is steep and is usually climbed on foot .
From the col you have a good view of the next section of the route to Col de Valpelline .
Descend N to the upper basin of Glacier de Tsa de Tsan .
Climb E toward Col de Valpelline 3568 m keeping to the right side of the glacier ( your left ) .
Reaching this col in good weather is the highlight of the tour .
The pyramidal summit of the Dent d'Herens suddenly appears over the snow line , then the sharp summit of the Matterhorn shows up , and the faces of these giants slowly unveils .
The view from Col de Valpelline is one of the best in the Alps and the descent to Zermatt is probably the most spectacular , the shining ice of the north face of Dent d'Herens and the severe west face of the Matterhorn will keep your attention for a long time down .
But do n't forget the crevasses , in bad visibility this descent can be a trap , there are icefalls and plenty of big crevasses along the way .
In good visibility focusing on the route should be enough to avoid troubles .
From the col ski the slopes of the Stockji Glacier NE .
At about 3200 m start a wide turn , SE at first then traverse a plateau S , the north face of the Dent d'Herens should be in front of you .
The plateau ends over a steep slope with seracs on the right side .
Descend the slope , keeping away from the seracs , to get to the Tiefmatten Glacier .
At the end of the steep slope , at about 3000 m turn left E , stay close to the rocks and away from the crevasses on your right .
Continue on safer ground until about 2600 m where you see the Zmutt glacier merging from the left .
Now you have to cross the Zmutt glacier and move to its right side , go E toward the lower slopes of the north face of the Matterhorn .
Make a long diagonal near the right lateral moraine until you see the road to your left at the bottom of the valley .
Follow the road , connecting with a piste , to Furi , and from here to Zermatt by cableway or ski depending on the snow cover .
There are several variants to the classic route , the most popular is the Verbier variation , avoiding the main crux of Plateau du Couloir .
The Grand Lui alternative avoids road transportation adding two days to complete the route .
Day 2 : Cabane du Trient - Champex - Verbier - Cabane du Mont FortDay 3 : Cabane du Mont Fort - Col de la Chaux - Col de Severeu - La Barma - Cabane des DixDay 4 : Cabane des Dix - Pigne d'Arolla - Cabane des VignettesDay 2 : Cabane du Trient - Fenetre de Saleina - Col de Saleina - La FoulyDay 3 : La Fouly - Fenetre de Ferret - Gr.St. Bernard HospiceDay 4 : Gr.St. Bernard Hospice - Col de Prox - Cabane de ValsoreyIf you arrive in Chamonix too late to embarque for the traverse to Cabane du Trient , and you do n't want to spend the night in town , an alternative plan is the following : Day 0 : Argentiere - Grands Montets - Refuge d'ArgentièreDay 1 : Refuge d'Argentière - ChampexDay 2 : Champex - Bourg - St - Pierre - Cabane de ValsoreyThis plan also has the advantage of splitting the long day from Cabane du Trient to Cabane de Valsorey in two .
Another option is to continue the route to Saas Fee traversing Alder Pass from Zermatt .
Or have the leisurely finish you deserve : after a night in Zermatt ( and the first shower in a week ) take the cableway to Kleine Matterhorn , climb Breithorn , enjoy yet another spectacular view , and ski down to Breuil - Cervinia .
Almost all the route is coverd by two 1:50000 sheets of Carte Nationale de la Swiss ( with ski routes ) : Martigny and Arolla .
Mischabel covers the extension to Saas Fee .
New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
A former New Orleans police lieutenant pleaded guilty Wednesday to obstruction of justice in connection with the police shootings of civilians in the days after Hurricane Katrina and court documents unsealed with the plea suggest that other officers will be indicted in the case .
Former Lt. Michael Lohman was convicted of " conspiring with a group of New Orleans police officers to obstruct justice by engaging in a cover -up of the true circumstances surrounding the shooting , by NOPD officers , of a number of individuals , " U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana said at a news conference .
Two civilians were killed and four were wounded in the shootings on the Danziger Bridge on September 4 , 2005 , days after Hurricane Katrina roared ashore on the Gulf Coast .
Read the criminal complaint
The guilty plea does not signal the end of the investigation into the incident , Letten said .
" Know this : the investigation continues , " he said , adding that " this investigation is being conducted very aggressively , but also very fairly . "
The federal indictment unsealed Wednesday signaled that other indictments are likely .
" [ T ] he incident involved at least seven NOPD officers who drove to the Danziger Bridge in a rental truck in response to a call for police assistance , " the indictment said .
CNN New Orleans affiliate WVUE reported that two other officers have received target letters from federal prosecutors .
Such letters are sent to targets of grand jury investigations .
Legal scholars said they expected more indictments in the cover - up of the shooting but that it 's unclear whether any officers will be charged for the shooting itself .
" There 's no evidence the officers shot out of malice , " said Dane Ciolino , a professor at Loyola University New Orleans ' College of Law .
" It was probably negligence , ratcheted up to a federal offense by the cover - up . "
Lohman , the officer who pleaded guilty Wednesday , conspired with other police officers to cover up the shootings even though he believed them to be " legally unjustified , " according to the federal indictment .
Among Lohman 's actions , he fabricated stories , statements , a 17 - page report and a follow - up report , and lied to federal agents , Letten said .
The shootings occurred after several officers , responding to a call for assistance , drove to the bridge and encountered six civilians who were walking across it to get food and supplies , the indictment says .
The officers fired , killing one person -- later identified as 19 - year - old James Brissette -- and wounding four others , according to the indictment .
Witness in 2006 : New Orleans cops shot man in back
Once they reached the other side of the bridge , the officers started shooting again , killing Ronald Madison , a 40 - year - old severely disabled man , the indictment says .
Madison was shot seven times -- five times in the back , the coroner has said .
Lohman arrived on the scene after the shooting , learned that his police colleagues " planned to provide false stories about what had precipitated the shooting " and " encouraged them to do so , " according to the indictment .
Among other things , Lohman did not ensure police collected evidence , suggested that colleagues get rid of some shell casings the shooters had left behind and went along with a plan to plant a gun near the bridge , according to the indictment .
The officers falsely arrested Madison 's brother on eight counts of attempted murder of a police officer , according to the indictment .
Lance Madison was held for weeks before being released without any formal charges filed against him .
State prosecutors pursued criminal charges against several police officers without success .
In August 2008 , a judge quashed indictments against Sgts. Kenneth Bowen and Robert Gisevius Jr. , Officer Anthony Villavaso II and former Officer Robert Faulcon Jr. , all of whom were facing first - degree murder and attempted murder charges .
In addition , he threw out attempted first - degree murder charges against Officers Mike Hunter Jr. and Robert Barrios , and attempted second - degree murder charges against Officer Ignatius Hills .
Federal prosecutors opened an investigation after the judge 's actions .
The failure of the state prosecutors ' strategy is another reason legal scholars say they expect the federal indictments to hinge on the cover - up instead of the shooting itself .
Is it , as President Reagan 's re-election commercial said , " morning in America " ?
Back then it was , but not anymore ; it is economic evening in America as our nation 's spending , government programs and deficits balloon .
The federal deficit this fiscal year will be $ 1.6 trillion , or about 10.6 % of gross domestic product .
That is the largest deficit since World War II , and even President Obama 's optimistic estimates show our deficits will not return to sustainable levels for at least the next decade .
The administration 's projection ...
The National Secular Society said Ms Booth gave an " unjust " sentence
A secularist group has lodged an official complaint against Cherie Booth QC after she spared a man from prison because he was religious .
Shamso Miah , 25 , of Redbridge , east London , broke a man 's jaw following a row in a bank queue .
Sitting as a judge , Ms Booth - wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair - said she would suspend his sentence on the basis of his religious belief .
The National Secular Society claims her attitude was discriminatory and unjust .
' Acceptable behaviour '
Inner London Crown Court heard that Miah , 25 , of Redbridge , east London , went into a bank in East Ham and became embroiled in a dispute with Mohammed Furcan about who was next in the queue .
Miah - who had just been to a mosque - punched Mr Furcan inside the bank , and again outside the building .
Ms Booth told Miah that violence had to be taken seriously , but said she would suspend his prison sentence because he was a religious person and had not been in trouble before .
She added : " You are a religious man and you know this is not acceptable behaviour . "
The National Secular Society has complained to the Office for Judicial Complaints , suggesting that Mrs Blair acted in an unjust and discriminatory way , and suggesting that she might have treated a non-religious person less leniently .
Mars rovers " Spirit " and " Opportunity " were successful beyond NASA 's wildest dreams .
Now they 're building a new , nuclear - powered Mini Cooper - sized rover to be lowered onto Mars by a hovering drop ship in 2013 .
Meet " Curiosity , " the new Mars Science Laboratory .
If we can love cars on Earth , we sure as heck can love them when they 're shot across the cosmos to land on another planet to do some pretty astounding science .
Take a couple minutes to watch the above animation and it becomes abundantly clear NASA is aiming for a whole different level of robotic exploration with its next rover program .
The Mars Science Laboratory program was originally started back in 2003 with an estimated price tag of $ 1.62B , since then it 's undergone delays while new technologies were invented to support the ambitious plans and suffered a major setback when over 1,000 parts were manufactured from substandard titanium .
The current estimated costs for the program is right around $ 2.4B , pocket change .
[ gallery 5474093 ]
Like NASA 's previous missions to Mars , the rover starts out in a pod of sorts and slows in the atmosphere until a parachute can be deployed .
With previous missions the next step was to gently float to the ground or descend inside a big bouncy ball , now NASA 's planning to lower the rover with a drop ship of sorts .
The " sky crane " will make a powered descent and hover as it lowers the rover to the ground via cables .
If all goes as planned , the rover currently nicknamed " Curiosity " will land on Mars sometime in 2013 and it should make a pretty serious impression when it gets there , the beast weighs in at 1,984 lbs .
You 'll notice a distinct lack of solar panels on this beast and that 's because it's , wait for it , nuclear - powered !
It was only a matter of time before the concept in the Ford Nucleon would see the light of day .
Curiosity be the most capable robotic lab ever to examine Mars with several X - Ray spectrometers , a laser - based chemical composition analysis system , abilities to measure local radiation and neutron levels , weather monitoring systems .
Pretty freakin ' cool .

The Nikkei just wiped out all gains for 2010 in a mere 3 hours .
Elsewhere it is not much better : Shanghai down 1.52 % and Hang Seng down 1.63 % at last check .
And speaking of the latter , we were joking earlier that selling breaks all exchanges , but turns out we were right once again .
DJ reports :
The compiler of Hong Kong 's benchmark Hang Seng Index said Friday it is working to fix a glitch that has prevented index data from updating shortly after trading started .
Hang Seng Indexes Co. declined to elaborate on the cause of the error .
Hong Kong stock exchange spokeswoman Lorraine Chan said the bourse has noted the Hang Seng Index has been unable to be updated , and is in contact with the compiler to rectify the problem .
The NKY has now breached the 20 DMA , the 12/22 - 12/24 gap is likely going to be retested very soon .
And here is what happens when all the upside in the market has been on vapors .
When the selling starts ... it really STARTS .
Futures volume today was unprecedented .
Unless the overnight futures brigade manages to decelarte this reversal , it will get very ugly , very fast .
Flyers sign Denis Bodrov ( Photo © khl.ru )
The Philadelphia Flyers signed Denis Bodrov to an AHL deal .
The Russian defenseman was a second round pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft and was released by KHL‘s Atlant Mytischi in November due to bad performances .
“ He has n’t played in about a month , ” GM Holmgren said to philly.com .
“ I do n’t really know the process over there in Russia , but it worked out where he was free to do what he wanted .
He ’s been here the last few days . ”
Bodrov , 23 , started his pro career with Lada Togliatti .
He was drafted by the Flyers after his good performances at 2006 WJC , where he won the silver medal with Team Russia .
He was then traded to Atlant Mytischi after he was rumored to have a bad influence on the team ’s youngest players .
In the Moscow Region team he did n’t manage to play up to the expectation and he was finally released in November .
“ He was a highly thought of defenseman in our system at one time , ” Holmgren said to philly.com .
“ He was on our reserve list .
He ’s not in shape right now .
He needs to get down there and play .
We ’ll see what happens . ”
The move to North America might be a successful change of scenario for the young defenseman , who was very near to sign with the Flyers already on summer 2007 , but then he decided to spend a further year with Lada .

In 2008 , a nice man from PG&E came out to work on my house .
He installed a new body for the gas meter and said someone would come by later to install the electronics module to make it a “ smart meter “ .
Since I work with security for embedded systems , this did n’t sound very exciting .
I read up on smart meters and found they not only broadcast billing information ( something I consider only a small privacy risk ) but also provide remote control .
A software bug , typo at the control center , or hacker could potentially turn off my power and gas .
But how vulnerable was I actually ?
I decided to look into how smart meters work .
Since the electronics module never was installed , I called up various parts supply houses to try to buy one .
They were quite suspicious , requesting company background info and letterhead before deciding if they could send an evaluation sample .
Even though this was long before IOActive outed smart meter flaws to CNN , they had obviously gotten the message that these were n’t just ordinary valves or pipes .
Power , gas , and water meters have a long history of tampering attacks .
People have drilled into them , shorted them out , slowed them down , and rewired them to run backwards .
I do n’t think I need to mention that doing those kinds of things is extremely dangerous and illegal .
This history is probably why the parts supplier was n’t eager to sell any smart meter boards to the public .
There ’s always an easier way .
By analyzing the vendor ’s website , I guessed that they use the same radio module across product lines and other markets would n’t be so paranoid .
Sure enough , the radio module for a water meter made by the same vendor was available on Ebay for $ 30 .
It arrived a few days later .
The case was hard plastic to prevent water damage .
I used a bright light and careful tapping to be sure I was n’t going to cut into anything with the Dremel .
I cut a small window to see inside and identified where else to cut .
I could see some of the radio circuitry and the battery connector .
After more cutting , it appeared that the battery was held against the board by the case and had spring - loaded contacts ( see above ) .
This would probably zeroize the device ’s memory if it was cut open by someone trying to cheat the system .
I applied hot glue to hold the contacts to the board and then cut away the rest of the enclosure .
Inside , the board had a standard MSP430F148 microcontroller and a metal cage with the radio circuitry underneath .
I was in luck .
I had previously obtained all the tools for working with the MSP430 in the Fastrak transponder .
These CPUs are popular in the RFID world because they are very low power .
I used the datasheet to identify the JTAG pinouts on this particular model and found the vendor even provided handy pads for them .
Since the pads matched the standard 0.1 ″ header spacing , I soldered a section of header directly to the board .
For the ground pin , I ran a small wire to an appropriate location found with my multimeter .
Then I added more hot glue to stabilize the header .
I connected the JTAG cable to my programmer .
The moment of truth was at hand — was the lock bit set ?
Not surprisingly ( if you read about the Fastrak project ) , the lock bit was not set and I was able to dump the firmware .
I loaded it into the IDA Pro disassembler via the MSP430 CPU plugin .
The remainder of the work would be to trace the board ’s IO pins to identify how the microcontroller interfaced with the radio and look for protocol handling routines in the firmware to find crypto or other security flaws .
I have n’t had time to complete the firmware analysis yet .
Given the basic crypto flaws in other smart meter firmware ( such as Travis Goodspeed finding a PRNG whose design was probably drawn in crayon ) , I expect there would be other stomach - churning findings in this one .
Not even taking rudimentary measures such as setting the lock bit does not bode well for its security .
I am not against the concept of smart meters .
The remote reading feature could save a lot of money and dog bites with relatively minimal privacy exposure , even if the crypto was weak .
I would be fine if power companies offered an opt - in remote control feature in exchange for lower rates .
Perhaps this feature could be limited to cutting a house ’s power to 2000 watts or something .
However , something as important as turning off power completely should require a truck roll .
A person driving a truck will not turn off the mayor ’s power or hundreds of houses at once without asking questions .
A computer will .
Remote control should not be a mandatory feature bundled with remote reading .
First published in 1995 , Wavelets and Subband Coding offered a unified view of the exciting field of wavelets and their discrete - time cousins , filter banks , or subband coding .
The book developed the theory in both continuous and discrete time , and presented important applications .
During the past decade , it filled a useful need in explaining a new view of signal processing based on flexible time - frequency analysis and its applications .
The book was originally published by Prentice Hall .

FREMONT , Calif . – Labor and community allies are joining with workers at the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. ( NUMMI ) plant as they and their union , United Auto Workers Local 2244 , ratchet up pressure to keep the plant open despite Toyota ’s decision to shut it down in March .
NUMMI , begun as a Toyota - General Motors joint venture in 1984 , employs about 4,700 UAW members and assures an estimated 50,000 more California jobs .
Last year , after bankrupt GM pulled out , Toyota said it would close the plant .
The workers and their allies , including elected officials , have campaigned against the closing ever since .
Many unions showed their support at a spirited rally Feb. 12 at union headquarters , across the street from the plant .
Local 2244 president Sergio Santos drew resounding applause when he told the crowd , “ We want the company to review and reverse their decision to close our factory ! ” California Labor Federation head Art Pulaski got the hall chanting , “ Stop your plan to close us down , do n’t be the bad guys in this town . ”
AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka , snowed in on the East Coast , told the rally by video , “ Toyota betrays American workers … Toyota – do not kill American jobs . ”
Calling Toyota the most popular car brand in California , Trumka drew cheers as he warned , “ Toyota should n’t think they can destroy our jobs and communities and then sell us their cars . ”
State Treasurer Bill Lockyer wondered out loud why , among Toyota ’s many plants , they chose to close the one with a unionized work force .
Then he pounced : “ That ’s why this is a national issue ! ”
Noting that Toyota used to be known for loyalty to its workers and for a quality product , UAW National Vice President Bob King said the new management has “ lost its way , ” as shown by the closure , the safety recall , and the apologies of Mr. Toyota himself .
“ If they close the Fremont NUMMI facility , ” he thundered , “ we will not buy another Toyota . ”
“ We Teamsters know how to boycott , ” declared Rome Aloise , Western Vice President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters .
“ We ’ll show you how to shut this company down …
It ’s not too late to save this plant .
We ’re with you ! ”
Since California is a big market for Toyota , the fightback was projected as both a boycott and public awareness - raising .
Foreshadowing coming actions at dealerships , Bargaining Chair Javier Contreras confidently predicted , “ We ’re going to make ‘em call the corporation and say ‘ why do n’t you get these guys outta my front yard ? ' ”
The very next day , union members gathered at Toyota ’s dealership on Oakland ’s Oakport Street , holding banners reading , “ Toyota - Lexus : A Danger to California , ” and “ Toyota – Killing California Jobs .
Theirs was among 14 boycott demonstrations at area dealerships .
“ We ’re here to get the support of fellow Americans to keep that plant open , ” Javier Contreras Jr. said .
He said the dealership had sold no cars that day , and told of getting a call saying “ their manager ’s pretty upset right now . ”
Earlier , police , summoned to dislodge the workers , determined they were on public land and had the right to stay .
Contreras Jr. said NUMMI workers had not been offered jobs at other Toyota plants .
Everyone agreed that it was no accident that NUMMI , Toyota ’s only unionized plant , was being targeted for harsh treatment .
Communications Workers of America Local 9412 leaders Cookie Cameron and Keith Gibbs were out in support of their “ brothers and sisters ” at NUMMI .
They related how the UAW supported them in their recent dispute with AT&T , and emphasized that everyone will lose if NUMMI is shuttered .
The UAW and its allies plan to demonstrate at dealerships every day .

A trio of white knights look set to assume control of iconic Melbourne rock pub The Tote , which was scheduled to close its doors for the last time today due to a combination of liquor licensing requirements and fees .
A trio of white knights look set to assume control of iconic Melbourne rock pub The Tote , which was scheduled to close its doors for the last time today .
In a prima facie offer posted late this morning on music website Mess and Noise , the current proprietors of The Old Bar , and the former managers of After Dark in High Street Thornbury , wrote of their willingness to assume the licence , following a public plea from current proprietor Bruce Milne .
“ Joel [ Morrison ] , Singa [ Unlayiti ] and myself would dearly love to sit down with you at some point and talk about this further .
As you know we are running a very similar venue ( although on a smaller scale ) with very similar licensing .
“ I think that if there is a baton to be passed along that the three of us would consider ourselves a sincere and reasonable group of guys to accept responsibility of The Tote , ” wrote Liam Matthews on the online forum .
Milne responded minutes later :
You guys would run it with the love and respect it deserves .
If you can find a way , I ’m there for you .
Milne , a stalwart of the Melbourne music scene , had previously spruiked for a new licensee to keep the venue open :
Thanks for signing up
We look forward to seeing you bright and early with your need - to - know talking points and tidbits for the day ahead .

If someone can work out a way to keep the place open and deal with liquor licensing , I will work with them to make it happen .
But it needs to be the Tote , not some lame - o version .
Milne told Crikey that he would be “ happy ” if the trio took over the venue but that it would need to be removed from the “ high - risk ” category that has led to liquor licensing fees and compliance costs skyrocketing .
In an article in this morning ’s Australian Financial Review , The Tote ’s millionaire landlord , Computershare mogul Chris Morris , said he was happy to keep the venue running under a new licensee .
Matthews told Crikey he had contacted Morris but was yet to receive a response and a jump in running costs could still see the doors closed for some time yet .
An increase in liquor licensing fees of about $ 1600 was dwarfed by a requirement in Milne ’s licence to have two security guards stationed at the Tote ’s doors at all times — a near - doubling of his current annual expenses of $ 60,000 .
This came on top of the installation of “ quality ” CCTV cameras .
Attending the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal to revert the licence away from the high - risk category would slug Milne with about $ 15,000 in lawyers ’ fees .
The “ high - risk ” ruling puts the venue in the same category as several King Street nightclubs , leading to calls for a more nuanced approach from Liquor Licensing Commissioner Sue McLennan .
McLennan used the Herald Sun yesterday to defend her organisation against allegations of inflexibility .
And to add the burden on the much loved venue , which is believed to have been skirting close to the red for years , Crikey can reveal that Milne was also the victim of booze deal gone wrong at the hands of the Blueprint music festival .
Last year The Tote sold about $ 75,000 worth of beer to the festival , which later collapsed owing creditors hundreds of thousands of dollars , despite performance agreements with high - profile artists including Tim Rogers and Bertie Blackman .
Under a deal struck with Carlton and United Breweries , Milne told Crikey he is required to pay $ 500 a week to the brewery , and that while it was n’t the main reason for shutting up shop , did n’t help the venue ’s bottom line as he battled to keep it afloat .
It was contributing factor , especially in terms of fighting against liquor licensing .
$ 500 a week is not insubstantial to a business the size of the Tote .
According to Ararat farmer David Powne , who hosted the festival , about 50 slabs of beer were stolen from a paddock at the festival site , with the Tote denied any of the proceeds from festival sales .
Some of the beer made it back to Melbourne , while other slabs were allegedly sold by the festival ’s organisers to a local supermarket to recoup costs .
Blueprint organisers Tristan and Aaron Grey went to ground after the festival ’s demise in October , leaving a trail of angry creditors .
Cheques issued by the brothers bounced despite claims that the festival was underwritten by their mother .
Yesterday , about 2000
Tote defenders protested in support of the beleaguered venue , which has launched the career of countless up - and - coming bands .
City of Yarra councillor Steve Jolly and comedian Rod Quantock addressed the crowd , which was overseen by a police special response unit .
Curiously , no appearances were made by local Greens representatives , who are believed to be backing McLennan in her ruling on the Tote ’s future .
Greens Victorian upper house member Colleen Hartland has been vocal in her support for the commission ’s crackdown on late - night venues in state parliament .
Today , in a last hurrah for Milne , 25 bands will perform across the pub in a 12 - hour rock marathon , simulcast live on community radio .
The North American Forum on Integration ( NAFI ) was created in 2002 , and is one of many think tanks pushing for closer continental ties .
In 2005 , NAFI organized the Triumvirate , a North American model parliament which meets once a year .
The exercise brings together university students from the U.S. , Mexico and Canada with participants assigned the roles of legislators , journalists or lobbyists .
Over the years , the mock parliament has debated and drafted resolutions on such key issues as trade corridors , immigration , NAFTA �fs Chapter 11 , along with the creation of a North American investment fund and a customs union .
Infowars reported that last year�fs Triumvirate gathering was cancelled due to the swine flu pandemic scare .
The Triumvirate 2010 will be held in Querétaro , Mexico .
A description on its website states that " This 5th edition will gather a hundred university students from Mexico , the United States and Canada to participate , from May 30th to June 4th , 2010 , in an international negotiation exercise in which they will simulate a parliamentary meeting . "
Some of the main objectives of the Triumvirate event include , " To allow participants to familiarize themselves with the functioning of democratic institutions as well as North American political , economic , environmental and social realities ; to develop the participants ' sense of belonging to North America ( and ) to increase intercultural exchanges and promote the creation of academia networks . "
This year�fs delegates will address such topics as making smart borders more efficient , managing transboundary water in North America , as well as countering human trafficking and consolidating North American governance .
While the model legislature is seen as an opportunity for students to better understand the political process and the challenges facing the continent , in many ways it mirrors actual efforts to further integrate the three countries .
This includes the vision of a real functioning North American parliament similar to the European Union ( EU ) model .
In a 2008 article , journalist Steve Watson described the mock parliament as , " another example of an overarching movement on behalf of globalist business leaders and politicians to merge the three nations of North America into an EU like federation . "
He added that , " Integration meetings such as the NAFI Triumvirate are simulations of the exact practices currently being undertaken by the SPP and its offshoot organizations .
The NAFI Triumvirate is designed to familiarize ' future Canadian , American and Mexican leaders ' with the processes involved in such practices . "
Watson also pointed out that missing from the whole activity is any simulated opposition to the agenda being presented .
The reality is that not all issues need to be addressed in a bilateral , trilateral or global fashion as some are best solved at a local , state and national level .
It is important to learn about other countries and instill a sense of cooperation , but the Triumvirate exercise appears to be aimed at indoctrinating students to view themselves as North American citizens as opposed to Americans , Canadians or Mexicans .

Many of the recommendations from the 2005 report , Building a North American Community became part of the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) agenda and the push for deep integration .
The policy paper advocated the creation of a network of centers for North American studies .
It recommended that , " the three governments open a competition and provide grants to universities in each of the three countries to promote courses , education and research on North America and assist elementary and secondary schools in teaching about North America . "
The report also recommended developing , " teacher exchange training programs for elementary and secondary school teachers .
This would assist in removing language barriers and give some students a greater sense of a North American identity . "
In his article The Future of North America , Robert Pastor , one of the leading proponents of continental integration proclaimed , " To educate a new generation of students to think North American , each country should begin by supporting a dozen centers for North American studies .
Each center should educate students , undertake research , and foster exchanges with other North American universities for both students and faculty . "
The Center for North American Studies at American University in Washington , D.C. " was established to educate a new generation of students , to promote policy debate among the governments and the public , and to undertake research on ideas for a continental future . "
Arizona State University has also created the North American Center for Transborder Studies whose mission , " is to advance greater understanding of border and trilateral issues in North America by supporting scholars who contribute to the development of innovative theory and actionable policy analysis regarding these issues . "
The North American Integration and Development Center based at the University of California , Los Angeles , " seeks to build linkages among a wide variety of institutions , organizations , and community groups in order to promote North American integration . "
These various centers , along with other initiatives are part of the ongoing efforts to further condition and train a new generation into accepting a North American consciousness .
The ideology of globalization is deeply embedded in the corporate structure , mass media , government , as well as in the whole educational system .
Together they are working to shape the minds of the next generation .
Students at all levels are being indoctrinated to conform to universal values and standards .
Under a new global order , there is no room for nationalism or individuality .
Increasingly , it is special interest groups , multinational corporations , think tanks , and other nongovernmental organizations who are pulling the strings of power .
National sovereignty remains one of the last obstacles to the full implementation of a North American Union and global government .

While neither same - sex marriage nor civil unions are recognized in the Philippines , a recently introduced bill would further punish anyone attempting to enter into such a union , describing gay marriage as “ highly immoral , scandalous and detestable . ”
The bill recommends penalties both for the applicants for marriage and the solemnizing officer .
Under the bill , the would - be partners face 15 years imprisonment and a P150,000 fine .
Likewise , anybody caught faking or trying to mis-declare his / her gender in order to secure a marriage license may be meted a 12 - year jail term and a P100,000 fine .
If the offender is a public officer or employee , he / she shall be dismissed from government service and banned from re-employment in any public office .
Former Baptist minister turned lawmaker Bienvenido Abante Jr. introduced the bill last December saying that without the measure same sex unions would “ snap the remaining strand of our moral values . ”
When serving as chairman of the Human Rights committee back in 2006 Abante rejected a bill prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity , calling it a “ culture of death ” and reverse discrimination against heterosexuals .
Really .
My husband who was born and raised in the Philippines chimes in …
Why am I not surprised about this , especially coming from a very religious country like the Philippines .
This is just another example of the power and control organized religion has in poor countries like this one .
It is safe to conclude that Bienvenido Abante , Jr. has the strong backing of the church , so I am not at all surprised with what he is doing right now .
It is sad if not laughable to have him as the chairman of the Human Rights committee .
Seriously , how can you be the chairman of the Human Rights committee and try to pass a bill that violates the core meaning of your position .
Really , can somebody please tell this man what his job is all about ?
I believe that it is inhumane to discriminate against another group of people just because of their sexual orientation and I think this is a reaction to what is going on in Western countires like the United States .
I hope that the Filipino people , and not only the LGBT pinoys , will wake up and rise up against this reprehensible bill .

LEGITIMATE USE : Hamilton 's Diane Ratana shows the full copy of her Maori Traveller 's Permit which she used to change the ownership of her vehicle at Chartwell .
Inset : The Maori Traveller 's Permit of Hamilton man Kereama Tawha - Paraha .
A Maori sovereignty group insists a Maori Traveller 's Permit is legitimate despite one of their members being arrested when he used it in Hamilton on Monday night .
And they say their case has been strengthened by the fact that a NZ Post Shop yesterday accepted the permit as identification when a member changed the ownership of a vehicle .
Members of the Te Akaimapuhia Maori Incorporation , formed about two years ago , deny that the permits are illegal .
One of their members , Wiremu Peihopa , also known as Billy Griffith , was arrested by police on Monday night after producing his Maori Traveller 's Permit as his driver 's licence .
Police say he presented false information to them and will be disqualified from driving .
Fellow members and Fairfield neighbours Kereama Tawha - Paraha and Diane Ratana said Mr Peihopa 's arrest was nothing short of harassment and they deny they 're activists .
" We have been harassed by them many times , " Mrs Ratana said .
" The whole group do because of us stating who we are .
We should be free to travel on this land because we are Maori .
" These things got taken away from us a long time ago by the white settlers . "
Neighbour Patsy Hynes said Mr Peihopa simply used Wiremu as the Maori equivalent of his first name and was using his mother 's name instead of his father 's name , Griffith .
Mr Tawha - Paraha , who has also been arrested for producing his traveller 's permit , disputed police views the permits were illegal and would support Mr Peihopa .
The incorporation operated under the Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 , which it believed authorised it to create laws , statutes , regulations or place limitations on existing laws within its own native districts .
Mrs Ratana said their case was further cemented when she used her permit to change the ownership of her vehicle at the Chartwell NZ Post shop yesterday .
She said the attendant checked with management , who accepted it as a valid identification .
Police said the licences were illegal and warned against their use .
" People knowingly using these documents need to realise they face serious consequences while people that are duped into paying for passports , residency permits or driver 's licences have been taken advantage of and should contact police , " Senior Sergeant Kent Holdsworth said .

The Austrian extreme sportsman Felix Baumgartner says his next goal is to try to break the long - standing record for the highest ever parachute jump .
It is 50 years since the American Joe Kittinger made history by leaping from a balloon at 102,800 ft ( 31 km ) .
Many have sought to repeat the feat down the decades but all have failed .
Baumgartner , who is famous for stunts such as jumping off the Petronas Towers , aims to skydive from a balloon sent to at least 120,000 ft ( 37 km ) .
It is likely that in his long freefall of more than five minutes , he will exceed the speed of sound - the first person to do so without the aid of a machine .
" No - one really knows what that will be like , " he said .
" The fact is you have a lot of different airflows coming around your body ; and some parts of your body are in supersonic flow and some parts are in transonic flow .
What kind of reaction that creates , I can't tell you , " he told BBC News .
Felix Baumgartner 's base - jumping has not always pleased the authorities
Baumgartner and his supporters claim the project will gather scientific data also about the stratosphere and how the body copes with the extreme conditions so high above the Earth 's surface .
The most recent attempt to try to better Kittinger 's mark was made in 2008 by the Frenchman Michel Fournier .
Joe Kittinger made his leap before the first American went into space
The former paratrooper and adventurer had spent years preparing for " Le Grand Saut " , or Big Jump , only to see his balloon break free and float off into the sky just as he was about to climb inside the ascent capsule .
Baumgartner has frequently incurred the ire of the authorities because of his base - jumping - the highly dangerous practice of parachuting from buildings .
He also made headlines in 2003 when he crossed the English Channel on a carbon wing strapped to his back .
His assault on Kittinger 's record is likely to take place later this year over an as yet unnamed location in North America .
He will ascend to the stratosphere in a pressurized capsule attached to a 450 ft - high ( 140 m ) helium balloon , and then jump out at an altitude he hopes will exceed 120,000 ft . .
He will be wearing a specially modified full - pressure suit and helmet .
The organisers of the project called Red Bull Stratos say , if all goes well , he should break the speed of sound about 35 seconds into his descent .
Joe Kittinger 's 16 August 1960 jump was an extraordinary achievement .
It was made nine months before Alan Shepard was even launched on the first American sub-orbital space trip .
Kittinger experienced intense swelling in his right hand as his glove malfunctioned and his body reacted to the low pressure at high altitude .
" I was headed back down to a friendly Earth , " he recalls .
" It 's extremely hostile up there and the further you fall , the friendlier it is , " the retired USAF colonel told the BBC .
He is now supporting the Austrian in his endeavour .
As well as coping with freezing temperatures and ultra - thin air , a key objective for Baumgartner must be to try to maintain a good attitude during the descent and prevent his body from going into a spin and blacking out .
Baumgartner acknowledges the risks of breaking the sound barrier
If he does go into a spin , it is unlikely , he says , he will be able to correct it .
In any case , his chute will be automatically deployed if he is unconscious .
Baumgartner has an eye on the benefits he believes can accrue to space exploration , making it possible to bring astronauts back to Earth alive if their vehicle malfunctions .
" We want to prove a human person - if they have to bail out of a capsule from 120,000 ft - can come back safely to Earth , " he explained .
Michel Fournier has promised to make another attempt in 2010 also , if he can secure the funding .
A BBC / National Geographic Channel documentary is being made about Baumgartner 's project .
The 90 - minute film will be transmitted on BBC Two in the UK shortly after the jump .

Proudhon Reader
Selected Writings
Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations
Iain McKay , principal author of An Anarchist FAQ , has edited a newto be published by AK Press later this year .
This is the first serious attempt at a Proudhon anthology since Stewart's , and far superior in both organization and extent .
Unlike Stewart 's selections , McKay's are organized according to work and excerpted at length , functioning more like a collection of abridged texts as opposed to Stewart 's approach of organizing snippets into a sort of anarchistic .
The generous range of materials includes a lot of newly translated stuff , some of it by Shawn Wilbur of Corvus Editions .
The table of contents can be found here , and an extended introduction here
If you are looking for an excuse to pick up a roasted duck , I can't think of a better one than Sunday 's celebration of the Chinese Lunar New Year .
Here is a recipe from Helen Chen 's newly released Easy Asian Noodles that makes great use of a whole roasted duck , Cantonese Roast Duck Soup Noodles .
This easy - to - assemble soup starts out with chicken broth , either homemade or store brought , that is enriched with ginger and rice wine ; then , in go the greens , duck , and noodles .
The real flavor here comes from the sweet and savory roasted duck , with all of its wonderfully fatty meat .
This soup might not be complicated but it's a wonderful warming bowl , and a low - key way to celebrate the Chinese New Year .
The rules are filled with odd contradictions .
Lobbyists themselves are not allowed to pay for trips , but their corporate clients can .
And lobbyists are permitted to give huge sums to nonprofit groups that can sponsor travel .
They can also travel to destinations and meet the lawmakers once they get there , though they can not go on the same plane .
Seizing on the loopholes , lobbyists and the companies that employ them are still underwriting trips by dozens of members of Congress , particularly those in the House , the Times review shows .
The companies finance much of this travel indirectly , getting around the spirit of the rules by giving money to nonprofits , some of which seem to exist largely to sponsor trips .
In fact , the rules may have had the unexpected effect of obscuring who is actually paying for a lawmaker ’s junket .
“ If a nonprofit group is essentially just being used as a pass - through entity for corporate players that otherwise could not sponsor an event , that is a fraud and that is not allowed , ” said Representative Zoe Lofgren , the California Democrat who leads the House ethics committee .
The rules have had some real impact .
Privately financed travel for members of the House has dropped to fewer than 400 trips in the first 10 months of this year , compared with 1,100 in the same period in 2005 .
The drop in Senate travel has been even greater : Senators took just 24 trips in the first 10 months of this year , compared with 189 in the same period in 2005 .
Democrats and Republicans traveled proportionate to their numbers in Congress .
The universe of regular sponsors has been reduced to fewer than a dozen big foundations and associations , the Times analysis shows .
Many of the trips are sponsored by organizations with ideological and policy agendas , rather than commercial interests .
Most of those rely , at least in part , on corporate financing to underwrite trips for lawmakers .
Their internal policies vary widely in how they seek to insulate the trips from corporate influence .
The Aspen Institute , for instance , tries to block corporate influence - peddling by barring lobbyists from its events and declining corporate contributions for the trips , a spokesman said .
But not all groups are as strict .
Some nonprofits take money from major corporations with lobbyists , like Lockheed Martin , the defense contractor , Eli Lilly , the drug company , and Volkswagen , the automaker , to sponsor events for lawmakers during the trips .
A court in Saudi Arabia has sentenced a man to 120 lashes for having six wives at the same time .
Muslim men can keep up to four wives at a time under sharia , or Islamic law , which is applied in Saudi Arabia .
Reports say the unnamed man worked for the country 's religious police .
At his trial , the defendant claimed he did not know he was breaking the law .
The man was also banned from leading prayers and ordered to read two chapters of the Koran .
Islam permits polygamy for men on condition that wives are treated equally .
The case was tried in a court in the southern province of Jizan .
Religious police
Reports said that the accused was a member of the 5,000 - strong Saudi Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice .
The committee , known as the Mutawa , enforces the kingdom 's strict interpretation of Islam , particularly regarding relations between the sexes .
But a court official speaking to Reuters news agency said the man held only an administrative post there .
Correspondents say the case is one of a string of abuses by the religious police that have been exposed by the Saudi media .
In a move seen as an attempt to rein in the Mutawa , in February 2009 , Saudi 's King Abdullah replaced the head of the organisation .
In 2007 the Mutawa were banned from detaining suspects after the force came under criticism for overzealous behaviour after recent deaths in custody .
In 2002 the religious police allegedly stopped schoolgirls from leaving a blazing building because they were not wearing correct Islamic dress .
More than 100 searchers scoured the rugged desert near the Superstition Mountains east of Phoenix on Saturday looking for a Denver man who disappeared on a quest to find the fabled Lost Dutchman gold mine .
Jesse Capen , 35 , disappeared sometime after Nov. 22 when he drove in his Jeep to Apache Junction , east of Phoenix , to begin searching for the rich mine , said his mother , Cynthia Burnett , 60 .
He had planned to return to Denver in time for Christmas , but he either walked away or was taken from his campsite , and his whereabouts remain a mystery .
He could have been bitten by a rattlesnake , shot by another prospector or fallen and broken his leg and been devoured by a bear , Burnett said .
“ Deputies suspect foul play may be involved because there is no sign of him , ” she said .
“ Even if he would have been eaten by wild animals , there would be shoes and clothes left behind . ”
Hikers on Dec. 20 discovered Capen ’s white Jeep at a campsite near Old Tortilla Ranch , where they also found his wallet , backpack , cellular phone , camera , binoculars , sleeping bag , food and water inside a tent , Burnett said .
A team of searchers organized by the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office using dogs covered a 10 - mile radius around the tent on Dec. 23 , but found no trace of him in gullies or canyons .
Spelunkers crawled through all known caves in the area .
Helicopters , airplanes , dogs , volunteers and rescue workers tried again Saturday in a widespread ground and air search , one of many organized during the past several weeks , said sheriff ’s Deputy Don Roughan .
“ There have been no clues found , ” Roughan said Saturday .
“ It ’s a pretty desolate area .
It looks like you stepped on the moon . ”
Capen , who had never married , worked a graveyard shift as a bellhop at the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel the past 11 years .
For 10 years , he spent his free time studying the legend of the Lost Dutchman mine .
“ This is beyond obsessed , ” Burnett said .
“ He has more than 100 books and maps on the legend .
This was like research for a Ph.D.
This is a classic case of a man ’s search for treasure . ”
Capen planned to spend a month searching for the gold mine .
He had been there before to search .
Thousands of others have searched in the Superstition Mountains looking for the mine during the past 140 years .
In the 1840s , the Peralta family of Mexico mined gold out of the mountains , but Apaches attacked and killed all but one or two family members as they took the gold back to Mexico .
In the 1870s , Jacob Waltz — nicknamed “ the Dutchman , ” even though he was a native of Germany — rediscovered the mine with the help of a Peralta descendant , according to legend .
Violence has always been linked to the search for the mine .
Waltz reportedly shot people who followed him whenever he ran out of money and returned to the mine for more gold .
He died without revealing the location of the mine .
Movies have recounted the popular tale .
Authorities have found skulls of prospectors with bullet holes in the Superstitions .
While searching for Capen , Maricopa County sheriff ’s deputies came across two prospectors armed with handguns in the desert , Burnett said .
The deputies took the guns from the men to test them to see whether they had recently been fired , she said .
Burnett said her son probably should n’t have gone there unarmed , but he was a trusting “ gentle giant , ” standing 6 - foot - 4 and weighing well over 200 pounds .
After her son went missing , Burnett said , she searched through his apartment for clues about where he may have gone and found maps of the Superstition Mountains and stacks of books on the Lost Dutchman legend .
“ My best guess is that he fell and injured himself somewhere and could n’t get up , ” Burnett said .
Injured , he would have been easy prey for a bear or a mountain lion , she said .
“ I tried to give him my bear spray , ” Burnett said .

Credit goes to Jeff2009 over at the Malaysia Nerf Forum for first discovering this new Nerf product over in Malaysia ( He does n't have a validated NerfHaven account yet so i'm helping him announce it to the NIC , i managed to take a drive across the border today and returned back to Singapore with a few sets to do a full review ) .-- Check out the newYes , this is a reflex sight ... and the best part is , unlike the non-functional longshot scope or tactical scope , the Pinpoint Sight actually has a The Pinpoint Sight is powered by 2 x AAA batteries and comes packaged with 10 x Micro foam darts .
Reflex sights are typically non-magnified optical sights that reflect a reticle image onto a combining glass for superimposition on the target .
They are commonly used to aid in quick close quarter target acquisition and due to the long eye relief distance design , can be aimed at arm 's length withThe Nerf Pinpoint Sight now offers similiar quick aiming capability in a N - Strike Mission Kit !
Of course , compared to real reflex sights , the Nerf Pinpoint Sight does n't have any of the fancy lenses , fibre optics , tritium capsules or fine tuned calibrations and adjustments etc , but it does provide an interesting way to mount an alternativefor Nerf blasters ... and anyways , it just looks cool !
Keep a lookout for the , hopefully reaching your nearby stores soon !
Cheers !

WASHINGTON — Democrats , stung by criticism of their $ 787 billion economic - stimulus plan , are targeting Republicans who have attacked the program and then lobbied to get money for their districts .
More than a dozen Republican lawmakers supported stimulus - funding requests submitted to the Department of Labor , the Environmental Protection Agency and the Forest Service , in letters obtained by The Wall Street Journal through the Freedom of Information Act .
The stimulus package passed last February with no Republican votes in the House of Representatives .
In the Senate , just three Republicans supported it : Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , who later switched to the Democratic Party .
Lawmakers routinely send letters in support of federal funding for projects in their constituencies ; some Republican lawmakers have deliberately avoided sending requests for stimulus dollars because of their opposition to the bill .
Rep . Paul Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican who called the stimulus a " wasteful spending spree " that " misses the mark on all counts , " wrote to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis in October in support of a grant application from a group in his district which , he said , " intends to place 1,000 workers in green jobs . "
A spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan said the congressman felt it was his job to provide " the basic constituent service of lending his assistance for federal grant requests . "
The First Space Boat Does n’t Look Like A Boat At All
If Dr Ellen Stofan – team leader of the TiME mission – has her way , this will be the first nautical ship to sail across waters outside of planet Earth .
Its name is the Titan Mare Explorer .
If approved by NASA , the $ US425 million space boat would be launched in January 2016 , water landing on the Saturn ’s moon in June 2023 .
It would study the Ligeia Mare or the Kraken mare , located in the north hemisphere of Titan .
Scientists believe that these huge lakes are composed of liquid methane , ethane or a mix of both hydrocarbons .
While these highly - flammable components are not stable under Earth ’s conditions , they are stable liquids under Titan ’s − 179C .
The obvious objective would be to identify the precise components of these seas , their depth and physical features .
Then , the space boat has a little nuclear device that would set the lakes on fire , causing a chain reaction that would make the planet explode , pushing Saturn out of its orbit , which in turn would make it to collide with Jupiter , which will finally gain enough mass to ignite a fusion process , creating a star that would finally make Europa an habitable planet , so it can hold life forms that listen to Abba , drink lots of wine and eat tapas at bars .
OK , maybe it wo n’t do the last thing , but that ’s what I would like to see .

In order to force a change in the law , last month a man reported himself for breaching copyright more than a hundred times , hoping an anti-piracy group would take him to court .
The group 's lawyer said they would respond by today - they have n't - so the Danish copyfighter is now reporting himself to the police .
At the end of October , a Danish citizen took drastic action to draw attention to some restrictive and seemingly contradictory copyright legislation .
Henrik Anderson told TorrentFreak that in order to force his government ’s hand on laws which allow him to copy DVDs for his own personal use , but forbid him to remove the DRM in order to do so , he decided to turn himself in .
Henrik informed the Danish anti-piracy outfit Antipiratgruppen that he had broken the DRM on more than one hundred legally - purchased DVD movies and TV shows for use on his home media center , an act forbidden – but seemingly also allowed – under Danish laws , both detailed below ;
12 . –(1 ) Anyone is entitled to make or have made , for private purposes , single copies of works which have been made public if this is not done for commercial purposes .
Such copies must not be used for any other purpose .
§ 75 c . It is not permitted without the consent of the rightholder to make circumvention of effective technological measures
“ I ’ve started this because I do n’t want to be a criminal , ” Henrik told us , in his own similarly and deliberately contradictory way , noting that he ’d requested a response from the group by today , December 1st 2009 , indicating whether or not they intend to prosecute him .
However , in the period up to today , Henrik heard nothing from Antipiratgruppen , although their lawyer Thomas Schlüter did speak to the Danish press , saying that it was a political matter but had nevertheless reported the issue to the Association of Danish Videodistributors for consideration .
In response , their chairman , Poul Dylov , said they would have a meeting to decide whether to report the matter to the police .
Antipiratgruppen said it would reply to Henrik by they date he requested .
It seems they have broken their promise .
“ Today was the last chance for the anti-piracy group to come up with an answer , ” Henrik told Torrent Freak a few minutes ago .
“ And although , as you know , they told the press that they would give me an answer before the 1st of December , they have not done that . ”
Henrik told us that even though he has broken the law , Antipiratgruppen does n’t seem interested in responding .
“ They are obviously aware that there will be an outrage if they reported me to the police , ” he points out .
The other possibility , he says , is that Antipiratgruppen themselves do n’t see his actions as illegal – but this creates another problem .
The Ministry of Culture have already written to Henrik informing him that breaking DRM in this way is against the law .
Clearly frustrated , Henrik told us : “ But who should I follow ?
Those that determine the laws in this country ?
Or those who are lawyers for the companies that i’m committing a crime against ? ”
But Henrik has a solution to their inaction .
“ I decided to try to see if I can report myself directly to the police , for the case must be resolved , ” he told us .
Henrik feels that the situation he is trying to draw attention to can only be solved by him going to trial .
Hopefully then the Minister for Culture and the Danish parliament will see that the law has to be changed .
November 6 , 2009
When voters get the chance to ratify the status quo or " throw the bums out , " it does n't matter that the Republicans ' policies are disastrous for working people .
The Democratic bums get tossed out just the same .
THERE ARE two wrong interpretations of the November 3 election results circulating in the political establishment and among its chatterers .
One interpretation , the one coming from the White House , says they do n't matter at all .
The other , coming mainly from the Republican Party and the likes of Glenn Beck , holds that the elections were a sharp repudiation of Barack Obama 's " big government " agenda and a signal that Americans are ready to embrace the right wing again .
Let 's take the second one first .
Are the conservatives ' biggest gains -- a sweep of top statewide offices in Virginia , the governorship of New Jersey , and repealing gay marriage in Maine - - a sign that the right is back in the saddle again ?
Before the Republicans spins themselves back into the Congressional majority in 2010 and the White House in 2012 ( President Palin ? ) , it 's worth remembering that the president 's party has lost the Virginia governor 's race for nine straight elections now .
And as for the results of odd - year elections before congressional midterms predicting the results the following year , that 's only been true about half of the time in recent history .
They 're as accurate as a coin flip .
Columnist : Lance Selfa Lance Selfa is the author of The Democrats : A Critical History , a socialist analysis of the Democratic Party , and editor of The Struggle for Palestine , a collection of essays by leading solidarity activists .
He is on the editorial board of the International Socialist Review .
Second , while the winning Republican candidates -- Bob McDonnell in Virginia and Chris Christie in New Jersey -- are standard - issue conservatives , they did n't highlight right - wing ideology in their campaigns .
McDonnell successfully camouflaged his hard Christian Right beliefs by emphasizing local issues , such as Virginia 's chronic underinvestment in infrastructure .
In New Jersey , for most of the campaign against Democrat Jon Corzine , Christie coasted , assuming Corzine 's unpopularity would carry him to victory .
Eventually , it did .
And as the campaign descended into a mudslinging contest , Christie continued to speak in platitudes .
In the end , New Jersey voters tossed out Corzine , but they left the New Jersey state assembly with a virtually unchanged Democratic majority .
IF THE Republican wins in Virginia and New Jersey were n't that surprising , the Democratic victory in the congressional special election in New York 's 23rd district was more of a shocker .
For the first time since 1872 , a Democrat will represent this large , mostly rural district running across the northernmost part of the state .
From a purely electoral point of view , this has to be considered a major defeat for conservatives , who turned this race into a battle for the soul of the Republicans .
For weeks , members of the right - wing menagerie -- from Fox News to Sarah Palin to the Tea - Party Patriots -- championed the candidate of the third - party Conservatives , Douglas Hoffman , as the great hope against the mainstream Republican , Dede Scozzafava .
They succeeded in forcing Scozzafava out of the race .
But while the conservatives were busy high - fiving themselves , the Democrat Owen won .
The Tea Partiers took the defeat in stride , with Palin declaring : " The race for New York 's 23rd District is not over , just postponed until 2010 .
The issues of this election have always centered on the economy -- on the need for fiscal restraint , smaller government and policies that encourage jobs .
In 2010 , these issues will be even more crucial to the electorate . "
Hoffman , a robotic reciter of Ayn Rand - style talking points , lost in large part because Palin 's " issues of this election " had no bearing on the concerns of people in the 23rd district .
If it can't win in a longtime Republican district in New York , will the pure free - market ideology that Hoffman and his Tea Party crew are pushing sell in the country as a whole ?
Here , the right wing might want to pause before breaking out the champagne .
One of the lesser - reported stories of the 2009 election was the results of bond issues and other referenda in different parts of the country .
According to one election - night report , 10 of the largest 12 bond issues -- ballot measures that get voters approval to borrow funds to build hospitals , schools and infrastructure -- passed .
And two right wing - sponsored " taxpayer bill of rights " referenda lost in Washington and Maine .
Despite the discontent resulting from the current economic crisis , the right wing 's tax - cutting , government - slashing message has yet to recover its force .
The Tea Partiers are still appealing only to a minority of a minority .
DESPITE THIS , however , the White House and Democrats would be kidding themselves if they really thought the defeats in this election are nothing for them to be concerned about .
Virginia has to be particularly alarming to Democrats .
It 's not so much that the Republicans won there .
It 's how they won there .
When Obama won the state in 2008 -- the first Democratic presidential candidate to take Virginia in 44 years -- he did so by reshaping the electorate .
Almost one in three voters was Black , Latino or Asian .
And 21 percent were voters under the age of 30 .
In other words , the 2008 electorate represented 21st century Virginia .
It did n't help that the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds spent much of his time criticizing health care reform , opposing the Employee Free Choice Act and lining up with the coal companies against " cap and trade " environmental legislation .
As Ben Tribett , writing on the Firedoglake blog , pointed out , every time Deeds took one of these right - wing positions , polls showed that fewer self - identified Democrats said they would show up at the polls .
As a result , the people who turned up to vote in Virginia in 2009 were much more likely to have voted for John McCain in 2008 than the overall Virginia electorate in 2008 .
The White House is pointing to exit poll data showing that Obama was n't a factor in voters ' choices on Election Day .
But that 's an evasion .
Even if the 2009 elections turned on local issues , the electorate 's attitude to the president and to Washington shapes the overall political atmosphere .
Obama 's 2008 campaign mobilized young and minority voters , and attracted independent voters , because it convinced them they were voting for " change you can believe in , " and breaking with the " old ways " and " conventional wisdom " of Washington .
Yet in his less than one year in office , Obama has proven to be much more of a captive of Washington conventional wisdom and much slower to deliver on " change " than the people who voted for him expected .
After tailoring his 2008 appeal to a " middle class " fed up with Washington self - dealers and Wall Street fat cats , whose recklessness helped wreck the economy , he and the Democrats have shown themselves to be quite cozy with the lobbyists and banksters .
If Obama and the Democrats continue down this path , they are setting themselves up for a shellacking in 2010 .
Even if the tentative economic recovery takes hold over the next year , economists predict that unemployment will still hover at 10 percent or higher .
If voters are n't seeing real relief in their own lives -- and even worse , seeing the government hand billions to Wall Street fraudsters -- they will be in an even fouler mood than they were this year .
Given the two - party setup in American politics , where voters get their chance every two years to ratify the status quo or " throw the bums out , " it wo n't matter that the Republicans ' policies and ideology are disastrous for working people .
The Democratic bums will get tossed out just the same .
Anti-incumbent -- and particularly anti-fat cat - incumbent sentiment -- seemed to drive the electorate in 2009 .
The defeat of ex-Goldman Sachs chair Corzine and billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's closer - than - expected reelection against a no-name candidate show this .
This could build into a wave in 2010 .
The worst conclusion that Democrats and their supporters can draw from the elections is that they must move to the " center " -- i.e. , to the right -- to placate " swing voters " who went for the Republicans in 2009 .
The Democrats are already governing from " the center , " and that certainly did n't do them much good in mobilizing their base voters in 2009 .
Politicians are , by nature , cowardly and risk - averse .
So we 're likely to hear a lot from them about how the Democrats must n't go " too far , " " must reconnect with the people , " yada , yada , yada .
If liberal interest groups follow that lead and do n't pressure the Democrats for their demands , the end result will be more rotten compromises with the right , more demoralization for their supporters -- and a right - wing comeback that seemed impossible only a few months ago .

Layout
Modern Rome is huge and sprawling on both sides of the Tiber , but first - time tourists and short - term visitors will want to base themselves in “ old Rome ” .
The city has spread over time and is now immense , but you ’ll probably want to see the sights in Piazza de Spagna , Via Veneto , Quirinal , Esquiline , Lateran , Caracalla , Aventine , Palatine , Forum , Capitol , Campo de Fiori , Piazza Navona , and Piazza della Rotonda , and then Vatican , Januculum and Trastavere on the west of the Tiber .
Accommodation
Fact box Name : Rome or Roma
Place : Roughly in the middle of Italy , near the Mediterranean coast
Population : 3.5 m in the urban area
Language : Italian , and the local dialect Romanesco
Known for :
The Pope , gelato , architecture , world domination and “ what have the Romans ever done for us ? ”
Temperatures : Summer ( June - August ) is hot : 30°C +.
Winter average is 12°C , with an occasional snowfall .
Spring and autumn are the most pleasant times to visit
Airports : Leonardo da Vinci / Fiumicino International Airport ( main airport , modern ) and Ciampino International Airport ( budget airport .
Closes overnight , so check your transport and times carefully )
Price of a pint : â‚¬5
Price of a dorm bed : â‚¬20
Price of a public transport ticket : â‚ ¬1 for 75 minutes or â‚¬4 for a day
If you ’re going to be spending just a short time in Rome , it ’s probably best to stay near the popular sites .
Find yourself a hotel or hostel near the Pantheon and Campo de Fiori .
The area around the Termini station is also convenient and in the right area .
Hostel beds tend to cost less than â‚ ¬20 a night but — depending on the quality of the establishment — prices can drop as you move further away from the centre ; in fact , they get really cheap .
Although it ’s one of the world ’s most popular tourist destinations , competition keeps prices in check for the lower - and middle - ranges of the market .
Even better value are the campsites out of the city centre , combining great facilities such as swimming pools and scenic country views with easy access by metro into the city .
To see the full selection of Rome hostels on offer , check out our sponsors HostelBookers.com before you travel for user ratings , photos and detailed hostel descriptions .
Food
Although Italian cuisine is well - known worldwide , we tend to combine all sorts of regional specialities into a conglomerate .
Roman cuisine tends towards pasta , sauces and cheeses with lots of deliciously prepared meat and vegetable dishes .
One that caught our eye was Trippa alla Romana : a dish of tripe and tomatoes .
When buying coffee or gelato , you tend to order and pay at one counter before taking a receipt to another counter where people prepare your order .
It can be a bit confusing if you ’re used to ordering , eating then paying .
Pizza to take away is sold by weight , so let the server know how much you want by indicating where to cut .
Backpacking
Rome is certainly a good way to put on some weight !
Transport
Public transport runs regularly and quite often .
Buses , metro and trams are all integrated in the public transport system , so you can hop on and hop off within your time period .
The cheapest ticket is â‚ ¬1 , which lasts for 75 minutes .
If you ’re doing more than four journeys , more than 75 minutes apart during the day , you can get a â‚¬4 daily ticket .
Three , seven and 30 - day tickets also exist , as do yearly passes .
The first time you use the ticket , validate it in one of the yellow machines on board .
Make sure you hold onto it until you ’re clear of the vehicle as ticket inspectors do operate .
The same thing goes for trains , but validate your tickets on the platform before boarding .
Attractions – free
Vatican city and the Basilica of Saint Peter
You wo n’t need your passport to cross into the world ’s smallest country , but you will need “ modest ” clothing as you will in most of the Mediterranean ’s cathedrals , churches and mosques .
Expect a long security queue then a bag search before you can enter to gaze on priceless artistic treasures and soak in the atmosphere amidst other shuffling tourists .
The Pantheon
One of the largest and best - preserved temples in Rome , the Pantheon is built in a circular pattern which may have inspired later Roman church builders .
The “ Oracular ” or hole in the roof lets in rain during wet weather .
Villa Borghese
Public art and architecture ; fountains , churches , bridges , sculptures , etc .
When the city gets too much , the public gardens of Villa Borghese provide a welcome retreat .
The noise of traffic fades into the trees , but never quite manages to disappear .
Stands of mature trees , sculptures , and an artificial lake make it nice place to sit and relax , or wander aimlessly .
It almost goes without saying , but just wandering the streets of old Rome is a treat in itself .
Squares , fountains , buildings , statues , churches — they ’re everywhere and , luckily , never too far away from a good cafe or bar .
Walking the Forum
The forum was the central area for legal disputes , political and philosophical discussion and worship in the many temples .
Walking it nowadays is a treat which can be spoilt by the water - sellers offering â‚ ¬10 bottles of warm water , mimes and actors looking to charge you for a photo , and the other dregs of popular tourist sites .
We recommend reading up on ancient Roman history ; at least as far as figuring out who many of these people , places and gods are before you show up .
There ’s little in the way of easy - to - find information on site .
Attractions – paid
Colosseum
If you approach the forum by metro , which is probably the easiest way , you ’ll be arriving at “ Colosseo ” and emerge near this icon .
Built , expanded and used for gladitorial contests , it ’s partially in ruins now .
There are chances to take your classic photo from the outside and huge lines to get in .
If your time is short , I ’d advise skipping it but if you do go inside you can see the excavations which have unearthed the underfloor cages where animals and people were kept .
The Vatican Museum
The resources of the Renaissance church were thrown at bringing together this amazing collection of artwork and the design and building of what was the papal palace .
The Sistine Chapel is within its walls and that alone almost makes up for the entrance price .
If you go on the last Sunday of the month , admission is free .
Other tours operate around the Vatican , giving access to various places and sights .
Attractions – seasonal
Rome is always a popular pilgrim destination , but crowds swell at Easter and Christmas .
On Good Friday , the Pope leads the procession of the cross at the Colosseum ; and on Easter Sunday he addresses the crowds in St Peter ’s Square .
At Christmas , the city is filled with nativity scenes and festive markets , culminating in a midnight mass at most churches and a blessing by the Pope in St Peter ’s Square on the 25th .
If you ’re brave enough to face the summer heat , you could attend various neighbourhood festivals or Saint ’s days but Autumn is the party time with the cultural festival RomaEuropa , the White Night ( La Notte Bianca ) where art galleries and museums are open all night for free , the Marino wine festival and much more .
Guidebooks
With a culture - and history - heavy city like Rome , you ’d expect Rough Guides ’s
Where to next
angle to treat Rome well , and it does .
Time Out Shortlist Rome 2010 has the best guide to nightlife and the eating , drinking , party scene while Lonely Planet provides solid background and good on - the - ground choices and tips for getting around .
Being the capital , you can get pretty much anywhere from Rome .
Trains run in all directions ; budget and legacy airlines lead all over Europe and the world .
Craig recommends heading to Sicily for island life , rich fruits and wines , hiking in Mt Etna and beautiful beaches and countryside .
Linda recommends choosing a few cities to visit on the way north into Austria .
Assisi , Florence and Venice are all worth a visit , but picking a smaller one to stay in for a few days is a wonderful experience – one of our favourite places in Italy is a tiny town at the end of a winding bus route called Baiardo .
And there are thousands of little gems like this throughout the country .

Almost four years ago , I was tasked with converting a Kixtart script to Python .
This particular script was used to lock down Windows XP machines so they could be used as kiosks .
Obviously , you do n’t need Python to do this .
Any programming language that can access the Windows Registry will be able to do this or you could just use Group Policies .
But this is a Python blog , so that ’s what you ’re going to get in this article !
Getting Started
All you need for this tutorial is the standard Python distribution and the PyWin32 package .
The modules we ’ll be using are _winreg and subprocess , which are built into the standard distribution and win32api and win32con from PyWin32 .
We ’ll look at the code in two halves .
The first half will use the _winreg module :
import subprocess , win32 con from win32 api import SetFileAttributes from _winreg import * # Note : 1 locks the machine , 0 opens the machine .
UserPolicySetting = 1 # Connect to the correct Windows Registry key and path , then open the key reg = ConnectRegistry ( None , HKEY_CURRENT_USER ) regpath = r" Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies \\Explorer " key = OpenKey ( reg , regpath , 0 , KEY_WRITE ) #
Edit registry key by adding new values ( Lock - down the PC ) SetValueEx(key , " NoRecentDocsMenu " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoRun " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoFavoritesMenu " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoFind " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoSetFolders " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoSetTaskbar " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoSetActiveDesktop " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoWindowsUpdate " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoSMHelp " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoCloseDragDropBands " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoActiveDesktopChanges " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoMovingBands " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoViewContextMenu " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) SetValueEx(key , " NoChangeStartMenu " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting )
SetValueEx(key , " NoTrayContextMenu " , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) CloseKey ( key )
To start , we import the modules we need .
Then we connect to the Windows Registry and open the following key for writing :
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
WARNING : Before continuing , it should be noted that messing with the Windows Registry can cause your PC harm if you do it incorrectly .
If you do not know what you ’re doing , back up your registry before doing anything or use a virtual machine that you can restore ( like VirtualBox or VMWare ) .
The script above will make your PC mostly unusable for anything other than a kiosk .
Anyway , after opening the key , we set over a dozen settings that hide the Run option , Favorites , Recent , and Find from the Start Menu .
We also disable right - clicking on the desktop , Windows Update and all changes to various menus ( among other things ) .
This is all controlled by our UserPolicySetting variable .
If it ’s set to one ( i.e. boolean True ) , it will lock down all these values ; if it ’s zero , then it enables all the settings again .
At the end , we call CloseKey to apply the settings .
We should stop here a moment and consider that this is some truly ugly code ( as pointed out in the comments below ) .
I wrote this when I had only a month of so of programming experience and I was porting from a Kixtart script that looked as bad or worse than this one .
Let ’s try to make it cleaner :
from _winreg import * UserPolicySetting = 1 # Connect to the correct Windows Registry key and path , then open the key reg = ConnectRegistry ( None , HKEY_CURRENT_USER ) regpath = r" Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies \\Explorer " key = OpenKey ( reg , regpath , 0 , KEY_WRITE ) sub_keys = [ " NoRecentDocsMenu " , " NoRun " , " NoFavoritesMenu " , " NoFind " , " NoSetFolders " , " NoSetTaskbar " , " NoSetActiveDesktop " , " NoWindowsUpdate " , " NoSMHelp " , " NoCloseDragDropBands " , " NoActiveDesktopChanges " , " NoMovingBands " , " NoViewContextMenu " , " NoChangeStartMenu " , " NoTrayContextMenu " ] #
Edit registry key by adding new values ( Lock - down the PC ) for sub_key in sub_keys : SetValueEx ( key , sub_key , 0 , REG_DWORD , UserPolicySetting ) CloseKey ( key )
The main difference here is that I took all the sub_key names and put them into a Python list that we can then iterate over , setting each to the right value .
Now , if we had multiple differences in these lines of code , such as a mixture of REG_DWORD and REG_SZ , then we would need to do something different .
For example , we ’d need to iterate over a list of tuples instead or maybe create a function to pass the information to .
If you want the most flexibility , you could create a class that does this for you in addition to error handing and the opening and closing of the keys .
I ’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader though .
The other half of our script will hide various icons and folders :
# Sets the " Hidden " attribute for specified files / folders . if UserPolicySetting == 1 : SetFileAttributes ( " C: \Documents and Settings \All Users\Start Menu\Set Program Access and Defaults.lnk " , win32con.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN ) SetFileAttributes ( " C: \Documents and Settings \All Users\Start Menu\Windows Catalog.lnk " , win32con.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN ) SetFileAttributes ( " C: \Documents and Settings \All Users\Start Menu\Open Office Document.lnk " , win32con.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN ) SetFileAttributes ( " C: \Documents and Settings \All Users\Start Menu\New Office Document.lnk " , win32con.
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN )

This snippet hides the following
Various links to Microsoft Office documents that usually appear in the Start Menu
Windows Catalog and the Set Program Access and Defaults shortcuts
Various folders in the Start Menu ’s Programs sub - menu that we do n’t want user ’s to access , such as VNC , Office , the Microsoft SQL Connector , etc .
Other links in the Programs sub-menu
This is accomplished through a combination of win32 api ’s SetFileAttributes and win32 con ’s file attributes for the shortcuts .
The folder ’s hidden status are toggled using a subprocess call to Windows attrib command .
Unfortunately , this is another example of repetitious code .
Let ’s take a moment and try to refactor this .
It looks like everything that we ’re setting is in the Start Menu or its Programs subfolder .
We can probably take those paths and put them into a loop like we did with the previous example .
We can also use the flag to tell us when to hide or show the folders .
We ’ll put the whole thing into a function to make it easier to reuse too .
Let ’s see how that looks :
import os import subprocess import win32 con from win32api import SetFileAttributes def toggleStartItems ( flag=True ) : items = [ " Set Program Access and Defaults.lnk " , " Windows Catalog.lnk " , " Open Office Document.lnk " , " New Office Document.lnk " , " Programs \ Adobe Reader 6.0.lnk " , " Programs \ Windows Media Player.lnk " , " Programs \ Windows Movie Maker.lnk " , " Programs\\vnc " , " Programs \ \Outlook Express " , " Programs \ \Java Web Start " , " Programs \ \Microsoft Office " , " Programs \ \Microsoft SQL Server " ] path = r'C : \Documents and Settings \All Users \Start Menu ' if flag : toggle = " +h " else : toggle = " - h " for item in items : p = os.path.join ( path , item ) if os.path.isdir( p ) : subprocess .
Popen ( ' attrib %s " %s " ' % ( toggle , p ) ) elif flag : SetFileAttributes ( p , win32con.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN ) else : SetFileAttributes ( p , win32con.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL )
Now , does n’t that look much nicer ?
It also makes adding and removing items easier .
This leads for simpler maintenance and less headaches in the future .

German authorities declared last week that the use of web analytics tools such as Google Analytics is illegal without the consent of the person being tracked .
We speak to Marit Hansen , head of data protection in Schleswig - Holstein , about what it means .
The statement from the authorities said web users must be told they are being tracked and given the chance to opt out , and that IP addresses cannot be collected without the user ’s permission because they constitute personally identifiable information .
Research spoke to Marit Hansen ( pictured ) , acting head of data protection for Schleswig - Holstein , and a member of the association of regional and federal authorities that issued last week ’s ruling , about how the decision came about and what it means for the software companies and publishers .
Research :
It ’s somewhat surprising to hear that these very common web analytics tools seem to be illegal .
Hansen :
They ’re certainly not in accordance with the rules set out by law , which in this case means German media law and data protection principles .
So it ’s up to the people who develop and use these tools to make sure that their products are designed and configured in full compliance with the law .
These are not new requirements – these laws have been in place for a number of years .
Research :
The analytics tools have also been around for a number of years – why are we only addressing this now ?
Hansen :
The discussion has n’t just begun – since November this year the Duesseldorfer Kreis , which is an association of all the German data protection authorities , has been building on , interpreting and refining what is laid out in law .
Prior to this there have been discussions with some suppliers , including Google , to try to get them to configure their products in a way that ’s compliant with the law , which has n’t happened .
We informed them in August 2008 , I believe , that these things were not compliant with the law .
Research :
What sort of relationship do the data proteection organisations have with these companies ?
Hansen : Google Germany , for example , is based in Hamburg , as is Etracker , and they have been in regular contact with our colleagues in Hamburg for years – in 2006 , and also in 2008 and 2009 .
In some cases some of these tracking firms have got in touch themselves to ask , how do we make sure we ’re doing this properly ?
So there are those who say , we might be doing something wrong , we want to find out – and not just those who wait to be asked about it by the authorities .
Hansen :
Also , not everyone from these data protection bodies deals with internet issues every day , so I think it ’s good that over the past year we ’ve been working with the specialists , and asking the suppliers , how does all this work in detail , is it all down to the IP address , what role do cookies play , where and how is the data managed , and so on .
Research :
So there are companies that manage to conduct online tracking in line with the law ?
Hansen :
That ’s right .
Research :
What ’s the next step ?
How will the rules be enforced ?
Hansen : I expect that Google and others will set out their position , and either say yes , this is how we do it , or propose things they might change and discuss how they might comply , for example with the opt - out requirement .
That will eventually be decided in consultation with the authorities .
It would also be possible to use fines against those publishers who are using these tools on a large scale .
I do n’t believe that any of the authorities are going to do that while we are in a phase like this where it all seems very new to a lot of people .
But it ’s not ruled out .
Another approach that might be adopted is warnings , as you see in some other industries , for companies that are not in compliance .
Of course , we have other areas to focus on , so enforcing this is n’t our top priority , but fines are a possibility , and I think after a certain period of transition we ’ll see that happen more .
But , as you know , there are thousands of website managers who do n’t even know all this yet , so there ’s probably going to be an information campaign first of all .
We ’re very hopeful that companies open themselves up and that the discussion really focuses on the technical mechanisms and the details , and that they ask , how do we make this compliant with the law ?

Sebastian Pinera has promised to continue the centre - left 's social policies Conservative billionaire Sebastian Pinera has won Chile 's presidential run-off , ending two decades of centre - left rule .
Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei conceded defeat after results from 60 % of polling stations showed Mr Pinera with 52 % of the vote to Mr Frei 's 48 % .
Mr Pinera promised a tough law - and - order programme and vowed to use his business know - how to boost the economy .
Outgoing President Michelle Bachelet was barred by law from standing again .
Mr Pinera has promised to continue her highly popular social policies .
He will be Chile 's first democratically elected conservative leader for more than half a century .
Mr Pinera 's victory ends the long run in office of the Concertacion - a coalition of left - wing and centre parties that had run Chile since the end of military rule under Gen Augusto Pinochet in 1990 .
' Fresh air '
Mr Pinera won 44 % of the vote in last month 's first round , well ahead of Mr Frei , the governing Christian Democrat candidate .
After 20 years I think a change will be good for Chile
Sebastian Pinera
Pinera 's growth promise Profile : Sebastian Pinera Mr Pinera , 60 , made his fortune introducing credit cards to Chile .
He now owns a television channel , a stake in Chile 's most successful football club and has millions of dollars in investments .
He has promised to increase investment , fight crime and create one million jobs , the BBC's Candace Piette reports from the capital , Santiago .
He has also promised to cut taxes for small businesses and make government more efficient .
" Better times are coming for Chile .
There is a great new phase on the way , " Mr Pinera said on Sunday .
" After 20 years I think a change will be good for Chile .
It 's like opening the windows of your home to let fresh air come in . "
It was the second time Mr Pinera had run for the presidency at the head of a centre - right coalition .
Eduardo Frei had been seeking a second term as president In 2006 , he lost to Socialist Ms Bachelet .
Under the constitution she could not stand for re-election in 2010 .

Remember high school ?
That time of education and personal exploration , in a place of learning where young minds are shaped into responsible adults under the guidance of caring , understanding adults ?
Of course not .
High school is n't like that .
Between your raging hormones and the near - psychotic outbursts of your overworked , underpaid teachers , there was barely enough time to copy someone else 's homework to turn in next period while planning to accidentally bump into that hottie you pass every day on your way to lunch .
If you heard the word " responsible " in high school , it was probably followed by the words " for setting the toilets on fire " and the hope that your name would n't somehow be associated with it .
Wildlifers is n't specifically about setting high school toilets on fire , but only because I have n't quite worked out the script to that one .
It is about high school students , though , as represented by the two funny animals right here : Eddie and Musky , two of the first Wildlifers I ever came up with .
There 's a lot more of them now ( there 'd have to be , or there would n't be much story ) , and I make them do things like dissect eyes and watch bad educational films for your amusement and mine .
Sure , it 's cruel  it 's comedy , darn it !
The Wildlifers made their first appearance in the anthology comic Wild Life # 1 from Antarctic Press in 1993 .
They made appearances in most of the issues of that book , and since then have showed up now and then in the venerable indie anthology Furrlough .
They generated more mail and requests with every appearance , asking questions like like " When is there going to be more ? " and " Why do n't these guys get their own book ? " and " What the heck kind of animal is Musky ? "
As for that last one , she 's an otter .
As for the other two , the answers are now " in September " and " now they do " !
The Wildlifers Back to School Special reprinted all the Wildlifers stories published so far in a 64 - page , no-ads black and white collection .
It 's available on the Comics page of my Online Catalog .
In addition to stories like " Pierced Dreams " and " The Eyes Have It " from the early , hard - to - find issues of Wild Life , there will be two entirely new stories : " Forked " , which explores the mysterious and not always pleasant fate of flatware , and " Thrift Store Shopping Extravaganza " .
" But Joe , " I hear you ask , " what will this comic be like ? "
Well , I wo n't try and explain it  I 'll just show you some !
Click on the link below and read the first Wildlifers story , " A Hamburger Sammich and Sum French - Fried P'tatoes ! " , for a taste .
As for how I heard you , my powers are beyond your understanding .
Have questions about the Wildlifers ?
Email me if you 've got a good one , and maybe I 'll put it on the Wildlifers FAQ .
More soon !

USING subterfuge to entrap and kill adversaries , in locations far from any battlefield , has been a feature of conflict for the past 3,000 years or so — at least since Jael , one of the warrior heroines of ancient Israel , lured the enemy commander Sisera into her tent , lulled him to sleep with a refreshing drink of milk , and then used a tent peg to smash out his brains .
In modern times targeted killing is a more elaborate business , and many of the finer points — how the victim is stalked , how many people are involved — usually remain under wraps .
But the plot to eliminate Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , a Hamas commander who was found dead in a Dubai hotel room on January 20th , has been laid bare in stark detail by the police in that country , not normally regarded as a model of open government .
Hamas instantly blamed Mossad , the Israeli intelligence service , confirming that the dead man was a founder of the movement 's military wing .
Israel had fingered him in particular for the abduction and killing of two soldiers in 1989 .
Mr Mabhouh 's brother claimed that he had been killed by an electrical appliance that was held to his head .
The local police said he had been suffocated .
The gory details of his end were not made public in Dubai , but many of the events that led up to it were starkly exposed .
Indeed any amateur student of espionage and its tradecraft can now consult YouTube , the video - sharing site , to see closed - circuit television footage of some of the 11 people ( all travelling on European passports ) who are said by the Dubai authorities to have joined in the plot .
On February 15th the country 's police chief offered a blow - by - blow account of the plotters ' doings , elucidating the images .
The key agents were “ Gail ” and “ Kevin ” who supervised the hit , and “ Peter ” who was in charge of preparatory logistics .
In the films their appearances changed frequently .
Kevin acquires glasses and a full head of hair , after going to the loo .
It is clear that the plotters were expecting Mr Mabhouh 's arrival .
One spotter waited at the airport ; he duly tipped off a couple of colleagues , stout figures in tennis gear , who wait at the hotel and take note of the victim 's room number , 230 .
The plotters book room 237 , which they use as a base .
In later footage Gail and Kevin are seen pacing the corridor nearby .
Four men in baseball caps , one also wearing gloves , are seen getting into a lift to leave ; they seem to be the ones who did the job .
In Israel the initial reaction to the killing was of telling smirks , plus leaks to the effect that the victim was buying arms from Iran .
But this gave way to embarrassment as the Dubai authorities produced their evidence , and as protests came from countries — Britain , France , Germany and Ireland — whose passports had apparently been faked or abused ; and from individuals whose identities were “ borrowed ” .
The Israeli security services have never voiced any moral doubts about targeted assassinations ( whether in the neighbourhood or farther afield ) but there was a concern that the latest killing might go down on a list of plots that have misfired in unforeseen ways .
In 1997 , for instance , Mossad agents tried to eliminate Khaled Meshal , a senior Hamas official , in Jordan .
Two agents posing as Canadians were caught trying to poison him and Israel , under threat that its agents would be executed , agreed to send an antidote .
In 1973 Israeli agents murdered a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer in Norway , mistaking him for the leader of Black September , the group blamed for a massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics .
These bungles contrast with operations that Israeli spooks recall with defiant pride : the killing of Imad Mughniyeh , a top member of Hizbullah , in Damascus in 2008 ( a particular coup since Syria is hostile territory for Israel ) ; and the dispatch of Abu Jihad , a senior Palestinian official and founder of the Fatah movement , by a squad that swooped into Tunis in 1988 .
The not - so - cold war
Israel has no monopoly on killing its foes far from home .
European countries , including Britain ( since the 1950s , anyway ) claim to eschew such methods .
But during the cold war both superpowers conspired eagerly to eliminate people they deemed undesirable .
In America there was a rethink after a committee , under Senator Frank Church , disclosed that it was probing a web of plots to kill senior figures in countries like Congo , Cuba , the Dominican Republic and Vietnam .
This led to a series of presidential decisions — most famously order number 12,333 , signed by Ronald Reagan in 1981 — which barred assassinations .
The real force of such orders was to squelch rogue plots hatched in the lower levels of the security services ; procedures still exist for the president , in consultation with congressional leaders , to authorise the killing of a perceived adversary .
In 1998 , three years before the 9/11 attacks , Bill Clinton mandated the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden , after bombs at American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
Since the start of the “ war on terror ” , the boundaries in American thinking between legitimate military action and cold - blooded assassination have become fuzzier still .
Among America 's foreign - policy pundits there were serious discussions , back in 2003 , as to whether simply killing Saddam Hussein would be a humane alternative to waging war against Iraq .
More recently , as the fronts in the battle with al - Qaeda have broadened from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Somalia and Yemen , so too has the scope of American actions to eliminate perceived foes .
Last September , for example , American helicopters fired on a convoy of trucks in Somalia and killed Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , who was blamed for an attack on an Israeli hotel in Kenya in 2002 , and for the embassy bombs of 1998 .
On February 3rd Dennis Blair , the director of national intelligence , told Congress that American forces might sometimes seek permission to kill a citizen of the United States , if he was a terrorist .
This followed a report that Barack Obama had authorised an attack on Anwar al - Awlaki , a radical American imam , in Yemen .
The operation in Somalia earned Mr Obama a rebuke in the Harvard law faculty , where he first shone as a progressive young legal scholar .
Such actions were counterproductive and of dubious legitimacy , a columnist in the Harvard Law Record argued .
But defenders of the right to kill selectively cite the shooting down of Japan 's Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto in the second world war , which was quite a cold - blooded business — though he was clearly an enemy combatant .
In truth , the factor that has changed the tactics of the American administration is less legal than mechanical : the advent of drones that can be directed with lethal accuracy ( most of the time ) from offices in Virginia .
The best - known target was Baitullah Mehsud , leader of the Pakistani Taliban , who was blown up at his home in Waziristan last August .
A study by the New America Foundation , a think - tank , points out that CIA drone attacks have become far more frequent since Mr Obama took office , with more strikes being ordered in his first ten months than in George Bush 's last three years .
In a world where Western voters demand maximum results for minimum expenditure of blood and treasure , assassination by machine has an obvious appeal to political leaders .
Although they cost more “ enemy ” lives ( including civilian ones ) than old - time stabbing or poisoning , they also arouse less controversy .
But for how long ?
Legal watchdogs say it makes unlawful killing more likely by dehumanising the process ; and Pakistani officials , even those committed to fighting the Taliban , say the ruthless use of drones is alienating local people .
Whether death is by computer or by more old - fashioned methods , the antecedents and details of assassination are easier to hide in rough , remote locations than in rich , westernised ones .
And even in wild places , awkward facts can come out — as they obviously did in Dubai .
When you think of UFC lightweight Clay Guida the thoughts of non -stop action usually comes to mind .
He ’s known as a fighter whose motor never stops .
As a result , Guida has been involved in some of the most exciting battles ever in the Octagon .
His upcoming match with Kenny Florian in UFC 107 promises to feature the same kind of action which has made both fighters fan favorites .
But the Round Lake native suffered a split decision loss to Diego Sanchez at the TUF Team US vs. UK Finale .
In a move to help him make the jump to the next level Clay bought a 40 - foot RV and headed West to hook up famed trainer Greg Jackson .
“ The Carpenter ” still considers himself part of Gilbert Grappling and the Midwest Training Center , but he wanted to step outside of his comfort level and engulf himself in training .
Jackson is known as one of the top MMA minds right now , training some of the top names including UFC standouts Rashad Evans , Georges St. Pierre and Nate Marquardt .
Others like Joe Stevenson and Andrei Arlovski have sought Jackson ’s coaching to re-invigorate their games .
Guida certainly is banking on Jackson ’s magic touch to expand his capabilities , which will be important when considering his opponent Florian is very capable at striking on the feet and working submissions on the ground .
Guida recently told Sherdog radio that Jackson is n’t necessarily reinventing him , but rather re-directing his game .
Guida also said he ’s been getting a lot of work with other top fighters including WEC contenders Donald Cerrone and Cub Swanson , as well as fellow UFC 155er Aaron Riley .
Ironically Kenny Florian has also joined with a new trainer , Greg jackson associate Firas Zahabi .
The Montreal based instructor heads Tri-Star Gym and is Georges St. Pierre ’s head trainer , but has also formed a union with Jackson sharing their stable of fighters to broaden the selection of good training partners .
Kenflo previously trained with Massachusetts based Mark DellaGrote .
Florian vs. Guida facing off means Zahabi and Jackson will be cornering opposing fighters .
Both Guida and Florian are looking to bounce back from defeat and return to the list of title contenders .
A loss this Saturday means two in a row , and the 155 pound division is so deep that two consecutive losses is enough to take you out of contention .
UFC 107 : Penn vs. Sanchez will be in Memphis , TN at the FedEx Forum this Satuday , December 12 , 2009 .
PINE CITY , Minn .
—Police credit a 15 - year - old German Shorthaired dog with saving the life of an elderly , unconscious man in Pine City .
Brett Grinde said he took Effie out for their usual walk on Monday evening , but within a couple minutes she started pulling on the leash , wanting to go in a different direction .
Effie then took off running , leading Grinde to a neighbor 's house where a 94 - year - old man was on face down on the driveway .
The dog started licking the man 's face .
Grinde called 911 , then started CPR .
KARE -TV reported the eldery man , William Lepsch , regained consciousness and is in serious condition at North Memorial Medical Center .

Posted : Sun Feb 14 , 2010 6:14 am [ Game -> Article ] - News related to Top Story : OXM Fallout : New Vegas Details | More info on Company : Obsidian Entertainment | More info on Game : Fallout : New Vegas
The latest OXM has hit the stands and , just like PSM3 and PCGamer , they have an " exclusive " " world premier " of Fallout : New Vegas .
Here are the details ( scans after the jump ) : The Brotherhood of Steel is back , but the core story revolves around the NCR and Caesar 's Legion .
SPECIAL now has descriptions - eg CHA 10 = Cult Leader , EN 1 = Basically Dead .
Those descriptions for Strength : 10 - Hercules ' Bigger Cousin 9 - Doomsday Pecs 8 - Circus Strongman 7 - Beach Bully 6 - Barrel Chested 5 - Average Joe 4 - Lightweight 3 - Doughy Baby 2 - Beached Jellyfish 1 - Wet Noodle
You get a Vault 21 jumpsuit from the doc who revives you , along with a pistol and a Pip Boy 3000 .
Weapons can be modified , but modifications only have positive results .
The magazine implies you wo n't need to make a choice between different mods , because they wo n't be mutually exclusive .
And a little later the magazine contradicts itself by writing that adding a larger magazine increases reload times .
Every weapon has a special attack , not just the golf club .
It seems that Fore ! does not mean groin shots are back for every weapon .
Guns have different knockback amounts , pistols do n't do much , shotguns blast people away .
There 's a town - specific reputation , and Obsidian has ' hinted ' that the reputation will impact endings .
Karma has been overhauled , tracking the factions and ideologies that you agree with .
Nightkin are back , as blue - skinned Super Mutants who 've gone schizophrenic through Stealth Boy use .
They attack you while cloaked , deactivating cloak at the last minute to hit you with a club .
The Tabitha situation can also be resolved by convincing Tabitha to revolt against the other Super Mutants .
Helios
One is not only a power plant , but also the location of the controls of a solar weapon developed by Poseidon Energy which you can employ yourself .
You can now choose the main character 's age .
Scans Removed
In addition , OXM apparently did n't really hear our cries about giving all the credit to Obsidian - nor did they actually do their homework on who Obsidian are and the connections they have to the Fallout series ( even going so far as to falsely claim that " there wo n't be any connection to those [ original Fallout games ] , though . "
I 'm pretty sure the inclusion of factions like , I dunno , the NCR definitively tell us that there will be quite a connection to the original Fallout games .
Thanks to NMA for the bulletpoints and madnath619 for bringing everything to my attention .
Edit :
The scans have been taken down .
Although they were never hosted at Duck and Cover , apparently even linking to them is grounds for copyright violations .
Oh well .

It 's pretty obvious this article was written for the 10 - 15 year old lulz EXPLOSIONS demographic .
It 's an absolute travesty that this is even considered " journalism . "

Clearly , you have a responsibility to push the series forward , but there 's also nothing worse than a misguided attempt to differentiate a follow - up that only ruins what everyone loved about the original .
Throw in a new developer - New Vegas is being developed by Obsidian rather than Bethesda 's in - house team - and there is no doubt that a fair few Fallout fans will be more than a little concerned that this could be a recipe for nuclear disaster .
Seriously , what in the name of all that is holy is this supposed to mean ?
I still cannot completely comprehend that there actually are people who feel that Fallout 3 was in any way spectacular .
It was a mediocre pseudo - RPG which focused more on action in gameplay rather than storytelling and had too many flaws to count .
And to praise Bethesda 's in - house develeopement talent ?!
Gee , I guess the [ rumors ] and [ steel be with you ] - dialogue was something that really set the standard for the gaming industry of tomorrow .
It also bothers me how you call Fallout 3 fans just plain and simple Fallout fans .
Most of the FO3 - fanboys never played the originals , and even if they did they most likely disliked them .
Some of the Bethesda fanboys have already been crying after Elder Scrolls 5 , well it 's part of this foolery I cannot understand : you already got your ES V in form of Oblivion : w/ gunz !
and now we 're about to get another taste of that bitter nectar in form of Oblivion : now w/ neon lightz !
So , technically , all those Morrowind fans should be in fact waiting for Elder Scrolls 7 ?

That 's the thing though - we should n't have to install user made content to make the game good .
The onus is on the developer to make it a worthwhile game to play .

Yeah , but if a real writer did the project - you know , like me - then it would be successful .
Iceland 's economy shrank further in the third quarter on lower domestic demand and government consumption as the island continues to suffer the effects of the collapse of its banking sector last autumn .
Iceland 's gross domestic product fell 5.7 % on a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis and dropped 8.0 % on a year - to - year basis , Statistics Iceland said Monday .

UPDATE : Here ’s What CBS Is Saying About Oprah
EXCLUSIVE : One of the biggest questions in the TV biz has been when , and even if , Oprah Winfrey would give up her daytime syndicated talk show to focus on OWN , her long delayed Oprah Winfrey Network in 70 million homes that was supposed to launch in place of the Discovery Health Channel as a joint venture between Winfrey and Discovery Communications .
The industry has been betting that the daytime diva would extend The Oprah Winfrey Show for at least another year or two because of the huge cash license fees which stations have long paid her .
But people around Oprah are telling me that wo n’t happen .
They say that Discovery Communications chief David Zaslav has demanded that Oprah “ move it or lose it ” — move her talk show to OWN , or risk losing the Oprah Winfrey Network altogether .
I ’ve learned that in coming days Winfrey and Discovery will issue a press release announcing OWN ’s on - air launch for the start of 2011 .
And , in several weeks , Oprah will tell the public that she ’s ending her syndicated Chicago - based daytime talk show when her current deal runs out and moving it to OWN headquarters in Los Angeles probably as soon as mid-2011 .
Hardest hit by the news will be CBS Television Distribution which syndicates the show , Also hit will be ABC ’s owned - and - operated stations which make up Oprah ‘s core station group , and also Sony TV execs who ’d been hoping Oprah would deliver any extension of her daytime talker into their hands based on the success they ’ve had this season syndicating Dr Oz , Harpo ’s latest daytime talk show star ) .
“ Les Moonves , Bob Iger , and Sony will flip out , ” one of my insiders says about Oprah ’s news .
“ The only winner is David Zaslav . ”
* UPDATE : My news this morning caught CBS by surprise .
The Eye was counting on a 1 - or 2 - year renewal of The Oprah Winfrey Show .
“ In all honesty , we have not heard she ’s made a decision yet whether to continue , ” an insider tells me .
“ We think we ’re still in the talking stages .
To our minds , it ’s a non-decision . ”
CBS had scheduled a face - to - face meeting a month ago with Oprah and her personal and professional posse at her Santa Barbara compound to discuss her plans .
But one of the people in the close group of people around her passed away .
So it was canceled , I ’ve learned .
CBS is quick to point out that , a few years back , Winfrey re-negotiated her distribution deal with CBS TV Distribution so it “ gets a lesser fee now ” .
The result is that , when Oprah stops her syndicated talk show and moves it to OWN , “ It will be a hit for us , but not until 2012 .
And with the lower syndication fee , it ’s not as big a hit as it would have been , ” a CBS insider tells me .
Besides , CBS has seen Oprah claim time and time again over the years that she ’s “ retiring ” from the syndicated show .
But to take Oprah to a nosebleed cable channel even if it reaches into 70 million homes ?
“ She has always respected the fact that the pulpit she has now gives her such a huge amount of influence . ”
And CBS also plans to remind her that , thanks to the syndicated show , “ she by far makes more money on TV than anybody else . ”
Now let ’s see how persuasive Les Moonves and his people can be . *
I ’m told that right now Oprah and her advisers are trying to figure out what to do with her mini-city in Chicago , and which personnel she can and will move out to LA in the next six months .
Also Discovery will have to renegotiate her own deal .
Even though it has yet to go on the air , OWN has experienced tremendous turmoil since it was announced , including the entrances and exits of many top female TV executives — three in just the last 7 months .
Combined with the unprecedented delays , that has come at a cost for Discovery .
“ It ’s so upside down because Discovery has lost millions of dollars since it was announced , ” a source tells me .
“ It was rumored 50/50 that Zaslav would throw in the towel and her network would n’t launch .
But Zaslav sees it as a loss leader . ”
Last week , Oprah called a confab in Los Angeles and met with everyone associated with OWN .
She also personally heard programming pitches .
Only very recently has she put in place her two current top lieutenants to run OWN ( but for how long ? ) : Christina Norman , who at the start of the year was named CEO after spending 17 years with Viacom Inc ’s MTV cable empire before stepping down as MTV president .
And Lisa Erspamer who this week was named OWN ’s Chief Creative Officer and is a 15 - year veteran of Harpo Productions where she served as co-executive producer of Oprah since 2006 .
But I hear that recently appointed OWN head of programming Jamila Hunter , NBC ’s former SVP of alternative entertainment , is out looking for a job after just 3 months .
I understand that Oprah was supposed to tell CBS Inc chief Les Moonves back on October 1st what her plans were but then cancelled several scheduled calls to him .
Winfrey ’s distribution deal was re-signed in 2004 with King World which is now part of CBS Television Distribution .
It expires in fall 2011 which marks the end of Oprah ’s 25th season .
( News reports said a clause existed in her current contract that would have let her end the show in 2010 , but that she chose last year to extend the show ’s run through the contract ’s full term . )
She said in 1997 that she was planning to retire , then renewed her contract through 2002 .
Then in 2002 she said she would call it quits in 2006 , but in 2004 she re-upped through 2011 .
Back then she was still enjoying high ratings and fat cash license fees from TV stations and big popularity .
But that was then , and this now .
Her ratings have been in double - digit decline in recent years .
And given the financial crisis which has put TV stations on life support because of the plunge in advertising , Oprah was unlikely to be able to demand another big cash raise to continue her show in syndication — especially in today ’s climate when stations are bartering with syndicators , not paying them .
“ It had the potential to bankrupt stations .
She would have wanted all cash up front .
GMs would have told her to go away , ” one source explains to me .
When Oprah leaves syndication , it will open up time slots and free up station cash not just for syndication ’s existing stars ( which now include Harpo - started Dr Phil , Rachael Ray and Dr Oz ) but also new ones .
Leaving the extraordinary visibility she enjoyed through syndication for a nosebleed cable channel is a huge gamble for Oprah as a TV brand .
There ’s the possibility that OWN could distribute her new talk show for syndication .
But I hear no one is talking about that now .
In the U.S. , Oprah is viewed by an estimated 7 million people a day ( though that audience has fallen by half over the past 10 years ) and in 140 countries .
It has been estimated that she currently earns about $ 275 million a year in showbiz income .
Long the No. 1 rated daytime talk show , Oprah also made Winfrey into the richest African American woman worth $ 2.3B at last count , a worldwide media personality with a powerful media empire around her , a celebrated actress who doubled as a film and television producer , a force in both book and magazine publishing .
But there ’s also no question that Oprah is a much more controversial figure now than she ’s ever been before because of her wealth and fame and politics .
“ She ’s lost her authenticity .
Like when she said , ‘ It ’s good to have your own private jet . ’
Or when she shut down the City of Chicago with this season ’s ‘ flash mob ’ for the opening show .
Where ’s the relatability ? ”
The word internally at ABC is that TV stations have been cringing at Oprah ’s past and present and continuing support for Barack Obama , from her appearance at his inauguration ( see photo ) to her visits to the White House , because it antagonizes half the viewing public who do n’t share her politics .
Now Oprah will no longer be in their faces : instead she ’ll be isolated on cable .
The biggest question now in the TV industry is whether it ’s “ Good Luck ! ” or “ Good Riddance ! ”
Iran has executed two people over widespread street unrest that erupted after the Islamic Republic 's disputed presidential election in June , an Iranian news agency reports .
The two were among 11 people who had been sentenced to death on charges including moharebeh ( waging war against God ) , efforts to overthrow the Islamic establishment and membership of armed groups , the ISNA students agency said .
The executions were the first carried out for election - related incidents .
The presidential election plunged Iran into its deepest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
" The sentences against two of these people ... was carried out today at dawn and the accused were hanged , " ISNA said .
It named the two as Mohammad Reza Alizamani and Arash Rahmanipour .

Young people who enter the work force in a recession , meanwhile , are psychologically altered .
They are less likely to get professional - level jobs throughout life .
They are less likely to switch jobs later in their career , even in pursuit of greater opportunity .
But there ’s also reason not to be too despairing .
The country endured stagflation and recession between 1977 and 1983 , and rebounded smartly in the 1980s and ’90s .
That ’s because people are not passive pawns of economic forces .
Recessions test social capital .
If social bonds are strong , nations can be surprisingly resilient .
If they are weak , things are terrible .
The U.S. endured the Great Depression reasonably well because family bonds and social trust were high .
Russia , on the other hand , was decimated by the post - Soviet economic turmoil because social trust was nonexistent .
This recession has exposed America ’s social weak spots .
For decades , men have adapted poorly to the shifting demands of the service economy .
Now they are paying the price .
For decades , the working - class social fabric has been fraying .
Now the working class is in danger of descending into underclass - style dysfunction .
For decades , young people have been living in a loose , under - institutionalized world .
Now they are moving back home in droves .
The economic response to the crisis is everywhere debated , but the social response is unformed .
First , we need to redefine masculinity , creating an image that encourages teenage boys to stay in school and older men to pursue service jobs .
Evangelical churches have done a lot to show how manly men can still be nurturing .
Obviously , more needs to be done , and schools need to be more boy - friendly .
Second , antipoverty programs have long focused their efforts on inner cities , but now there also is great vulnerability in working - class places like central Pennsylvania and rural Michigan .
Many social workers are not exactly comfortable in socially conservative areas , but if the working class disintegrates , then look out .
Third , Facebook is great , but social networking sites do not by themselves create support networks when jobs disappear and poverty looms .
Somebody has to provide institutions for unaffiliated 24 - year - olds .
There ’s no sign that government will nimbly repair these social gaps .
It will probably be up to social entrepreneurs to take a midcrisis look at their priorities .
Somehow there must be a way to use the country ’s idle talent to address freshly exposed needs .
Adaptive cycles are the foundation of both natural ecological and human socio-economic systems , and have been investigated independently from very different perspectives by ecologists and financial analysts who have almost certainly never heard of each others ' work .
It is interesting then to look at the strong correspondence of the self - similar hierarchical patterns , best described as fractals , which emerge from both fields .
This form of organization seems to be a fundamental dynamic in many areas .
The following is a guest post from Stoneleigh , former editor of The Oil Drum Canada , who now writes at The Automatic Earth .
The essay explores the natural patterns that occur in human systems .
The bewildering , entrancing , unpredictable nature of nature and people , the richness , diversity and changeability of life come from that evolutionary dance generated by cycles of growth , collapse , reorganization , renewal and re-establishment .
We call that the adaptive cycle .
Holling , 2009
Figure 1 : Sierpinski Triangle Fractal
Holling , Panarchy and Resilience
Arguably the most significant thinker in the field of ecological cycles has been Buzz Holling , who refers to the conceptual model he derived from the study of forest ecosystems as Panarchy .
Holling observed that ecosystems developed in adaptive cycles of exploitation , conservation , release and reorganization which could be described in three dimensions - ecological ' wealth ' , connectedness and resilience .
These cycles provide a framework for the opposing forces of growth and stability versus change and variety .
Figure 2 : Adaptive Cycle in Three Dimensions
In an adaptive cycle , early growth is rapid as individuals of many species arrive in a newly opened space and seek to exploit a plethora of vacant ecological niches .
Genetic diversity and biomass , both living and dead , increase quickly in this expansion phase .
Ecological connections are initially simple and sparse , but over time many interconnections and mutual dependencies develop .
The system therefore increases in both ' wealth ' and connectedness , as flows of energy and materials become larger and more complex .
Biological ' wealth ' confers the potential for novelty , allowing the system to adapt in disparate directions as circumstances warrant .
Connectedness permits increasing stability , through the development of negative feedback loops , which help to regulate conditions conducive to life .
As time passes , rapid growth gives way to conservation .
Inter - dependencies become highly specialized and self - regulation becomes fine - tuned and sophisticated .
Efficiency is maximized as niches are fully occupied , and flows of energy and nutrients are tightly controlled by the existing biota .
This represents the end of the growth phase .
Relatively few opportunities are left for newcomers or novel strategies , hence diversity stabilizes or declines .
The system is ' rich ' , but becomes more rigid , and therefore less resilient in the face of potential shocks , which can propagate rapidly through a highly inter-connected system with smaller margins for error than it had in its generalist phase .
An increasingly brittle ecosystem becomes , in Holling 's words , " an accident waiting to happen " .
When something does push the ecosystem outside of the boundaries it can tolerate , the long growth phase can morph into a rapid and chaotic release and reorganization phase , where nutrients and energy stores previously tied up can suddenly be liberated .
This can be associated with a considerable loss of complexity , but also with much greater potential for generalist strategies and for novelty .
Figure 3 : Adaptive Cycle Stages
During the growth phase the system finds an abundance of resources available .
Expansion and exploration of new opportunities are key concepts within this stage .
“ When new ecological spaces open up – due , for instance , to forest fires , or retreating glaciers , or many other things - resources needed for other species to grow are made available .
There ’s more light reaching the soil surface when large trees are toppled , or burned to the ground , for example . ”

There ’s more light reaching the soil surface when large trees are toppled , or burned to the ground , for example . ”
“ The " r " phase is transitory , and as the system matures , it is replaced by the K phase .
Eventually slower growing , long lived species or entities enter the system .
Resources become less widely available as they become “ locked up ” …
The K phase is sometimes called the conservation phase , because energy acquired goes into maintaining or conserving existing structure , rather than building new structure .
In this phase , a few dominant species or companies or countries … have acquired many of the resources and are controlling the way they can be used . ”

“ Often systems rapidly pass into a phase called omega .
This is also referred to as the release ( or creative destruction ) phase because structure , relationships , capital or complexity accumulated during the r and K phases is released ( often in a dramatic or abrupt fashion ) .
…
Plants may die … or a company may go bankrupt , releasing workers and decommissioning factories or offices . ”

…

“ The fourth , or alpha phase , is a period of reorganization , in which some of the entities previously released begin to re-structure but not necessarily as they were before .
This phase can mark the beginning of another trip through an adaptive cycle …
Many new entities may enter the system , and innovation becomes more probable . ”
Project Shrink
However , such adaptive cycles do not exist in isolation .
Local ecosystem cycles are embedded in larger and slower - moving regional cycles operating over years and decades , which are in turn part of global climate and elemental cycles ( carbon , nitrogen , phosphorus etc ) that may unfold over centuries or millennia .
These larger cycles can act as stabilizing factors by adding a ' memory effect ' , or wealth reservoir , enabling rapid regeneration following a localized setback , but only if the larger cycle is not in its own contraction and reorganization phase .
In addition to being part of larger cycles , dynamic ecosystems are also composed of smaller and faster - moving cycles of growth and decay , operating on much shorter time horizons .
This nested set of self - similar structures allows for both persistence and innovation .
Figure 4 : Panarchy ( Nested Adaptive Cycles )
Where higher and lower order cycles are very tightly coupled , they may synchronize , becoming trapped in a extended growth phase at many scales at once , thereby risking synchronous collapse .
This need not be triggered at a large - scale level , but can begin anywhere in a set of nested adaptive cycles and proceed both upwards and downwards .
A destabilizing event arising from below , for instance a disease outbreak leading to widespread morbidity and further adverse consequences , is called a ' revolt ' .
A synchronous collapse , which can take the form of a " pancaking implosion " , to use Holling 's term , can lead to a poverty trap , or persistent maladaptive state characterized by low ' wealth ' and connectivity , which is very much more difficult to recover from than a localized reversal would have been .
By way of illustration , the Canadian province of British Columbia is currently facing a confluence of circumstances that pose a significant large - scale ecological threat .
A long - standing policy of fire - suppression , in a hitherto naturally fire - controlled ecosystem , has led to a thick understory of growth , which has in turn caused significant stress to trees forced to compete for water and nutrients in an area becoming warmer and drier .
Trees under stress have much lower resistance to pine beetle infestation , with the result that a pine beetle population explosion is killing huge tracts of forest despite all efforts to contain the outbreak .
This adds to the combustible material on the forest floor and greatly increases the risk of widespread conflagration .
The much smaller self - limiting fires typical of the province would have opened up areas for new growth , killed insect pests and released nutrients for regeneration , and in fact are required by some tree species in order to open up seed pods for reproduction .
In contrast , very large and intense fires , fueled by a tremendous excess of flammable detritus , can comprehensively denude enormous tracts of land .
This can remove the biological reservoir of potential repopulating species as well as lead to enough soil erosion to inhibit regrowth of the forest ecosystem .
An interlocking series of adaptive cycles has been synchronized through being locked into an extended growth phase and is therefore much more vulnerable to a catastrophic event that could become a lasting poverty trap .
When collapse occurs it can be a natural part of the pattern of adaptation and learning .
That is what happens in forests when they burn or are attacked by natural enemies .
Recovery typically replaces the old with a similar but new pattern that is similar because of the memory reserved in seeds and vegetation of the understory .
But when the collapse occurs as a consequence of long effort to freeze the system into one paradigm of development and management , then it might involve collapse of a level of the panarchy , which in turn threatens other levels .
The collapse of ancient societies has this character - the top religious and political controls can collapse , triggering the gradual collapse of institutions till the family is left as the sole source of survival .
It leads to a " poverty trap . "
Holling , 2009
Much of Holling 's work has focused on the crucial role of resilience in both natural and human systems , and the Resilience Alliance has been the result :
We define resilience , formally , as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function , structure and feedbacks - and therefore the same identity .
Resilience arises from a redundancy that has the appearance of inefficiency and a lack of critical structural dependency on specialized hierarchy , neither of which conditions are likely to be met at the peak of the growth phase of an adaptive cycle .
For these to be achieved from this point at least a partial , or localized , collapse to a simpler level of organization would have to occur .
There can potentially be a fine line between a retreat from rigidity to this level of resilience and a ' poverty trap ' , where a collapse has proceeded so far and so fast that the system has been stripped of the wealth ( biological or otherwise ) that it would need to rebuild .
Where adaptive cycles have become synchronized , so that the likelihood of deep collapse is increased , striking a balance of resilience would be far more difficult .
A resilient world would promote biological , landscape , social and economic diversity .
Diversity is a major source of future options and of a system 's capacity to respond to change .
A resilient world would embrace and work with natural ecological cycles .
A forest that is never allowed to burn loses its fire - resistant species and becomes very vulnerable to fire .
A resilient world consists of modular components .
When over - connected , shocks are rapidly transmitted through the system - as a forest connected by logging roads can allow a wild fire to spread wider than it would otherwise .
A resilient world possesses tight feedbacks .
Feedbacks allow us to detect thresholds before we cross them .
Globalization is leading to delayed feedbacks that were once tighter .
For example , people of the developed world receive weak feedback signals about the consequences of their consumption .
A resilient world promotes trust , well developed social networks and leadership .
Individually , these attributes contribute to what is generally termed " social capital , " but they need to act in concert to effect adaptability - the capacity to respond to change and disturbance .
A resilient world places an emphasis on learning , experimentation , locally developed rules , and embracing change .
When rigid connections and behaviors are broken , new opportunities open up and new resources are made available for growth .
A resilient world has institutions that include " redundancy " in their governance structures and a mix of common and private property with overlapping access rights .
Redundancy in institutions increases the diversity of responses and the flexibility of a system .
Because access and property rights lie at the heart of many resource - use tragedies , overlapping rights and a mix of common and private property rights can enhance the resilience of linked social - ecological systems .
A resilient world would consider all nature 's un-priced services – such as carbon storage , water filtration and so on - in development proposals and assessments .
These services are often the ones that change in a regime shift – and are often only recognized and appreciated when they are lost .
Walker , 2008
This will be a very tall order in a panarchic future .
Prechter , Elliottwaves and Socionomics
Bob Prechter has also spent decades studying the structure of nested cycles , but in his case in financial markets , carrying on the work of RN Elliott , who established the field in the 1930s .
Elliott painstakingly documented motive ( impulse ) and corrective patterns which unfold at all degrees of trend simultaneously - from small moves completing in minutes to larger cycles playing out over months , years , decades and longer .
Elliott noted that motive waves in the direction of the one larger trend occur in fives , while corrective waves counter to the one larger trend form threes or multiples thereof .
Prechter explains that this is the minimum requirement for an adaptive cycle capable of both fluctuation and progress , and therefore the most efficient form .
Each move itself is composed of the same patterns , while each also forms a component part of larger structures .
( Motive waves are labeled with numbers , while corrective waves are labeled with letters . )

As opposed to self - identical fractals , whose parts are precisely the same as the whole , and indefinite fractals , which are self - similar only in that they are similarly irregular at all scales , a robust fractal is one of intermediate specificity .
Though variable , its component forms , within a certain defined latitude , are replicas of the larger forms .
Prechter , 1999 , p17
Figure 7 : The Brain as a Robust Fractal
Bob Prechter 's socionomics model combines Elliott 's observed fractal patterns with an understanding of human herding behaviour , comprising a comprehensive challenge to prevailing notions such as the Efficient Market Hypothesis by reversing causation and recognizing the role of emotional / irrational behaviour as the prime market driver .
While the real economy demonstrates negative feedback loops , finance is thoroughly grounded in positive feedback .
Figure 8 : Perception Versus Reality in Socionomic Causation
Socionomics provides a model of collective mood swings which permits collective human behaviour prediction in finance , the real economy and beyond .
Consensus takes time to build , so that the more extreme the sentiment , the closer one is to a trend change .
Collectively optimistic people engage in one range of behaviours over different timescales - typically buy stocks , borrow funds to build businesses , employ others in the expectation of profit , vote for incumbents whom they credit with stability , engage in cheerful expressions of popular culture and behave in an increasingly inclusive manner in recognition of common humanity .
Collectively pessimistic people become increasingly risk averse and suspicious of others , in whom they look for differences rather than similarities .
Both optimistic and pessimistic behaviours , particularly in their extreme forms , can create self - fulfilling prophecies for varying periods of time , until perception substantially overshoots reality and the trends it creates can no longer be sustained .
The manic trend of recent years has led to an unsustainable debt burden of unprecedented scope and complexity .
It also led to an unprecedented degree of global economic and financial integration dependent on hierarchical specialization , comparative advantage and just - in - time delivery that are clear examples of rigidity creating a brittle system .
Figure 9 : Phase 1 of the Decline with Elliottwave Labels
Like Holling 's panarchy , Prechter 's nested socionomic cycles either reinforce or counter each other depending on the direction of cycles larger and smaller than the one under consideration .
Where cycles at several degrees of trend are moving in the same direction , the move will be extreme - either a mania to the upside or a crash to the downside .
The largest mania ever known topped in the year 2000 , and we have been in bear market territory since then ( more obviously in real terms ) .
We are now approaching a synchronized move in the opposite direction as the rally of recent months peters out in the face of the larger downtrend .
The consequences of this will be considerable , but we are still quite near the beginning of the large - scale and complex downward pattern the model predicts will unfold over the next several decades .
We can expect many deleveraging cascades and many intervening rallies , some larger than we have seen so far .
Figure 10 : Diminishing Marginal Productivity of Debt in the US Economy
It is inevitable that the complex web of debt instruments and inter-dependencies that humanity invented to prolong its growth phase ( to use Holling 's terminology ) by stealing from the future will be a prime focus for a sharp reversal , as we have already reached the point where additional debt provides less than no benefit .
Socionomics tells us that the trust and complacency as to systemic risk that allowed this debt structure to develop will be primary casualties of a synchronized move to the downside , being both cause and effect in a powerful positive feedback loop .
Tainter , Complexity and Peer Polities
Joseph Tainter 's work complements that of Holling and Prechter , providing a framework of diminishing marginal returns to complexity which encompasses ecosystems , individual societies and competitive peer polities .
As complexity increases , it eventually becomes a liability , as we can see with Holling 's description of rigidity reducing the resilience of ecosystems and Prechter 's many writings on the debt complexity of manias and the systemic risk it engenders .
Figure 11 : Declining Marginal Returns to Complexity
As with diminishing marginal productivity of debt , past a certain point further investments in complex solutions to increasingly complex problems has a negative return .
Tainter explains , however , that where there is not a single political structure , but instead competitive peer polities , these entities become trapped in a competitive spiral where investment in organizational complexity must be maintained regardless of cost , as the alternative is domination by another member of the cluster at the same level of complexity , rather than collapse to a simpler system .
The counter - productive actions of states are legitimized to the citizenry by the fact that each member of the cluster is engaging in the same behaviour .
Collapse , which requires a power vacuum , is not possible unless the whole cluster collapses at once at the point of economic exhaustion .
Peer polity systems tend to evolve toward greater complexity in lockstep fashion as , driven by competition , each partner imitates new organizational , technological , and military features developed by its competitors .
The marginal return on such developments declines , as each new military breakthrough is met by some counter - measure , and so brings no increased advantage or security on a lasting basis ..
A society trapped in a competitive peer polity system must invest more and more for no increased return , and is thereby economically weakened .
And yet the option of withdrawal or collapse does not exist ..... Peer polity competition drives increased complexity and resource consumption regardless of cost , human or ecological .
Tainter , 1988 , p214
Tainter observes that the peer polity nature of the modern world creates a more apt comparison with the rapid collapse of the ancient Maya than with the slow decline of Rome .
To use Holling 's terminology , we have seen a panarchy of nested cycles synchronize , with the effect of artificially extending the growth phase for all simultaneously .
The evidence for this is abundantly available in terms of the many limits to growth we are approaching or have reached , most notably the high EROEI energy required to maintain complexity .
The significant risk is therefore of deep collapse over a relatively short period of time ( although this would still likely be decades at least ) .
Collapse , if and when it comes again , will this time be global .
No longer can any individual nation collapse .
World civilization will disintegrate as a whole .
Competitors who evolve as peers collapse in like manner .

Postscript :
There are about three kinds of scientists - the consolidator , the technical expert , and the artist .
Consolidators accumulate and solidify advances and are deeply skeptical of ill formed and initial , hesitant steps .
That can have a great value at stages in a scientific cycle when rigorous efforts to establish the strength and value of an idea is central .
Technical experts assess the methods of investigation .
Both assume they search for the certainty of understanding .
In contrast , I love the initial hesitant steps of the " artist scientist " and like to see clusters of them .
That is the kind of thing needed at the beginning of a cycle of scientific enquiry or even just before that .
Such nascent , partially stumbling ideas , are the largely hidden source for the engine that eventually generates change in science .
I love the nascent ideas , the sudden explosion of a new idea , the connections of the new idea with others .
I love the development and testing of the idea till it gets to the point it is convincing , or is rejected .
That needs persistence to the level of stubbornness and I eagerly invest in that persistence .

The Journal of Neuroscience 2010 .
Transplanted neurons grown from embryonic stem cells can fully integrate into the brains of young animals , according to new research in the Jan. 20 issue of The Journal of Neuroscience .
Healthy brains have stable and precise connections between cells that are necessary for normal behavior .
This new finding is the first to show that stem cells can be directed not only to become specific brain cells , but to link correctly .
In this study , a team of neuroscientists led by James Weimann , PhD , of Stanford Medical School focused on cells that transmit information from the brain 's cortex , some of which are responsible for muscle control .
It is these neurons that are lost or damaged in spinal cord injuries and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) .
" These stem cell - derived neurons can grow nerve fibers between the brain 's cerebral cortex and the spinal cord , so this study confirms the use of stem cells for therapeutic goals , " Weimann said .
To integrate new cells into a brain successfully , the researchers first had to condition unspecialized cells to become specific cells in the brain 's cortex .
Cells that were precursors to cortical neurons were grown in a Petri dish until they displayed many of the same characteristics as mature neurons .
The young neurons were then transplanted into the brains of newborn mice -- specifically , into regions of the cortex responsible for vision , touch , and movement .
Until now , making these proper cellular connections has been a fundamental problem in nervous system transplant therapy .
In this case , the maturing neurons extended to the appropriate brain structures , and , just as importantly , avoided inappropriate areas .
For example , cells transplanted into the visual cortex reached two deep brain structures called the superior colliculus and the pons , but not to the spinal cord ; cells placed into the motor area of the cortex stretched into the spinal cord but avoided the colliculus .
" The authors show that appropriate connectivity for one important class of projection neurons can be obtained in newborn animals , " said Mahendra Rao , MD , PhD , an expert in stem cell biology at Life Technology , who was unaffiliated with the study .
The researchers also compared two methods used to grow transplantable cells , only one of which produced the desired results .
" The authors provide a protocol for how to get the right kind of neurons to show appropriate connectivity , " Rao said .
" It 's a huge advance in the practical use of these cells . "
Researchers will now explore whether the same results can be achieved in adult animals and , ultimately , humans .
Weimann and his colleagues also hope to understand how the transplanted cells " knew " to connect in precisely the right way , and whether they can generate the right behaviors , such as vision and movement .

I think this woman needs to watch more foreign movies .
She ’s got a bruise on her arm that looks vaguely like a man ’s face , and of course she immediately jumps to the conclusion that out of eleventy - whatever guys with beards and long hair , her bruise looks like — wait for it — Jesus .
Never mind that nobody actually knows what Jesus looked like compared to other long - haired , bearded guys .
Never mind that AFAIK there ’s no mention in the Bible of Jesus actually having long hair or a beard at all .
I guess every guy with a beard is Jesus , just like every woman in a scarf is his mother .
But I think what we have here is a another case of mistaken identity .
Her bruise clearly looks like Gerard Depardieu portraying Cyrano de Bergerac .
Wait a minute !
Does that mean Jesus looks … French ?
I wonder how that ’ll play on Fox News !
But I came away with the overwhelming impression that the main job of Mass Effect 2 is to build the audience and anticipation for Mass Effect 3 .
( The franchise was always intended as a trilogy . )
I could almost see the portfolio theory at work at Electronic Arts headquarters .
Next week , the company is scheduled to release Dante ’s Inferno , a game based on the epic poem .
Now that qualifies as a risk .
And so I could almost hear the executives saying , “ In that case , we need our other big game this quarter , Mass Effect 2 , to play it safe . ”
Of course , the result of BioWare ’s playing it safe is still more interesting and impressive than most developers ’ most inspired efforts .
And the most interesting and impressive aspect of Mass Effect 2 is how intelligently the game melds the combat systems of a third - person action game with the storytelling and characterizations of a traditional role - playing game .
The term “ role - playing shooter ” may have been coined by the creators of 2009 ’s Borderlands , but the phrase almost perfectly describes Mass Effect 2 .
This is an important distinction and it signifies a new stage in BioWare ’s development .
BioWare has been known over the last 15 years as one of the world ’s top makers of single - player role - playing games .
Going back decades to Dungeons & Dragons , one of the cornerstone concepts of a role - playing game has been that players primarily build up their virtual characters through the meticulous accumulation and selection of equipment and skills .
In a role - playing game , even those played online in real time , combat generally revolves around the shrewd , strategic use of gear and special abilities rather than on the human player ’s spatial perception and eye - hand coordination  the province of a shooter or other sort of action game .
Hybrids are certainly possible .
The original Mass Effect was a role - playing game that BioWare was ambitiously , almost rambunctiously , trying to cram into the form of an action game .
With Mass Effect 2 , by contrast , BioWare clearly decided to build the game as a shooter type first , leaving in only the lightest of customization options for each character  with far fewer skill options than in the first game  and fuse them with a combat system that can be played almost entirely as a real - time shooter .
In terms of the combat dynamics , imagine Gears of War lite with some science - fiction magic powers .
Venezuela 's 11 - year economic experiment with Hugo Chavez 's ' Bolivarian Revolution ' is on its death bed these days given the horrendous economic results that are increasingly hard to deny .
Venezuelans have long caught on to the ruse , with Chavez 's approval rating below 50 % according to the Washington Post .
Across Latin America , only 27 % have a favorable opinion of the leader and far more importantly , Chavez 's low - income base is now watching their buying power being rapidly eroded by Venezuela 's 25 % inflation .
So far Chavez has tightened the noose around Venezuelan media in a bid to contain the full extent of Venezuela 's economic disaster which includes electricity , food , and water shortages .
Yet interestingly , bearing similarities to Iran , twitter is filling the media gap and helping to expedite his regime 's eventual demise .
FOX :
Student protesters have organized their efforts by planning their demonstrations on Twitter , which is serving as both a public message - board for activists and a storing house for images of the worst of the violence .
...
Chavez has fought back by declaring that " using Twitter , the Internet ( and ) text messaging " to criticize or oppose his increasingly authoritarian regime " is terrorism , " a comment that recalls the looming threats of his allies in Iran , whose bloody crackdown on physical and electronic dissent may be blazing a trail for the Latin strongman .
Venezuelan journalist Nelson Bocaranda told El Nuevo Herald that the government has launched an army of Twitter users to bring down online networks and try to infiltrate student groups .
For Venezuela 's economy and people , the faster twitter works its magic the better .

There are 68,000 US soldiers based in Afghanistan US President Barack Obama has issued new orders for the US military in Afghanistan after deciding how many more troops to send , officials say .
Mr Obama told senior military leaders about his long - awaited decision on troop numbers on Sunday night , a White House spokesman said .
The president is now briefing the UK , French and Russian leaders on the plan .
The moves come as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he would send 500 more soldiers to the country .
According to US media reports , Mr Obama is set to formally announce that a further 30,000 troops are to be sent to Afghanistan in a televised address on Tuesday .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
It is all part of the choreography , the idea the UK has an Afghan strategy separate from the US is fanciful
Read Mark 's thoughts in full
He has been considering a request from the US military commander in Afghanistan , Gen Stanley McChrystal , for 40,000 soldiers .
Mr Obama met Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday evening .
He also spoke to senior staff including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and National Security Adviser James Jones before holding a videophone conference with Gen McChrystal and Karl Eikenberry , ambassador to Afghanistan .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , who is currently visiting Washington DC , was told of the plans in person .
' Political surge '
The US currently has about 68,000 troops in Afghanistan , where foreign forces currently total more than 100,000 .
We should be failing in our duty if we did n't work with our allies to deal with the problem where it starts

UK commits extra Afghan troops Pakistan warns US on Afghan plan Send us your comments
In his address , the president is also expected to tell the American public again why the US involvement in Afghanistan is necessary and how long the commitment is expected to last .
Last week , Mr Obama said he intended to " finish the job " in Afghanistan .
The White House said Mr Obama was in the process of speaking to all the key US allies in the Afghan conflict , including Italy , France , Britain and Russia .
The leaders were informed of the new strategy but were not told exactly how many extra troops the US intends to despatch , the Associated Press reported .
On Monday , Mr Brown said he was sending a further 500 soldiers to Afghanistan , taking the country 's total deployment in the country to 10,000 .

He said all conditions had been met to send the extra personnel and that eight other countries had also offered additional troops .
Mr Brown told parliament " the safety of people on the streets of Britain " depended on the UK taking action to address the militant threat from al - Qaeda at its source - along the Afghan / Pakistan border areas .
" We should be failing in our duty if we did n't work with our allies to deal with the problem where it starts , " Mr Brown told parliament .
Mr Brown said the military surge would be followed by a political surge , with an enlarged and reformed Afghan police force and more effective and accountable local administration .
Italian Foreign Minster Franco Frattini said on Monday that Rome was also prepared to increase its presence in Afghanistan from the current 3,200 .
Italy 's Ansa news agency quoted Mr Frattini as saying the conflict was a test of Nato's " credibility " and that it was " clear that Italy must finish the job started with NATO and make a greater contribution if it is needed " .

They do n’t , interestingly , include the obvious one : the “ consensus ” science is riddled with errors , fudged data and spin , is hugely politicised , and the IPCC is starting to resemble a bunch of losers who will be so discredited that they wo n’t be able to show their faces in polite society for decades .
No , Prof Pitman ( UNSW ) chooses to avoid that one , clearly missing the irony of trying to make this point so soon after Climategate , Glaciergate and Hurricanegate , and all the other “ - gates ” yet to come .
So here they are , in all their gruesome glory ( from the ABC … where else ? ) :
“ Sceptics are so well funded , and so well organised ” – so the $ 70 billion or so thrown at alarmist scientists to try to prove AGW since the mid 1990s ( which , by the way , they still have n’t managed to do ) is just loose change , I guess ?
Are you admitting that the alarmists are a disorganised rabble ?

“ They have nothing else to do .
They do n’t have day jobs … ” – [ so ludicrous that no comment is required – Ed ]
“ … so they can put all their efforts into misinforming and miscommunicating climate science to the general public ” – Sorry , but we ca n’t hold a candle to your celebrity warm - mongers like Al Gore , James Hansen , Tim Flannery , Robyn Williams etc etc ( continued p 94 ) .
They ’re the real misinformation experts here .
And then the best one of all [ cue violins ] :
“ All of the efforts you do in an IPCC report is done out of hours , voluntarily , for no funding and no pay , whereas the sceptics are being funded to put out full - scale misinformation campaigns and are doing a damn good job , I think . ”
Does n’t it just make your heart bleed ?
I mean this guy must be on another planet .
The climate alarmist movement must be one of the most well funded scientific bandwagon in the history of the freaking planet !
And the media happily print anything they say , without question .
Try getting a sceptical article printed anywhere in the mainstream media .
Oh per-lease , as they say .
And of course , in the spirit of full disclosure , the ABC points out that Prof Pitman is co-director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales .

If Murray Rothbard — Austrian School economist , anarchist political philosopher , early American popular historian , and inveterate libertarian organizational gadfly — had never lived , the modern libertarian movement would have nowhere near its current size and influence .
He inspired and educated generations of young libertarian intellectuals and activists , from Leonard Liggio to Roy Childs to Randy Barnett .
He helped form and shape the mission of such libertarian institutions as the Institute for Humane Studies , the Cato Institute , and the Ludwig von Mises Institute .
His unique combination of a Randian - Aristotelian natural - rights ethic , Austrian economics , anarchocapitalism ( of which he was the ur- source , within the contemporary libertarian movement ) , fervent anti-interventionism , and a populist distrust of " power elites , " both public and private , injected modern libertarianism with the distinct flavor that separates it from other brands of small - government , free - market thought .
Let 's put it this way :
When the likes of F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman died , conservative flagship National Review could and did praise them pretty unreservedly .
But when Rothbard died in 1995 , his old pal William Buckley took pen in hand to piss on his grave .
Rothbard , Buckley wrote , spent his life
huffing and puffing in the little cloister whose walls he labored so strenuously to contract , leaving him , in the end , not as the father of a swelling movement … but with about as many disciples as David Koresh had in his little redoubt in Waco .
Yes , Murray Rothbard believed in freedom , and yes , David Koresh believed in God .
Things look a little different now when it comes to Murray Rothbard 's influence , though it 's unlikely anyone at National Review will note it — except maybe in the context of an attack on Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .
The rise of Paul and his loud and enthusiastic and young fan base , which Buckley could not have foreseen ( I , who was writing an intellectual history of libertarianism from 1996 – 2006 , also failed to see it coming ) , contradicts Buckley 's contention that Rothbard 's divisive radical intransigence doomed him to irrelevance .
The Paul movement — the largest popular movement motivated by distinctly libertarian ideas about war , money , and the role of government we 've seen in the postwar period — is far more Rothbardian than it is directly influenced by the beliefs or style of any of the other recognized intellectual leaders or influences on American libertarianism .
The Paul crowd is the sort of mass antiwar , antistate , anti-fiat - money agitation that Rothbard dreamed about his whole activist life .
The Paulites stress Rothbard 's key issues of war and money , with that populist hint of what he called " power elite analysis " — and that the uncharitable call " conspiracy theories . "
Indeed , as I learned from my reporting on the movement during Paul 's primary campaign , a majority of them are pretty much learning their libertarianism directly from Paul himself and the Internet communities surrounding Paul .
But Rothbard was a friend and influence on Paul , and central to the Paul Internet community is the very Rothbardian Mises Institute website and the personal site of Mises Institute founder and chairman , Lew Rockwell , who was a close partner of Rothbard 's in the last decade of his life .
The Mises Institute has just issued an interesting ( though regrettably brief , for this fan ) collection of unpublished Rothbard writings .
They are essays , letters , and memos written with a specific purpose — to advise various libertarian education and funding groups in the 1940s and ' 50s ( mostly the Volker Fund , the most important supporter of libertarian intellectuals in that era — they funded the academic berths of both Mises and Hayek , sponsored the conferences for which Milton Friedman 's Capitalism and Freedom was largely written , and kept Rothbard alive with various grants and tasks ) on whether specific works or authors were worthy of promotion as good libertarian education or propaganda ( in the neutral sense ) .
Because of this practical purpose , Rothbard 's writing here highlights a still - important faultline in the larger libertarian project , both as an intellectual operation and a sales ( of ideas ) operation .
Rothbard vs. the Philosophers is about two - thirds Rothbard , and one - third introductory essay by an Italian political scientist , Roberta Modugno .
The essay derives so much from the Rothbard material that follows that it adds only a little to the value proposition of the book .
Its contextualization of the mature Rothbard does make the book useful to more than just dedicated Rothbard fans and libertarian - movement historians .
( There is much , much more of this sort of Rothbard material in the Mises Institute 's archives , and I hope this is only the beginning of issuing it . )
" Rothbard is the most entertaining of major libertarian thinkers — sharp , witty , mean , funny , and colloquial , and those virtues shine through these writings ' hortatory and practical purpose . "
Rothbard is an intellectual with a mission .
He learned much from Marx and various Marxist movements in terms of strategies for radical politico - economic change , and he agreed with Marx that while " philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways , the point is to change it . "
( While talking about Rothbard with libertarians who do n't cotton to him , which I did quite a bit of in my movement - history research , I detect that they often think their preferred libertarian thinkers were more scientific - interpretive , while Rothbard was more propagandistic .
Actually , all the major libertarian social thinkers had social and political change , not merely the objective search for truth , as their goal . )
Modugno's introductory essay does spell out the specifics of Rothbard 's project in a way that Rothbard himself often only implies in the writings collected here : that " the axiom of nonaggression " is " the true cornerstone of the Rothbardian system , " thus he " morally condemns all forms of statism . "
States , after all , cannot function without first aggressing against someone , if only to get tax money to fund their activities .
Rothbard is very concerned — especially given the practical purpose of these writings — with what he sees as the efficacy of social and economic philosophers and thinkers in swaying the world toward the cause of total liberty .
His critiques often have language along the lines of this comment on his beloved economist mentor Mises : " Mises 's utilitarian , relativist approach to ethics is not nearly enough to establish a full case for liberty . "
That spirit of seeking libertarian advantage dominates this book .
Rothbard is the most entertaining of major libertarian thinkers — sharp , witty , mean , funny , and colloquial , and those virtues shine through these writings ' hortatory and practical purpose .
His flayings of Leo Strauss and Karl Polanyi thus should not be approached as a nuanced and charitable philosopher - to - philosopher engagement .
Rothbard here is rather writing as an ideological polemicist about what thinkers are " good for the team , " and his critiques even beyond this book often had that spirit .
This aspect of Rothbard is sometimes used to attack him as an unserious thinker , but it is n't fair to the purpose of this sort of polemic .
While , for example , he is not capturing the full nuances of Karl Polanyi's history or analysis in his The Great Transformation , Rothbard is doing what he was asked to do — sniffing out a detectable set of beliefs about modern civilization , currency , and markets that make Polanyi an ineffective ally for radical libertarians .
Before Ayn Rand ever began influencing him , we find Rothbard providing a preliminary takedown of some of the common reasons Rand is thought " bad for the brand " of libertarianism .
In a 1948 piece attacking an essay in praise of " rugged individualism , " Rothbard writes that " I consider it a tribute to the moral qualities of an individualist society that private charity and philanthropy helps the unfortunate people in our midst . "
And while praising Leo Strauss , generally credited as philosophical godfather to the neoconservatives for agreeing there are ethical absolutes discoverable by reason , Rothbard points out some amusing curiosities in Straussian thinking , mostly focusing on Strauss 's famous " esoteric " readings of the likes of Machiavelli and his numerological obsessions , which Rothbard finds " really so absurd as to be almost incredible " and " excruciatingly crackpot . "
The most interesting part of Rothbard vs. the Philosophers , and the most important to libertarian intellectual history , is the notorious memo where he advised the Volker Fund , before the book came out , that F.A. Hayek 's The Constitution of Liberty should not be supported , and should be strenuously attacked when it appears .
( I heard more than one prominent libertarian thinker and activist refer to the memo as horrific or scandalous , and a massive black mark on Rothbard 's reputation that could not be washed away . )
Accidents of intellectual and institutional history , told at great length in my book Radicals for Capitalism : A Freewheeling History of the American Libertarian Movement , have linked as " libertarian " a set of thinkers who are actually in deep opposition on important questions regarding the intellectual justification for political and ethical beliefs , and of the preferred role for government .
All of these thinkers were bound by opposition to the post–New Deal consensus ; all had economic beliefs either largely or totally in opposition to the postwar economic planning and manipulation system known as Keynesianism ; and all were linked in a community of affinity and intellectual engagement , through organizations ranging from the Mont Pelerin Society to the Volker Fund to the Foundation for Economic Education .
But as Rothbard makes abundantly clear here , very important differences exist between the fallibilistic , utilitarian , small - government thinking of Hayek ( and Friedman , and to a great degree Mises ) and the rights - based anarchism of Rothbard and many of his followers , both of which coexist uneasily under the label libertarian .
" Rothbard here is rather writing as an ideological polemicist about what thinkers are ' good for the team , ' and his critiques even beyond this book often had that spirit . "
In words that he never made or intended to make public in his lifetime , Rothbard calls Hayek 's most monumental statement about liberty and the political order " surprisingly and distressingly , an extremely bad , and , I would even say , evil book . "
The " evil " part comes from the blow he thinks it will strike the libertarian movement , with Hayek then and even more later seen as libertarianism 's most respectable and brilliant exponent .
Since Hayek supported political liberty only for instrumental reasons , and not nearly as far as the anarchist Rothbard , Rothbard felt Hayek 's position would create a rhetorical " Even Hayek admits … " problem for more radical libertarians ( which has been true , to some extent . )
Rothbard 's arguments against Hayek are not strictly pragmatic ; he maintains that Hayek misunderstands the rational arguments for liberty and misstates the importance of rights arguments in classical - liberal history .
In a later , more conciliatory but still negative memo , Rothbard lists at many pages ' length the various concessions
Hayek makes to state power that Rothbard thinks are unnecessary and rights - violating , from government subsidies for public goods to government enterprises competing in the market to compulsory unemployment and old - age insurance to aid to the indigent .
The uneasy relationship between Rothbard and Hayek is echoed to this day , with such modern Hayekian libertarians as Virginia Postrel ( former editor of Reason magazine ) and Will Wilkinson lamenting the conflation of their thought with Rothbard - style beliefs .
All sorts of intralibertarian squabbles follow along the same rough lines of the no-compromise , antistatist Rothbardians versus the more classical - liberal , utilitarian , fallibilist , prudential Hayekians .
The differences in ultimate political ends are often also reflected in differences in tone and willingness to engage — as opposed to rail against — the standard bastions of mainstream power and influence .
" Rothbard 's intention is to make his own argumentation in support of freedom more persuasive , " Modugno notes .
Despite Rothbard 's dire warnings to the Volker Fund , Hayek 's work clearly was persuasive , and mostly about the things Rothbard would have liked him to be persuasive about .
I do n't think many people are converted by Hayek to a belief in , say , some minimal income floor from anarchism .
( And if so , that battle over a state that behaves in a properly Hayekian manner versus one that disappears entirely is still one for the far future , and was of little relevance in the 1950s context in which Rothbard skewered Hayek . )
In fact , Hayek is so associated with his beliefs in the failures of central planning , the powers of a free - market price system , and his demolition of " social justice " that many people familiar with him are surprised to find out that Hayek believes most of the bad things ( from an anarchocapitalist perspective ) that Rothbard slams him for .
These intralibertarian oppositions are real , important , and continuing .
Both Hayek and Rothbard ( and those they 've influenced and taught ) are still changing minds .
And though the general run of modern intellectuals have a hard time distinguishing them , both tendencies in libertarianism will continue to joust with each other as they joust with the world at large .
( One of the reasons the rights - versus - outcomes distinction is hard for others contemplating libertarianism to see is that , for some very good reasons , both libertarian approaches tend to lead to the same beliefs about limiting state power . )
Hayek and Rothbard were both more than intellectuals ; they were advocates .
And while what they ultimately advocated was different , in the context of today 's world of improvident government growth and power grabs , the rest of the world is n't so wrong in lumping them together for practical purposes .
Both were great economic thinkers , and understood marginalism and the division of labor .
In a world of different minds , in the social - and intellectual - change game , different sorts of arguments and different end points are going to work on different people and in different steps .
In the occasional schisms and discomforts between the approaches of , say , a Ron Paul and a Cato Institute , we see similar tensions that were already bubbling in the 1950s and are revealed in Rothbard vs. the Philosophers ( although Rothbard 's full - on anarchism remains too radical even for most Paulites ) .
If Hayek and Rothbard were ( unbeknownst to Hayek ) at war , it 's a war that both won , and neither won .
( Libertarian publisher R.W. Bradford amusingly laid out the case that the Rothbard side lost in libertarian - movement influence , back in 1988 , but I think the revival of both Rand and the Mises Institute 's influence in the Paul scene belie this . )
That both tendencies survive is all for the best both for libertarian ideas and for the general shape of human intellectual and political history .
Ok , so I ’ve just realized something .
There are smart people here who take issue with the fact that CO2 captures / retards / slows down , heat flow .
Now of course there are nuances , but at Climate Audit Steve does n’t like the discussion b/c we ’ve all heard it before .
I mean that ’s what it is , we have all heard the arguments .
I ca n’t even imagine a unique new one .
I ’ll give my opinion just to start the discussion , but what will happen is that others will give theirs and this thread wo n’t have anything to do with me or my crazy views .
My opinion is :
CO2 is more absorbent of heat in longwave than shortwave radiation .
Because sunlight absorbed and re-emitted , the energy is converted from short to long wavelength , there is necessarily a warming effect .
The questions in my mind are how much , how dangerous and what can we do about it .
My answers are dunno , but less warming than IPCC rubbish , likely beneficial and ca n’t be changed with today ’s technology .
Does that make me a lukewarmer , a denier , a skeptic or what ?
Believe it or not , Goldman Sachs is calling a top for U.S. Treasuries in their latest global daily .
The firm believes inflation and interest - rate hike expectations have been overdone for U.S. government bonds .
They also appear further emboldened in their call for no major interest rate hike through 2011 after Bernanke 's words with Congress .
Get ready for disinflation ( falling inflation , down to very low levels ) :
Goldman Sachs :
Core inflation now beginning its second deceleration phase
Under these circumstances , we continue to expect disinflation in core consumer prices .
We have argued for quite some time that core inflation has been sticky up until January because of two temporary inflationary forces — tobacco and car prices .
These two factors alone were responsible to nearly a half of year - on - year reading in core inflation .
Tobacco prices rose more than 30 % last year , as local governments raised taxes in order to make up for their budget shortfalls .
While vehicle prices have risen steeply largely because car dealers are now selling their new car inventory at normal prices ( as oppose to the ‘ liquidation ’ prices offered after the collapse of Lehman Brothers ) .
...
Treasuries are forming a top
At 3.70 % , 10 - yr Treasuries are at the top-end of the trading range .
Our Sudoku model suggests that based on consensus expectations for growth , inflation and policy rates , 10 - yr yields should trade at around 3.50 % .
If we were to plug our below - consensus macro forecasts , Sudoku would put the fair value closer to 3.0 % .
In our Bond Snapshot , released at the start of the week , we argued that while are currently on the sidelines , we would be inclined to play it from the long side , provided that the outlook for growth fails to improve .
Yesterday ’s consumer confidence was one important marker in this regard .

Dec. 25ParamountWesternJoel Coen , Ethan Coen Matt Damon , Josh BrolinA tough U.S. Marshal helps a stubborn young woman track down her father 's murderer .
Reportedly , is based off the Charles Portis novel of the same name and not a direct remake of the 1969 Henry Hathaway - directed John Wayne classic .
No matter what , though , the original movie is so well known that it will be at the forefront of many moviegoers ' minds .
The newfeatures Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn ( the John Wayne role ) , Matt Damon as La Boeuf ( the Glen Campbell role ) and Josh Brolin presumably as bad guy Ned Pepper ( the Robert Duvall role ) .
Mr. Bridges previously worked with the Coens on , while Brolin , who headlines the Western - themedin June , co-starred in the Coens ' The originalis not necessarily some untouchable classic , but its star , John Wayne , remains such an icon to this day that it's hard to imagine anyone filling his shoes , even a venerable actor like Jeff Bridges ( there will probably be many " The Dude takes on The Duke " references ) .
Younger audiences might not care , but older audiences likely will and they are the ones that drive business for Westerns .
The Coens and the marketing should work double - time to explainthey 've remade , beyond Hollywood 's usual attempt to cash in on a famous name .
The last major Western remake was , and it posted decent returns , opening with a $ 14 million weekend on its way to a $ 53.6 million final , but its 1957 predecessor was n't as well known asmined material that John Wayne already famously covered in , and it failed , grossing $ 22.4 million in its entire run .
In general , Westerns that receive nationwide release are few and far between .
The last one wasin September 2008 , and it only mustered $ 20.2 million , andflopped in 2003 . , on the other hand , fared pretty well , racking up $ 58.3 million in 2003 , but one has to go back another ten years , to 1993 , to find another successful , straightforward Western : , which corralled $ 56.5 million or the equivalent of over $ 103 million adjusted for ticket price inflation .
The Coen Bros. have had limited experience in the genre : aimed for a down home vibe and became one of their most successful pictures ( particularly its soundtrack ) , while , despite being set in 1980 , had Western elements and stands as their highest - grossing picture at $ 74.3 million .
was well - received by audiences for its action thriller plotline and sequences , but alienated many with its malevolent , artsy - fartsy meanderings .
Theremake would be commercially better - served emphasizing the former over the latter .
People will want to see a straight - shooting remake , not simply the Coens ' dark , snarky spin .
As of this writing , though , the movie reportedly has n't begun production yet , so it 's not possible to get a good read on how it might turn out .
At the end of the day , the John Wayne connection may prove helpful in raising awareness for theremake .
Unfortunately , the Western genre has been on the wane since Mr. Wayne 's passing ( aside from some Clint Eastwood movies ) , and Westerns are such a rarity these days that the genre itself may dominate 's media coverage .
Westerns are considered so quaint to the Hollywood bandwagoners that the prospects of Westerns in the near future may ride on 's performance .
Western
Ian Brimacombe reports on a woman who fought in the Eritrean struggle for independence from Ethiopia .
She was just 13 when she became a soldier .
She spent the next 16 years fighting in a brutal guerrilla war .
Meriem Omer began her life as a girl soldier in 1976 .
" I joined the cause voluntarily .
I felt like I had to do something , " she told the BBC's World Update programme .
" It was a hot political situation .
I saw villages burning .
I was surrounded by war .
The regime was imprisoning many people .
One of them was my father . "
In the battlefield , you could be as aggressive as a man and as merciless as a man
Meriem Omer
She was in sixth grade when she saw him dragged from the family home and thrown into the back of a van .
He was taken to a high - security prison where he was tortured , and she never saw him again .
" I felt so sad that my dad was in prison , " she says , " he was my role model and I could n't bear it . "
" The feeling that creates in a human being - whether man or woman - it 's a feeling of revenge . "
Equality Meriem
Omer 's story is remarkable , but not unique .
It is thought that about a quarter of the soldiers in the Eritrean rebel " Popular Front for the Liberation of Eritrea " or EPLF were women , and in many instances , girls .
WOMEN AT WAR
The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are the first in which tens of thousands of women have fought alongside men for prolonged periods .
This week the BBC World Service is taking an in - depth look at women 's stories from the frontline .
They left the traditional world they knew to join Marxist - inspired guerrillas who espoused equality between the sexes .
Meriem
Omer spent nine months doing her military training .
" That mentally and physically prepared me to carry a gun , " she says .
Today she still recalls vividly what it was like to fight .
" In the battlefield you could be as aggressive as a man and as merciless as a man , " she says .
" Physically we were not the same as the men , but we would double the men's efforts to be seen to equally participate in the battle . "
Tank commanders
She also remembers how gender was never much of an issue .

" We were assigned equally , like men , to the front - lines , " she says .
" Women were very important to the revolution . "
She says the aim of the organisation was to bring about social change and , therefore , it would n't have been able to do without women - from feeding the army , to providing information and support .
" That 's why they included the rights of women in the military code .
The role of women actually changed the attitude of men , " she says .
Thousands of young women participated in the struggle .
Some of them even became commanders of tank units .
Ms Omer says she felt a sense on empowerment but , as a woman at war , she says she knew she also faced additional risks .
" We were more vulnerable than men , " she says .
" Boys would be tortured , but women would always be raped and tortured and ultimately killed .
I never liked that idea , so I would have killed myself before I would be captured . "
Combat roles
The revolution was a long drawn - out affair .
Eritrea only emerged from its war of independence in 1993 .
After feeling the euphoria of seeing the fight for freedom won , Ms Omer fell out with the new Eritrean authorities and was eventually exiled .
She moved to the UK where , until last year , she was involved with an Eritrean organisation that supports a network of Eritrean diaspora communities across the world .
Now she helps run a family business in Sweden .
She remains a staunch opponent of the Eritrean government .
Meanwhile , the tradition of women in the Eritrean military continues to this day .
The country remains one of the few places in the world where women are drafted to fight alongside men in combat roles .
But Meriem
Omer says the picture is depressing for women conscripts .
" They are kept against their will , " she says .
" There is no battle to fight .
It 's just military service servicing the officers ' needs .
They are really not happy . "
It may be because of the Swedish way of life , but she says she has also seen the bigger picture .
" The experience of that conflict made me learn and grow up and believe in negotiation and peace , " she says .
" It 's not always a solution to carry a gun and fight . "
You can listen to the BBC World Service series on Women at War on World Update all this week until Thursday 18 February .

I watched an episode of the Tyra Show a couple months ago and Steve Harvey was on promoting this book .
I could n't believe that he was on a female - dominated audience show promoting such a sexist book , stereotying women into compulsive shoppers who are completely dependent on " their man . "
He also took the time on the show to talk about the importance of " being a lady " ( i.e. proper table manners , letting a guy open a door for you , looking the part by wearing " pretty , shiny things " [ i'm not kidding , he actually said those exact words ] , etc. ) .
I was simply shocked that Tyra , and her audience just sat along through the whole show giggling at his remarks about how " men want to treat a lady right " and all the other bullshit coming out of his outdated , set in his " manly " ways mouth .
I do not care for that man or his latest book one book .

I leafed through that book a bit as these talk show hosts seem to be in love with it .
It seems like the burnt caramel or chocolate version of The Rules and other stupid books like that .
Like Men are from Mars Women are from Venus .
Dude 's all like , women will get all upset about some woman wearing the same outfit .
Me , I do not care as my outfit is usually either pajamas and a Dir en grey T shirt or Camo pants and a Dir en grey t shirt , weather permitting .
If I saw some dame wearing the same shirt as me , I 'd say , COOL YOU LIKE DIR EN GREY TOO .
And I 'd only look upon them with the slightest scorn if they say they are wearing it as a fashion statement as I do not believe in wearing a shirt of a band unless you love that band .
But , this is not the main thing that bugs me about this book .
It 's this whole blaming women for if a guy cheats thing .
If a man has a woman with the body of a Victoria 's Secret underwear model who goes to bed every day in said underwear and serves this man breakfast in bed with a side of her dude will still go out and cheat because HE WANTS TO CHEAT .
Even if oiled women are in an elevator rubbing against him , he has the option to say , no , I will not cheat .
Why ruin a long term relationship for a few minutes of sex ?
He makes it seem like men are very stupid .
Like they are incapable of thinking , here is a hot woman , but I have a wife at home who I love .
Grr !
Then to make matters worse , Steve Harvey was freaking out because his wife was scuba diving .
And she gave it up for him !
It makes me think , man , chill !
The woman knows what she 's doing .
Why should she give up what she loves because her husband can't just relax , or learn scuba with her ?
Also , I am not sure I want to take advice from a man who had 3 divorces .
Why must all of these books be Books About Attracting the Sort of Men I hate that Make me Consider Swinging to the Lesbian Side of the Fence Which I 'd do If I did n't Fear Ending Up with a Woman like My Mother who is a bit ... Aggressive to Put it Mildly .

Silvio Berlusconi loses a PINT of blood after attacker breaks his nose and knocks out two teeth
Silvio Berlusconi lost nearly a pint of blood after he was punched to the ground by an attacker yesterday .
The 73 - year - old Italian prime minister is facing a second night in hospital after doctors admitted his injuries were worse than they had thought .
Mr Berlusconi also suffered a broken nose and lost two teeth during the assault as he signed autographs at the end of a stormy political rally in Milan yesterday .
Scroll down for video
Bloodied : Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi in his vehicle after being attacked at a rally in Milan
Assault : Mr Berlusconi appeared shaken as he was rushed to hospital
He spent a quiet , if painful , night in hospital last night and is having trouble eating , his personal doctor said today .
He is also suffering from a severe headache .
However his friends are rallying around him - a spokesman said French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Vladimir Putin have both already phoned to commiserate with Mr Berlusconi .
His doctor , Alberto Zangrillo , said the premier 's injuries would take at least 15 days to heal .
Berlusconi , a popular but divisive figure , said ' I 'm fine , I 'm fine ' as he arrived at the hospital yesterday .
He reportedly asked to be brought newspapers upon waking up , no doubt wanting to read coverage of the assault on the front pages .
Berlusconi was attacked when a man stepped from the crowd , dodging bodyguards , before smashing the politician in the face - apparently while clutching a model of the city 's Duomo cathedral in his clenched fist .
The prime minister told an Italian TV presenter visiting him in hospital that he considered it ‘ miraculous ’ not to have lost an eye in the attack .
‘ This is truly a bad day for Italy , and it 's the duty of all the political forces to ensure that Italy does not go back to the years of violence , ’ Gianfranco Fini , Berlusconi 's top conservative ally , said .
The moment Mr Berlusconi is struck in the face by a statuette
Help : Bodyguards surround the prime minister
The incident triggered an outpouring of solidarity for Berlusconi from allies and critics , just as the prime minister seeks to regain political momentum after a bruising year battling mounting legal troubles and sex scandals .
Allies blamed the assault on an atmosphere of hatred swirling around the billionaire businessman .
‘ What they 've done to Berlusconi is an act of terrorism , ’ Umberto Bossi , head of the far - right Northern League and a close Berlusconi ally , said .
‘ An oppressive climate has been felt for some time and what 's happened today is a worrying sign . ’
The attacker , named last night as Massimo Tartaglia , was arrested by police and taken away .
Just a reprint .
What do I think ?
Well , I would like the titled material to be analogous to chloroephedrine , but this is just a salt of the amine using acetic as the acid , a result of the isolation process from pills .
Much of it is in traffic in Mexico ; apparently the superlabs also purchase material which at one time was in pills .

All you people who want an easy meth systhesis – They do n’t exist !
You have to know some chemistry .
Learn some ( yes it takes some discipline ) or be doomed to fail .
So , again , this information is posted for information purposes only .
I accept no responsibility for anyone actually using this .
If you do you will be subject to state and federal laws and will be subject to fines and / or imprisonment .
If you are stupid enough to actually manufacture meth you WILL probably go to prison .
This is the 90’s .
So to make meth from ephedrine - Using l- or pseudo ephedrine place 1000 gms of ephedrine , 250 gms of red phosphorus , and 1000 ml of hydriotic acid in a suitable round bottom flask .
Fit the flask with a reflux condenser and reflux the mixture for 48hrs at 120 degrees C. Add a 10 % solution of sodium hydroxide until the Ph is 14 .
You should get an oil layer and a water layer .
Separate the oil layer in a separatory funnel and put it a flask with 3 volumes of water .
Rig the flask for distillation and distill the oil water mixture until the oil is mostly gone ( except for highly colored globs of oil . )
In the reciever flask there should be two layers , an upper oil layer and a lower water layer .
Separate the oil layer and mix it with 10 % hydrochloric acid until the Ph is 7.6 .
evaporate the water and it will crystallize into methamphetamine hcl .
——
“ We have observed that mixtures containing red phosphorus , iodine and either concentrated HCl or glacial acetic acid do convert ephedrine to methamphetamine ; however , when the phosphorus is omitted , methamphetamine is not formed .
Ephedrine was reacted with red phosphorus and iodine in refluxing water , varying the ratios of red phosphorus and iodine ; when red phosphorus and iodine are in excess of ephedrine in a 1:3.8:7.2 molar ratio ( ephedrine : red phosphorus : iodine ) methamphetamine is formed and the ephedrine is consumed in 8 hours . ”
Anyone have any thoughts , experience with the typical E - RP - HA when the usually separate step of creating the hydriotic acid is omitted and the three chemicals are just reacted in refluxing water .
It seems like that is what is being described ( along with acid substitution ) .
——
Materials :
1. 30 ml bottle tincture iodine containing 2 % iodine , sodium iodide 2.4 % , alcohol 47 % , rest H20
2. 5 Sinustop Herbal Decongestant tablets containing 60mg crystaline pseudoephedrine HCl each mixed with some herbal ingrediants .
Or 300 mg of ephedrine obtained thru some other method .
3. 5 road flares .
4. Bottle of drain cleaner containg conc .
H2SO4
5 . Bottle white distilled vinegar
6. Red devil Lye containing sodium hydroxide
7. Spray can of brake cleaner containing 1,1,1 trichloroethylene or 1,1,1 trichloroethane
Procedure :
A. Purifying pseudoephedrine :
1 . Take the 5 decongestant capsules , empty their contents into a small funnel with a coffee filter .
Pour 50 ml of cold water through the filter , and collect the liquid in a small jar .
2 . Add a 1 / 4tsp of lye to the collected liquid .
You should immediately smell the odor of ephedrine .
3 . Put the resultant solution in another small jar , and add 50ml of brake cleaner , then close the lid and shake vigorously .
Let stand so that the layers seperate .
4 . Using a turkey baster , suck up the bottom brake cleaner layer out of the jar and put it into a small bowl .
5 . Add 50 ml of vinegar and heat the resultant mixure over low heat in a frying pan with 1/2 inch of water .
Thus a water bath .
Do not use a gas stove , since the brake cleaner vapors will produce toxic phosgene if there is contact with a flame .
Instead use a hot plate or electric stove at low heat only .
6 . Heat the bowl in the water bath until no more liquid is left .
At the bottom will be a solid layer of a pseudoephedrine acetate .
B. Preparing the red phosphorus :
1. Scrape the red phosphorus off of the caps of the 5 flares and store for later use .
You should get about 0.1g per flare .
C. Preparing the iodine / HI solution :
1 . Pour the entire bottle of the iodine tincture into a small ceramic bowl .
Heat on the above type water bath until no more alcohol is left .
Let cool , put in a small polyethylene jar , and add 0.1 ml of the H2SO4 drain cleaner .
Thats about 1 / 4inch of liquid in the end of an eye dropper .
This converts the sodium iodide to HI .
You now have a solution of iodine and HI .
2 . Add the red phosphorus , and heat bottle in a water bath until the purple iodine color goes away .
D. The reaction :
1 . Add the pseudoephedrine acetate to the solution of HI / I and phosphorus , and heat on a water bath for 24 hours .
E : Extraction :
1 . Cool the reaction solution and add 1 / 2tsp of lye .
Take the solution and perform steps A3 - A6 .
2 . You will end up with methamphetamine acetate that you can scrape from the bowl .
Congradulations !
You have circumvented all of law enforcement and have greatly contributed to the end of the “ drug war ” .
( or contributed to the outlaw of all flares , iodine tincture , vignegar , drain cleaners , and auto store chemicals and coffee filters as will happen in the next year )
Best regards , Cousin Singe

FAQ fodder …
If methamphetamine looks waxy or oily , it is probably contaminated with the HI salt of meth , an oily by - product of the red- phosphorous / HI reduction of ephedrine –the most prevalent method of clandestine manufacture .
The HI salt is soluble in acetone , while the HCL salt is only very slightly soluble .
The HI salt could be washed out , basified , and then precipitated with HCl gas to give methamphetmine HCL .
When completely dry , methamphetamine HCL is soluble in chloroform , while ephedrine HCL is not .
This would provide a convenient method of separation .

Mexico meth raid yields $ 205 million in U.S. cash
Authorities say it ’s the largest drug money haul in history and reflects a vast global trade .
Gang said to supply U.S .
By Hector Tobar and Carlos Martinez Times Staff Writers
March 17 , 2007
MEXICO CITY – Authorities confiscated more than $ 200 million in U.S. currency from methamphetamine producers in one of this city ’s ritziest neighborhoods , they said Friday , calling it the largest drug cash seizure in history .
The seizure reflected the vast scope of an illegal drug trade linking Asia , Mexico and the United States , officials said .
Two of the seven people arrested Thursday at a faux Mediterranean villa in the Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhood were Chinese nationals .
The group was part of a larger drug - trafficking organization that imports “ precursor chemicals ” from companies in India and China for processing into methamphetamine in Mexican “ super labs , ” authorities said .
The methamphetamine is eventually sold in the United States .
The raid resulted from an investigation that began in December , when authorities seized 19 tons of pseudoephedrine , a cold medicine that is a key ingredient in the production of methamphetamine , at a Mexican port on the Pacific Coast .
A legally registered Mexican company , listed by a trade association as the country ’s third - largest importer of pseudoephedrine , was implicated , officials said .
Mexican drug - trafficking organizations have become increasingly important in the U.S. methamphetamine trade , because the U.S. has imposed tougher controls on the sale of the chemicals used to produce the highly addictive drug .
President Felipe Calderon hailed the seizure as a major development in his government ’s war on drug traffickers , who have ravaged several Mexican cities and towns .
“ We are working in a decisive manner to save our country and to keep Mexico safe and clean , ” Calderon told an audience in Tijuana .
“ I do n’t even want to imagine how many young people this gang poisoned with its drugs .
But I can assure you , they will do it no longer . ”
Mexican officials said the cash seized was mostly in U.S. $ 100 bills and weighed at least 4,500 pounds .
“ Kudos for the Mexicans , ” said Donald C. Semesky , financial operations chief for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
“ They ’re very serious in this effort , and we commend them . ”
U.S. officials said that , if confirmed , the cash seizure would be several times larger than any other made from drug traffickers .
A spokesman for the Mexican attorney general ’s office said that experts were still analyzing the $ 205.6 million in cash to check for counterfeits but that the bills appeared to be legitimate .
Officials with the attorney general ’s organized crime unit used a moving truck , guarded by a 25 patrol - car caravan , to take the money to its headquarters .
Authorities said the traffickers were led by a naturalized Mexican citizen of Chinese descent who appeared to have left the country .
Several machines for manufacturing pills were found at the site , but the group did not produce drugs there .
The mansion appeared to serve as a financial operations center and cash storage facility .
Exclusive neighborhood
The neighborhood is home to some of the capital ’s wealthiest residents and many members of the diplomatic corps .
The back of the property is contiguous with a racquetball court at the Ukrainian ambassador ’s residence .
The Israeli Embassy is a few blocks away .
Most neighbors and the many maids and security guards who work in the area declined to comment on the raid .
The few who did said they had no knowledge of illicit activity .
“ The problem is that all of these houses are veritable fortresses , ” said one of the neighborhood ’s security guards , who asked not to be named .
“ You never know what goes on inside .
The doors open automatically .
The owners all have chauffeurs .
People go in and out , and you never see anything . ”
A driver - bodyguard arrested at the house had told neighbors he was a retired lieutenant colonel in the Mexican army .
Neighbors said he walked a German shepherd along the tree - lined streets .
Authorities said the chain of events that brought police to the mansion began in December , when they discovered a shipping container filled with barrels of pseudoephedrine on a storage lot at customs offices in Lazaro Cardenas , a port city about 175 miles northwest of Acapulco .
The chemicals had been manufactured in China and shipped to Mexico on a British - flagged vessel that was bound for Long Beach .
The seizure led authorities to a chemical company , Unimed Pharm Chem , based in the city of Toluca , about 40 miles west of Mexico City .
The company reported legally importing 32 tons of pseudoephedrine in 2004 .
“ The resulting investigation showed that this company illegally imported … pseudoephedrine acetate from India , ” the attorney general ’s office said in a statement .
“ These chemicals are used to illegally produce methamphetamines . ”
Mexican Atty Gen. Eduardo Medina Mora said in a radio interview that one of the Chinese exporters involved in shipping the chemicals to Mexico is an illicit “ shadow ” company not registered with Chinese authorities .
Last year , Mexican authorities raided what they termed the largest methamphetamine lab in the Western Hemisphere at an industrial park in Guadalajara .
The factory had 11 custom - designed pressure cookers capable of producing 400 pounds of the drug each day , about 20 times the production of a typical California lab .
U.S. officials estimate that 80 % of the methamphetamine sold on U.S. streets is produced by Mexican criminal organizations .
For these drug cartels , whose business mushroomed when they became the middlemen in the shipment of Colombian cocaine to the United States , methamphetamine is a lucrative side business worth billions of dollars , analysts say .
Officials at the DEA ’s Office of Financial Operations estimated that 90 % of the money transferred from the United States to Latin American suppliers of drugs leaves the U.S. as cash .
Drug traffickers transfer $ 8 billion to $ 24 billion to Mexico each year , according to authorities .
$ 100 bills preferred
Most of the cash is carried across the U.S. - Mexico border by car or on foot as $ 10 and $ 20 bills and later converted to $ 100 bills , officials say .
Semesky said $ 100 bills are the preferred method for making large payments between drug organizations , because they are less bulky .
With $ 20 bills , $ 1 million weighs 110 pounds .
“ They do n’t want to build a storage location for 20s , ” the DEA ’s Semesky said of the drug traffickers .
“ You ’re talking about decreasing that bulk at least five times . ”
Before Friday , the largest reported amount of cash seized by Mexican authorities was $ 7 million , which was found inside electric appliances at Mexico City ’s international airport in 2005 .
The appliances were headed for Colombia .
Mexican officials said they worked past midnight Thursday to count the seized bills , which were hidden inside locked metal shelves , suitcases and closets .
It was five times the amount that was seized in all of 2006 by Mexican authorities in anti-narcotic and money - laundering operations .
To provide a sense of the scale of the money involved , Mexican media compared the amount seized to various items in the 2007 federal budget .
The $ 205.6 million was more than the funding allocated to pensions for the handicapped by Mexico ’s social security agency .
It exceeded the amount of public funds provided to Mexico ’s political parties for campaign spending and also surpassed the budget of the Mexican Senate .
“ It ’s a lot of money , and we did n’t know a thing , ” said one security guard assigned to a nearby property .
“ We work outside and ca n’t even imagine what goes on inside these houses . ”

A new job posting on Apple 's site suggests that the company is preparing to add still and video camera capabilities to its iPad tablet device in the future .
The position is for a quality assurance engineer in the Media Systems division of Apple 's broader Interactive Media Group and is specifically focused on the " iPad Media " segment of the division .
The Media Systems team is looking for a software quality engineer with a strong technical background to test still , video and audio capture and playback frameworks .
Build on your QA experience and knowledge of digital camera technology ( still and video ) to develop and maintain testing frameworks for both capture and playback pipelines .
According to the job description , the employee will be responsible for assisting the development team by testing performance of their systems and developing appropriate tools for performing the testing .
Familiarity with and interest in photography , video as well as media file formats is highly desirable .
Experience with tuning of and image pipeline , including , but not limited to AWB , Color Correction , AutoExposure , FrameRate adjustments is a plus .
The lack of a camera has been seen by many observers as a significant disappointment for the iPad .
It does appear , however , that the iPad 's enclosure contains an empty space appropriate for a notebook - style iSight camera , and the resulting speculation has included thoughts that Apple had either planned to offer a camera in the iPad but pulled it for unknown reasons or is still planning to offer one in the shipping version but did not include discussion of it during the device 's introduction for similarly unknown reasons .
While most in the media business continue to deny the problem of liberal bias , a number of journalists have admitted that the majority of their brethren approach the news from a liberal angle .
Examples :
“ You know , it ’s fairly well discussed inside CBS News that there are some managers recently who have been so ideologically entrenched that there is a feeling and discussion that some of them , certainly not all of them , have a difficult time viewing a story that may reflect negatively upon government or the administration as a story of value ....
They never mind the stories that seem to , for example — and I did plenty of them — go against the grain of the Republican Party .... I did n’t sense any resistance in doing stories that were perceived to be negative to the Bush administration — by anybody , ever .
I have done stories that I perceived were not received well because people thought they would reflect poorly upon this [ the Obama ] administration . ”
— Former CBS
News investigative correspondent Sharyl Attkisson on CNN ’s Reliable Sources , April 20 , 2014 .
“ There is no doubt that the press failed to scrutinize this program [ ObamaCare ] at the time of passage and during the context of the President ’s re-election .
I think any reporter who would argue otherwise would be putting their head in the sand . ”

Buzzfeed ’s Michael Hastings : “ The presence of Obama , even on the press corps , even on the people who follow him every day , when they ’re near him , they lose their mind sometimes .
You know , they start behaving in ways that are juvenile and amateurish .

“ So many [ reporters and editors ] share a kind of political and cultural progressivism — for lack of a better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of the Times .
As a result , developments like the Occupy movement and gay marriage seem almost to erupt in the Times , overloved and undermanaged , more like causes than news subjects . ”

“ Ultimately journalism has changed .... Partisanship is very much a part of journalism now . ”
— CBS Corporation Chairman and CEO Les Moonves as quoted in a June 7 , 2012 Los Angeles Times story by Robin Abcarian and Kathleen Hennessey .
“ I think that the media is as divided on this issue [ of gay marriage ] as the Obama family — which is to say not at all .
And so he ’s never going to get negative coverage for this .... When you have almost the entire media establishment on your side on an issue in a presidential campaign , it ’s very hard to lose politically . ”
— Mark Halperin on MSNBC ’s Morning Joe , May 10 , 2012 .
“ Are reporters biased ?
There is no doubt that —
I ’ve worked at the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Post , and worked here at Politico .

“ If the 2012 election were held in the newsrooms of America and pitted Sarah Palin against Barack Obama , I doubt Palin would get 10 percent of the vote .
However tempting the newsworthy havoc of a Palin presidency , I ’m pretty sure most journalists would recoil in horror from the idea . ”
— New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller in a column for the paper ’s June 19 , 2011 Sunday Magazine .
“ You guys talk about her [ Sarah Palin ] a lot , we write about her a lot , yet if you talk to any single reporter at any media organization that we ’re aware of , I do n’t think that anyone thinks she can be President or should be President . ”

" The mainstream press is liberal .... Since the civil rights and women 's movements , the culture wars and Watergate , the press corps at such institutions as the Washington Post , ABC - NBC-CBS News , the NYT , the Wall Street Journal , Time , Newsweek , the Los Angeles Times , the Boston Globe , etc. is composed in large part of ' new ' or ' creative ' class members of the liberal elite — well - educated men and women who tend to favor abortion rights , women 's rights , civil rights , and gay rights .
In the main , they find such figures as Bill O'Reilly , Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , Pat Robertson , or Jerry Falwell beneath contempt ....
If reporters were the only ones allowed to vote , Walter Mondale , Michael Dukakis , Al Gore , and John Kerry would have won the White House by landslide margins . "

" I 'll bet that most Post journalists voted for [ Barack ] Obama .
I did .

" If you were going to events during the primaries , what you saw was that the executive editors and the top people at the networks were all rushing to Obama events , bringing their children , celebrating it , saying they were , there 's this part of history .... The American people are smart , they can see this .
That 's why Obama 's on every magazine cover ....
There 's no question in my mind the media has been more supportive of Senator Obama . "
— NPR's Juan Williams on Fox News Sunday , October 26 , 2008 .
" Many in the media have been one - sided , sometimes adding to Obama 's distortions rather than acting as impartial reporters of fact and referees of the mud fights ....
We hear a lot less about Democratic sins such as President Clinton 's distortions of Bob Dole 's position on Medicare in 1996 and the NAACP 's stunningly scurrilous ad campaign in 2000 associating George W. Bush 's opposition to a hate crimes bill with the racist murderers who dragged James Byrd behind a truck . "

" From a reporter 's point of view , it 's almost hard to remain objective because it 's infectious , the energy , I think .

He feeds off that . "
— NBC reporter Lee Cowan in an MSNBC.com video about the Obama campaign posted January 7 , 2008 .
" If we wore our politics on our sleeves in here , I have no doubt that in this and in most other mainstream newsrooms in America , the majority of those sleeves would be of the same color : blue .
Survey after survey over the years have demonstrated that most of the people who go into this business tend to vote Democratic , at least in national elections .
That is not particularly surprising , given how people make career decisions and that social service and activism is a primary driver for many journalists . "

" I do n't know if it 's 95 percent ...[ but ] there are enough [ liberals ] in the old media , not just in ABC , but in old media generally , that it tilts the coverage quite frequently , in many issues , in a liberal direction ....

And again , it 's the reason why for 40 years , conservatives have rightly felt that we did not give them a fair shake . "
— ABC News political director Mark Halperin appearing on The Hugh Hewitt Show , October 30 , 2006 .
" The elephant in the newsroom is our narrowness .
Too often , we wear liberalism on our sleeve and are intolerant of other lifestyles and opinions ....

I 've been in communal gatherings in The Post , watching election returns , and have been flabbergasted to see my colleagues cheer unabashedly for the Democrats . "

" There is , Hugh , I agree with you , a deep anti-military bias in the media .
One that begins from the premise that the military must be lying , and that American projection of power around the world must be wrong .
I think that that is a hangover from Vietnam , and I think it 's very dangerous .
That 's different from the media doing it's job of challenging the exercise of power without fear or favor . "
— ABC News White House correspondent Terry Moran talking with Los Angeles - based national radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt , May 17 , 2005 .

" I worked for the New York Times for 25 years .
I could probably count on one hand , in the Washington bureau of the New York Times , people who would describe themselves as people of faith .... I think one of the real built - in biases in the media is towards secularism .... You want diversity in the newsroom , not because of some quota , but because you have to have diversity to cover the story well and cover all aspects of a society .
And you do n't have religious people making the decisions about where coverage is focused .
And I think that 's one of the faults . "
— Former New York Times reporter Steve Roberts , now a journalism professor at George Washington University , on CNN's Reliable Sources , March 27 , 2005 .
" Personally , I have a great affection for CBS News ....
But I stopped watching it some time ago .
The unremitting liberal orientation finally became too much for me .
I still check in , but less and less frequently .
I increasingly drift to NBC News and Fox and MSNBC . "

Jerusalem ( CNN ) --
An Israeli man accused of having 21 wives and fathering 49 children was charged Sunday in a Tel Aviv court with multiple counts of sexual assault , rape , sodomy and enslavement .
Goel Ratzon , 60 , was arrested last month .
Authorities charge that he lived in a compound with the 21 wives , having convinced them that he was omnipotent .
All the wives tattooed Ratzon 's name and picture on their arms and the children 's names are all derivatives of his name , according to the court papers .
Ratzon married his first wife in 1972 , added a second wife in the early 1980s , and from 1991 added another 19 wives , according to the indictment .
He persuaded the women that he had the power to heal and curse , through which he gained " complete control of their lives , desires , thoughts , emotions and actions , " the court papers say .
Ratzon spoke in court for first time last week , saying he was innocent , that everything was done with consent , and that any women who wished to leave could do so , Israeli media reported .
The indictment charges that the defendant " captured the women in a ' pseudo - family ' structure that revolved around the worship of his image , making the birth of his children a supreme goal that the women must aspire to , and all this was to glorify him while serving and fulfilling all his needs . "
Ratzon demanded that his wives and children completely obey all of his orders and has stringent rules and had a penalty system if they disobeyed him , the indictment alleges .
He also " abused his wives by trampling their self - worth and cut them off from any outside social contact including their families , and by this enslaved them to him and his desires , " the court papers say .
The indictment includes allegations of rape and sodomy of two of his daughters , sexual assault of another daughter , and rape , assault and sodomy of four other girls .
Beyond the mental and physical control Ratzon had over his wives , he effectively controlled all of their finances , the indictment says .
The women deposited major chunks of their social security payments and salaries into the family 's account , paid for all of his living expenses and bought him all his property and anything he demanded , authorities charge .
Ratzon 's cult has been known to the authorities for about 10 years , they said , but it was only about six months ago they succeeded in convincing one of the women to file a complaint .
That brought about his arrest last month .

Iran ’s so - called green movement is not yet a counterrevolution , but recent developments make clear it is heading in that direction .
Seven months after the uprising began , an opposition manifesto is finally taking shape , and its sweeping demands would change the face of Iran .
Three bold statements calling for reform have been issued since Friday , one by opposition presidential candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi , one by a group of exiled religious intellectuals and the third by university professors .
Taken together , they suggest that the movement will not settle for anything short of radical change .
The statements set tough preconditions for a political truce : resignation of the current leadership , introduction of broad democratic freedoms , prosecution of security forces engaged in violence against the opposition and an end to politics in the military , universities and the clergy .
The proposed reforms would amount to a total overhaul of the system .
But they also reflect a common desire to prevent an all - out confrontation by engaging the regime in compromise and ending the escalating violence .
The three sets of demands all accept that Iran will remain an Islamic republic , if largely in name only .

The three statements offer the outside world the first concrete indication of what the opposition wants and what Iran might look like if the opposition prevails .
Just as striking is the fact that several branches of the opposition are developing a voice despite the increasingly brutal crackdown by an increasingly militarized regime .
The boldest statement was issued Sunday by five exiled religious intellectuals who founded diverse parts of the reform movement in the 1990s .
Many of today ’s opposition activists are their progeny as students , colleagues , political allies and friends .
Their 10 - point manifesto begins by calling for the resignation of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose reelection in June sparked an outpouring of public rage over alleged fraud .
It calls for the abolishment of clerical control of the voting system and candidate selection , replacing it with an independent voting commission that includes the opposition and protesters .
The authors also demand the release of all political prisoners and recognition of law - abiding political , student , nongovernmental and women ’s groups as well as labor unions .
They call for an independent judiciary , including popular election of the judicial chief , and freedom for all means of mass communication .
They even demand term limits for elected officials .
The five authors include philosopher Abdulkarim Soroush , the father of the reform movement ; dissident cleric Mohsen Kadivar ; former parliamentarian and Islamic Guidance Minister Ataollah Mohajerani ; investigative journalist Akbar Ganji , who was imprisoned for six years for reporting on regime corruption ; and Abdolali Bazargan , an Islamic thinker and son of a former prime minister .

They issued the manifesto on a website run by Kadivar and Mohajerani to mark the green movement ’s growing maturity , Soroush explained in an interview Monday .
“ The green movement is known only for its demonstrations and protests , not its ideas , so it was time to explain its political demands , ” he said .
The manifesto also carries a message to the green movement ’s widely diverse followers .
“ Some people expected the green movement to do miracles , to do the impossible .
We wanted to make it clear that it ’s a democratic movement , and if it has a godfather , it is Gandhi , ” Soroush said .
“ We are insisting adamantly that democratic , nonviolent change is at the heart of this movement .
That will minimize the violence from the other side , which is ready to engage in any kind of violence . ”
All five of the manifesto’s exiled authors , most of them titans of Iran ’s 1979 revolution and major figures in earlier governments , remain connected to the opposition at home .
In a separate statement , opposition leader Mousavi , whose defeat by Ahmadinejad in the June 12 presidential election sparked the current uprising , made some of the same demands in more general terms .
“ What we want is a government and system that is honest and supportive , and is based on votes of people , one that looks at variety in the votes and ideas of people as an opportunity instead of a threat , ” he wrote Friday in a long statement on his website .

In Iran , Mousavi called for the government both to be held accountable “ for the troubles it has caused ” and to establish wide freedoms of press , speech , assembly , protest and independent political activity .
Acknowledging new calls for his arrest and execution , he added that he was willing to die for the cause .
In another statement Monday , 88 professors at Tehran University -- the country ’s largest and most prestigious education center -- called on Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , to end violence against the opposition , which they described as a sign of the regime ’s weakness .
They also daringly demanded that the supreme leader order the release of detained students and called for the prosecution of those who harassed , beat , detained or tortured in prison the protesters .
All three statements reflected an increase in defiance on the part of the opposition .
“ The hatred and resentment that has built up against the regime in the past three decades has deep roots , ” warned the manifesto from the five exiled leaders , who claim to speak for the opposition and have written the most extensive and combative of the statements .
“ The discontent has a great destructive power and can unleash a vast wave of violence throughout society . ”
In blunt terms , they also warned Iran ’s supreme leader -- who has the powers of an infallible political pope -- that ignoring the escalating demands of the opposition will only “ deepen the crisis with painful consequences ” for which he would ultimately be accountable .

Species name : Syringammina fragilissima
Habitat : The sea floor around Europe and north Africa .

In the late summer of 1882 , a ship called the Triton cruised the chilly seas north of Scotland .
As it went , it dredged the sea bed for specimens of unknown creatures , under the guidance of the oceanographer John Murray .
Two of the specimens were strange enough that Murray sent them to his colleague Henry Brady for examination .
They were chunks of sand a few centimetres across , lightly cemented together and filled with a network of hollow branching tubes .
The samples were fragile and had been badly broken , but Brady was able to identify them as a new species , which he called Syringammina fragilissima : “ very fragile sand pipe ” .
A better name would have been very fragile sand beach ball , but Brady did n’t see the organism underwater .
It turns out that Murray and Brady had discovered the first specimen of an entirely new group of organisms , the single - celled xenophyophores .
Shunning the convention that single cells are microscopic , Syringammina is a brute , growing to a width of 10 centimetres – and sometimes even twice that .
Crusty and slimy
The cell branches and splits into hundreds of tubes , which ramify and interconnect in a hugely complex network .
It also bends the single - cell convention of having only a single nucleus : Syringammina has many , scattered throughout the tubes .
As the cell proliferates , it builds up a crusty structure around itself , called the test – this is what Murray ’s expedition found .
To build it , the cell secretes a slimy organic cement , which it uses to stick together tiny particles of sediment .
The tests made by Syringammina are by far the largest structures created by any single cell .
The actual cell may not be as big – as the test gets ever larger , the cell will abandon parts of it , which may be taken over by a range of tiny animals , such as nematodes .
A study of a similar species , which was observed through a time - lapse camera for eight months , showed that the creature built itself up in fits and starts : it would grow for a few days , then remain the same size for a few months , then have another growth spurt .
Syringammina may do the same thing ; we do n’t know .
Known unknowns
In fact , there is very little about the monstrous beach ball cell that we do know .
Let us count the ways .
We do not know how it reproduces .
The group it belongs to , the xenophyophores , is part of a much larger group called the foraminiferans , and these often switch between sexual and asexual reproduction .
Syringammina may well do the same thing .
We do not know how it feeds .
It may be a suspension feeder , pumping water through its body and sifting out tiny particles of food , or it may poke out a “ limb ” to pick up food from the sea bed .
Farm animal
Another possibility has been put forward by Ole Tendal of the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen , Denmark : Syringammina may farm bacteria .
Within the tubes of the test , Syringammina accumulates particles of waste , which it stitches together into long strings .
Syringammina might use these strings to cultivate bacteria .
The waste pellets would provide food for the bacteria , which the Syringammina could then eat .
There is some tentative evidence to support this .
A 2004 study found that Syringammina contains unusually high levels of certain fatty acids that are characteristic of bacteria .
One more mystery .
Scattered throughout the Syringammina cell – and indeed through the cells of all xenophyophores – are tiny crystals of barium sulphate .
They could be a waste product , or ballast , or something altogether different .
We have no idea .
Google 's Nexus One Android phone could end up being a miss for the search company with the golden touch .
About 20,000 Nexus
Ones were sold in the first week , compared to 250,000 for the Motorola Droid and 1.6 million for Apple 's iPhone 3G S , estimates Flurry , an analytics company that tracks the usage of developer applications on iPhone and Android platform .
The shockingly low number , if true , means the Motorola Droid outsold the Nexus One more than 12 times and the iPhone 3G S had 80 times the sales of the Nexus One in its first week .
" As a product , the Nexus One boasts the most advanced Android OS to date as well as unique features , " says Peter Farago , vice - president of marketing in a blog post on Flurry .
" However , potentially due to the heightened promise created by early buzz , the handset has ultimately fallen short on sales expectations . "
Google declined to comment .
" We are not disclosing sales data for Nexus One phones , " says a company spokesperson .
Google introduced the Nexus One on January 5 as the first Android device that would be sold by the search company itself , rather than a manufacturing or carrier partner .
The Nexus One , which runs Android 2.1 , has been designed by HTC and works with T - Mobile ’s network in the United States .
The device retails for $ 180 with a 2 - year T - Mobile contract , while an unsubsidized version is available for $ 530 .
But you can only get the Nexus On through Google 's online store , and only if you 're in the United States , for now .
The iPhone 3G S was available in eight countries at launch .
The move has sparked complaints from users unhappy with the poor customer support from Google , which offers no phone or in - store help .
Nexus
One has also faced device - related issues , such as its inability to effectively connect to T - Mobile 's 3G network and complaints about the touchscreen .
All that may have taken a toll on the Nexus One 's popularity among consumers .
Google 's phone also lacks the " ' wow ' factor that is now expected with each new challenger to the iPhone , " says Farago .
The Nexus One has a vivid , crisp OLED display and a 1 - GHZ Snapdragon processor that makes it the fastest on the market .
It includes voice recognition , turn - by - turn navigation from Google Maps and improvements to the user interface in the form of the latest version of the Android operating system .
Still , most of it is seen by analysts as an " evolutionary " improvement and one that 's not enough to compel customers to overwhelm Google 's online store .
Google 's online launch of the Nexus One could also be blamed for the slow sales .
" It 's a very different go - to - market strategy compared to Verizon 's launch of Droid , on which it spent a record - breaking $ 100 million on marketing , including aggressive TV advertising spends , " says Farago .

Tsutomu Yamaguchi , the only person officially recognised as a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings at the end of the second world war , has died aged 93 .
Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima on a business trip for his shipbuilding company on 6 August 1945 , when a US B - 29 dropped the first atomic bomb on the city .
He suffered serious burns to his upper body and spent the night in Hiroshima .
He then returned to his hometown of Nagasaki , about 190 miles southwest , which suffered a second US atomic bomb attack three days later .
On August 15 , 1945 , Japan surrendered , ending the war .
Nagasaki 's mayor today said " a precious storyteller " had been lost , in a message posted on the city 's website .
Yamaguchi died on Monday morning of stomach cancer , the Mainichi , Asahi and Yomiuri newspapers reported .
Yamaguchi was the only person to be certified by the Japanese government as having been in both cities when they were attacked , although other dual survivors have been identified .
" My double radiation exposure is now an official government record .
It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die , " Yamaguchi told the newspaper Mainichi last year .
In his later years , Yamaguchi gave talks about his experiences as an atomic bomb survivor and often expressed his hope the weapons would be abolished .
He spoke at the United Nations in 2006 , wrote books and songs about his experiences , and appeared in a documentary about survivors of both attacks .
Last month he was visited in the hospital by the filmmaker James Cameron , director of Titanic and Avatar , who is considering making a movie about the bombings , according to Mainichi .
Immediately after the war , Yamaguchi worked as a translator for American forces in Nagasaki and later as a junior - high - school teacher .
Japan is the only country to have been attacked with atomic weapons .
About 140,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki .
Yamaguchi is one of about 260,000 people who survived the attacks .
Some bombing survivors have developed various illnesses from radiation exposure , including cancer and liver illnesses .
Certification as an atomic bomb survivor in Japan qualifies individuals for government compensation , including monthly allowances , free medical checkups and funeral costs .
Assume you could plug a synthesizer into the internals of your computer 's CPU , what would you hear ?
Noise and cacophony would be an intuitive first guess , and probably correct if you would hear the sound in real time .
But if we slow down the CPU to approximately 3500 operations per second , we just about might assume the CPU 's computation could contain all essential ingredients of music : rhytm and repetition caused by iteration , melodies caused by various mechanisms that change a value incrementally , and harmonies caused by some mechanism of excluding values , such as memory alignment .
Since I was n't able to open a live CPU without making it slightly disfunctional in the process , I took Valgrind to the rescue : I wrote a little object code instrumentation tool , " skin " as Valgrind authors call them , which logs into a file all values I wish to follow when executing the software with which I wish to have a Close Encounter of the Third Kind .
A little more code to generate sound and movies of the values .
Here 's what one would here if the bits one to seven in the result of each addition and subtraction would indicate a very short ping .
All those bits being zero corresponds to the barely audible 24.5 Hz , or the sub- contra G. Roughly ten highest notes are unfortunately ultrasound , but this was nevertheless the best representation I could come up with .

NOTE :
columnist Molotov Mitchell says that Uganda has it right , the Bible clearly calls for homosexuals to put to death .
If gay Ugandans do n't like that , they can just leave .
And that America 's Founding Fathers had it right too , because was a death penalty for gays in the original colonies .
Mitchell says that by being willing to kill homosexuals , Ugandans are now " more American that Americans " and he closes by quoting Martin Luther King : " The moral arm of the universe is long , but it bends towards justice .
" This piece first appeared to little notice on WND several weeks ago , but has just been posted to YouTube .
Mitchell 's ranting is yet another another example of the recent ramping up of violently anti-gay rhetoric from the Christianist right .
The American Family Association thinks gays should all be imprisoned and forcibly subjected to " reparative therapy . "
The Family Research Council says that gays are inherent rapists who can't be trusted around soldiers .
Mission America says that protecting gay kids from beatings in school is a fascist idea .
And now a columnist from the most widely read Christian site in the nation is calling for us to be put to death .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Canada ’s minority Conservative government , which a few months ago seemed on the verge of having enough popular support to win a majority in Parliament , has seen its lead in one poll fall back to the lowest point since last summer .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper speaks during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa in this December 9 , 2009 file photo .
REUTERS / Chris Wattie
An EKOS survey released on Thursday showed Conservative support at 33.1 percent , down 2.8 percentage points from the last EKOS poll on December 17 , and support for the Liberals , the biggest opposition party at 27.8 percent , up 1.1 percent .
The Conservatives ’ lead had been as high as 15 percentage points in mid-October , when voters reacted negatively to Liberal threats to trigger an election .
EKOS , which polled 1,744 Canadians in an automated telephone survey , said that no single issue has dragged down support for the Conservatives .
However , it said that the decision by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to suspend -- or prorogue -- Parliament until March , effectively shutting down opposition criticism , has added to the decline in the party ’s popularity .
The opposition parties had been hammering away at the Conservatives over allegations that Afghan prisoners that the Canadian military handed over to Afghan authorities in 2006 and 2007 were subsequently tortured .
“ Certainly , the prorogation maneuver is drawing near universal raspberries outside of the shrinking CPC ( Conservative Party of Canada ) base , ” EKOS President Frank Graves said in a statement .
He added that the Conservative defections generally seemed to be going more to the left - of - center New Democratic Party ( NDP ) and the Green Party than to the Liberals , and it “ may be that voters are still punishing the Liberals for their election threat . ”
NDP support was at 16 percent in the poll , which was down 1 percent .
The poll said the Greens , which have no seats in Parliament , may be at a high water mark at 13.4 percent , “ but if they can grow another point or two , they really will bear watching . ”
The Greens were up 2.2 percent from a week earlier .
The separatist Bloc Quebecois -- which runs only in the French - speaking province of Quebec -- was at 9.8 percent support , up 0.6 percent .
The EKOS survey was conducted between January 4 and January 5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points 19 times out of 20 .

Well , that did n’t take long :
The WISE spacecraft ( Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer ) spotted its first near - Earth asteroid on January 12 , 2010 , two days before the official start of its all - sky survey .
That ’s a pretty good catch , considering WISE just popped it lens cover a couple of weeks ago ( December 29 , 2009 ) and released its “ first light ” image on January 6 .
This is the first of what researchers hope will be thousands of previously undiscovered asteroids in the main asteroid belt , and hundreds of new near - Earth asteroids .
By mapping the whole sky in infrared light , it should also be able to capture millions of new stars and galaxies .
WISE ’s software picked up the object , 2010 AB78 , moving against a background of stationary stars .
Researchers followed up and confirmed the discovery with the University of Hawaii ’s 2.2 - meter ( 88 - inch ) visible - light telescope near the summit of Mauna Kea .
This asteroid does not pose any foreseeable impact threat to Earth , but scientists will continue to monitor it .
2010 AB78 is currently about 158 million kilometers ( 98 million miles ) from Earth .
It is estimated to be roughly 1 kilometer ( 0.6 miles ) in diameter and circles the sun in an elliptical orbit tilted to the plane of our solar system .
The object comes as close to the sun as Earth , but because of its tilted orbit , it is not thought to pass near our planet .

For the first time in the history of its testing , the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) has found bisphenol A ( BPA ) in the umbilical cord blood of American babies .
Nine out of ten samples tested positive for the chemical , a shocking number when considering the laundry list of chronic illnesses that are associated with BPA exposure .
Used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins , BPA has come under increasing scrutiny over the past several years for its role in contributing to the development of cancer , endocrine damage , reproductive problems , and neurological dysfunction .
Many plastics manufacturers have begun removing the additive from their products , despite continued reassurances by the FDA that the chemical is safe .
Studies continue to show that BPA is dangerous , even at minimal levels , and that it should not be used in consumer products .
Several groups , including the Endocrine Society and the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , have expressed opposition to the use of BPA .
Scientists are finding that low - dose exposure , especially during early developmental years , can actually cause more endocrine and reproductive problems than larger - dose exposure due to the way the body recognizes the chemical .
Not only was BPA found in babies , but 231 other chemicals were detected as well , indicating that human beings are exposed to more toxic chemicals than ever .
Experts fear that such an onslaught of toxicity may cause permanent damage to the next generation of Americans .
Public outcry over the FDA 's continued approval of BPA despite numerous studies revealing its dangers has led the agency to express that it will reevaluate its position .
The agency was supposed to issue an updated review about BPA safety on November 30 but it never actually followed through .
The FDA most recently claimed that the report will be made available before the end of the year .
Experts and analysts believe the food industry is behind the push to keep BPA legal , exerting influence on the FDA to conceal the truth about its dangers .
Many manufacturers have voluntarily been able to eliminate BPA from their products , illustrating that there is no reason why it should continue to be used by anyone .
The AMA , the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have all endorsed a resolution that calls on Congress to minimize or eliminate the use of BPA in consumer products .
The EWG hopes that top priority will be given to the issue in light of the group 's recent discovery .

President Barack Obama will take questions from Senate Democrats on television this week at their retreat , Majority Leader Harry Reid 's ( D - Nev. ) office announced Tuesday .
Obama will speak to the 60 - member Senate Democratic Caucus on Wednesday morning during their retreat at the Newseum here in D.C .
The speech will be followed by a question - and - answer period , which will be televised , as was Obama 's Q&A with House Republicans at their retreat last Friday .
The nonpartisan political network C- SPAN announced the session would be televised in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon :
Watch C- SPAN 2 LIVE at 10 am Weds as President Obama addresses and takes questions from Senate Democrats at their retreat in DC .
Pundits on both sides of the aisle had welcomed the televised exchange with Republicans , and the White House said it hoped for a similar , televised session with Senate Republicans .
The session with Democrats will be the second such session in less than a week .
Obama took questions from members of the House Democratic Caucus during their speech , though that session was behind closed doors .

The Shape of Jobs to Come with its headline - grabbing list of exotic new roles in science was based on flimsy research , says nanoscientist James Hayton
It 's a big issue : how to stimulate interest in science and inspire the next generation to follow a scientific career .
With the aim of doing just that , the government - backed Science : [ So what ?
So everything ] campaign last month released a list of 20 possible future jobs , based upon expected advances in science and technology .
The exotic list , from " body - part maker " to " space architect " , generated huge media interest , and was publicly endorsed by prime minister Gordon Brown , science minister Lord Drayson , and Stephen Fry , who supports the Science : So What campaign .
The list was based on a lengthy commissioned report , entitled The Shape of Jobs to Come , researched and written by a futurist consultancy called Fast Future .
Unfortunately , despite the best intentions of Science : So what ?
( SSW ) , there were major flaws in Fast Future 's research .
My own attention was caught by the job of " nano - medic " in the list of 20 future jobs .
The description claimed that " sub-atomic devices and treatments could transform personal healthcare so we would need a new breed of nano medicine specialists to administer these treatments . "
It is , and forever will be , impossible to make devices smaller than an atom .
Although this mistake has since been acknowledged and partially corrected , trying to trace the source of this job description revealed a huge amount about Fast Future 's practices .
For a whole page of information about nano - medicine , there is a single referenced source : a web page whose only mention of nano - medicine is the phrase " Nano - sized machines to deliver health .
' Nuff said . "
This is indicative of the general quality of sources used in Fast Future 's research .
For the job of " memory augmentation surgeon " , the sole source is an IT consultancy company – no reference to any neurological research into the physical basis of memory itself .
Virtual clutter organisers ?
The only cited reference is a named head and neck surgeon who suggests the role .
The job already exists anyway , but the use of informal suggestions as sole sources of information is pretty poor practice in any field of research .
Rohit Talwar , CEO of Fast Future and co-author of the report , gave the following explanation for the consultancy 's choice of source information ( you can see his full response here ) :
" [ A ] key approach in futures research is to look for ' weak signals ' .
Citing websites , news reports and blogs is an accepted best practice in horizon scanning where you are looking for these weak signals of what 's coming next .
These weak signals often pre-date any hard academic literature , which is why futures work deliberately draws on a range of sources not just published academic literature .
In many cases there may only be one source or opinion from which you are working . "
This is not the case for the jobs listed .
Taking nano - medicine as an example , there are thousands of research papers and quality media reports about the role .
In this instance , Fast Future is working from only one source of information not out of necessity , but out of choice .
It could easily have referred to academic review papers , which provide expert summaries of peer - reviewed research , or consulted directly with scientists themselves .
It did n't , and the result is a report lacking in any real insight , because Fast Future does n't seem to have looked at the subjects in any detail .
Worse still , where there is relevant information in the cited sources , it has been copied and pasted directly into the job descriptions that were the basis of all the publicity .
Take this description of quarantine enforcer , a job that is unlikely to inspire kids to take up science and would probably never exist as a specialised career anyway :
" If a deadly virus starts spreading rapidly , few countries , and few people , will be prepared .
Nurses will be in short supply .
And as death rates rise , and neighborhoods are shut down , someone will have to guard the gates . "
Compare this to the source , an article on Forbes magazine 's website :
" If a deadly virus starts spreading rapidly , few countries , and few people , will be prepared .
That 'll be good for certain occupations .
Nurses will be in short supply .
And when people really start dying , and neighborhoods are shut down , someone will have to guard the gates . "
This is not the only example of cut - and - paste .
Reading the press release , or SSW 's page , would n't it be reasonable to assume that the descriptions are Fast Future 's own work , based upon extensive research from a number of reliable sources ?
Independently of my own articles on this issue on the 10 minus9 blog , EvidenceMatters put together a detailed and highly critical analysis of the future jobs report , revealing yet more flaws in Fast Future 's methods .
Meanwhile , Holford Watch asked the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , which funds the SSW campaign , for a response to the various concerns raised .
It stands by the report :
" This work is a speculative look to the future and does not inform policy or impact on government funding decisions .
The report was checked by the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills and felt to be rigorous and credible for the purposes we required . "
This standard of rigour and credibility shows a great deal about the department 's attitude towards the promotion of science .
If the purpose of the report was to inspire the next generation of scientists , or even to stimulate interest in science , it is essential to look at some of the incredible work being done by scientists and the real benefits we might gain .
If promoting science is important , then so is the quality of the material commissioned to this end .
Personally , I find it deeply disappointing and frustrating that public money has been used to cobble together a report in such a sloppy manner .
" That 'll do " just is n't good enough .

Vector is a Haskell library for working with arrays .
It has an emphasis on very high performance through loop fusion , whilst retaining a rich interface .
The main data types are boxed and unboxed arrays , and arrays may be immutable ( pure ) , or mutable .
Arrays may hold Storable elements , suitable for passing to and from C , and you can convert between the array types .
Arrays are indexed by non-negative Int values .
The vector library has an API similar to the famous Haskell list library , with many of the same names .
This tutorial is modelled on the NumPy tutorial .
Quick Tour
Here is a quick overview to get you started .
Importing the library
Download the vector package :
$ cabal install vector
and import it as , for boxed arrays :
import qualified Data .
Vector as V
or :
import qualified Data .
Vector .
Unboxed as V
for unboxed arrays .
The library needs to be imported qualified as it shares the same function names as list operations in the Prelude .
Generating Vectors
New vectors can be generated in many ways :
$ ghci GHCi , version 6.12 . 1 : http :// www . haskell .
org / ghc / :? for help Loading package ghc - prim ... linking ... done .
Loading package integer - gmp ... linking ... done .
Loading package base ... linking ... done .
Loading package ffi - 1.0 ... linking ... done .
Prelude > : m + Data .
Vector --
Generating a vector from a list : Prelude Data .
Vector > let a = fromList [ 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ] Prelude Data .
Vector > a fromList [ 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector --
Or filled from a sequence Prelude Data .
Vector > enumFromStepN 10 10 4 fromList [ 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector --
A vector created from four consecutive values Prelude Data .
Vector > enumFromN 10 4 fromList [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector
You can also build vectors using operations similar to lists :
-- The empty vector Prelude Data .
Vector > empty fromList [ ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector --
A vector of length one Prelude Data .
Vector > singleton 2 fromList [ 2 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector --
A vector of length 10 , filled with the value ' 2 ' --
Note that to disambiguate names , -- and avoid a clash with the Prelude , -- with use the full path to the Vector module Prelude Data .
Vector > Data .
Vector .
replicate 10 2 fromList [ 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector
In general , you may construct new vectors by applying a function to the index space :
Prelude Data .
Vector > generate 10 ( ^ 2 ) fromList [ 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 , 36 , 49 , 64 , 81 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector
Vectors may have more than one dimension :
--
Here we create a two dimensional vector , 10 columns , -- each row filled with the row index .
Prelude Data .
Vector > let x = generate 10 ( \ n -> Data .
Vector .
replicate 10 n ) --
The type is " Vector of Vector of Ints " Prelude Data .
Vector > : t x x :: Vector ( Vector Int )
Vectors may be grown or shrunk arbitrarily :
Prelude Data .
Vector > let y = Data .
Vector .
enumFromTo 0 11 Prelude Data .
Vector > y fromList [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector --
Take the first 3 elements as a new vector Prelude Data .
Vector > Data .
Vector .
take 3 y fromList [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] :: Data .
Vector .

Modifying vectors
Just as with lists , you can iterate ( map ) over arrays , reduce them ( fold ) , filter them , or join them in various ways :
-- mapping a function over the elements of a vector Prelude Data .
Vector > Data .
Vector . map ( ^ 2 ) y fromList [ 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 , 36 , 49 , 64 , 81 , 100 , 121 ] :: Data .

Indexing vectors
And like all good arrays , you can index them in various ways :
-- Take an arbitrary element Prelude Data .
Vector > y ! 4 4 -- Take the last element Prelude Data .
Vector > Data .

The Tutorial
The vector package provides several types of array .
The most general interface is via Data .
Vector , which provides for boxed arrays , holding any type .
There are also more specialized array types :
which provide unboxed arrays ( i.e. no closures ) and storable arrays ( data that is pinned , and may be passed to and from C via a Ptr ) .
In all cases , the operations are subject to loop fusion .
That is , if you compose two functions ,
map f . map g
the compiler will rewrite it into a single traversal :
map ( f . g )
saving time and space .
Simple example
You can create the arrays in many ways , for example , from a regular Haskell list :
Prelude Data .
Vector > let a = fromList [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] Prelude Data .
Vector > a fromList [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector Prelude Data .
Vector > : t a a :: Vector Integer
GHCi will print the contents of the vector as executable code .
To create a multidimensional array , you can use a nested list generator to fill it :
Prelude Data .
Vector > let x = fromList [ fromList [ 1 .. x ] | x <- [ 1 .. 10 ] ] Prelude Data .
Vector > : t x x :: Vector ( Vector Integer )
-- XXX TODO need a better printing function for multidimensional arrays .
You can also just create arrays filled with zeroes :
Prelude Data .
Vector > Data .
Vector .
replicate 10 0 fromList [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector
And you can fill arrays from a sequence generator :
Prelude Data .
Vector > enumFromN 1 10 fromList [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector Prelude Data .
Vector > enumFromStepN 0 10 10 fromList [ 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 ] :: Data .

Array Types
The vector package provides several array types , with an identical interface .
They have different flexibility with respect to the types of values that may be stored in them , and different performance characteristics .
In general :
End users should use Data .

Unboxed
Simple , atomic types , and pair types can be stored in a more efficient manner : consecutive memory slots without pointers .
The Data . Vector .
Unboxed .
Vector type provides unboxed arrays of types that are members of the Unbox class , including :
Bool
()
Char
Double
Float
Int
Int8 , 16 , 32 , 64
Word
Word8 , 16 , 32 , 64
Complex a's , where 'a ' is in Unbox
Tuple types , where the elements are unboxable
Unboxed arrays should be preferred when you have unboxable elements , as they are generally more efficient .
Storable Arrays : passing data to C
Storable arrays ( Data.Vector.Storable.Vector ) are vectors of any type in the Storable class .
These arrays are pinned , and may be converted to and from pointers , that may be passed to C functions , using a number of functions :
unsafeFromForeignPtr :: Storable a => ForeignPtr a -> Int ->
Int ->
Vector a -- Create a vector from a ForeignPtr with an offset and a length .
The data may -- not be modified through the ForeignPtr afterwards .
unsafeToForeignPtr :: Storable a => Vector a -> ( ForeignPtr a , Int , Int ) --
Yield the underlying ForeignPtr together with the offset to the data and its -- length .
The data may not be modified through the ForeignPtr. unsafeWith :: Storable a => Vector a -> ( Ptr a -> IO b ) ->
IO b --
Pass a pointer to the vector 's data to the IO action .
The data may not be -- modified through the ' Ptr .
Storing your own types in Storable vectors
You can store new data types in Storable vectors , beyond those for instances that already exist , by writing a Storable instance for the type .
Here we store a 4 - element Double vector as the array element .
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} import Data .
Vector .
Storable import qualified Data.
Vector .
Storable as V import Foreign import Foreign .
C.Types --
Define a 4 element vector type data Vec4 = Vec4 {-# UNPACK #-} ! CFloat {-# UNPACK #-} ! CFloat {-# UNPACK #-} ! CFloat {-# UNPACK #-} !
CFloat
Ensure we can store it in an array
instance Storable Vec4 where sizeOf _ = sizeOf ( undefined :: CFloat ) * 4 alignment _ = alignment ( undefined :: CFloat ) {-# INLINE peek #-} peek p = do a <- peekElemOff q 0 b <- peekElemOff q 1 c <- peekElemOff q 2 d <- peekElemOff q 3 return ( Vec4 a b c d ) where q = cast Ptr p {-# INLINE poke #-} poke p ( Vec4 a b c d ) = do pokeElemOff q 0 a pokeElemOff q 1 b pokeElemOff q 2 c pokeElemOff q 3 d where q = cast Ptr p
And now we can write operations on the new vector , with very good performance .
a = Vec4 0.2 0.1 0.6 1.0 m = Vec4 0.99 0.7 0.8 0.6 add :: Vec4 -> Vec4 -> Vec4 {-# INLINE add #-} add ( Vec4 a b c d ) ( Vec4 a ' b' c' d' ) = Vec4 ( a + a ' ) ( b + b' ) ( c + c ' ) ( d + d' ) mult :: Vec4 -> Vec4 -> Vec4 {-# INLINE mult #-} mult ( Vec4 a b c d ) ( Vec4 a ' b' c' d' ) = Vec4 ( a * a ' ) ( b * b ' ) ( c * c' ) ( d * d' ) vsum :: Vec4 -> CFloat {-# INLINE vsum #-} vsum ( Vec4 a b c d ) = a + b + c + d multList :: Int -> Vector Vec4 -> Vector Vec4 multList !
count !
src | count <= 0 = src | otherwise = multList ( count - 1 ) $ V . map ( \ v -> add ( mult v m ) a ) src main = do print $ Data .
Vector .
Storable . sum $ Data .
Vector .
Storable . map vsum $ multList repCount $ Data .
Vector .
Storable .
replicate arraySize ( Vec4 0 0 0 0 ) repCount , arraySize :: Int repCount = 10000 arraySize = 20000
Pure Arrays
Impure Arrays
Arrays can be created and operated on in a mutable fashion -- using destructive updates , as in an imperative language .
Once all operations are complete , the mutable array can be " frozen " to a pure array , which changes its type .
Mutable arrays plus freezing are quite useful for initializing arrays from data in the outside world .
For example , to fill a generic array , we first
allocate an empty vector of size n
destructively update the cells using a generator function
freeze the array and return it as a pure value .
import qualified System .
Random .
Mersenne as R import qualified Data .
Vector .
Generic as G import qualified Data .
Vector .
Generic .
Mutable as GM random :: ( R . MTRandom a , G . Vector v a ) => R . MTGen ->
Int ->
IO ( v a ) random g n = do v <- GM .
new n fill v 0 G . unsafeFreeze v where fill v i | i < n = do x <- R . random g GM .
unsafeWrite v i x fill v ( i + 1 ) | otherwise = return ()
Here we use the Data .
Vector .
Generic .Mutable.new to allocate a new , uninitialized array , which we then write elements to ( using unsafeWrite ) .
By using the generic interface , we can construct boxed , storable or unboxed arrays all from the same code .
Some examples
The most important attributes of an array are available in O ( 1 ) time , such as the size ( length ) ,
-- how big is the array ?
Prelude Data .
Vector > let a = fromList [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] Prelude Data .
Vector > Data .
Vector .
length a 10 -- is the array empty ?
Prelude Data .
Vector > Data .
Vector .
null a False
Array Creation
Enumerations
The most common way to generate a vector is via an enumeration function :
enumFromN
enumFromStepN
And the list - like :
enumFromTo
enumFromThenTo
The enumFrom *N functions are guaranteed to optimize well for any type .
The enumFromTo functions might fall back to generating from lists if there is no specialization for your type .
They are currently specialized to most Int / Word / Double / Float generators .
> enumFromN 1 10 fromList [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] > enumFromStepN 1 3 4 fromList [ 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 ] > Data .
Vector .
enumFromTo 1 10 fromList [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] -- counting backwards > Data .
Vector .
enumFromThenTo 10 9 1 fromList [ 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ]
A note on fusion
As for almost all vector functions , if an enumerator is composed with a traversal or fold , they will fuse into a single loop .
For example , we can fuse generation of an array of doubles , with computing the product of the square roots .
The source program consists of two loops :
import qualified Data .
Vector as V test :: V . Vector Int ->
Double test = V . foldl ( \ a b -> a * sqrt ( fromIntegral b ) ) 0 create :: Int -> V . Vector
Int create n = ( V . enumFromTo 1 n ) main = print ( test ( create 1000000 ) )
And after optimization ( revealed with the ghc - core tool ) , we have only one loop :
main_ $ s $ wfoldlM_loop :: Int # ->
Double # ->
Double # main_ $ s $ wfoldlM_loop = \ ( sc_sWA :: Int # ) ( sc1_sWB :: Double # ) -> case <=# sc_sWA 1000000 of _ { False -> sc1_sWB ; True -> main_ $ s $ wfoldlM_loop ( +# sc_sWA 1 ) ( *## sc1_sWB ( sqrtDouble # ( int2Double # sc_sWA ) ) ) }
Doubling the performance , by halving the number of traversals .
Fusion also means we can avoid any intermediate data structure allocation .
An example : filling a vector from a file
We often want to populate a vector using a external data file .
The easiest way to do this is with bytestring IO , and Data .
Vector.unfoldr ( or the equivalent functions in Data .
Vector .
Unboxed or Data .
Vector .
Storable :
Parsing Ints
The simplest way to parse a file of Int or Integer types is with a strict or lazy ByteString , and the readInt or readInteger functions :
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} import qualified Data.ByteString .
Lazy .
Char8 as L import qualified Data .
Vector as U import System .
Environment main = do [ f ] <- getArgs s <- L . read
File f print .
U . sum .
parse $ s --
Fill a new vector from a file containing a list of numbers .
parse = U . unfoldr step where step !
s = case L . readInt s of Nothing -> Nothing Just ( ! k , ! t ) ->
Just ( k , L . tail t )
Note the use of bang patterns to ensure the parsing accumulated state is produced strictly .
Create a data file filled with 1 million integers :
$ seq 1 1000000 > data
Compile with - Odph ( enables special optimizations to help fusion ) :
$ ghc - Odph -- make vector.hs
Run :
$ time ./ vector data 500000500000 ./ vector data 0.08s user 0.01s system 98 % cpu 0.088 total
Parsing Floating Point Values
To load a file of floating point values into a vector , you can use bytestrings and the bytestring - lexing package , which provides readDouble and readFloat functions .
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} import qualified Data.ByteString .
Lazy .
Char8 as L import qualified Data.ByteString.Lex .Lazy .
Double as L import qualified Data .
Vector as U import System .
Environment main = do [ f ] <- getArgs s <- L . read
File f print .
U . sum .
parse $ s --
Fill a new vector from a file containing a list of numbers .
parse = U . unfoldr step where step !
s = case L . readDouble s of Nothing -> Nothing Just ( ! k , ! t ) ->
Just ( k , L . tail t )
Parsing Binary Data
The best way to parse binary data is via bytestrings and the Data .
Binary package .
There are instances of Binary and Serialize available in the vector - binary - instances package .
An example : parsing a list of integers in text form , serializing them back in binary form , then loading that binary file :
{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-} import Data .
Vector .
Binary import Data .
Binary import qualified Data.ByteString .
Lazy .
Char8 as L import qualified Data .
Vector .
Unboxed as V main = do s <- L . readFile " dat " let v = parse s :: V . Vector Int encodeFile " dat2 " v v' <- decodeFile " dat2 " :: IO ( V . Vector Int ) print ( v == v' ) --
Fill a new vector from a file containing a list of numbers .
parse = V . unfoldr step where step !
s = case L . readInt s of Nothing -> Nothing Just ( ! k , ! t ) ->
Just ( k , L . tail t )
Random numbers
If we can parse from a file , we can also fill a vector with random numbers .
We 'll use the mersenne - random package :
$ cabal install mersenne - random
We can then use MTRandom class to generate random vectors of different types :
import qualified Data .
Vector .
Unboxed as U import System .
Random .
Mersenne import Control .
Monad main = do -- create a new source of randomness -- and an infinite list of randoms g <- newMTGen Nothing rs <- randoms g -- fill a vector with the first 10 random
Ints let a = U .
fromList ( take 10 rs ) :: U . Vector Int -- print the sum print ( U . sum a ) -- print each element forM_ ( U . toList a ) print
Running it :
$ runhaskell B . hs - 56426044567146682 - 2144043065897064806 - 2361203915295681429 1023751035988638668 - 5145147152582103336 6545758323081548799 - 7630294342751488332 - 5861937811333342436 - 3198510304070719259 8949914511577398116 - 8681457396993884283
We can also just use the vector - random package to generate new vectors initialized with the mersenne twister generator :
For example , to generate 100 million random Doubles and sum them :
import qualified Data .
Vector .
Unboxed as U import System .
Random .
Mersenne import qualified Data.Vector .Random .
Mersenne as G main = do g <- newMTGen Nothing a <- G . random g 10000000 :: IO ( U . Vector Double ) -- 100 M print ( U . sum a )
Filling with a monadic action
We might want to fill a vector with a monadic action , and have a pure vector at the end .
The Vector API now contains a standard replicateM for this purpose , but if your monadic action is in IO , the following code is more efficient :
replicateMIO :: ( G . Vector v a ) =>
Int -> IO a -> IO ( v a ) replicateMIO n a = do v <- M . new n fill v 0 G . unsafeFreeze v where fill v i | i < n = do x <- a M . unsafeWrite v i x fill v ( i + 1 ) | otherwise = return ()
Transformations on Vectors
A primary operation on arrays are the zip class of functions .
> let a = fromList [ 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 ] > let b = enumFromN 0 4 > a fromList [ 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 ] > b fromList [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] > Data .
Vector .
zipWith ( - ) a b fromList [ 20 , 29 , 38 , 47 ]
We can also , of course , apply a function to each element of a vector ( map ) :
> Data .
Vector . map ( ^ 2 ) b fromList [ 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 ] > Data .
Vector . map ( \ e -> 10 * sin ( fromIntegral e ) ) a fromList [ 9.129452507276277 , - 9.880316240928618 , 7.451131604793488 , - 2.6237485370392877 ] > Data .
Vector . map ( < 35 ) a fromList [ True , True , False , False ]
Folds : Sums , Products , Min , Max
Many special purpose folds ( reductions ) on vectors are available :
> let a = enumFromN 1 100 > Data .
Vector . sum a 5050 > Data .
Vector .
product a 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000 >

Vector .
minimum a 1 > Data .
Vector .
maximum a 100
Indexing , Slicing and Iterating
One dimensional arrays can be indexed , sliced and iterated over pretty much like lists .
Because Haskell values are by default immutable , all slice operations are zero -copying .
> let a = enumFromN 0 10 > a fromList [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] > let b = Data .
Vector . map ( ^ 3 ) a > b ! 2 8 > slice 2 3 b fromList [ 8 , 27 , 64 ]
slice takes 3 arguments : the initial index to slice from , the number of elements to slice , and the vector to operate on .
A number of special - purpose slices are also available :
> Data .
Vector .
init b fromList [ 0 , 1 , 8 , 27 , 64 , 125 , 216 , 343 , 512 ] > Data .
Vector .
tail b fromList [ 1 , 8 , 27 , 64 , 125 , 216 , 343 , 512 , 729 ] > Data .
Vector .
take 3 b fromList [ 0 , 1 , 8 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector > Data .
Vector .
drop 3 b fromList [ 27 , 64 , 125 , 216 , 343 , 512 , 729 ] :: Data .
Vector .
Vector
Unsafe Slices
For performance reasons you may wish to avoid bounds checks , when you can prove that the substring or index will be in bounds .
For these cases there are unsafe operations , that let you skip the bounds check :
> let a = fromList [ 1 .. 10 ] > unsafeSlice 2 4 a fromList [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] > unsafeInit a fromList [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] > unsafeTail a fromList [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ]
and also unsafeTake , unsafeDrop .
Examples
Sum of Squares
Take the sum of the squares of the elements of a vector :
sumsq :: U . Vector Int ->
Int sumsq v = U . sum ( U . map ( \ x -> x * x ) v )

We are speeding toward an economic cliff because our government can't practice restraint .
We spend so much more than we take in because politicians at every level use the public treasury to win elections .
The public mostly accepts lavish promises of more and more federal spending because the cost of government has been so effectively divorced from what actually comes out of our paychecks .
Ask almost anyone how they did on their taxes and you 're likely to hear a happy exclamation that the taxpayer got a little money back !
But ask the same person how much they paid the government over the year in withheld income and payroll taxes and you 'll often see a blank look .
When the money that government spends seems so unconnected to the money we earn it is easy for many to see government expenditures as " free money . "
It 's not , but the engineered divorce in perception between the fruits of our labors and spending by elected officials has resulted in a national debt that equals more than $ 500,000 per American household .
If not for accounting sleights - of - hand the national debt would be seen as much higher than even the shocking figure of more than $ 12 trillion .
As my father , Ronald Reagan , once said , " Our federal tax system is , in short , utterly impossible , utterly unjust and completely counterproductive , it reeks with injustice and is fundamentally un-American . . .
It has earned a rebellion and it's time we rebelled . "
I agree and that 's why I am enthusiastically now helping FairTax.org with pending legislation to replace the income tax entirely with a fair , progressive and honest national consumption tax aptly called the FairTax .
It ends all federal taxes on income and earnings and replaces every penny now raised with a 23 % tax on personal consumption at the point of final retail sale .
In conducting research on the FairTax , I have become convinced of two things : the FairTax is the best way to create a new era of healthy American economic growth , and that my father would have been a strong proponent of the FairTax as a tax reform / replacement model had it existed during his time in government .
Among many virtues , like the effect the FairTax will have on bringing trillions of private , job - producing investment dollars into our economy , the FairTax restores critically needed transparency to government spending .
Because the taxpayer sees the cost of government on every receipt , the relationship between personal earnings and government spending becomes crystal clear .
This will inevitably lead to public pressure to restrain spending — and not a moment too soon .
Workers take home paychecks free of federal withholding and FICA taxes under the FairTax .
This is a stimulus idea that we all need .
Congressional corruption of the tax code disappears under the FairTax because there are no exemptions that can be expanded and sold for profit and power by tax writing committees to the favored few .
In essence , those who spend more pay higher taxes .
Instead of exemptions that can be manipulated by Congress , the FairTax issues a monthly " prebate " check that covers the taxes we will pay on the necessities of life and which wipes out all federal taxes on spending up to the poverty level .
In addition , hidden income - tax costs now embedded in the price of products we pay will also be eliminated and brought into the bright light of public scrutiny .
When you consider that fat cats , illegal immigrants and the underground economy all become part of the tax base , as consumers , it is easy to see that we can all pay less of a share for government .
It 's just a better , more honest and simple way to collect federal taxes , and one that makes April 15 just another spring day .
It 's time for the second American tax revolt and that 's why I am helping lead the FairTax national movement and encouraging everyone to join the cause by visiting www.fairtax.org.

Messages from a long - lost universe ( Image : Tim Gravestock )
At first , there did n’t seem anything earth - shattering about the tiny point of light that pricked the southern Californian sky on a mild night in early April 2007 .
Only the robotic eyes of the Nearby Supernova Factory , a project designed to spy out distant stellar explosions , spotted it from the Palomar Observatory , high in the hills between Los Angeles and San Diego .
The project ’s computers automatically forwarded the images to a data server to await analysis .
The same routine kicks in scores of times each year when a far - off star in its death throes explodes onto the night sky , before fading back to obscurity once more .
But this one did not fade away .
It got brighter .
And brighter .
That ’s when human eyes became alert .
The supernova finally reached its peak brightness after 77 days .
After 200 days – long after most supernovae have dwindled back into obscurity – it was still burning brightly .
Only in October 2008 , an unprecedented 555 days after it was first spotted , had it faded enough for the supernova hunters to call off their observations .
Digesting what they had seen took longer still .
SN 2007bi , as dry protocol labelled the event , was one of the most extreme explosions ever recorded , of that there was no doubt .
It was so intense that it did n’t fit any model of how normal stars die .
But then , it was rapidly becoming clear that , in life as in death , this had been no normal star .
If the interpretation of what popped up that April night is correct , this was a star that should not have existed , …

Artist Caleb Larsen has created an art sculpture which , when connected to the Internet , perpetually attempts to sell itself on eBay .
Combining Robert Morris’ Box With the Sound of Its Own Making with Baudrillard ’s writing on the art auction this sculpture exists in eternal transactional flux .
It is a physical sculpture that is perpetually attempting to auction itself on eBay .
Every ten minutes the black box pings a server on the internet via the ethernet connection to check if it is for sale on the eBay .

Jace Hall Show : Felicia Day Light Saber Fight
Jace and Felicia fight to the death !
Splendid news on the health front this week , as it has emerged that drinking beer is good for you - and that soft drinks will kill you .
First up the beer research , carried out by researchers in California .
It seems that the nutritious , health - giving stuff is actually a key source of silicon in the diet , which ( it turns out ) is vital for healthy bones .
" The factors in brewing that influence silicon levels in beer have not been extensively studied , " said Charles Bamforth , lead author of the study .
" We have examined a wide range of beer styles for their silicon content and have also studied the impact of raw materials and the brewing process on the quantities of silicon that enter wort and beer . "
According to the beery boffins :
Beer appears to be a major contributor to Si intake ... moderate beer consumption may help fight osteoporosis , a disease of the skeletal system characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue .
Bamforth and his colleagues , having tested a wide variety of different tipples , recommended " highly hopped " varieties as being best for the bones .
" Beers containing high levels of malted barley and hops are richest in silicon , " the doc said .
Meanwhile , other topflight boffins have discovered that the swilling of pop is a fantastically unhealthy thing to do .
Research reveals that drinking just two cans of soft drink a week will double your risk of pancreatic cancer .
" The high levels of sugar in soft drinks may be increasing the level of insulin in the body , which we think contributes to pancreatic cancer cell growth , " says Dr Mark Pereira of Minnesota Uni .
So there you have it : throw that nasty tin of pop in the bin and quaff a tankard of ale instead , and not only will your pancreas remain your friend but your bones will remain robust and not snap like dry twigs as you age .
The beer research is to be published here ( subscription required ) and the pop study is here ( ditto ) . ®
Alight snow came down in Bucharest , covering the mounds next to freshly dug graves , open and gaping in long straight rows .
“ Here are the fallen , ” intoned a solemn priest as four men placed a wooden coffin before him on a wobbly trestle .
Jacob Stetincu , shot by a sniper , lay wrapped in a thin cotton sheet , wearing a worn blue beret , snowflakes catching in his grayed mustache .
After a hurried sacrament , the men nailed his coffin shut , carried him to the nearest grave -- his widow struggling to keep up -- and shoveled in the heavy earth .
The priest , working in shifts with a dozen of his brethren , was already shaking holy water on the next victim of Nicolae Ceausescu ’s brutal reign .
It was the bitter last day of an epic year , 1989 .
Revolutions had swept across Europe .
From Poland to Hungary to East Germany , communist regimes toppled like proverbial dominoes .
The Berlin Wall was gone , the Cold War over .
And now , the hated regime of Nicolae Ceausescu was gone as well , the only revolution won with blood in the streets .
Abruptly , I felt an overwhelming need to be out of Romania , out of Eastern Europe , before the New Year .
Perhaps it was the visit to the cemetery and the poor innocents being buried in the snow .
“ Revolution overload , ” one friend called it .
The faded Orient Express left for Vienna that night .
Twenty - seven hours later , I walked into my house in Bonn , the capital of what was then still West Germany , in time to join a midnight chorus of friends and neighbors singing “ Auld Lang Syne , ” just as people were in Berlin , Prague , Warsaw and Budapest .
For the newly free peoples of Eastern Europe , this was a moment of celebration .

On Christmas Day in Berlin , Leonard Bernstein had conducted Beethoven ’s Ninth ( “ Ode to Joy ” ) with the word “ joy ” changed to “ freedom . ”
Less than a year later , long - divided Germany would be reunited , and a year after that , the Soviet Union would come undone .
The grim concrete symbol of the world ’s division , East versus West , free and unfree , began its slow fade into historical imagination .
And with it , so did truth .
The recent 20th anniversary celebrations of these epochal events are over .
For Americans , especially , the fireworks and rousing rhetoric recalled victory in an existential struggle -- four decades of Cold War confrontation , trillions of dollars spent on national defense , too many lives lost in shadowy wars overseas .
And in most ways it was a victory .
The year 1989 changed the world .
It moved us from a world of division and nuclear blackmail to one of new opportunity and unprecedented prosperity .
It set the stage for our contemporary era : globalization , the triumph of free markets , the spread of democracy .
It ushered in the great global economic boom that lifted billions out of poverty around the world and established America as the one and only superpower .
Yet it was a dangerous triumph , chiefly because we claimed it for our own and scarcely bothered to fully understand how this great change came to pass .
We told ourselves stick - figure parables of defiance and good - versus - evil triumph , summed up in Ronald Reagan ’s clarion call : “ Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall ! ”

From the vantage point of 20 years , we should be wiser .
The reality is that “ our ” victory in the Cold War was not what we thought it was , nor did it happen the way we think it did .
Most painfully , the myths we spun about it have hurt the world and ourselves .
What are these myths that we embrace as truths ?
First , people power .
Most popular accounts of 1989 come down to a simple plot line : Eastern Europe ’s long - repressed citizens , frustrated by poverty and lack of freedom and inspired by our example , rose up and overthrew their communist overlords .
Well , yes and no .
In East Germany , that is pretty much what happened .
In Hungary , by contrast , change came from the top , as a small cadre of communist reformers threw over the old order and began , quite literally , cutting holes in the Iron Curtain .
In Poland , the activists of the Solidarity trade union sat down with their onetime jailers and agreed to hold elections .
There , democracy came first , and only afterward revolution .

A second myth concerns the role of history .
Americans tend to see the end of communism as foreordained , born of its inherent flaws .
This is the tectonic overview of history as the interplay of great and seemingly inevitable forces .
Seen from the ground , however , it looked very different .
Factors beyond our control figured in the equation as well , not least a drop in oil prices from roughly $ 40 a barrel in 1980 to less than $ 10 a decade later .
And if you were there the night the Berlin Wall fell , you know that it came to pass , in the dramatic way it did , because of a freak accident -- an utterly human blunder .
In a Cold War vignette now become famous , played and replayed on YouTube , the spokesman for the East German Communist Party misread a press release and told his country ’s people they were free to go -- “ immediately , ” as of the night of Nov. 9 , 1989 , and not the next day , when new travel rules were officially supposed to take effect .
In the ensuing administrative chaos , the Berlin Wall “ fell . ”
The iconic pictures of Berliners dancing atop the wall owe as much to happenstance as to culminating history .
A third myth is the most dangerous : the idea of the United States as emancipator , a liberator of repressed peoples .
This crusading brand of American triumphalism has become gospel over the past two decades in certain foreign policy circles , especially among neoconservatives .
For them , the revolutions of 1989 became the foundation of a post - Cold War worldview .
All totalitarian regimes are hollow at the core , they suggest , and will crumble with a shove from the outside .
If the inspiration for this was the Berlin Wall , coming down as Reagan “ ordered , ” the operational model was the mass protests in Romania leading to the violent overthrow of the Ceausescu regime .

“ Once the wicked witch was dead , ” as Francis Fukuyama put it , “ the Munchkins would rise up and start singing joyously about their liberation . ”
It is a straight line from this fantasy of 1989 to the misadventure in Iraq , and beyond .
The theologian Reinhold Niebuhr famously warned about the dangers of “ mis-memory ” or , worse , the deliberate rewriting of history in order to shape the future , much as the old communists tried to do .
The United States contributed uniquely to the end of the Cold War , from the reconstruction of Europe and containment to capitalist economics .
But others “ won ” it , on their own ( and our ) behalf .
Among them were the likes of Jacob Stetincu , all but forgotten in his grave .
Drunk on pride and power , we Americans have tried to rewrite history .
Having got it so wrong , it ’s time to figure out how , and why , and move on .
Michael Meyer , Newsweek ’s bureau chief for Germany and Eastern Europe in 1989 , is the author of “ The Year That Changed the World . ”
I have a mathematical confession : I do n’t trust uncountable sets .
Some time ago on MathOverflow somebody asked what a reasonable definition of “ infinite permutation ” would be .
The first answer that comes to mind is a bijection .
The set of all such bijections does form a group , but not only is it uncountably generated , it contains , as Darsh observes , a copy of every countably generated group ( acting on itself by left multiplication ) .
In particular it contains a copy of the free group on countably many generators .
It also does n’t seem to carry any natural kind of topology .
On the other hand , a much nicer candidate is the set of “ compactly supported ” permutations , i.e. those which fix all but finitely many elements .
This countable group is generated by transpositions and therefore has a neat presentation given by the usual relations .
I believe it ’s also the largest locally finite subgroup of the full group of bijections .
I find this group much more philosophically appealing than the full group of bijections , and the reason is simple : each element of the group is computable .
On the other hand , only countably many elements of the full group of bijections are computable : the rest ca n’t be written down by a Turing machine .
And I do n’t trust anything that ca n’t be written down by a Turing machine .
Corollary : I do n’t trust the real numbers .
Instead of explaining what I mean by this , which I do n’t think I have time for today , I ’ll just throw a question out to the audience : how do you feel about all this ?
Client : “ We like the green , but it ’s just a little too green .
Can you use our green ? ”
Me : “ That is your green . ”
Client : “ Oh , well it looks more limey .
We want it more like our green . ”
Me : “ The limey green is your green .
It is exactly what is used on your logo type . ”
Client : “ Oh , okay , well then can you change it by one ? ”
Me : “ One what ?
Do you want it lighter , or darker ? ”
Client : “ No , just change it by one . ”
Me : “ I do n’t understand what ‘ change it by one ’ means .
I can make it lighter , darker , more yellow , more cyan …
But when I change it , it ’s not going to be the same as your corporate green . ”
Client : “ Okay , well let ’s just change it by one and have a look . ”

Tufts of hair from " Inuk " were found preserved in Greenland 's permafrost DNA analysis of human hair preserved in Greenland 's permafrost has given clues as to what the owner looked like .
A study , published in the journal Nature , says the individual 's genome is the oldest to have been sequenced from a modern human .
The researchers say the man , who lived 4,000 years ago , had brown eyes and thick dark hair , although he would have been prone to baldness .
They say the genome also shows that his ancestors migrated from Siberia .
The man has been named Inuk , which means " human " in the Greenlandic language .
" We wanted to acknowledge that he was from Greenland , even though he is not a direct ancestor of modern Greenlanders , " said Professor Eske Willerslev from the University of Copenhagen , who took part in the study .
They must have crossed either by boat or in the winter time over the ice .
No one knows
Professor Eske Willerslev
The researchers say an analysis of the genome shows that Inuk was from the Saqqaq culture .
The team now has genetic evidence that Inuk 's metabolism and body mass meant he was adapted to living in a cold climate .
The Saqqaq hunted seals and seabirds and relied on the sea for most of their food .
Archaeological remains show they lived in tiny tents in winter .
" It 's a very hostile environment and I was really surprised that people could live up there , " explained Professor Willerslev .
Inuk had shovel - shaped front teeth , according to the research team .
He also had dry earwax , which would have made him more vulnerable to ear infections .
He is thought to have died young because , although his genes show susceptibility to baldness , tufts of thick hair were found .
Siberian connection
The analysis took a year and the genome sequence suggested that the Saqqaq 's closest living relatives were native populations in north - eastern Siberia , such as the Chuckchis and the Koryaks .
The scientists say the Saqqaqs were probably not ancestors of contemporary Inuit or Native American populations .
This suggests , the researchers say , that the Saqqaqs migrated from Siberia to the New World approximately 5,500 years ago .
This would have been independent of the movement that gave rise to modern Native Americans and Inuit .
Professor Willerslev explained that it was not known how the people made the crossing from Siberia to Greenland and Alaska .
" There was no land bridge between Siberia and Alaska at that time , so they must have crossed either by boat or in the winter time over the ice .
No one knows , " he said .
What happened to the Saqqaq people and why they died out also remains a mystery .
" Was it climatic change , was it competition from other cultures coming in ?
We have no idea , " said Professor Willerslev .

Here 's my reading of the situation .
I first contacted Norfolk constabulary a week ago and was told by a very helpful press officer that there was no further statement at that time , but that I should keep getting in touch for further information .
When I asked yesterday if they had at least ascertained if there was a leak or a hacking of the UEA servers , I was sent the statement which has caused so much interest .
In the comments that thread , Jeff Id states that he has heard from Norfolk police too .
My reading of this is that the investigation has barely got off the ground , and some action was perhaps prompted by my questions .
Six weeks on from the breaking of Climategate , it might be seen as slightly embarrassing for the police that they had yet to determine what it is they are investigating , so they have now leapt into action .
Jeff appears to be the only prominent climate blogger contacted directly .
As the person who first received the link to the leaked information , he is an obvious first port of call for the police to get some evidence to point them to the answer to the leak / hack question .
The involvement of the Domestic Extremism Police is probably actually predictable .
As watchers of the deteriorating civil liberties situation in the UK all know , powers granted to the police in the wake of 9/11 in order to fight terrorism are routinely used in the UK for minor crimes .
By bringing in these specialists , Norfolk Police will be able to monitor emails , demand passwords and cryptographic keys and so on .
That these powers are out of all proportion to the alleged crime is of course of no concern to law enforcement officers .
Meanwhile , the involvement of the Information Commissioner is interesting too .
The ICO 's inquiry probably has two distinct focuses .
Firstly they will be investigating if UEA staff were involved in withholding information subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Act .
For the benefit of overseas readers , the latter relates to the maintenance of personal information .
But while there are obvious concerns over the conduct of UEA staff , it is likely that the ICO will also be looking at whether the hack / leak itself also breached the DPA .
While the vast majority of the emails are not personal in nature , there are odd snippets of personal information among all the talk of hiding declines and nobbling journals .
It is likely that these would concern the ICO .
I wonder how long it will be before we get a determination on the hack / leak question ?
Perhaps some of my IT - savvy readers can suggest how difficult it is to determine if one 's server has been hacked ?
( CNN ) --
An Irish atheist group has published a series of quotations on religion in an attempt to challenge a blasphemy law that went into effect on New Year 's Day .
The 25 " blasphemous " quotations include the words of Jesus , Mohammed , Mark Twain , Salman Rushdie and Bjork .
Atheist Ireland published the list on its Web site Friday .
It says it aims to challenge the law , which makes blasphemy a crime punishable by a € 25,000 - ( $ 35,800 ) fine .
" Despite these quotes being abusive and insulting in relation to matters held sacred by various religions , we unreservedly support the right of these people to have published or uttered them , " the group said on the site .
" We unreservedly support the right of any Irish citizen to make comparable statements about matters held sacred by any religion without fear of being criminalized , and without having to prove to a court that a reasonable person would find any particular value in the statement . "
Lawmakers in staunchly Catholic Ireland passed the law in July , but it came into force January 1 .
A person breaks the law by saying or publishing anything " grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion , thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion . "
Those found guilty of breaking the blasphemy law may try to defend themselves by proving that a reasonable person would find literary , artistic , political , scientific or academic value in what they said or published , the law says .
Atheist Ireland called the law " silly and dangerous , " because it provides an incentive for religious outrage .
" We believe in the golden rule : that we have a right to be treated justly , and that we have a responsibility to treat other people justly , " the group said .
" Blasphemy laws are unjust :
They silence people in order to protect ideas .
In a civilized society , people have a right to to express and to hear ideas about religion even if other people find those ideas to be outrageous . "
The group urged the Irish government to repeal the law .
It also asked lawmakers for a referendum on removing all references to God from the Irish constitution .

Area C does n't sound very ominous .
A land of stone - sprinkled grey hills and soft green valleys , it 's part of the wreckage of the equally wrecked Oslo Agreement , accounting for 60 per cent of the Israeli - occupied West Bank that was eventually supposed to be handed over to its Palestinian inhabitants .
But look at the statistics and leaf through the pile of demolition orders lying on the table in front of Abed Kasab , head of the village council in Jiftlik , and it all looks like ethnic cleansing via bureaucracy .
Perverse might be the word for the paperwork involved .
Obscene appear to be the results .
Palestinian houses that cannot be permitted to stand , roofs that must be taken down , wells closed , sewage systems demolished ; in one village , I even saw a primitive electricity system in which Palestinians must sink their electrical poles cemented into concrete blocks standing on the surface of the dirt road .
To place the poles in the earth would ensure their destruction – no Palestinian can dig a hole more than 40 cm below the ground .
But let 's return to the bureaucracy .
" Ro'i " – if that is indeed the Israeli official 's name , for it is difficult to decipher – signed a batch of demolition papers for Jiftlik last December , all duly delivered , in Arabic and Hebrew , to Mr Kasab .
There are 21 of them , running – non-sequentially – from numbers 143912 through 145059 , all from " The High Planning Council Monitoring [ sic ] Sub-Committee of the Civil Administration for the Area of Judea and Samaria " .
Judea and Samaria – for ordinary folk – is the occupied West Bank .
The first communication is dated 8 December , 2009 , the last 17 December .
And as Mr Kasab puts it , that 's the least of his problems .
Palestinian requests to build houses are either delayed for years or refused ; houses built without permission are ruthlessly torn down ; corrugated iron roofs have to be camouflaged with plastic sheets in the hope the " Civil Administration " wo n't deem them an extra floor – in which case " Ro'i 's " lads will be round to rip the lot off the top of the house .
In Area C , there are up to 150,000 Palestinians and 300,000 Jewish colonists living – illegally under international law – in 120 official settlements and 100 " unapproved " settlements or , in the language we must use these days , " illegal outposts " ; illegal under Israeli as well as international law , that is – as opposed to the 120 internationally illegal colonies which are legal under Israeli law .
Jewish settlers , needless to say , do n't have problems with planning permission .
The winter sun blazes through the door of Mr Kasab 's office and cigarette smoke drifts through the room as the angry men of Jiftlik shout their grievances .
" I do n't mind if you print my name , I am so angry , I will take the consequences , " he says .
" Breathing is the only thing we do n't need a permit for – yet ! "
The rhetoric is tired , but the fury is real .
" Buildings , new roads , reservoirs , we have been waiting three years to get permits .
We can not get a permit for a new health clinic .
We are short of water for both human and agricultural use .
Getting permission to rehabilitate the water system costs 70,000 Israeli shekels [ about £ 14,000 ] – it costs more than the rehabilitation system itself . "
A drive along the wild roads of Area C – from the outskirts of Jerusalem to the semi-humid basin of the Jordan valley – runs through dark hills and bare , stony valleys lined with deep , ancient caves , until , further east , lie the fields of the Palestinians and the Jewish settlers ' palm groves – electrified fences round the groves – and the mud or stone huts of Palestinian sheep farmers .
This paradise is a double illusion .
One group of inhabitants , the Israelis , may remember their history and live in paradise .
The smaller group , the Palestinian Arabs , are able to look across these wonderful lands and remember their history – but they are already out of paradise and into limbo .
Even the western NGOs working in Area C find their work for Palestinians blocked by the Israelis .
This is not just a " hitch " in the " peace process " – whatever that is – but an international scandal .
Oxfam , for example , asked the Israelis for a permit to build a 300 m2 capacity below - ground reservoir along with 700 m of underground 4in pipes for the thousands of Palestinians living around Jiftlik .
It was refused .
They then gave notice that they intended to construct an above - ground installation of two glass - fibre tanks , an above - ground pipe and booster pump .
They were told they would need a permit even though the pipes were above ground – and they were refused a permit .
As a last resort , Oxfam is now distributing rooftop water tanks .
I came across an even more outrageous example of this apartheid - by - permit in the village of Zbeidat , where the European Union 's humanitarian aid division installed 18 waste water systems to prevent the hamlet 's vile - smelling sewage running through the gardens and across the main road into the fields .
The £ 80,000 system – a series of 40ft shafts regularly flushed out by sewage trucks – was duly installed because the location lay inside Area B , where no planning permission was required .
Yet now the aid workers have been told by the Israelis that work " must stop " on six of the 18 shafts – a prelude to their demolition , although already they are already built beside the road – because part of the village stands in Area C. Needless to say , no one – neither Palestinians nor Israelis – knows the exact borderline between B and C .
Thus around £ 20,000 of European money has been thrown away by the Israeli " Civil Administration " .
But in one way , this storm of permission and non-permission papers is intended to obscure the terrible reality of Area C. Many Israeli activists as well as western NGOs suspect Israel intends to force the Palestinians here to leave their lands and homes and villages and depart into the wretchedness of Areas B and A .
B is jointly controlled by Israeli military and civil authorities and Palestinian police , and A by the witless Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas .
Thus would the Palestinians be left to argue over a mere 40 per cent of the occupied West Bank – in itself a tiny fraction of the 22 per cent of Mandated Palestine over which the equally useless Yasser Arafat once hoped to rule .
Add to this the designation of 18 per cent of Area C as " closed military areas " by the Israelis and add another 3 per cent preposterously designated as a " nature reserve " – it would be interesting to know what kind of animals roam there – and the result is simple : even without demolition orders , Palestinians cannot build in 70 per cent of Area C .
Car bombs exploded amid busy streets and official buildings in Baghdad this morning , killing at least 127 people and wounding 450 more , in the latest assault on the Iraqi government by militants , according to police officials .
Four car bombs shook the city on its eastern and western sides in the span of about 30 minutes , starting around 10:10 am , police officials said .
One blast gutted portions of the city ’s main courthouse on the western side of the Tigris River ; another lay waste to a street in front of makeshift offices for the Iraqi finance ministry , which had been forced to move employees after a powerful bombing in August ; a third car bomb exploded at a busy intersection as a U.S. convoy passed by ; and a fourth car bomb ripped a main street in the mostly Sunni district of Dura .
It was the third major assault on Baghdad ’s state institutions since August , when a pair of car bombs rocked the foreign and finance ministries , killing at least 100 ; in late October , a pair of car bombs hammered Iraq ’s ministry of justice , the ministry of municipality and Baghdad ’s provincial council -- all three buildings located within the span of a city block -- and claimed the lives of at least 155 people .
Those attacks sabotaged the workings of the government , with some ministries forced to move employees to temporary facilities , and robbed the government of credibility that security had returned to Baghdad .
Today ’s blasts came barely a day after the Iraqi parliament approved a law to hold national elections and marred the day ’s announcement by the Iraqi government that the national vote will be held March 6 .
Previous attacks in August and October have been blamed by government officials on both the late dictator Saddam Husssein ’s Baath party and Al Qaeda in Iraq .
But it is virtually impossible to know who really is to blame .
The government arrested army and police officers after the previous attacks , accusing them of carelessness or even collaboration with those behind the explosions .
Survivors today expressed shock .
“ I never felt so scared in my life .
I lived through wars and served in the military , but today was so terrifying .
Many people were killed and wounded .
Men , women , police and children who sell things , all were killed and injured , ” said Abu Haidar , a shopkeeper in the crowded Shurja district , where the finance ministry ’s offices were targeted .
A bomb device also exploded as a police patrol drove by and wounded four civilians in eastern Baghdad , police said .

Scientists have developed coaxial nanocables : carbon nanotubes coated with titanium dioxide .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
By itself , titanium dioxide ( TiO 2 ) is a very poor electrode .
Electrons move very slowly through the material - so slowly , in fact , that it can take years to fill a millimeter - thick piece of TiO 2 .
However , things change when the TiO 2 is extremely thin : a 10 - nm - thick piece of TiO 2 can be filled with electrons in milliseconds .
Inspired by this ability , scientists have recently investigated whether TiO 2 could be useful for fabricating high - capacity batteries .
A team of scientists , Fei-Fei Cao , et al. , from institutions in China and Germany , have found that applying a thin coat of TiO 2 to the outside of carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) can create coaxial nanocables .
The nanocables can then be formed into a crystalline solid that turns out to be very good at trapping lithium ions and quickly transporting electrons - much better than either TiO 2 or CNTs on their own .
“ On one hand , the CNT core provides sufficient electrons for the storage of lithium in the TiO 2 sheath , ” the researchers wrote in a study published in Chemistry of Materials .
“ On the other hand , the CNT itself can also store lithium whereby this storage kinetics is , in turn , improved by the presence of the nanoporous TiO 2 … [ which ] enables rapid access of lithium - ions from the liquid electrolyte . ”
These symbiotic advantages could directly lead to improvements in lithium - ion batteries that use nanocable - based anodes .
The researchers found the new anodes offer improvements in storage capacity , release rate , and cycling performance compared with either pure CNT or pure TiO 2 .
The nanocables also had good reliability , showing almost no capacity loss after one hundred cycles .

These abilities are also competitive with graphite - based anodes , which are commonly used in today ’s lithium - ion batteries .
Plus , the nanocables are easy to produce and made of inexpensive materials , which could make them attractive for commercial use .
“ This fascinating symbiotic behavior and the fact that the cable morphology leads to an efficient use of this symbiosis makes this solution match the requirements of lithium - ion batteries extremely well , ” the researchers wrote .
The scientists hope that this demonstration of the synergistic benefits of hybrid materials might motivate further research in using hybrid materials for other energy storage devices , such as supercapacitors .

When scientists confirmed in October that they had detected the first rocky planet outside our solar system , it advanced the longtime quest to find an Earth - like planet hospitable to life .
Rocky planets -- Earth , Mercury , Venus and Mars -- make up half the planets in our solar system .
Rocky planets are considered better environments to support life than planets that are mainly gaseous , like the other half of the planets in our system : Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
The rocky planet CoRoT - 7 b was discovered circling a star some 480 light years from Earth .
It is , however , a forbidding place and unlikely to harbor life .
That 's because it is so close to its star that temperatures might be above 4,000 degrees F ( 2,200 C ) on the surface lit by its star and as low as minus 350 F ( minus 210 C ) on its dark side .
Now scientists led by a University of Washington astronomer say that if CoRoT - 7 b's orbit is not almost perfectly circular , then the planet might also be undergoing fierce volcanic eruptions .
It could be even more volcanically active than Jupiter 's moon
Io , which has more than 400 volcanoes and is the most geologically active object in our solar system .
" If conditions are what we speculate , then CoRoT - 7 b could have multiple volcanoes going off continuously and magma flowing all over the surface , " says Rory Barnes , a UW postdoctoral researcher of astronomy and astrobiology .
Any planet where the surface is being remade at such a rate is a place nearly impossible for life to get a foothold , he says .
Calculations about CoRoT - 7 b's orbit and probable volcanism were presented at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington , D.C. , during a session Jan. 5 and as part of a press briefing Jan .
6 . CoRoT - 7 b was discovered by a French - led team using the CoRoT -- Convection , Rotation and Planetary Transits -- satellite .

The next step to finding a planet that harbors life may have to wait until astronomers are better able to detect rocky planets that are farther from their stars , Barnes says .
" Because it is easier to detect planets that orbit close to their host stars , a significant fraction of the first wave of rocky planets being found outside our solar system may be more Io - like than Earth - like . "
Barnes and his colleagues suspect CoRoT - 7 b is subject to extreme volcanism partly because it is so close to its sun , the distance between the two being about 1.6 million miles ( 2.5 million kilometers ) .
That 's about 60 times closer than the Earth is to the sun .
Volcanism is then triggered by even a tiny deviation from a circular orbit .
How tiny of a deviation ?
About 155 miles ( 250 kilometers ) , according to calculations done by Barnes based on how bodies in our solar system influence each other 's orbits .
That 's about the distance from Washington , D.C. , to Philadelphia .
That amount of deviation , or more , could be caused by the gravitational pull of the next planet out from CoRoT - 7 b .
Deviations in its orbit would set tidal forces in motion that flex and distort the whole shape of CoRoT - 7 b .
This is different from what happens on Earth , where oceans absorb the energy of tidal forces .
" CoRoT - 7 b most certainly has no oceans .
A planet on a non-circular orbit experiences different amounts of gravitational force at different points along the orbit , feeling the strongest gravitational pull when it is closest to the star and the weakest when it is most distant .
As the planet moves between these two points , it stretches and relaxes .
This flexing produces friction that heats the interior of the planet resulting in volcanism on the surface , " Barnes says .
" This scenario is exactly what is occurring on Jupiter 's moon Io .
For planets like CoRoT - 7 b , however , the heating may be much , much stronger than on Io . "

British companies spearheading the drive to exploit the Canadian tar sands will come under renewed assault this week from an increasingly vocal group of shareholders and environmentalists who are planning to turn the forthcoming BP , Shell and Royal Bank of Scotland annual meetings into a referendum on these controversial operations .
The Co-operative and the Fair Pensions lobby group are releasing a special briefing paper designed to counter recent statements by the oil companies that sought to justify their involvement in carbon - intensive oil extraction in Alberta on the basis that it was needed to meet rising oil demand .
Friends of the Earth , Platform and other green groups are publishing a new report , Cashing in on Tar Sands – RBS , UK Banks and Canada 's Blood Oil , which claims RBS has provided loans of $ 7.5 bn ( £ 4.9 bn ) in the past three years to companies carrying out this kind of mining in North America .
There are signs the oil companies and the Canadian government are becoming increasingly concerned about the reputational damage that could be inflicted on them : a special " tar sands day of learning " was held at the headquarters of the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto on 1 February to bolster the confidence of fellow bankers and investors .
The Co-op 's investor briefing , designed to rally further opposition , warns institutional investors with highly diversified portfolios that allowing BP and Shell to pursue their costly tar sands extraction could undermine their holdings in other areas of the economy .
" The issue for many large investors is not just whether the macroeconomic conditions necessary to ensure the profitability of oil sands production are in place , but whether the continued expansion of oil sands production could aggravate climate change , thereby putting at risk gross domestic product growth and the performance of their portfolio as a whole , " says the new document .
Fair Pensions last week announced the establishment of a new web tool allowing individual pension holders to lobby their fund managers , who are big investors in BP and Shell .
More than 1,200 people have taken advantage of it on www.countingthecost.org.uk.
The Friends of the Earth and Platform report is being released tomorrow , on the day a coalition of non-governmental organisations seeks a judicial review against the Treasury over its willingness to allow RBS to finance companies alleged to be exacerbating climate change and disregarding the human rights of local indigenous peoples .
RBS is now largely publicly owned and the NGOs believe the government could stop it from acting in ways that are counter to its climate - change policies .
Tar sands oil has soared up the investment , political and environmental agenda since the Copenhagen climate change summit highlighted the need for a clampdown on the most carbon - intensive activities that are the biggest threat to global warming .
Shell , a leader in the tar sands business , had shown signs of backtracking in recent months , with new chief executive Peter Voser saying : " We look at them as being developed , but at a much slower pace . "
But the company will still go ahead with plans to increase production by 100,000 barrels a day , which it is said will raise CO2 emissions from its current level of 3.7 m tonnes a year to 5 m by 2015 .
BP is more bullish than ever : chief executive Tony Hayward said it could be getting 100,000 - 200,000 barrels a day from tar sands by 2015 and was already preparing two US refineries specially to process this kind of crude .
Despite mounting opposition from politicians , as well as some investors and non-governmental organisations , Hayward is convinced : " Canadian heavy oil is going to be a very important part of America 's energy . "
But not if the Co-op and Fair Pensions can help it .
They have had a resolution accepted for BP and Shell 's AGMs , asking both companies to undertake reviews on the risk of tar sands extraction , with reports to be made to the 2011 AGMs .
The BP resolution wants details of " assumptions made by the company in deciding to proceed with the Sunrise [ tar sands ]
Project regarding future carbon prices , oil price volatility , demand for oil , anticipated regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and legal and reputational risks arising from local environmental damage and impairment of traditional livelihoods " .
Both BP and Shell insist that they can extract oil from tar sands in a responsible way , with the latter arguing that CO2 emissions can be minimised by using carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) techniques .
Shell says a planned CCS plant in Edmonton , Alberta would take more than 1 m tonnes a year out of the atmosphere by 2015 and could be expanded in future .
Tar sands , or oil sands , are deposits of sand and clay saturated with bitumen , which is oil in a solid or semi - solid state .
The region where they have been found , in the ancient forests of Alberta , is said to cover an area bigger than England .
When the bitumen is close to the surface it is excavated in an opencast mine .
The land is cleared and the bitumen - soaked sand is dug out with mechanical shovels and loaded on to trucks to be taken to a separation plant .
BP stresses it does not get involved in such controversial strip - mining , but bringing the oil out from deeper deposits has its own serious problems : it requires power and steam - generating plants that use a lot of energy and water .
In some cases , steam has to be injected into wells to encourage the bitumen to flow .
BP claims the method of production used in the Sunrise Project only emits 5 % more greenhouse gases than commonly imported conventional fuels .
But the Co-op says the Jacobs report , which is quoted by the oil company in support of these figures , is " subject to challenge " because it has not been peer - reviewed .
" Peer - reviewed studies and US government studies show that the relative emissions of oil sands are much higher than BP claim , " says the briefing paper , which questions the companies ' assumptions that global oil prices will remain high enough in future to justify the heavy investment costs of bringing oil out of the ground in this way .
Analysts at Deutsche Bank recently pointed out that continuing high oil prices – currently close to $ 80 per barrel – could trigger a permanent switch to more efficient oil use and low - carbon alternatives : " The value of high capex [ capital expenditure ] intensity , long lead time , currently undeveloped oil such as undeveloped Canadian heavy oil sands … could be far lower than the market expects . "
The involvement of a major investor such as the Co-op in the campaign against tar sands is relatively new , but back at its 2008 annual meeting Shell was accused by an individual shareholder of " selling suicide on the forecourt " .

A Pomona College student who says he was detained at a Philadelphia airport because he was carrying English - Arabic flashcards filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against employees of the Transportation Security Administration , the FBI and the Philadelphia Police Department , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .
Nicholas George , a senior majoring in physics and Middle Eastern studies , was returning to California from Philadelphia in August when he was randomly selected for extra screening at Philadelphia International Airport , the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia states .
When George emptied his pockets , he took out the flashcards .
Authorities detained him in the screening area for 30 minutes before he was questioned by a TSA supervisor , the lawsuit states .
At one point , the supervisor asked George if he knew who committed the 9/11 terrorist attacks , according to the lawsuit .
George answered , " Osama bin Laden . "
" Do you know what language he spoke ? " the supervisor asked , according to the document .
" Arabic , " George answered .
This was the ultimate highlight of my # PAX 2009 , and watching it again just now brought tears to my eyes again .
I 'm not worthy of something this awesome .
Thank you Jonathan , and Paul , and Storm , and Molly for making me feel cool .

With the current crisis , many on the right are proclaiming their usual mantras on the need to attack working class pay and conditions to solve the economic problems .
The idea is that by cutting wages and breaking unions the crisis will be ended and the conditions made favourable for economic growth to return .
With increasing growth , so wealth will trickle down and everyone will benefit .
The worse thing that we could do is to organise , struggle and resist those seeking to solve the problems we face , problems caused by the elite , by reducing our living standards and rights .
The idea that social struggle and working class organisation are harmful was expressed constantly in the 1970s and 80s .
With the post - war Keynesian consensus crumbling , the " New Right " argued that trade unions ( and strikes ) hampered growth and that wealth redistribution ( i.e. welfare schemes which returned some of the surplus value workers produced back into our own hands ) hindered " wealth creation " ( i.e. economic growth ) .
Do not struggle over income , they argued , let the market decide and everyone will be better off .
This argument was dressed up in populist clothes .
Thus we find the right - wing guru F.A. von Hayek arguing that , in the case of Britain , the " legalised powers of the unions have become the biggest obstacle to raising the standards of the working class as a whole .
They are the chief cause of the unnecessarily big differences between the best - and worse - paid workers . "
He maintained that " the elite of the British working class . . . derive their relative advantages by keeping workers who are worse off from improving their position . "
Moreover , he " predict[ed ] that the average worker 's income would rise fastest in a country where relative wages are flexible , and where the exploitation of workers by monopolistic trade union organisations of specialised workers are effectively outlawed . "
[ 1980s Unemployment and the Unions , p. 107 , p. 108 and p. 110 ]
Now , if von Hayek 's claims were true we could expect that in the aftermath of Thatcher government 's trade union reforms we would have seen : a rise in economic growth ( usually considered as the means to improve living standards for workers by the right ) ; that this growth would be more equally distributed ; a decrease in the differences between high and low paid workers ; a reduction in the percentage of low paid workers as they improved their positions when freed from union " exploitation " ; and that wages rise fastest in countries with the highest wage flexibility .
Unfortunately for von Hayek , the actual trajectory of the British economy exposed his claims as nonsense .
Looking at each of his claims in turn we discover that rather than " exploit " other workers , trade unions are an essential means to shift income from capital to labour ( which is why capital fights labour organisers tooth and nail ) .
And , equally important , labour militancy aids all workers by providing a floor under which wages cannot drop ( non-unionised firms have to offer similar programs to prevent unionisation and be able to hire workers ) and by maintaining aggregate demand .
This positive role of unions in aiding all workers can be seen by comparing Britain before and after Thatcher 's von Hayek inspired trade union and labour market reforms .
There has been a steady fall in growth in the UK since the trade union " reforms " .
In the " bad old days " of the 1970s , with its strikes and " militant unions " growth was 2.4 % in Britain .
It fell to 2 % in the 1980s and fell again to 1.2 % in the 1990s .
A similar pattern of slowing growth as wage flexibility and market reform has increased can be seen in the US economy ( it was 4.4 % in the 1960s , 3.2 % in the 1970s , 2.8 % in the 1980s and 1.9 % in the first half of the 1990s ) .
[ Larry Elliot and Dan Atkinson , The Age of Insecurity , p. 236 ]
Given that the free - market right proclaims higher economic growth is the only way to make workers better off , growth rates have steadily fallen internationally since the domination of their ideology .
Thus growth of output per head in the USA , Europe , Japan and the OECD countries between 1979 to 1990 was lower than in 1973 - 9 , and 1990 - 2004 lower still .
The deregulation , privatisation , anti-union laws and other neo-liberal policies have " failed to bring an increase in the growth rate . "
[ Andrew Glyn , Capitalism Unleashed , p. 131 ]
What growth spurts there have been were associated with speculative bubbles ( in the American economy , dot.com stocks in the late 1990s and housing in the 2000s ) which burst with disastrous consequences .
So the rate of " wealth creation " ( economic growth ) has steadily fallen as unions were " reformed " in line with von Hayek 's ideology ( and lower growth means that the living standards of the working class as a whole do not rise as fast as they did under the " exploitation " of the " monopolistic " trade unions ) .
If we look at the differences between the highest and lowest paid workers , we find that rather than decrease , they have in fact shown " a dramatic widening out of the distribution with the best - workers doing much better " since Thatcher was elected in 1979 [ Andrew Glyn and David Miliband ( eds. ) , Paying for Inequality , p. 100 ]
This is important , as average figures can hide how badly those in the bottom ( 80 % ! ) are doing .
In an unequal society , the gains of growth are monopolised by the few and we would expect rising inequality over time alongside average growth .
In America inequality has dramatically increased since the 1970s , with income and wealth growth in the 1980s going predominately to the top 20 % ( and , in fact , mostly to the top 1 % of the population ) .
The bottom 80 % of the population saw their wealth grow by 1.2 % and their income by 23.7 % in the 1980s , while for the top 20 % the respective figures were 98.2 % and 66.3 % ( the figures for the top 1 % were 61.6 % and 38.9 % , respectively ) .
[ Edward N. Wolff , " How the Pie is Sliced " , The American Prospect , no. 22 , Summer 1995 ]
There has been a " fanning out of the pay distribution " with the gap between the top 10 % of wage - earners increasing compared to those in the middle and bottom 10 % .
Significantly , in the neo-liberal countries the rise in inequality is " considerably higher " than in European ones .
In America , for example , " real wages at the top grew by 27.2 % between 1979 and 2003 as compared to 10.2 % in the middle " while real wages for the bottom 10 % " did not grow at all between 1979 and 2003 . "
In fact , most of the gains in the top 10 % " occurred amongst the top 5 % , and two - thirds of it within the top 1 % . "
Unsurprising , the neo-liberal countries of the UK , USA and New Zealand saw the largest increases in inequality .
[ Glyn , Op. Cit. , pp. 116-8 and p. 168 ]
Given that inequality has increased , the condition of the average worker must have suffered .
For example , Ian Gilmore states that " [ i ] n the 1980s , for the first time for fifty years . . . the poorer half of the population saw its share of total national income shirk . "
[ Dancing with Dogma , p. 113 ]
According to Noam Chomsky , " [ d ] uring the Thatcher decade , the income share of the bottom half of the population fell from one - third to one - fourth " and the between 1979 and 1992 , the share of total income of the top 20 % grew from 35 % to 40 % while that of the bottom 20 % fell from 10 % to 5 % .
In addition , the number of UK employees with weekly pay below the Council of Europe 's " decency threshold " increased from 28.3 % in 1979 to 37 % in 1994 .
[ World Orders , Old and New , p. 144 and p. 145 ]
Moreover , " [ b ] ack in the early 1960s , the heaviest concentration of incomes fell at 80 - 90 per cent of the mean . . .
But by the early 1990s there had been a dramatic change , with the peak of the distribution falling at just 40 - 50 per cent of the mean .
One - quarter of the population had incomes below half the average by the early 1990s as against 7 per cent in 1977 and 11 per cent in 1961 . "
[ Elliot and Atkinson , Op. Cit. , p. 235 ] " Overall , " notes Takis Fotopoulos , " average incomes increased by 36 per cent during this period [ 1979 - 1991/2 ] , but 70 per cent of the population had a below average increase in their income . "
[ Towards an Inclusive Democracy , p. 113 ]
The reason for this rising inequality is not difficult to determine .
When workers organise and strike , they can keep more of what they produce in their own hands .
The benefits of productivity growth , therefore , can be spread .
With unions weakened , such gains will accumulate in fewer hands and flood upwards .
This is precisely what happened .
Before ( approximately ) 1980 and the neo-liberal assault on unions , productivity and wages rose hand - in - hand in America , afterward productivity continued to rise while wages flattened .
In fact , the value of the output of an average worker " has risen almost 50 percent since 1973 .
Yet the growing concentration of income in the hands of a small minority had proceeded so rapidly that we 're not sure whether the typical American has gained anything from rising productivity . "
Rather than " trickle down " " the lion 's share of economic growth in America over the past thirty years has gone to a small , wealthy minority . "
In short : " The big winners . . . have been members of a very narrow elite : the top 1 percent or less of the population . " [ Paul Krugman , The Conscience of a Liberal , p. 124 , p. 244 and p. 8 ]
Looking at America , after the Second World War the real income of the typical family ( " exploited " by " monopolistic " trade unions ) grew by 2.7 % per year , with " incomes all through the income distribution grew at about the same rate . "
Since 1980 ( i.e. , after working people were freed from the tyranny of unions ) , " medium family income has risen only about 0.7 percent a year " Median household income " grew modestly " from 1973 to 2005 , the total gain was about 16 % .
Yet this " modest gain " may " overstate " how well American families were doing , as it was achieved in part through longer working hours .
For example , " a gain in family income that occurs because a spouse goes to work is n't the same thing as a wage increase .
In particular it may carry hidden costs that offset some of the gains in money . "
This stagnation is , of course , being denied by the right .
Yet , as Krugman memorably puts it : " Modern economists debate whether American median income has risen or fallen since the early 1970s .
What 's really telling is the fact that we 're even having this debate . "
So while the average values may have went up , because of " rising inequality , good performance in overall numbers like GDP has n't translated into gains for ordinary workers . "
[ Op. Cit. , p. 55 , pp. 126-7 , p. 124 and p. 201 ]
Luckily for American capitalism a poll in 2000 found that 39 % of Americans believe they are either in the wealthiest 1 % or will be there " soon " !
[ Glyn , Op. Cit. , p. 179 ]
In fact , as we discussed in section B.7.2 , social mobility has fallen under neo-liberalism -- perhaps unsurprisingly as it is easier to climb a hill than a mountain .
This is just as important as the explosion in inequality as the “ free - market ” right argue that dynamic social mobility makes up for wealth and income inequality .
As Krugman notes , Americans " may believe that anyone can succeed through hard work and determination , but the facts say otherwise . "
In reality , mobility is " highest in the Scandinavian countries , and most results suggest that mobility is lower in the United States than it is in France , Canada , and maybe even in Britain .
Not only do n't Americans have equal opportunity , opportunity is less equal here than elsewhere in the West . "
Without the blinkers of free market capitalist ideology this should be unsurprising : " A society with highly unequal results is , more or less inevitably , a society with highly unequal opportunity , too . "
[ Op. Cit. , p. 247 and p. 249 ]
Looking at the claim that trade union members gained their " relative advantage by keeping workers who are worse off from improving their position " it would be fair to ask whether the percentage of workers in low - paid jobs decreased in Britain after the trade union reforms .
In fact , the percentage of workers below the Low Pay Unit 's definition of low pay ( namely two - thirds of men's median earnings ) increased -- from 16.8 % in 1984 to 26.2 % in 1991 for men , 44.8 % to 44.9 % for women .
For manual workers it rose by 15 % to 38.4 % , and for women by 7.7 % to 80.7 % ( for non-manual workers the figures were 5.4 % rise to 13.7 % for men and a 0.5 % rise to 36.6 % ) .
[ Andrew Glyn and David Miliband ( eds. ) , Op. Cit. , p.102 ]
If unions were gaining at the expense of the worse off , you would expect a decrease in the number in low pay , not an increase .
An OECD study concluded that " [ t] ypically , countries with high rates of collective bargaining and trade unionisation tend to have low incidence of low paid employment . "
[ OECD Employment Outlook , 1996 , p. 94 ]
Within America , we also discover that higher union density is associated with fewer workers earning around the minimum wage and that " right - to - work " states ( i.e. , those that pass anti-union laws ) " tend to have lower wages , lower standard of living , and more workers earning around the minimum wage . "
It is hard not to conclude that states " passed laws aimed at making unionisation more difficult would imply that they sought to maintain the monopoly power of employers at the expense of workers . "
[ Oren M. Levin- Waldman , " The Minimum Wage and Regional Wage Structure : Implications for Income Distribution " , pp. 635-57 , Journal of Economic Issues , Vol. XXXVI , No. 3 , p. 639 and p. 655 ]
As far as von Hayek 's prediction on wage flexibility leading to the " average worker 's income " rising fastest in a country where relative wages are flexible , it has been proved totally wrong .
Between 1967 and 1971 , real wages grew ( on average ) by 2.95 % per year in the UK ( nominal wages grew by 8.94 % ) [ P. Armstrong , A. Glyn and J. Harrison , Capitalism Since World War II , p. 272 ] .
In comparison , real household disposable income grew by just 0.5 percent between June 2006 and 2007 .
Average weekly earnings rose 2.9 % between April 2006 and 2007 while inflation rose by 3.6 % ( Retail Prices Index ) and 2.8 % ( Consumer Prices Index ) .
[ Elliot and Atkinson , The Gods That Failed , p. 163 ]
This is part of a general pattern , with UK Real Wages per employee being an average 3.17 % per year between 1960 and 1974 , falling to 1.8 % between 1980 and 1999 .
In America , the equivalent figures are 2.37 % and 1.02 % .
[ Eckhard Hein and Thorsten Schulten , Unemployment , Wages and Collective Bargaining in the European Union , p. 9 ]
Looking at the wider picture , during the early 1970s when strikes and union membership increased , " real wage increases rose steadily to reach over 4 % per year " in the West .
However , after von Hayek 's anti-union views were imposed , " real wages have grown very slowly . "
In anti-union America , the median wage was $ 13.62 in 2003 compared to $ 12.36 in 1979 ( reckoned in 2003 prices ) .
In Europe and Japan " average wages have done only a little better , having grown around 1 % per year . "
[ Glyn , Op. Cit. , p. 5 and p. 116 ]
It gets worse as these are average figures .
Given that inequality soared during this period the limited gains of the neo-liberal era were not distributed as evenly as before ( in the UK , for example , wage growth was concentrated at the top end of society .
[ Elliot and Atkinson , Fantasy Island , p. 99 ] ) .
Nor can it be said that breaking the unions and lower real wages translated into lower unemployment in the UK as the average unemployment rate between 1996 and 1997 was 7.1 % compared to 4.5 % between 1975 and 1979 ( the year Thatcher took power ) .
The average between 1960 and 1974 was 1.87 % compared to 8.7 % over the whole Thatcherite period of 1980 to 1999 .
Perhaps this is not too surprising , given that ( capitalist economic theology aside ) unemployment " systematically weakens the bargaining power of trade unions . "
In short : " Neither on the theoretical nor empirical level can a strictly inverse relation between the real wage rate and the level of unemployment be derived . "
[ Hein and Schulten , Op. Cit. , p. 9 , p. 3 and p. 2 ]
As we discussed in section C.1.5 this should come as no surprise to anyone with awareness of the real nature of unemployment and the labour market .
So unemployment did not fall after the trade union reforms , quite the reverse : " By the time Blair came to power [ in 1997 ] , unemployment in Britain was falling , although it still remained higher than it had been when the [ last Labour Government of ]
Callaghan left office in May 1979 . "
[ Elliot and Atkinson , Age of Insecurity , p. 258 ]
To be fair , von Hayek did argue that falls in unemployment would be " a slow process " but nearly 20 years of far higher unemployment is moving backwards !
So we have a stark contrast between the assertions of the right and the reality their ideology helped create ( Proudhon : " Contrary to all expectation !
It takes an economist not to expect these things " ) .
The reason for this difference is not hard to discover .
As economist Paul Krugman correctly argues , unions " raise average wages for their membership ; they also , indirectly and to a lesser extent , raise wages for similar workers . . . as nonunionised employers try to diminish the appeal of union drives to their workers . . . unions tend to narrow income gaps among blue - collar workers , by negotiating bigger wage increases for their worse - paid members . . .
And nonunion employers , seeking to forestall union organisers , tend to echo this effect . "
He argues that " if there 's a single reason blue - collar workers did so much better in the fifties than they had in the twenties , it was the rise of unions " and that unions " were once an important factor limiting income inequality , both because of their direct effect in raising their members ’ wages and because the union pattern of wage settlements . . . was . . . reflected in the labour market as a whole . "
With the smashing of the unions came rising inequality , with the " sharpest increases in wage inequality in the Western world have taken place in the United States and in Britain , both of which experience sharp declines in union membership . "
Unions restrict inequality because " they act as a countervailing force to management . "
[ Op. Cit. , p. 51 , p. 49 , p. 149 and p. 263 ]
So under the neo-liberal regime instigated by Thatcher and Reagan the power , influence and size of the unions were reduced considerably and real wage growth fell considerably -- which is the exact opposite of von Hayek 's predictions .
Flexible wages and weaker unions have harmed the position of all workers .
So comparing the claims of von Hayek to what actually happened after trade union " reform " and the reduction of class struggle suggests that claims that social struggle is self - defeating are false ( and self - serving , considering it is usually bosses , employer supported parties and economists who make these claims ) .
A lack of social struggle has been correlated with low economic growth and often stagnant ( even declining ) wages .
So while social struggle may make capital flee and other problems , lack of it is no guarantee of prosperity ( quite the reverse , if the last quarter of the 20th century is anything to go by ) .
Indeed , a lack of social struggle will make bosses be more likely to cut wages , worsen working conditions and so on -- after all , they feel they can get away with it !
Which brings home the fact that to make reforms last it is necessary to destroy capitalism .
Of course , no one can know that struggle will make things better .
It is a guess ; no one can predict the future .
Not all struggles are successful and many can be very difficult .
If the " military is a role model for the business world " ( in the words of an ex-CEO of Hill & Knowlton Public Relations ) , and it is , then any struggle against it and other concentrations of power may , and often is , difficult and dangerous at times .
[ quoted by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton in Toxic Sludge Is Good For You ! , p. 47 ]
But , as Zapata once said , " better to die on your feet than live on your knees ! "
All we can say is that social struggle can and does improve things and , in terms of its successes and transforming effect on those involved , well worth the potential difficulties it can create .
Moreover , without struggle there is little chance of creating a free society , dependent as it is on individuals who refuse to bow to authority and have the ability and desire to govern themselves .
In addition , social struggle is always essential , not only to win improvements , but to keep them as well .
In order to fully secure improvements you have to abolish capitalism and the state .
Not to do so means that any reforms can and will be taken away ( and if social struggle does not exist , they will be taken away sooner rather than later ) .
Ultimately , most anarchists would argue that social struggle is not an option -- we either do it or we put up with the all the petty ( and not so petty ) impositions of authority .
If we do not say " no " then the powers that be will walk all over us .
As the history of neo -liberalism shows , a lack of social struggle is fully compatible with worsening conditions .
It shows that the problems within capitalism are systemic , regardless of the wishes of economists and the right ( Proudhon 's ironic words from 1846 spring to mind : " Political economy — that is , proprietary despotism — can never be in the wrong : it must be the proletariat " ) .
Ultimately , if you want to be treated as a human being you have to stand up for your dignity -- and that means thinking and rebelling .
As Bakunin argued in God and the State , human freedom and development is based on these .
Without rebellion , without social struggle , humanity would stagnate beneath authority forever and never be in a position to be free .
Of course , being utterly wrong has not dented von Hayek 's reputation with the right nor stopped him being quoted in arguments in favour of flexibility and free market reforms ( what can we expect ?
The right still quote Milton Friedman whose track - record was equally impressive ) .
Nor has this utter lack of accuracy been reflected when Thatcher or Blair are being evaluated by the media for their performance on economic matters .
Rather than look at the claims and predictions of the Thatcherites and their ideological mentors and how they measure up with what happened , a myth of economic success is created , a myth which the Labour Party seems to emulate .
Still , why let the actual development of the economies influenced by von Hayek 's ideology get in the way ?
Perhaps it is fortunate that he once argued that economic theories can " never be verified or falsified by reference to facts .
All that we can and must verify is the presence of our assumptions in the particular case . "
[ Individualism and Economic Order , p. 73 ]
With such a position all is saved -- the obvious problem is that capitalism is still not pure enough and the " reforms " must not only continue but be made deeper ...
As Kropotkin stressed , " economists who continue to consider economic forces alone . . . without taking into account the ideology of the State , or the forces that each State necessarily places at the service of the rich . . . remain completely outside the realities of the economic and social world . " [ quoted by Ruth Kinna , " Fields of Vision : Kropotkin and Revolutionary Change " , pp. 67 - 86 , SubStance , Vol. 36 , No. 2 , pp. 72-3 ]
And , needless to say , while three decades of successful capitalist class war goes without mention in polite circles , documenting its results gets you denounced as advocating " class war " !
It is more than pass the time when working class people should make that a reality -- particularly given the results of not doing so .
This is why we should document the utterly wrong predictions of an icon of the right .
Partly , of course , it is fun to show up the massive errors of our enemies .
However , and even more important , it is necessary to expose the hype and short - term memory of the media in order to fully counter the claims that the last 20 years have been anything but a disaster for working class people .
In addition , it shows the way to improve our conditions .
Militancy , direct action , solidarity and working class organisation works , they are effective and they get results .
This is the message that is easily seen from comparing von Hayek 's claims and predictions with reality .
It also shows the necessity of creating a new working class movement based on these principles , the principles of anarchism .

In the past few weeks I wrote a program to compute the aliases of variables and expressions in an object - oriented program ( based on a new theory [ 1 ] ) .
For one of the data structures , I needed a specific notion of equality , so I did the standard thing in Eiffel : redefine the is_equal function inherited from the top class ANY , to implement the desired variant .
The first time I ran the result , I got a postcondition violation .
The violated postcondition clauses was not even any that I wrote : it was an original postcondition of is_equal ( other : like Current ) in ANY , which my redefinition inherited as per the rules of Design by Contract ; it reads
symmetric : Result implies other ~ Current
meaning : equality is symmetric , so if Result is true , i.e. the Current object is equal to other , then other must also be equal to Current .
( ~ is object equality , which applies the local version is is_equal ) .
What was I doing wrong ?
The structure is a list , so the code iterates on both the current list and the other list :
from
start ; other .start ; Result := True
until ( not Result ) or after loop
if other . after then Result := False else
Result := ( item ~ other.item )
forth ; other .
forth
end
end
Simple enough : at each position check whether the item in the current list is equal to the item in the other list , and if so move forth in both the current list and the other one ; stop whenever we find two unequal elements , or we exhaust either list as told by after list .
( Since is_equal is a function and not produce any side effect , the actual code saves the cursors before the iteration and restores them afterwards .
Thanks to Ian Warrington for asking about this point in a comment to this post .
The new across loop variant described in two later postings uses external cursors and manages them automatically , so this business of maintaining the cursor manually goes away . )
The problem is that with this algorithm it is possible to return
True if the first list was exhausted but not the second , so that the first list is a subset of the other rather than identical .
The correction is immediate : add
Result and other_list .
after
after the loop ; alternatively , enclose the loop in a conditional so that it is only executed if count = other .
count ( this solution is better since it saves much computation in cases of lists of different sizes , which cannot be equal ) .
The lesson ( other than that I need to be more careful ) is that the error was caught immediately , thanks to a postcondition violation — and one that I did not even have to write .
Just another day at the office ; and let us shed a tear for the poor folks who still program without this kind of capability in their language and development environment .

Igor Zakharkin : “ We ca n’t stand this food anymore ” ( Photo © Shaun Best , Reuters )
It seems like the food they serve in the Olympic village in Vancouver is really bad .
First it were Alexei Morozov and Semyon Varlamov who complained about the food in the village .
According to Morozov the players had to eat in McDonald’s .
He also said that with food like this they would “ turn up their toes ” .
Then it was Ilya Bryzgalov who called the food “ terrible ” .
Now it ’s Team Russia coach Igor Zakharkin who calls Russian officials for help .
“ We ca n’t stand it anymore .
It is time for our officials to step in .
Our players can’t recover eating the food they serve in the village .
It ’s not tasty and low in calories .
It ’s some semi prepared foods !
We do n’t want it to have an impact on our team ” , said Zakharkin to Vitaliy Slavin of Sovetskiy Sport .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Energy states were among the best job markets in the U.S. in 2009 , along with states benefiting from federal jobs .
States particularly hurt by the financial and housing crises were among the worst job markets .
Every state and the District of Columbia saw job market conditions deteriorate between 2008 and 2009 .
The results for Gallup 's Job Creation Index reflect aggregated data from approximately 100,000 Gallup Daily tracking interviews conducted throughout 2009 with employed adults in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia .
Gallup asks those who are employed whether their companies are hiring workers and expanding the size of their labor forces , not changing the size of their workforces , or laying off workers and reducing the number of employees they have .
The Job Creation Index reports the net difference between the percentage reporting an expansion and the percentage reporting a reduction in their workforces .
Energy - producing states such as North Dakota , Louisiana , West Virginia , Oklahoma , and Texas were home to some of the top job markets in the U.S. in 2009 , as they were in 2008 .
They were joined by Alaska and New Mexico , two other energy states ; Nebraska , a farm state benefiting from ethanol and a strong commodities market ; and Maryland and Virginia , two states benefiting from the presence of federal government employees .
Despite the recent improvement in manufacturing and banking , economically long - depressed Michigan and financial - crisis states in the Northeast , including Rhode Island , Delaware , New Jersey , and Connecticut continued to be some of the worst state job markets in 2009 .
The housing - crash states of Nevada and California also remained near the bottom of the list , joined by Arizona , another state with housing problems , and two other Western states -- Oregon and Idaho .
New Hampshire , another financial state , was on the list of worst job market states , as was Minnesota .
In 2009 nationwide , the figures were 24 % hiring and 25 % letting go .
Least and Most Job Market Deterioration
Every state and the District of Columbia saw job market conditions deteriorate between 2008 and 2009 .
Areas benefiting from the presence of federal government employees experienced comparatively stable job market conditions : the District of Columbia , Maryland , and Virginia .
Also seeing the least deterioration were some of the best job markets in 2009 -- New Mexico , Nebraska , and Alaska .
On the other hand , several states with the worst job markets in 2008 also saw the least change in 2009 -- presumably because they had declined so much already : Vermont , Rhode Island , and Florida .
Montana was also among the job markets having the least deterioration between 2008 and 2009 .
Among those experiencing the most deterioration were three states among the top 10 job markets in 2008 : Wyoming , Utah , and South Dakota , probably reflecting the reduction in gas and oil exploration last year .
Also included were several states that ended up with the worst job markets of 2009 : Oregon , Idaho , Arizona , and New Hampshire .
Others seeing big declines included Kansas , Alabama , Washington , and Hawaii .
Bottom Line
Many of the circumstances that dominated job market conditions during 2008 continued to do so during 2009 : energy and commodity states continued to see their job markets do comparatively well , while job market conditions in housing - and financial - debacle states continued to fare relatively poorly .
States with a significant number of federal employees also seem to be among the least affected as job market conditions deteriorated between 2008 and 2009 .
Of course , the annual data in these comparisons do not show the sharp deterioration of job market conditions in early 2009 or the comparative recovery later in the year .
However , they do suggest that the deepening recession of 2009 had a significantly negative impact on job market conditions across the nation .
In 2010 , the factors that influence comparative job market conditions may change .
For example , improving conditions in the manufacturing sector could mean comparative improvements in job market conditions in many long - depressed areas .
Similarly , continuing improvements in the financial and housing sectors could help the job market in many currently depressed states .
Still , improvements in some states are not enough to get the U.S. economy on a sustainable growth path for 2010 - 2011 .
Instead , widespread improvements in job market conditions will need to happen in every state .
Gallup 's " State of the States " series reveals state - by - state differences on political , economic , and well - being measures Gallup tracks each day .
New stories will be released throughout the month of February .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 94,018 employed adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan.
2 - Dec. 30 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
The margins of sampling error range from ± 1 percentage point for large states such as California to as high as ±9 percentage points for the District of Columbia .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
When I look at the present economic environment , I am not encouraged .�
But if you really want me to be discouraged , talk to me about politics .
For the last 40 - 80 years we have been borrowing , whether implicitly ( pensions , retiree healthcare ) or explicitly , deferring problems into the future , where they will be compounded with interest and survivorship ( lifespans have lengthened , Kaiser , and sadly for those who pay , they want a high quality of life in their dotage ) .
So , at present , legislators are more partisan , whether in the states or at the federal level . �
Why ?�
There is less slack .�
Let ’s start at the state level , because most of them have to balance their budgets , and ca n’t print money to help out .
Many states are screaming in pain .�
As such , they tell their legislators in the Federal Congress to send back money . �
But that toughens the debate on the Federal level .
With almost all state budgets fighting against a deficit , and some in deep trouble , it makes for interesting and ugly politics . �
Much of this was created by optimistic assumptions of what could be earned from equities over the long run , much of which is now being slowly repudiated , as markets fail to live up to expectations .
The Federal budget is hopelessly out - of - whack , with 4 - 5 % of GDP deficits out as far as the eye can see . �
So , what do we do about it ?
1 ) Raise Taxes .�
I do n’t like this idea , because the US Government has entered many areas where it should not be .�
I would rather see the discretionary government shrink considerably .�
Also , remember , Social Security and Medicare are not guaranteed .�
Congress could wipe out all benefits tomorrow , and face a political firestorm .�
But remember , in the Great Depression , that is just what they did . �
This is why I do n’t insist that rates must head higher .�
It depends on society as a whole .
Raising taxes has the perverse result of slowing economic growth , which affects future taxes .
2 ) Inflate the currency .�
Ugh . �
Oppress the elderly , who cannot work to make up the difference ?�
Create a new inflation mindset that has all of us focusing on the short - term . �
Inflationary economies by their nature become more and more short term .
3 ) Default on obligations .�
There are several forms of this :
a) Total default : anyone with a Treasury Note is a sucker .�
Global depression ensues .
b) External default : we do not honor external obligations , but honor internal ones . �
Global depression ensues , but the US does relatively well .
c ) Internal default : what , are you joking ?�
Why do we pay off the losers who lent to us ?
As we look at Greece , Spain , and Portugal , we chuckle over the foolishness of the EU thinking that they could have monetary union without full political union .�
It did n’t work under the Confederation , why should it work elsewhere ?
But we should not chuckle .�
After all , we have California , Illinois , and New York , and more waiting in the wings . �
There is no bankruptcy code for the states .�
I am not sure what happens if one state does not pay , aside from being shut out of the municipal bond market .
So , my point remains — what are we going to do ? �
Raise taxes , inflate the currency , or default ? �
Perhaps in a real crisis , we would slim down the government .�
We might also decrease Social Security and Medicare benefits .�
We might also amend ERISA , to allow for reductions in pension payments .�
In a real crisis , nothing is fixed .
Or , we might tax a lot more — the depression was an example of that .�
That is a reason that I am not a total bear on Treasuries .
The government has choices to make .�
What should they do ?�
Offer your answers as best you can .

Only a year after the government stepped in to aid Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley by granting them access to the federal safety net , policy makers are developing an exit path that would allow them and others to escape limits on banks being proposed by the Obama administration .
President Obama wants to limit the scope of risk - taking by barring banks with federally insured deposits from trading securities for their own accounts and from owning hedge funds and private equity funds .
The plan , policy makers said on Friday , would effectively require bank holding companies  which Goldman and Morgan became at the height of the financial crisis  to divest themselves of these lucrative operations .
But Treasury Department officials are also seeking to give banks that do not like the proposed rules the option of dropping their status as holding companies to keep their trading and other investment businesses .
The move is likely to turn the spotlight on Goldman , which could be one of the biggest potential beneficiaries because it makes sizable profits from proprietary trading and runs many private equity and hedge funds .
Goldman traders are known for taking large trading positions , even as they manage trades for clients .
Twenty gallons of gasoline were poured into a 400 - square - foot room .
The pungent liquid soaked the floor , desk , and computer inside the small office .
It was about 12:30 a.m. on the cool Sunday morning of June 14 , and the room was dark .
Josh Robinson stood amid the puddles , awash in fumes .
One of his partners in crime waited outside the second - floor window on top of a wooden , latticework awning .
Two others had climbed down already .
The 28 - year - old Robinson then made the mistake that would cost him his life .
He struck a match .
The detonation briefly turned night into day .
A fireball engulfed the room and the man inside .
A surveillance camera hooked up to a motion detector down the hall blinked on and off in the moments after the ignition , recording slightly more than four seconds of video .
Across the street , a group of women stood and stared .
They had been chatting in the driveway of a house a moment earlier when the crinkle of broken glass caught their attention .
The mixed residential - and - business neighborhood near 40th Street and Baseline Road in Phoenix was usually quiet at that time of night .
A minute later , they heard more breaking glass and an alarm .
The homeowner , her daughter , and a friend moved to get a better view of the two - story structure , which they mistook for an apartment complex in the dim light .
Actually , it was the headquarters of Young Champions of America , a national business that teaches such activities as karate , soccer , and cheerleading to kids .
As they watched , flames erupted from the structure .
One of the women called 911 .
The flashover fire spread quickly across the second floor and up to the roof .
To their horror , the women saw the figure of a man stumble out of the inferno .
" They could see the whole body was in flames , and he was kind of waving his hands around , " a police report of the incident states .
He began rolling over and over on top of the awning for what seemed like " forever " to the witnesses .
The homeowner 's daughter grabbed a T - shirt from her mother and dashed across 40th Street to the raging fire .
Another section of the erratic video shows two of the burning man 's buddies trying to pat out the flames just before he falls from the platform .
The camera did n't record much else .
Robinson 's head smacked the ground hard , but it did n't matter much by then .
His hair and clothing had been mostly seared off his charred body , and he'd inhaled a fatal amount of smoke .
As the building fire raged , the young woman approached the arsonist 's body , which was still burning .
She used the T - shirt to dab at the flames on the victim .
Before the first fire truck arrived , she saw a " redheaded woman " standing by her side , recounts Phoenix Fire Department Captain Marika McCue , who helped conduct the investigation .
" Do something ! " the redhead screamed hysterically .
" I am doing something ! " the homeowner 's daughter shouted .
The first firefighters at the scene , records state , saw two women — neither of them a redhead — patting flames on the victim .
The burned man was dead .
Firefighters broke through a first - floor door that led into a warehouse space , thinking they could save one side of the structure .
" However , the fire traveled exceedingly fast , and they were forced to abandon the interior of the building , " the report states .
The fire gutted the company 's offices and warehouse , ruining equipment and destroying many years ' worth of memorabilia .
The witness never saw the redhead again , and McCue was unable to find any trace of her during months of investigation .
McCue 's best guess is that the traumatic events distorted the witness ' memory .
The " redheaded woman , " McCue believes , was actually 20 - year - old Jonathan Antonucci , one of Robinson 's known accomplices in the fire .
Antonucci pleaded guilty in October to arson and manslaughter , which allowed him to escape getting tried for first - degree murder ( anyone helping to carry out a crime in which a death occurs is subject to Arizona 's felony - murder rule ) .
But in a jailhouse interview with New Times , Antonucci denied he was at the scene as Robinson lay dying .
He did n't know what happened to his best friend , he claims , because he ran away from him and the other arsonists seconds after " the incident " began .
His version is hard to believe , based on the evidence .
And , as his former employers note , he 's got a reputation as a liar and a cheat .
To dozens of Valley kids , he was " Sensei Jon " : tall , lean , ambitious , and charismatic , the eldest son of a Baptist preacher , a talented and popular karate instructor .
But Sensei Jon , even as he preached about Jesus and the ethics that went along with martial arts , had joined the dark side .
He would become a thief and a schemer .
It does n't seem a stretch to imagine that the plan to torch the building was hatched by Antonucci , who had been stealing thousands of dollars from Young Champions and already had started his own karate company for kids .
Antonucci blames most everything on the dead Robinson .
Whoever was most responsible , the June arson fire was surely a first - class betrayal .
The culprits were some of the very same " young champions " who had grown up with the firm .
Authorities believe Antonucci and Robinson had hoped to destroy evidence of their embezzlement from the company .
" That 's what hurts the most , " says Rory Hood , the company 's president .
" These were students of this organization . "
The four friends had all worked as karate instructors , teaching children and teens in the evenings or on weekends at schools and churches .
Robinson and Antonucci sometimes helped out at the main office ( which did n't host classes ) .
Young Champions of America employs about 25 instructors at a time in the Valley , including some who teach multiple classes per night .
Parents can pay a smaller fee per class rather than for a set number of weeks , which is one way the company meets its goal of providing youth classes to lower - income families .
Each instructor must find and retain students in their classes , and Robinson and Antonucci — both lively and engaging as teachers — were among the most successful .
Robinson had started taking karate lessons when he was 7 years old from Kraig Hollingworth , now the company 's vice president .
Except during a brief stint in the Marine Corps , Robinson had always been affiliated with Young Champions either as student or employee .
Antonucci had attended the company 's karate classes as a youngster in Colorado and hooked up with the local chapter when his family moved to Phoenix .
Both he and Robinson occasionally went to Hollingworth 's house to play video games and socialize .
Moniza Murillo , 21 , also had come of age with the firm , starting as karate student and advancing to rookie teacher .
She lived in a mobile home with her parents and another family while attending Estrella Community College just before her arrest .
She took her first Young Champions class at age 10 .
The fourth person arrested in connection with the arson , Jeffrey Otto , 20 , began taking classes in his mid-teens from Robinson and had assisted as an instructor during the year before the fire .
The three surviving suspects were charged with first - degree murder in addition to arson .
Only Otto has maintained his not - guilty plea and held out for trial .
Murillo copped a plea in August and has reportedly agreed to testify against Otto , if he does n't change his mind and admit involvement in the arson .
Antonucci 's plea deal , meanwhile , calls for between seven and 21 years in prison .
He 's scheduled to be sentenced in March .
Murillo 's sentence will depend on how much she helps prosecutors in Otto 's trial , if there is one .
None of them had ever been in trouble with the law before , as far as New Times could tell through public records and interviews .
Ironically , the instruction given by Young Champions employees , whether in karate or other classes , typically includes character lessons , as well as the physical activities .
Kids are taught to respect others , do their homework , and make other good choices in life .
Many come to view their instructors as mentors .
The accusations and arrests that came in the fire 's aftermath were a shock to the hundreds of teens and little kids they had taught , the students ' parents , and their own friends and families .
Murillo 's parents , Joseph and Isabell , wrote in a letter to the court that their daughter sings , draws , practices karate , and plays soccer .
She played softball and football at La Joya Community High School .
She went to church every Sunday , is liked by teachers , and won a college scholarship .
" Never in a million years would we ever think she would be locked up , " they wrote .
The owner and staff members of Young Champions are still reeling from the group 's actions and what led to them .
The arson , though unexpected , was the culmination of months of drama and suspicion at the Phoenix office building .
Antonucci had been accused of pilfering daily sales totals and of running moneymaking operations on the side .
Before he was fired , the company hired an outside auditor to determine the extent of the thefts .
The auditor not only discovered problems with records kept by Robinson and other instructors , but evidence of far more serious embezzlement by another less - tenured employee .
On the morning of the fire , Hood , his wife , Tawnya , and Hollingworth were at the site before the sun came up .
They simply could n't believe the blackened , unrecognizable corpse was that of sensei Josh Robinson .
The idea of treachery by a friend was too tough to fathom .
Before Young Champions of America , there was Bonnie Blue Bells .
Bonnie Hood started the company in 1958 in the Grand Rapids , Michigan area to teach an activity that was immensely popular at the time : baton - twirling .
Hood 's flash of inspiration was to bring baton - twirling to the masses by partnering with school districts , which would provide space for classes .
The late Hood would later run a traveling variety show called the New Olympians , which hosted numerous cultural exchanges from Cuba to China .
Baton - twirling fell out of fashion , but not before Hood 's son , Rory , who came to school in Arizona , caught the bug .
He became an ace baton - twirler during his years at the University of Arizona .
He also helped expand his mother 's company , which had changed its name and begun to offer instruction in other activities .
Martial arts had gained popularity through the ' 70s , thanks to martial artist and actor Bruce Lee .
Then , in 1984 , the movie The Karate Kid changed everything .
People lined up around the block to take karate classes from the Hoods ' company .
Martial arts , of course , continue to be a staple of popular culture .
( A remake of The Karate Kid is scheduled to be released this year ) .
Young Champions ultimately opened offices in 16 states , and teaches an estimated 75,000 youth nationwide .
The company introduced karate to Jonathan Antonucci when he was 12 .
Back then , Antonucci was living in Fort Collins , Colorado , the oldest of five siblings who were home - schooled by their devoutly Baptist parents .
Antonucci was a hardworking , entrepreneurial sort , his 18 - year - old brother , Joshua , tells New Times .
Starting when Jonathan was 9 , he made money each summer mowing lawns and each snowy winter delivering newspapers .
He discovered a Young Champions branch through the local Boys and Girls Club , and martial arts soon became a part of his persona .
Joshua says his brother got an early start as a teacher , giving lessons to his siblings in their backyard and handing out homemade awards .
When he found out that his father , Dante Antonucci , planned to move the family to Phoenix , " he was excited because this was the base for Young Champions of America , and this was supposed to be where the best instructors were , " Joshua says .
His first lessons in his new city were from Kraig Hollingworth , but he also spent time under the tutelage of Josh Robinson .
Robinson was almost like family to some of the company 's staffers — especially his former teacher Hollingworth .
A few years after Robinson 's mother enrolled her son in karate classes , she met her future husband , Larry Moody , another single parent who took his daughter and son to the classes .
Moody even proposed to Robinson 's mom in front of a delighted crowd at a Young Champions karate tournament .
The boy became an accomplished black belt , instructor , and employee with the company .
Still , his family members describe him as a bit naive and immature , the type of guy who often starts projects he does n't finish .
He was given a medical discharge from the Marine Corps and worked odd jobs to supplement his Young Champions income .
He could n't hold his first , brief marriage together — his wife took their two small children and moved to Utah .
After his divorce , he fell in love with a Mexican immigrant who spoke little English .
They did n't have much money , but they had a son together in 2008 and planned to get married .
Robinson 's sister , Angie Guzman , says they made a " kooky little couple . "
Robinson and Antonucci became good friends over the years , and the teen graduated from student to Robinson 's assistant instructor .
The pair were very popular with students .
Sometimes they 'd force each other to endure pain - threshold tests or joint locks , which entertained their classes .
" Jon and Josh were maybe the life of the entire company , " says Joshua Antonucci .
But Jonathan Antonucci was n't satisfied with the way Young Champions was run , Joshua says .
Class attendance typically dropped off in the summer , and Antonucci could n't make the kind of money he wanted , forcing him to take an occasional side job .
His financial problems were partly based on lifestyle .
Antonucci made more than $ 30,000 and Robinson more than $ 40,000 in the year preceding the fire , says Hollingworth .
They were paid a commission for each student , and both worked an average of only 30 hours a week , he says .
When Antonucci moved out of his parents ' house at age 18 and began renting a home , money got tight .
So he did what many Americans would do in that situation : bought a nice automobile on credit .
A 2004 GMC Sierra 1500 pickup , to be precise .
He also ramped up plans to launch his own dojo , Red Dragon Martial Arts , which had been his dream since the days of the pretend classes in his backyard in Colorado .
He had asked Murillo , Otto , and Robinson to work for him .
Joshua Antonucci says Robinson had a " hard time " with the concept of going from Jon 's sensei ( a Japanese term of respect for a person who has mastered a discipline ) to Jon 's employee — he wanted to work with Jonathan , not for him .
But the entrepreneurial - minded teen , his brother says , would n't hear of it .
Despite the disagreement , Robinson apparently came around to intending to work for the younger man .
Joshua Antonucci has continued to help develop a Web site for the business his brother wants to open — and has tried to retain the support of his brother 's former students .
Jonathan Antonucci says that when he gets out of prison , even if it 's not for two decades , he still intends to open the dojo .
The headquarters of Young Champions of America is now in a wasteland of half - empty office buildings in the Scottsdale Airpark area .
The new place does n't have as much room as the old building and property , which the company bought in 2004 during a period of growth .
But it 's enough space to manage the business and keep classes going .
Last month , Rory and Tawnya Hood , Hollingworth , and the company 's business manager , Char Brandom , chatted with New Times about the fire and the events leading up to it .
Hood chastises himself for being such a softie with the " kids . "
The company had been ripped off before , on a lesser scale , because so much money was collected in the field .
In late 2008 , Hood and Hollingworth found that Antonucci was taking greedy schemes further than anyone in the past , yet Hood still gave him a second chance .
Instructors at Young Champions receive awards for retaining the most students , and after a while , nobody could match Antonucci .
Whether in karate classes or the occasional soccer class he taught , students seldom left the teen .
Even Hollingworth , despite his years of experience , could not keep so many students .
" It was too fishy for me , " Hollingworth says .
He began an investigation and quickly saw that , for weeks at a time , Antonucci recorded no absences for any of his students .
The teen also had , suspiciously , failed to turn in sign - in sheets that should have been collected at the classes .
Rory Hood admits the company was too trusting of its instructors , who represented Young Champions at the various class locations without much supervision .
( Changes have since been made ) .
Because it turned out that Antonucci had been signing up and instructing more students than he claimed , and he'd been keeping the extra money , Hollingworth assigned himself the project of checking up on other instructors ' records .
About the same time , company officials began receiving various complaints about Antonucci , Robinson , and other instructors .
They 'd been selling candy and water during classes without permits or approval from Young Champions , and they 'd continued to do it even after getting written up for violating company policy .
Phone calls began to trickle in from people at the school or church facilities used for classes .
Facility owners or managers complained that Antonucci was teaching more classes , at extended hours , than the contracts called for .
He also was n't monitoring everyone at the classes properly , meaning parents were wandering around the school or church grounds .
Once , Antonucci backed his truck onto a church 's property to unload equipment , destroying the landscaping .
When asked about such things , Antonucci typically had an excuse and would deny he did anything wrong .
But Shar , who took many of the angry phone calls , told Rory Hood what it all added up to : Antonucci was a liar , and he could n't be trusted .
Hood says he'd gotten other people who'd stolen from the company prosecuted in the past .
But with the popular Antonucci , who was good friends with Robinson , " I was hoping this was not true . "
Hollingworth and Hood called in Antonucci for a meeting in February 2009 .
" I 'm like , ' Jon , I 'm upset , ' " Hood says .
" ' What happened ?
What 's going on ? ' "
Antonucci responded , " I figured you 'd ask that . "
He took out some sheets of paper from a folder and passed them to his bosses .
The sheets explained that all his moneymaking schemes were part of an elaborate experiment he was conducting to help Young Champions discover its security flaws .
He called it " Project Catch Them . "
Antonucci told Hood and Hollingworth he 'd intended to show Young Champions how its instructors might steal from the company , and he added that he was " shocked " they 'd caught him first .
Then he pulled $ 2,700 worth of $ 20 bills from a moneybag in his pants and handed it to Hollingworth , explaining it was his illicit profit — from the semester that began just a few weeks earlier .
" Our jaws dropped to the ground , " Hood says .
" I told him , ' Do you think I became the president of a company to be this stupid ? "
They estimated that Antonucci had snatched more than $ 10,000 in the previous year .
Yet days later , when Antonucci came clean and admitted to stealing , the company decided to let him keep teaching some classes .
It was n't a great time to give up one of its best instructors .
The company had been posting poor profits and had recently hired an auditor to catch other thieves and figure out better ways to manage the firm 's income .
The auditor found a big reason for the company 's poor performance : another embezzling employee , who Hood says used forgery and fraud to steal at least $ 16,000 and perhaps far more .
Young Champions forwarded its findings to police .
The employee has n't been charged so New Times is withholding the person 's name .
With bigger fish to fry , and with parents asking when Antonucci was coming back , Hood relented .
" We were going to take small amounts out of [ Antonucci 's ] check , " Hood says .
" I felt good .
I was not ruining this kid's life . "
By that April , though , Sensei Jon had blown his second chance .
Parents had started to complain , saying they paid too much for their kids ' aptitude tests in the classes .
It turned out Antonucci had added his own personal surcharge to the test fees .
The teen was fired , this time without much ado .
But Hollingworth found more trouble when he went through Antonucci 's company e-mails .
Antonucci and Robinson had used the e-mails to discuss plans for the new company , Red Dragon .
Hollingworth had also suspected Robinson was running some of the same schemes as Antonucci but had n't caught him red - handed yet .
He decided to perform a second audit of Robinson 's records and , this time , found discrepancies that seemed to prove Robinson had stolen money , too .
Robinson was given an ultimatum : stop the shenanigans or be fired .
As for Antonucci , the company took the possible competition seriously and threatened to sue him .
Like all the other instructors , Antonucci had signed a contract with Young Champions that prohibited him from similar employment within 16 months of leaving the company .
Yet by May , Antonucci had started his own classes .
" We were getting ready to file an injunction , " says Hollingworth .
Antonucci decided to settle with his former employer .
He agreed to stop recruiting his former students , to not copy the company 's business model , and to pay the company 's attorney fees in the case .
He was supposed to come into the office on Monday , June 15 , to sign the agreement .
By then , there was no office .
The fire happened during a rare stretch of cool weather in June .
The arsonists dressed mostly in black and all wore dark , hooded sweaters .
Just after 11 p.m. , Murillo , Otto , Antonucci , and Robinson met at the Walmart at 75th Avenue and McDowell Road and bought three five - gallon gas cans .
They filled them up at a nearby Chevron station and put them in the bed of Antonucci 's pickup with two other gas cans already there .
As part of their planned alibi , authorities believe , Murillo and Otto drove to another friend 's house about midnight , hung out for a bit , then took Otto 's car to meet Antonucci and Robinson at Young Champions headquarters , 5414 South 40th Street .
They parked the two vehicles about a block away and left one gas can behind because of the weight — each weighed about 30 pounds .
The karate instructors each carried one can to the awning before passing them to the top , says fire inspector Marika McCue .
All four climbed up onto the awning , McCue says .
Antonucci smashed the second - floor window to Rory Hood 's office , his hand protected by a soccer shin -guard .
The gas cans were hauled inside .
" They were madly splashing it around — 20 gallons of fuel , " says McCue .
" Even if the room had been twice that size , it still would have been a lot of fumes . "
Robinson and his younger friends apparently figured the liquid gas on the floor , desk , and cabinets would catch fire far more slowly .
Larry Moody , Robinson 's stepfather , says his son was n't mechanically inclined and was " very naive to the power of gasoline . "
When Robinson struck the match , " he spontaneously ignited , " says McCue .
" Everything — clothes , skin , hair . "
The other suspects fled the scene without calling for help .
To create their own alibi , Antonucci and Robinson had intended to drive to Utah after the building was torched .
Robinson and his fiancée planned to get married that Sunday night .
He had arranged to pick up his other two children at his ex-wife 's place and bring them to Phoenix for a brief ceremony .
Now , obviously , the wedding was off .
The three surviving friends met up at Antonucci 's house and watched Liar , Liar .
It 's doubtful they paid much attention to the flick , considering what they 'd just been through , but the choice of movie was appropriate .
After the movie , Antonucci filed a missing persons report on Robinson .
He apparently wanted authorities to believe he had no idea what had happened to his friend .
By dawn , the group had split up .
Antonucci drove to Landmark Missionary Baptist Church in Casa Grande , where his father is pastor .
About 1 p.m. , a Young Champions employee told authorities the body at the fire scene was definitely Josh Robinson's , judging by a tattoo of a Japanese character on the corpse 's back .
McCue says the employee told her that Robinson and Antonucci were as " thick as thieves . "
Police called Antonucci a couple of hours later and asked him to come in for an interview .
He drove to police headquarters at 620 West Washington Street with his brother , Joshua — and blabbed his way right into a jail cell .
Before he gave McCue enough information to arrest him , though , Antonucci inadvertently gave up his friends , Otto and Murillo .
In recounting the evening of June 13 , Antonucci casually mentioned they had accompanied him to Walmart to buy gas cans , which Robinson wanted to take to Utah " because he has a habit of allowing his vehicle to run out of gas . "
Until then , Otto and Murillo were n't on McCue 's radar .
Young Champions employees did n't suspect them , and police might never have known they were with the other two arsonists that night .
Antonucci told the investigator that , despite the purchase of gas cans and gasoline , he did n't know Robinson intended to burn down a building .
He did claim , however , that just one week before , Robinson had " joked " about torching Young Champions to destroy the company 's paperwork .
After they bought the gas , Antonucci related in the police interview , Robinson told him he had to run out for a quick errand before they drove to Utah .
But , he contended , Robinson never came back .
McCue tightened the screws , telling him — truthfully — that a witness had seen someone that fit his description in a similar pickup driving slowly around the Young Champions building just before the fire started .
With that , Antonucci confessed .
Sort of .
He admitted he 'd driven Robinson to Young Champions .
Antonucci told McCue he thought they were driving to Utah , but Robinson started giving him directions that led him to the building .
He said he did n't question Robinson , nor did he see the older man remove any gas cans from Antonucci 's pickup .
He said he waited in the truck a block away , not knowing what Robinson was doing .
Then came a popping sound , followed a few minutes later by sirens .
Antonucci told McCue he then drove past the Young Champions building and saw Robinson in flames on top of the awning .
He drove down the street , made a U - turn , and drove past one more time .
Robinson was now on the ground .
" He said it was awful seeing his best friend agonizingly burn alive , " states McCue 's report .
" He denied getting out of his vehicle and said he just left the area because he did n't want anyone to think he was involved with setting the fire . "
Armed with details about the purchase of gas cans by Otto and Murillo , police called in the pair for a chat on June 23 .
They drove to the police station together .
Phoenix police Detective Audrey Santisi interviewed Murillo first .
At the outset , she would say only that she had been with Otto and Antonucci the night of the fire .
They had watched Liar , Liar together while worrying why Robinson had disappeared before his planned trip to Utah , Murillo said .
Murillo acknowledged hearing rumors around the office that Antonucci and Robinson were suspected of embezzling from the firm .
Then came Otto 's turn .
He talked about the embezzlement investigation , too , telling Santisi that Antonucci admitted to him that he'd stolen $ 600 from Young Champions .
Otto said Robinson , on the other hand , " never took a single dime " from the company .
Otto told Santisi that , a week before the fire , Robinson and Antonucci were " joking " that if they burned down the building , it would " erase everything . "
During the same conversation , Otto claimed , Antonucci talked about his contract 's anti-competition clause and " was making comments of how he would like to bring YCOA down or take YCOA out , for the sake of his business .
Jeff interpreted this as that Jon 's business would be dominant over YCOA . "
Otto also talked of buying the gas cans with the other instructors .
Murillo had n't mentioned that part , but Otto admitted buying one of the cans when re-interviewed by Santisi .
The two remained free for about two weeks — until fire officials recovered the digital video file from the surveillance camera .
McCue told the pair to come back in for another interview , which they did on July 5 .
She showed Murillo a still image from the video that shows three people , including the burning Robinson , on the awning .
Murillo cracked .
In tears , she confessed to helping plan and execute the arson .
After police took her into custody , they found the receipt for one of the gas cans in her purse , as if she 'd been keeping it as a memento .
McCue says
Otto stuck to his story .
At the end of an hours - long interview , she pulled out the video image .
She pointed at one of the people in the picture .
The face was n't visible , but the figure had Otto 's build .
" That 's you , " she told him .
" I think I need a lawyer , " Otto said , before invoking his right to remain silent .
McCue says she later discovered one piece of hard evidence against Otto :
Cell phone records show he sent a text message from the fire scene , just after midnight on June 14 .
Why Otto and Murillo decided to help their friends commit arson still is n't clear .
They might have fallen for what police believe was the poorly considered plan by Antonucci and Robinson to erase evidence of their embezzlement and clear the path for Antonucci 's business — where they were considering working .
As it turned out , the hard drive of a computer containing the instructors ' records — and , therefore , potential proof of the schemes — was recovered intact by authorities .
On top of that , Antonucci 's paperwork already had been copied and passed on to police .
The company had proof of Antonucci's and Robinson 's thefts , but not Otto 's and Murillo's .
Hollingworth says it 's possible the two also were stealing from the company , which could have meant they , too , wanted to destroy records .
He tells New Times it would take time to go through the data to figure out whether Otto and Murillo pocketed class fees .
He says he wo n't bother now because the point is moot .
McCue says Otto and Murillo 's involvement is , perhaps , the oddest aspect of the case .
The investigator has been able to find no evidence of a motive for their engaging in the arson , beyond a strong friendship with the more - experienced instructors .
Even romance did n't enter in : McCue says Murillo was attracted to Otto , but the two were n't dating .
" They had nothing to gain .
Nothing , " says McCue .
" They came to a cross in the road — they had to make a choice .
Are you going to do the right thing or go along with your buddies ? "
Wearing stripes and pink long underwear in an interview room in the Fourth Avenue Jail in downtown Phoenix , the minister 's son is nervous — but cocky .
He 's lanky , about six feet tall .
A detention officer later tells New Times that Jonathan Antonucci is creating a reputation for himself as a jailhouse preacher .
During an interview , Antonucci peppers his conversation with Bible quotes .
He tries to compare himself to Kings David and Solomon , who sinned mightily yet " always came back to what they were taught . "
Despite his professed religious beliefs , some of Antonucci 's statements to New Times contradict what he told police .
And despite his pleading guilty to manslaughter and arson , Antonucci maintains he 's guilty of neither .
" The biggest reason I was there was that I was going along to try to stop them , " Antonucci claims .
" Somebody told me that maybe , somewhere deep down in my subconscious , I wanted it to happen .
I do n't believe that 's true .
I really do n't .
But if it is , I know it 's no longer true . "
If he had to do it again , he says , he would n't try to stop the arson with mere argument .
Instead of acting " cowardly , " he says he would have tackled Robinson to stop him .
He implies that Robinson had a motive for the arson but that " embezzlement had absolutely nothing to do with it . "
So what was the motive ?
" The motivation was not my own , so I 'd rather not speak of it , " he replies .
Though Antonucci reportedly told McCue that he never got out of his truck , he now claims he was far from the truck when the fire broke out .
He says the police report is wrong :
He never saw Robinson on fire and , therefore , did n't fail to seek help for his friend .
" To me , it made me sound like quite a monster , and that is not what happened , " he says .
" The smart side got a hold of me about 15 seconds after the incident began , and I ran as fast as I possibly could " back to the truck .
Clearly , his statements to New Times and to police can't both be true .
It 's disturbing how Antonucci tries to justify stealing money from Young Champions .
Though he admits " there was probably $ 600 to $ 800 that I came by that I should not have come by , " he explains that he took the money in retaliation for the company 's breaking a promise to him .
In 2008 , he was told by the company that he could work as an instructor for a summer camp , he says , but Young Champions canceled the camp .
That put him in a financial bind , he says , " so I thought . . .
I 'll take a little extra here . "
He says he believes Young Champions did n't deserve to be torched , but " I guess some people might disagree with that . "
Antonucci says he does n't believe Otto or Murillo should be sentenced to any more time in prison than he himself gets .
( Otto 's trial , if he does n't change his plea , is scheduled in May . )
Antonucci says he hopes
Otto will be found innocent .
He says he also hopes the judge in his case , Joseph Kreamer , gives him fewer than the minimum seven years that the state is seeking .
When he gets out , he says , he 'll try to find Robinson 's son " to make sure he 's doing okay . "
Somehow , it seems doubtful that Robinson 's former fiancée , who has reportedly returned to Mexico , would ever want to see him again .
The staffers at Young Champions sure do n't .
They hope he gets the maximum 21 years .
And they worry that whenever he gets out , he will come after them or the company .
Josh Robinson 's parents are crushed , both by their son's death and his criminal behavior .
Angie Guzman , Robinson 's sister , cries as she explains how she and her son are unlikely to see Robinson 's kids ever again .
Then there are all the friends and students of the four people connected to the arson .
Two memorials for Robinson drew hundreds of people .
In response to online articles in New Times about the suspects , many parents of students left written comments about how the crime has shaken their lives .
One woman contacted by New Times related how her teenage daughter had benefited enormously from training with Robinson over seven years .
" She was devastated [ by the death ] , " the teen 's mother says .
" Two weeks later , she had lost 10 pounds .
Her self - confidence has gone down .
She does n't trust people .
She 's just not the same — it 's like her innocence was lost . "
The woman said she wanted to deliver a message to Antonucci from her daughter at his sentencing hearing .
" She wanted me to look Jon in the eye and ask , ' Why did you leave your best friend when he was on fire ? ' "
The woman showed up for the scheduled sentencing on January 8 but did n't try to talk to Antonucci .
( A sign in the courtroom prohibits such communication with detainees . )
Antonucci , in shackles , smiled occasionally during the proceeding but did n't turn to look at anyone in the gallery .
The courtroom was packed : Antonucci 's friends and family on one side , and his detractors — including staff members of Young Champions — on the other .
His father 's mouth hung open slightly , as if stunned by the event .
His mother had a sort of old - school Christian schoolmarm look ; she wore a plain , long , blue skirt and white blouse .
Neither would comment for this article .
Antonucci's lawyer , Jeffrey Kirchler , said he needed extra time to round up people to testify in support of the defendant .
Judge Kreamer rescheduled the sentencing for March 5 .
Deputy County Attorney Jon Wendell told the judge he would use the extra time to prepare a list of aggravating factors Kreamer should consider before the sentencing .
As he was led out after the hearing , Sensei Jon avoided the stares of his detractors .
IN DEFENSE OF SHAMELESS EXPLOITATION … .
The capture of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , the Taliban ’s top military commander , is no small matter .
It ’s a “ major victory . ”
Given that Baradar is the most significant Taliban figure to be detained since the war began , and his role in leading the Taliban ’s military operations , this is a success that may very well pay considerable dividends for U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
As far as the politics is concerned , it ’s worth noting that U.S. leaders were well aware of Baradar ’s capture late last week , but deliberately kept the news under wraps in order to help bolster a sensitive and ongoing intelligence - gathering effort .
This prompted Juan Cole to note :
[ T ] hat Joe Biden and others kept the arrest secret , in order to allow further operations against Taliban leaders in Karachi , shows a discipline that Bush and Cheney never had .
They were always happy to prematurely release details of ongoing investigations to get a political bump , even if it meant allowing terrorists to escape .
Right .
Dick Cheney was blasting the Obama administration on national security over the weekend , and it might have been tempting for Biden and others to use the Baradar capture as evidence that Cheney does n’t know what he ’s talking about .
But the White House Grown - Ups knew the ongoing efforts were more important than making Dick the Clown look foolish .
As Andrew Sullivan noted , the president and his team “ are serious about national security and do not put domestic political games before it . ”
And that ’s obviously a good thing , which inspires confidence in the administration .
That said , Steve M. raises an interesting observation .
[ G]uys ?
You should probably take at least a small victory lap .
There has to be something you can do that ’s more than stoic silence but still well short of the “ Mission Accomplished ” flyboy stunt .
At least send Biden to the morning shows to talk about the capture … subtly , but with pride .
That seems pretty persuasive to me .
During the Bush / Cheney era , no counter - terrorism development was too small to trumpet .
The arrest of some low - level thug who once said something nice about al Qaeda was reason enough for press conferences and media interviews with high - ranking administration officials .
If U.S. officials had helped capture Baradar in the Bush / Cheney era , we ’d probably see just about every official you can think of — POTUS , VPOTUS , AG , Defense Secretary , HHS Secretary , NSA , etc. — hitting the airwaves to pat themselves on the back .
The goal would be to get a bump in the polls .
Obama and his team are obviously less interested in exploiting counter - terrorism victories for political gain , and prefer to treat Americans like adults , rather than manipulating their fears .
As a result , capturing high - profile terrorists ( Baradar ) , killing high - profile terrorists ( Hakimullah Mehsud , Baitullah Mehsud , Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan ) , and arresting would - be terrorists ( Najibullah Zazi , Talib Islam , and Hosam Maher Husein Smadi ) — all victories that bolster our national security interests — are treated as low - key successes .
All in a day ’s work .
That ’s admirable , to be sure .
But a little chest - thumping is hardly out of the question here .
If the White House does n’t draw more attention to their victories , the public may not hear about them .
I can appreciate the president ’s mature , sensible restraint as much as the next guy , but the White House is also facing an aggressive misinformation campaign , launched by those who still want to convince Americans that Obama is n’t reliable on national security , all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding .
Some understated - but - public appreciation for the men and women in the military and intelligence agencies who make these successes possible seems more than fair .
Researchers have found some misbehaving neurons in the part of the brain that tells time .
The startling discovery could change how neuroscientists think about the brain ’s influence on the body ’s biological rhythms , and has raised questions about the very definition of a functioning neuron .
At the University of Manchester in England , electrophysiologist Mino Belle studies the electrical activity of neurons in the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus , or SCN .
Although no bigger than a grain of rice , the SCN is the brain ’s central timekeeper and command center in charge of coordinating the cycles , called circadian rhythms , that determine the crucial timing of processes like hormone release , the sleep - wake cycle , and metabolism .
Neuroscientists like Belle are busy trying to figure out how and why the cells in the SCN behave the way they do , because insights at the cellular level could lead to more effective therapies for sleep disorders , like insomnia and narcolepsy , as well as disorders linked to disrupted circadian rhythms , like shift work sleep disorder and jet lag .
Understanding what makes the SCN tick could also lead to better therapies for metabolism disorders like diabetes .
For decades , conventional wisdom has said that SCN neurons fire frequently during the day , while an individual is awake , and rest at night .
But researchers now know that not all SCN neurons are created equal .
Specifically , not all of them contain genes that code for a specific type of “ molecular clock . ”
In 2007 , Belle began experimenting with mice that were genetically engineered so their clock - containing SCN cells would glow fluorescent green , standing out amongst their neighbors .
When he recorded only from clock - containing cells , he observed a perplexing pattern in the data : instead of firing during the day , these cells were actually at rest .
Even stranger : they were resting in an electrical state never before recorded in healthy neurons .
“ When we started to see the behavior , it took me several months to accept , ” said Belle .
“ But it was overwhelmingly the case . ”
Belle spent those months not only replicating the result , but also performing various tests to make sure the cells were healthy .
His findings were published in the October 9 issue of the journal Science .
The SCN uses environmental cues , most importantly light , to determine the time of day and year .
But Belle ’s findings shake up everything researchers thought they knew about how SCN neurons respond to those cues .
Furthermore , the results fly in the face of the current working definition of a healthy neuron .
A resting neuron usually has a membrane potential — the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell — of about - 70 mV .
It “ fires ” when an influx of positive charge , usually in the form of charged sodium or calcium particles , causes sufficient “ depolarization . ”
The threshold is usually around - 50 mV .
But Belle reports observing neurons with a resting membrane potential of - 25 mV during the day .
Barnard College neuroscientist Joseph LeSauter , who has studied the SCN for 16 years , has a hard time making sense of that finding .
“ At minus 30 [ mV ] or minus 35 , maybe it ’s OK .
But at minus 25 , that cell , in order to survive , has to eat up so much energy that it would be very strange to be in that state .
Why would a brain be designed to eat so much energy ?
I cannot conceptualize it , ” LeSauter said .
The unique firing pattern and strange membrane potential are so contrary to conventional thinking about the SCN that Belle and University of Manchester colleague Hugh Piggins , a co-author of the Science paper who has studied the SCN for 18 years , were not surprised when it was next to impossible to convince colleagues it was real .
Fortunately , they got some help .
Unbeknownst to them , a research group led by University of Michigan mathematician Daniel Forger had built a model of the SCN , based on data collected from existing literature , that predicted the very electrical behavior they had observed .
Mathematical models can help answer questions about complex systems like the SCN , said Forger , because they can simulate and analyze multiple variables simultaneously .
While laboratory experiments can only look at one or two parts of a system at a time , a mathematical model can combine the individual observations and then predict how a system will behave when all the parts are working together .
The match between the predictions made by the University of Michigan model and the findings from Belle ’s research is dead - on , Forger said .
“ A model is never perfect , but I think you ’d be hard pressed to say the model did n’t predict certainly qualitatively — and I think quantitatively — what was found experimentally . ”
After connecting at a 2008 conference on biological rhythms in Florida , the two research teams began a collaboration that continues today .
But with or without the model , the result is surprising , said electrophyiologist Charles Allen of Oregon Health and Science University .
“ We ’re all trying to figure out exactly where it fits in what we know about how neurons function .
There is no other example in any nerve cell for a functional state that is that depolarized , ” he said .
Allen , like LeSauter , has a hard time understanding why such a depolarized state would ever occur , given its high energy cost .
He also said the data raises important questions about how these neurons could be surviving such a large influx of positive charge , most likely in the form of calcium , which at high amounts is toxic to the cell .
Belle , meanwhile , welcomes the uncertainty .
“ Now that we have seen cells reside outside of normal neurophysiology , we may ask the next questions :
Is that all that we know about the central nervous system ?
Is that all that we know about neurons ? ”
Strap on your seatbelts , folks !
You ’re about to board the Sarah Palin Hypocrite Coaster .
You must be this obtuse to ride .
As a former TV writer and political editor of National Lampoon , I do n’t know if there ’s anything off - limits when satirizing , though one would hope those commanding the pen have some inkling of what satire means before they take to the page .
Joking is n’t necessarily satire .
I ’ve heard a lot of offensive jokes that do n’t fall within an ironic mile from satire .
But for argument ’s sake , let ’s say Limbaugh was using satire to rip into Emanuel .
My argument here is n’t with Limbaugh as much as it is with Palin ’s selective righteous indignation .
If I have this right , the former governor feels Emanuel ’s crude colloquial usage of the word " retard " in a private meeting is a " ... slur on all God ’s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities – and the people who love them , " but if used satirically over the radio to millions of listeners to describe Emanuel , liberal groups and mental health advocates , it 's okey - dokey .
Okay , governor , let ’s try this one out .
You know what ’s retarded ?
Claiming you know foreign policy because " you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska . "
You know what else is retarded ?
Telling David Letterman that a joking reference to your daughter is out of bounds but defending Rush Limbaugh ’s reference to people ( including mental health advocates ) as retards who were attending a retarded summit .
That ’s real retarded .
Almost as retarded as quitting half way through your governorship and saying you ’re not quitting but that " I know when it 's time to pass the ball for victory . "
But not as retarded as saying Rush Limbaugh - who called people " retarded " - was only quoting Emanuel – who was calling a proposal " retarded " - when the only words of Emanuel he " quoted " were " f- ing retarded . "
You know how retarded that is ?
It ’s like saying " four score and seven disabled children should be shot and dismembered " and then saying you were just quoting the Gettysburg address .
Retarded ?
Sure .
But you know who is the biggest retard ?
The hypocritical retard who deceitfully uses her own down syndrome baby as a political brickbat to bash her opponents , but allows the same child and all the other of " God ’s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities " to be slurred to millions of Americans by the most retarded retard on the radio .
A politically opportunistic retard who puts a pompous retard of a talk show host above her own special needs child .
That , ladies and gentleman , is not only f’-ing retarded .
It is terribly and incredibly sad .
So ... whataya think , Sarah ?
I ’m only quoting Emanuel .
Pretty satirical , huh ?

The Blackwater security company took its name from the water of the North Carolina swamp where the company is headquartered .
After its involvement in a deadly shooting rampage in downtown Baghdad in 2007 , the company changed its name to the innocuous Xe last year .
It has also set up a proliferation of “ affiliates ” under various names .
But Blackwater / Xe ’s swamp muck just keeps on bubbling .
The Justice Department ’s criminal fraud section has launched an investigation into whether Blackwater officials paid bribes to Iraqi officials , a possible violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , The New York Times reported Jan. 31 .
The investigation was opened late last year , after the Times reported that top Blackwater executives had approved around $ 1 million in secret payments to Iraqi officials in an effort to “ buy their support ” for the firm to continue operating in Iraq after the Sept. 16 , 2007 , shooting spree in Baghdad ’s crowded Nisour Square .
The incident , which killed 17 Iraqis and left many others injured , created a furor in Iraq and drew worldwide condemnation .
The Blackwater guards claimed they had acted in self - defense , but witnesses and victims say the guards , escorting a heavily armed convoy through Baghdad traffic , unleashed an indiscriminate , unprovoked attack .
Victims said the guards had blocked traffic at the intersection and randomly opened fire at everything and everyone around them .
Blackwater also reportedly paid about $ 800,000 to families of victims in the incident .
“ It ’s unclear how much of those payments were settlements versus bribes , ” notes a report at MainJustice , a site that covers the Justice Department .
Blackwater ’s bribery efforts were apparently unsuccessful , as the firm was subsequently barred from Iraq .
On Friday , the Justice Department appealed a court decision that dismissed criminal charges against five former Blackwater guards for the 2007 Nisour Square shooting .
A U.S. district court judge in December threw out manslaughter charges against the guards over procedural issues .
The dismissal sparked outrage in Iraq .
Iraqi President Nouri al - Maliki said his government would sue Blackwater on behalf of the victims .
Last month , Vice President Joe Biden , on a visit to Iraq , said the U.S. government would appeal the dismissal .
At the time of the incident , Blackwater and all other U.S. personnel in Iraq were immune from Iraqi laws under a controversial order issued by U.S. occupation chief Paul Bremer in 2004 .
That immunity was lifted in the U.S. - Iraq status of forces agreement signed in December 2008 , in the last days of the Bush administration .
It was not until then , more than a year after the shooting spree , that the U.S. Justice Department issued criminal charges against the guards .
The 35 - count Justice Department indictment issued Dec. 8 , 2008 , charged five Blackwater guards with 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one weapons violation count .
If convicted , the men would face 10 years in prison for each manslaughter charge , plus additional time for the other charges .
Meanwhile , two former Blackwater security guards were arrested last month and charged with murder for their role in the deaths of two Afghan civilians in Kabul in May 2009 .
Actually they were working for a Blackwater / Xe “ affiliate ” by the name of Paravant .
After Blackwater gained notoriety over the 2007 Baghdad incident , the State Department said it would stop doing business with the company , but a Feb .
1 ABC News report says that “ several other agencies , including the CIA and the Pentagon , continue to employ the controversial company , under a myriad of names , often via secret , classified contracts . ”
The ABC report says Blackwater / Xe is “ operating subdivisions under a variety of altered handles intended to lower its public profile .
In some instances the flagship company has tried to distance itself from these offshoots , insisting they are merely ‘ affiliates . ’
“ Public records and a source familiar with their ownership suggest , however , that the companies are nothing more than new names on the same old Blackwater . ”
A total of 20 different entities , with names like Paravant , XPG , Greystone , Raven , Constellation , US Training Center , GSD Manufacturing , and Presidential Airlines , all are owned by Blackwater founder Erik Prince and registered to the same address as Blackwater - Xe , the ABC report says .
Although Xe was barred from Iraq after the Nisour Square incident , the report says , “ Xe and its rebranded affiliates still work in Afghanistan , and continue to provide security and training , ” often as subcontractors to big name firms like Raytheon .
Another Blackwater / Xe “ affiliate , ” Select PTC , later renamed XPG , has been involved in clandestine operations in countries including Pakistan , Afghanistan , Iraq , Syria and the Philippines , according to the ABC report .
XPG currently has a Pentagon contract paying it $ 17,000 per day , or more than $ 6 million a year , to provide security services along Afghanistan ’s border with Pakistan , says ABC .
Last month
Xe submitted a bid for another contract , worth about $ 1 billion , for training and security in Afghanistan .
The Pentagon has not yet made a decision on that contract .
ABC quotes Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D - Ill. , a member of the House Intelligence Committee , questioning why Blackwater under any name still gets government contracts .
“ After everything that has gone wrong … with Blackwater , I cannot understand why the U.S. government has anything to do with them , ” she said .
“ I have yet to hear a convincing reason for their continued work for the government . ”

Bad news for moms , dads , directors , producers , agents , friends , lovers , deceased grandparents , dialogue coaches , yoga teachers , therapists , dieticians , inspirational teachers and much - missed pets .
The organisers of this year 's Academy Awards have called time on that appallingly fascinating Oscar - night staple , the everlasting and tearful acceptance speech in which several telephone directories of names are thanked as an actor grapples with the twin shock of industry recognition and performing without a script .
Winners at next month 's ceremony will instead be instructed to give two speeches : a pithy onstage one explaining the personal significance of their Oscar triumph , and a backstage one – delivered to a " thank you cam " – in which they can express their gratitude to anyone and everyone as unrestrainedly as they wish .
The backstage video will then be posted on the web for winners to share with their fans , peers and loved ones through email or Facebook .
The idea , said Oscars co-producer Bill Mechanic , was quite simple – the elimination of what he termed " the single most hated thing on the show " .
News of the initiative was broken at the annual Oscar nominees lunch in Beverly Hills yesterday .
Guests at the event – including George Clooney , Sandra Bullock , Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges – were given tips on how best to use a 45 - second acceptance speech and instructed to " share your passion on what the Oscar means to you " , rather than embark on a marathon of thank - yous .
To hammer their point home , the ceremony 's producers resorted to aversion therapy by playing a video of past winners ' thoughts from the podium .
The tape included the speech that Renée Zellweger unleashed after lifting the best supporting actress Oscar in 2004 for her role as a tough farm girl in Anthony Minghella 's Cold Mountain .
She plucked a sheet of notes from her clutch bag before taking to the stage and memorably paying tribute to , among others : the academy ; her fellow nominees ; Charles Frazier for writing the novel on which the film was based ; the film 's producers , cast and crew ; director Minghella for his " masterpiece " ; her friends at Miramax ; her fellow actors Vincent D'Onofrio and Tom Cruise for , respectively , " teaching me how to work " and demonstrating that " kindness and success are not mutually exclusive " ; and her glorious family , especially " my immigrant mom and dad " , her brother and his new wife .
The two - speech directive will not be the only break with tradition this year .
Impatient winners keen to display their award prominently – or put it to more modest use as a doorstop or bathroom ornament – will be able to take their fully engraved statuette home after the ceremony .
Until now , the victorious parties have had to wait weeks for the academy to inscribe their names on the gold - plated trophies – they are handed out without nameplates as the winners ' identities are kept a closely - guarded secret .
This year , winners will be able to get their nameplates affixed to their Oscars at the gala governors ball straight after the ceremony .
RS
Owens , the company which makes the statuettes , will produce and engrave 197 nameplates – one for each nominee in every category .
The engraving will include the nominee 's name , category , film title and year .
" An Oscar statuette just is n't complete until a nameplate is attached , " said Tom Sherak , the president of the academy .
" The governors ball is the perfect place for Oscar winners to add that final touch as they celebrate their accomplishment and the year 's movies . "
Once the winners have been announced , the unlucky runners - up will suffer the additional indignity of having their nameplates recycled .

A White House aide has appeared at a briefing with the words " hope " and " change " written on his hand in a jibe at Republican Sarah Palin .
Mrs Palin , the former vice - presidential candidate , had been shown reading crib notes from her hand at a question and answers session on Saturday .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs also appeared to have his shopping list written on his palm .
" Hope " and " Change " were the key themes of President Obama 's election campaign .
Eggs , milk , bread
Mr Gibbs was speaking at the White House shortly after the president had been stressing the need for a bipartisan approach to politics .
Showing his left palm , Mr Gibbs said : " I wrote a few things down . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The list read in vertical order - eggs , milk , bread [ which had been crossed out ] .
" And then I wrote down ' hope and change ' , just in case I forgot , " he said .
The jibe reportedly drew groans from reporters present .
At the weekend , Mrs Palin was delivering a speech and taking part in a question and answer session for the Tea Party movement , which draws together opponents of Mr Obama 's healthcare reform , his economic stimulus package and other aspects of his agenda .
A photo taken during the event showed her left hand with the words " energy " , " budget cuts " , " tax " and " lift Americans ' spirits " .
The word " budget " had been crossed out .
Video footage showed her seemingly reading from her hand when asked what top three things a conservative - led Congress should do .
In her speech , Mrs Palin received a standing ovation as she called for a " return to conservative principles " .
She also spoke of a " charismatic guy with a teleprompter " - an apparent reference to President Obama .
The Winter Olympics are still a week and a half away , but it 's never too early to start getting warmed up .
Let 's take a look at the origins of some of the events you 'll be enjoying from Vancouver .
1. Figure Skating
Skating has been around for centuries , but figure skating 's expressive movements are actually somewhat more recent than you might suspect .
The athletic , acrobatic version of the sport was n't popularized until the mid-19th century .
Jackson Haines , an American with a ballet background , wowed European crowds with his graceful movements and thrilling jumps while also making another key breakthrough : he choreographed his routines and set them to music .
This so - called " international style "  of skating caught on in Vienna and other European cities and gave rise to the kind of figure skating we 'll be watching in the Olympics .
2. Biathlon
As you might expect from a sport that involves a rifle , biathlon has military roots .
Norwegian soldiers have been running combined skiing - and - shooting races since at least 1767 , and the Norwegian military sponsored the first modern race of this kind in 1921 .
In those days , though , it was n't quite like the biathlon we know .
Instead , it was an event called " military patrol "  that involved a four - man patrol going through the event in heavy backpacks .
Military patrol was actually a medal event at the 1924 Winter Olympics , but it quickly fell off of the program and was only a demonstration sport at the 1928 , 1936 and 1948 Games .
The idea of individuals racing on skis with guns gained popularity in Europe throughout the 1950s , though , and by 1960 , the races were back on the Olympic program as the individual biathlon event .
3. Curling
The event that loves to confuse American spectators traces its roots back to medieval Scotland .
It was n't quite the strategic game it is now when it got its start , though ; early curling basically consisted of Scottish men sliding flat - bottomed rocks along icy ponds .
It was fun , though , and Scottish soldiers brought the game to Canada , where it really took off .
( Some estimates have upwards of 90 % of the world 's curlers living in Canada . )
4 , 5 & 6 . Luge , Skeleton , and Bobsled
The three events that require an icy track have a common origin in one man 's brain .
In the late 1860s , Swiss hotelier Caspar Badrutt had a problem : no one wanted to spend the winter at his chilly resort in St. Moritz .
Rather than spend the winter with an empty hotel , Badrutt convinced some of his regulars that it would be fun to spend some time at a " winter resort , "  and English guests started flocking to St. Moritz during the cold months .
The guests found a particularly exciting way to pass their time when they started modifying delivery boys ' sleds and zipping down the town 's streets .
( If you lashed two of these sleds together , you had the precursor to the modern bobsled . )
All of this sledding was great fun , but Badrutt soon had a new problem on his hands : since the only place to run the sleds was on the city 's streets , sledders kept careening into pedestrians .
To combat this dangerous problem , Badrutt built an icy halfpipe track to keep the sleds off of the streets .
Within a decade , the sledding events had grown into competitive sports , and bobsled was on the program for the first Winter Olympics in 1924 .
7. Snowboarding
Although snowboards may have been around in some form since the 19th century , they did n't become an actual commercial product until the 1960s .
In 1965 , Sherman Poppen , a Michigan dad , bound two skis together to make a snowboard - like ride for his daughter .
The device , which he dubbed " the Snurfer , "  sold nearly a million units over the next 10 years .
By the end of the 1970s , many other surfers and skiers had made little innovations and improvements to the design , including bindings to hold the rider 's boots , which helped the sport 's popularity explode during the ' 80s and '90s .
8 . Ice hockey
Ice hockey 's origins are a bit more obscure than some of its counterparts at the Games .
Games that evolved into the similar ice sport of bandy have been played since the 10th century , and reports of a hockey - like game exist in the history of Eastern Canada 's indigenous Mikmaq people .
Whatever its exact origins , hockey really took off in 19th - century Canada .
British soldiers and Canadian schoolboys alike enjoyed playing the game on the country 's frozen ponds and lakes , and during the 1870s a student group at McGill University wrote down the first set of hockey rules .
Some of these rules would be familiar to modern watchers — they replaced the ball with a wooden puck — while others would make the game seem a bit hectic , like allowing nine players per side .
Even the origins of the name " hockey "  are murky .
Some scholars contend that the name is derived from hoquet , a French word for a shepherd 's crook that would resemble a hockey stick .
Others argue that it was so named because it was " Colonel Hockey 's game , "  a tribute to an 1850s - era British officer who was stationed in Nova Scotia and used the game to keep his men in shape .
9. Short Track Speed Skating
Traditional speed skating involves pairs of timed skaters making their way around an oval track .
However , in North America , it was common for indoor races with shorter tracks to feature mass starts where all the racers took off at once .
The mass starts and the tracks that had been shortened to accommodate indoor arenas led to exciting races , and in 1967 the International Skating Union began to recognize the event .
10 . Ski Jumping
Like the biathlon , ski jumping owes a big debt to the Norwegian military .
In 1809 , Olaf Rye , who would later go on to become a major - general , was fooling around on some skis in front of his fellow soldiers and managed to jump 30 feet into the air .
The thrilling new sport quickly spread throughout Norway , with jumpers getting increasingly ambitious .
In 1862 , the first organized competition took place in Trysil , Norway , and in 1879 , the first annual installment of the wildly popular Husebyrennet jumping competition took Oslo by storm .

ranks among the top five small universities in the nation in producing Peace Corps volunteers .
Many other Pacific Northwest colleges and universities are also doing their part to keep the
supplied with volunteers
The Peace Corps
last week that 20 University of Portland graduates are serving in its programs abroad .
That puts the university in a tie with the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma , Wash . , and Williams College in Williamstown , Mass. , as the fourth largest producer of Peace Corps volunteers among colleges and universities with less than 5,000 undergraduate students .
St. Olaf College in Northfield , Minn. , was the top producer with 26 of its alumni in the field .
Emily Bradvica is one of the University of Portland graduates now in the Peace Corps as a youth development volunteer in the Ancash province of northern Peru , where she lives with a host family .
" Ancash is the most beautiful place I have ever been in my life , and I take every chance I get to point that out to my host familia , " she wrote on her
on Jan. 30 .
" There are the moments that it is so easy to feel a part of this town , so easy to feel myself becoming not just a passerby , but someone who is intricately connected with nature and the people here . "
The University of Portland 's strong contribution to the Peace Corps reflects the mission of the private Catholic university to teach faith and service , said spokesman Joe Kuffner .
All students are expected to participate in community service .
Other Oregon and Washington schools ranked among top producers of Peace Corps volunteers include Reed College in Portland and Willamette University in Salem , which each have 17 graduates serving in the Peace Corps .
That puts them 12th along with Dartmouth College in Hanover , N.H. , for producing volunteers .
Gonzaga University in Spokane , Wash. , ranked 7th with 19 graduates in the Peace Corps , and The Evergreen State College of Olympia , Wash , ranked 22 with 14 graduates serving overseas .
The University of Oregon , with 63 graduates now in the Peace Corps , ranked 11th among large colleges and universities .
The University of Washington was first with 101 graduates currently volunteering for the service .
Western Washington University has 38 graduates serving abroad , sixth highest among medium colleges and universities .
The Peace Corps has 7,671 volunteers in 76 countries .
Last year , the Peace Corps received a record 15,000 applications , an 18 percent increase over the previous year .

Description
Задача : распознать цифру на картинке .
Один из важных параметров модели в машинном обучении - это её размер .
От него косвенно зависит скорость работы модели и возможность использования её устройствах , не обладающих значительными вычислительными возможностями , например , планшетах , мобильных телефонах , IoT - девайсах .
Соревнование поможет новичкам разобраться в базовых принципах машинного обучения и выполнить задачу , максимально похожую на реальную .
Наличие GPU не обязательно .
Модель вполне можно обучить за разумное время на обычном компьютере , используя CPU .
Или же воспользоваться бесплатны м
Google Colaboratory , предоставляющим доступ к GPU и TPU для ускорения обучения .
Если с какими - то технологиями возникнут сложности или многое из написанного ниже будет совершенно непонятно , не пугайтесь .
Почти всё уже реализовано во фреймворках , нужно лишь правильно скомпоновать веб - сервер с ML - кодом .
Или же за основу взять готовое base - line решение и менять его на своё усмотрение .
Оно также вполне сгодится как шаблон для использования в собственных разработках .
Профессионалам , надеюсь , будет интересно побороться за минимальный размер сабмита и попробовать model compression , model quantization , model pruning , model distillation и много подобного на датасете , который позволяет быстро проводить много экспериментов .
Dataset
Датасет ( набор данных ) содержит монохромные картинки размера 28 на 28 пикселей с изображениями рукописных арабских цифр и называется MNIST .
Всего 70 000 изображений : 60 000 составляет выборка для обучения и 10 000 - тестовая выборка для проверки качества обученной модели .
Классы сбалансированы , т.е. каждая цифра встречается примерно одинаковое количество раз .
А сами изображения цифр выровнены по центру .
MNIST dataset description on Wikipedia .
Yann LeCun : " It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real - world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting . "
Датасет MNIST входит в состав большинства фреймворков для машинного обучения и легко доступен в них .
Например , в Keras : keras.datasets.mnist и PyTorch : torchvision.datasets .MNIST .
В менее удобной форме его можно скачать здесь : 1.zip .
Metric
Качество модели оценивается метрикой Accuracy .
При равных значениях accuracy предпочтение отдаётся сабмиту меньшего размера .
Accuracy расчитывается как отношение числа правильных предсказаний к общему количеству предсказаний .
Чем значени е
Accuracy больше , тем лучше .
Пример : из 20 цифр 17 предсказаны правильно , а 3 неправильно .
Accuracy = 17 / 20 = 0.85 .
Evaluation
Сабмит запускается на двух датасетах : всем доступном оригинальном MNIST -е и приватном датасете , полученном аугментацией MNIST -а.
Оценка качества модели ведётся по второму датасету .
Значения метрики доступны по обеим датасетам .
Сабмит - это zip - архив .
Он состоит из текстовых файлов , описывающих необходимый для установки софт , и делающих предсказания скриптов .
apt.txt описывает пакеты OS Ubuntu , которые будут установлены командой sudo apt install перед запуском кода сабмита .
Если в сабмите нет apt.txt , то никакие дополнительные пакет ы Ubuntu не устанавливаются .
Пример содержимого apt.txt :
ffmpeg graphviz
python.txt описывает модули языка Python 3 , которые будут установлены командой pip3 install перед запуском кода сабмита .
Если в сабмите нет python.txt , то никакие дополнительные модули Python -а не устанавливаются .
Пример содержимого python.txt :
sklearn scipy scikit - image tornado
run.sh - это shell - скрипт .
Он автоматически начнёт выполняться после установки софта .
В нём описывается , что ещё запустится для корректной работы сабмита .
Содержимое сабмита разархивируется в директорию ~/ submit/ , поэтому остальные скрипты , например , написанные на Python -е , запускаются из этой директории .
Также run.sh получает два параметра запуска : адрес и порт , на котором код сабмита будет принимать запросы .
Пример содержимого скрипта run.sh :
#!/bin/sh -x
/usr/bin/python3 ~/submit/predict.py -- model ~/submit/v1.h5 -- host $ 1 -- port $ 2
Код сабмита должен должен работать в виде микросервиса и принимать http - запросы на том адресе и порту , которые были переданы run.sh .
Ему отправляются монохромные изображения размером 28x28 в форматах jpeg или png .
Запросы и ответы делаются по протокол у
HTTP 1.1 .
Правильный ответ на правильный запрос содержит 200 - ый код .
При ошибке в запросе или в переданных данных правильным будет ответ с 400 - ым кодом .
В случае любых других ошибок правильным будет ответ с 500 - ым кодом .
Все выдаваемые сабмитом ответы имеют JSON - формат .
Важно иметь ввиду , что может быть отправлено несколько параллельных запросов .
Запросы делаются к трём url - ам : / status , / predict и / exit .
На GET - запросы с url - ом / status правильным будет ответ с содержимым { " status " : " Ok " } .
Смысл запросов к статусу в том , чтобы быстро убедиться , что сабмит запущен и отвечает на запросы .
В POST - запросах с url - ом / predict будут отправляться одно или несколько изображений с именем параметра x .
На них сабмит должен отвечать массивом чисел с предсказанными цифрами в поле y .
Пример ответа на запрос с пятью изображениями : { " y " : [ 1,2,3,4,5]} .
Пример ответа на запрос с одним изображением : { " y " : [ 8 ] } .
На GET - запросы с url - ом / exit корректным будет ответ с содержимым { " exit " : " Ok " } .
После отправки ответа сабмит должен тут же закончить свою работу с нулевым exit code , что скажет о нормальном завершении работы .
Это нужно для быстрой и корректной остановки сабмита .
Для проверки работоспособности написанного кода сабмита можно использовать curl .
Пример отправки запроса с двумя изображениями , находящихся в файла х 1.jpg и 2.png :
curl - v - F 'x=@1.jpg ' - F 'x=@2.png '
http://127.0.0.1:12345/predict

Yet for another time , I find myself switching distros .
I hope am not addicted or something :) .
If not for anything else , I am enjoying the ride !
This time is Chakra , and I must admit , am impressed !
I had heard abοut ArchLinux back from the early days that I started experimenting with GNU / Linux distributions .
It caught my attention for two main reasons :
The mentality of Keep It Simple Stupid ( KISS ) and lightweight .
It ’s a rolling distro , which means you do n’t need to upgrade every now and then to newer versions to keep up to date .
Just update your way into everything new out there .
To be honest , I had attempted installing ArchLinux on an old laptop back then , but I failed miserably in completing the task .
Same disappointing results on Virtualbox on my desktop PC .
Although Arch has extremely thorough documentation available , I was stuck somewhere between manually setting up the system files and installing and configuring a working desktop environment .
As an newbie I could n’t handle the pressure , so I gave up .
But not for long .
To my great pleasure , I recently stumbled upon the Chakra Project .
Chakra is as the title suggests , a brand new distribution which is based on Arch Linux and KDE 4 , but it comes extra with its own tweaked package set of KDE called KDEmod and some very handy tools .
I was extremely happy to see that it features a graphical installer , and the fact that it supports automatic hardware configuration made it irresistible .
I just had to download and see with my one eyes .
It was about time I get rid of that Windows XP dual boot with Ubuntu after all .
In my joy I forgot to mention that Chakra is currently only at Alpha 4 level , with the Beta release following soon .
It was normal to expect some bugs and troubleshoots .
The Pros :
ArchLinux : Arch just feels great and runs smoothly .
The two reasons I mentioned in the beginning of the post apply here .
Pacman : Arch ’s Package Manager is a solid application that delivers .
A simple yet feature - filled tool for managing your packages through the Konsole .
I am not a terminal fan boy but I easily found my way around to do things .
KDE 4.3 : In my humble opinion it ’s on the right track .
I was very frustrated with 4.1 and it was one of the reasons I had switched to Gnome .
It ’s clear now that with the upcoming KDE SC 4.4 , the K Desktop Environment will earn much of it ’s old prestige back .
In addition , it feels much lighter on resources now compared to where I left it .
Although this could very well be due to Arch and / or the various modifications of the Chakra Project team ( if it is , the difference is remarkable ) , it is possible that all that bug fixing and code shining from KDE developers produced results .
KDEmod : Tweaking KDE for Arch optimization .
“ ArchLinux is a small distribution and the developers are on more important missions to maintain and improve it , so KDEmod was born to provide a fully modular installation of KDE with nearly all the features and bling some bigger distributions provide with it – and partly even more bleeding - edge features ” .
My first impression of KDEmod is only positive , having in mind it ’s still a work in progress .
AUR : “ The ArchLinux User- community Repository is a community driven repository for Arch users .
It contains package descriptions that allow you to compile a package from source and then install it via Pacman . ”
Compiling made easy with the KISS way .
Support : I feel obligated to repeat here the extensive documentation on the ArchLinux site .
What ’s more , when a problem occurred with Partition Manager , I posted a request in the forums .
Not only I got a respond in the same day to my problem , but the package responsible for the solution was already in the repositories for me to upgrade to .
Problem ’s gone !
Great job by the community there !
l
The To Dos :
GRUB : Installing bootloader version 0.97 from the Chakra installer , wiped out all my other booting options .
Ubuntu was n’t discovered and I had to manually edit the GRUB menu.lst file to enable booting to it .
Furthermore , my partition table got a bit mixed up and I had to undergo a small process through fdisk to repair it .
Works still needs to be done here I assume , since automation is desired , users should n’t have to get into this kind of trouble .
Shaman :
It ’s “ a complete frontend to libalpm / pacman and ABS written in Qt4 ” .
I tried adding and removing software with it , attempted some updates and applied some settings .
Shaman is far from ready .
It kind of reminded me of Kpackagekit when it first made it into Kubuntu .
It crashed on various occasions .
I can read in the forums that this is to the knowledge of the developers at Chakra - Project and are currently working on improving it .
A package managing application needs above all to be stable and reliable .
In conclusion :
If you are a new GNU / Linux user , I would n’t for now advice using this Alpha 4 release by no means as your main operating system .
But if you know your way around and / or belong to the adventurous type , I believe Chakra worths taking it for a spin .
I quote again from the Chakra webpage :
“ If you are not the “ pragmatic one ” and do n’t want to learn and take full control over your computer but rather use a “ point and click ” system , you may go better by using one of the many other distributions for now , although they will not give you the clarity , power and simplicity of Arch Linux . ”
Keep up the very good work done here Chakra Team , I personally appreciate the effort put into this and I will most certainly be here for the 1st official release .
President Barack Obama has praised the bosses of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan as " very savvy " and insisted he does not " begrudge " them their success and wealth , in a significant softening of the White House 's attitude towards multimillion - dollar Wall Street bonuses .
Once a staunch critic of outsized pay packets , Obama adopted a strikingly consensual tone when asked this week about a $ 9 m ( £ 5.8 m ) bonus awarded to Goldman 's Lloyd Blankfein and a $ 17 m ( £ 11 m ) payday granted to JP Morgan 's Jamie Dimon .
" I know both those guys , they are very savvy businessmen , " Obama said in a interview with Bloomberg 's BusinessWeek magazine .
" I , like most of the American people , do n't begrudge people success or wealth .
That is part of the free - market system . "
Equating the banking bosses with top sports stars , Obama agreed that Dimon 's $ 17 m pay packet was " an extraordinary amount of money " in high - street terms , but added : " There are some baseball players who are making more than that and do n't get to the World Series either , so I 'm shocked by that as well . "
Speaking more broadly about Wall Street rewards , Obama said : " I do think that the compensation packages that we 've seen over the last decade at least have not matched up always to performance . "
But he praised the fact that Goldman and JP Morgan were using long - term share awards , rather than cash , to pay bonuses to their senior executives .
He said this " requires proven performance over a certain period of time as opposed to quarterly earnings " , adding that it was a " fairer way of measuring CEO success and ultimately will make the performance of American businesses better " .
Although the White House denied any changed in direction on the issue of bonuses , Obama 's comments were far less strident than his past condemnations of rewards on Wall Street .
Shortly after taking office last year , he described bonus payouts by banks as " the height of irresponsibility " and said it was " shameful " that banks were paying " lavish " compensation in the middle of an economic crisis .
Banks argue that they have gone to considerable lengths to adjust pay policies in response to political and public concern .
Blankfein's $ 9 m bonus was far lower than the $ 69 m he received before the financial crisis hit , in spite of record profits at Goldman this year .
But it was still criticised by the treasury 's so - called pay czar , Kenneth Feinberg , as excessive .
The Obama administration has been reluctant to follow Britain by imposing a special tax on Wall Street bonuses , although several backbench Democrats in Congress are pushing proposals that would levy a one - time tax of 50 % on payouts above a certain level .
agreed to pay out a total of $ 2.3 billion , considered a record settlement for a drug company .
The civil lawsuits and regulatory fines will be distributed throughout most of the country as a result of a years - long Department of Justice ( DOJ ) investigation .
But the New York Times considers this a sneeze for Pfizer , mentioning that " While the government said the fine was a record sum , the $ 2.3 billion fine amounts to less than three weeks of Pfizer 's sales . "
The DOJ was after Pfizer and its subsidiaries for illegal activities and " off label marketing " -- the marketing of drugs for uses other than what the FDA approved .
The illegally marketed drugs were the pain killers Lyrica and Bextra , the antipsychotic Geodon , and the antibiotic Zyvox .
Zyvox was actually marketed for illnesses on which it had no effect .
In addition to seminars for physicians to promote drugs outside of their approved use , kickbacks were offered to physicians for prescribing drugs outside of FDA sanctioned uses .
This is the fourth time Pfizer has agreed to a large settlement over fraudulent marketing since 2002 .
( Salon , source below )
Since 1999 , other drug makers such as Eli Lilly and Merck have also incurred huge settlements .
But this does n't seem to slow Big Pharma down .
They just raise prices and create demands for drugs and vaccines even if they harm more than heal .

( Natural News ) Donna Kendall was awarded a $ 6.3 million compensation with $ 28 million added for punitive damages in her suit against Pfizer this past November .
The jury in Philadelphia awarded the punitive penalty after determining that the hormone therapy drugs Premarin , Prempro and Provera caused her breast cancer due to reckless action or inaction by the pharmaceutical companies involved .
Premarin and Prempro were manufactured by Wyeth , which Pfizer purchased recently for $ 67 billion .
In 2003 , Pfizer purchased the manufacturer of Provera , Pharmacie & Upjohn .
With the help of these acquisitions , Pfizer has become the largest drug manufacturer in the world .
According to a Reuters report , Pfizer may have inherited hundreds of more pending cases with those three recently purchased companies .
Before the Kendall case , Wyeth was successfully sued for $ 79 million in total compensatory and punitive damages .
Pfizer seems to take these punches in stride .
Of course , they will oppose the decisions and appeal to higher courts .
But there was a court decision before these that Pfizer cannot oppose or appeal .
In early September 2009 , Pfizer
ICC World Twenty20 qualifier , Abu Dhabi :
USA 121 -4 ( 19.1 overs ) beat Scotland 120 - 7 ( 20 overs ) by six wickets
Match scorecard ( ICC official site ) Scotland made 120 - 7 against the USA in Abu Dhabi
Scotland suffered a blow to their hopes of qualifying for the ICC World Twenty20 when they were beaten by the USA in their opening qualifier .
The USA won by six wickets after reaching Scotland 's total of 120 - 7 with five balls remaining .
Scotland elected to bat first in Abu Dhabi and captain Gavin Hamilton was his side 's top scorer with 41 .
But Jamaican - born Carl Wright hit 62 , while Guyanese Lennox Cush added 41 to set up the USA 's surprise victory .
The Scots must now bounce back in matches against Afghanistan and Ireland if they are to be one of the two teams to qualify for the next stages from their pool .
Afghanistan , who beat the Irish by 13 runs on Tuesday , are next up for the Scots on Wednesday .
A disappointed Hamilton said : " I think credit should be given where it is due .
The USA bowled well with the new ball and our batting was n't up to the standard against them .
" Every game is now a must - win .
We 're going to have a look at the team and we may well have to do a bit of a reshuffle in the side for our game against Afghanistan . "
USA heroes Wright and Cush added 97 runs for the second wicket in 82 balls , with the former clubbing eight fours from 57 balls , while Cush struck three fours and a six from 39 balls .
" It was a collective effort and a great achievement , " said Wright .
" The bowlers made it much easier for us to go out and get the runs .
" I 'm excited about my man - of - the - match but we have to keep up with our positive attitude and move as a group for our game against Ireland . "

Lufthansa pilot : ' If we crash , the company goes down '
As Lufthansa pilots suspend their strike after the first of a planned four days , captain Joerg Handwerg explains why he and his colleagues took action .
Lufthansa pilot Joerg Handwerg says jobs are under threat
This whole conflict started when Lufthansa made their highest turnover ever in 2007 .
As their employees , of course we wanted a share in that huge profit .
In 2009 , Lufthansa started saying they were hit by the recession .
They said they needed to save 1bn euros per year .
But Lufthansa is one of the most profitable airlines in the world .
They are using the recession as an excuse to cut costs and cut our salaries .
The company recently bought Austrian Airlines .
They need money to turn that into a profit - making enterprise .
And they are taking that money from our salary .
Our salaries were automatically cut by 12 % last year .
That was built into our contracts .
We told Lufthansa that we were willing to talk about increasing our productivity for the same pay .
However , we wanted more job security .
We hold the lives of between 100 to 500 people in our hands on each flight
Our jobs are under threat from the Austrian , Swiss and British pilots .
Because their loss - making companies - Austrian Airlines , Swiss Air and British Midlands - were bought by Lufthansa , they will accept any conditions from Lufthansa to keep their jobs .
I do n't want to say how much I earn , because it will only turn into a jealousy debate .
But a Lufthansa co-pilot 's salary starts at 60,000 euros [ £ 52,000 ] , and I am now a captain .
We earn good money , but we also have a huge responsibility .
We hold the lives of between 100 to 500 people in our hands on each flight .
If we crash , the whole company goes down .
We do n't like going on strike .
The last time we went on strike was in 2001 .
But as Lufthansa is refusing to co-operate , we had no choice .

The Harlequin Ladybird ( Harmonia axyridis ) , otherwise known as the Multi-Coloured Ladybird or the Halloween Ladybird , was introduced to North America from Asia in 1988 , originally for their aphid - eating abilities .
It took several attempts to establish a colony there , so this was not accidental , but a deliberate , planned event by the United States Dept of Agriculture that was to have global implications .
This ladybird is now the most common variety found in the whole of the United States .
At a later date the harlequin was introduced to Holland , primarily for aphid control on crops , and from there it migrated across the English Channel and was first spotted in southern England in 2004 .
Since then it has spread both north and east , and is now reckoned to be the biggest ecological threat since the introduction of the grey squirrel , another creature without natural predators , which all but wiped out the red squirrel population
Bigger than any of the 34 indigenous species native to the the British shores , the Harlequin as it is known in Britain because of its varied colours , not only eats voraciously the same food destined for the British ladybirds , it also eats the smaller native ladybirds and their eggs , as well as the eggs and larvae of many other insects , some beneficial and others less so .
Scientists believe that up to 100 species are now at risk because of this incomer , dubbed the most invasive ladybird in the world .
It is also cannibalistic .
It will eat other harlequin ladybirds as well as their own eggs if they are hungry .
This happens when the aphid and native ladybird populations die down , as is natural at certain times of the year .
They are also attracted to anything sweet , like fruit , and have been responsible for ruining wine harvests by altering the taste of the grapes with their excretions .
Let ’s look at how JScreme compiles a few simple examples :
Scheme JavaScript 123 123 # \a " a " " abc " " abc " #t / #f true / false
Functions are also easy :
Scheme JavaScript ( lambda ( x ) x ) function ( x ) { return x ; } ( f x ) ( f ( x ) ) ( apply f x y z ) ( f.apply ( null , [ x , y].concat ( list_to_vector ( z ) ) ) )
The only rule here that merits explanation is the one for apply .
In case you ’re not familiar with Scheme ’s ( or most other Lisp ’s ) apply , here ’s an equivalence :
apply no apply ( apply f 1 2 ' ( 3 4 ) ) ( f 1 2 3 4 )
So , apply takes a function , some arguments , and a list of more arguments , and calls the function with those arguments .
The reason apply is needed is because it lets you call a function with a number of arguments that is not statically known .
The function list_to_vector above converts a Scheme list into a vector , i.e. a JavaScript array .
It ’s implemented in Scheme as well .
We ’ll get to the details later .
Obviously there must also be a way for a function to receive a variable number of arguments :
Scheme JavaScript ( lambda ( x . y ) y ) function ( x ) { var y = listify_vector ( arguments , 1 ) ; return y ; }
Here , the function listify_vector converts the arguments array , starting at index 1 , into a Scheme list .
At this point I should mention that I ’ve been lying a bit about names .
Due to JavaScript ’s scoping rules being slightly different than Scheme ’s we must make sure that different variables have different names in JavaScript , even though they ’re named the same in Scheme .
The easiest way to achieve that is to use a name generator to create a unique name for each variable .
In Lisps , it ’s usually called gensym .
So , this is what code actually looks like :
Scheme JavaScript ( lambda ( x ) x ) function ( __space_g8757_ ) {return __space_g8757_;}
Of course there ’s also if :
Scheme JavaScript ( if a b c ) ( a ? b : c )
For simplicity ’s sake JScreme also implements letrec in the compiler .
It creates a new function to make scoping easier and to be able to treat the whole thing as an expression :
The balloon boy ’s father , Richard Heene , has released new footage proving the stunt was n’t a hoax , or so he thinks .
He said the real reason why he lied was to save his wife from being deported and the fear of not being able to find a fair jury .

I find it curious that REST enthusiasts insist on viewing the world through the five verbs GET , HEAD , PUT , POST , and DELETE .
It reminds me of a story :
Back in the early ' 80s , I worked for DARPA .
During the height of the Cold War , we were really worried about being attacked by Russia .
My team was charged with designing a RESTful interface to a nuclear launch site ; as far as technology goes , we were way ahead of our time .
Anyway , I wanted the interface to be " PUT / bomb " .
However , my co-worker insisted that it should be " DELETE / russia " .
One of my other buddies suggested that we compromise on something more mainstream like " POST / russia / bomb " .
Finally , my boss put an end to the whole fiasco .
He argued that any strike against the USSR would necessarily be in retaliation to an attack from them .
Hence , he suggested that it be " GET / even " , so that 's what we went with .
You have to understand , back then , GETs with side effects were n't yet considered harmful .

Ancient map with China at centre goes on show in US
The huge map is being displayed at the Library of Congress in Washington A historic map of the world , with China at its centre , has gone on display at the Library of Congress in Washington .
The map was created by Italian missionary Matteo Ricci in 1602 .
It is one of only two copies in existence in good condition .
Because of its rarity and fragility - the map is printed on rice paper - the map has become known as the " Impossible Black Tulip of Cartography " .
This is the first time it has been on public show in north America .
Ricci created the map at the request of Emperor Wanli who wanted it to help scholars and explorers .
' Revered by Chinese '
The map was purchased by the James Ford Bell Trust in October for $ 1 m ( £ 0.62 m ) , making it the second - most expensive rare map ever sold .
It denotes different parts of the world with annotations and pictures .
The map had China at the centre of the world to underline its importance
In the Americas , for example , several places are named including Chih - Li ( Chile ) , Wa - ti - ma - la ( Guatemala ) and Ka-na - ta ( Canada ) , and Florida is described as " the Land of the Flowers " .
Ford W Bell , a trustee for the James Ford Bell Trust , told the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review newspaper , that the map was " one of the two best in terms of quality , as far as we know " .
" Ricci was a very smart missionary .
He put China right at the centre of this new universe , this new globe , to underscore its importance , " he said .
" Ricci , of course , was the first Westerner to enter Beijing .
He was revered by the Chinese , and he was buried there . "
The first secretary for cultural affairs at the Chinese embassy in the US , Ti Ban Zhang , said in a statement that the map represents " the momentous first meeting of East and West " .

I ’m sure most of us heard of these memorable saying that goes like " A good sketch is better than a long speech " or " A picture is worth a thousand words " .
Sometimes , even the most complicated issue and matter can be simplified and expressed over a single image .
That ’s just how incredible images are ; but today I want to show you something different , a hybrid of both .
Here ’s a showcase of a very unique approach to portrait illustrations .
These images below are mixtures of both images and typography , where the latter is used to shape the portraits while the words within have messages to deliver .
It is just amazing how manipulation of font types , sizes and keywords can form a great portrait artwork with inner meaning .

BANGALORE , India — Indians have a thing for statues .
We are also obsessive about giant - sized cutouts and massive digital posters of our favorite movie stars and politicians .
Such larger - than - life street art is part of the urban visual scenery and skyline in many Indian cities .
Now one Indian is trying to take his fanatical hero - worship to gargantuan levels .
R. Chandrasekaran , a granite monument exporter who runs RC Golden Granites in the eastern Indian city of Chennai , has commissioned and completed a mammoth statue of pop king Michael Jackson .
The 12 - foot , 3.5 - ton sculpture of the legendary singer in an iconic pose is carved out of a single block of fragile black granite .
Sekar , as he calls himself , now wants to dispatch the statue that costs millions of rupees to build to Neverland Ranch , the late singer ’s home in Santa Barbara , Calif .
A mammoth statue of Michael Jackson .
( GlobalPost )
Chandrasekaran is a relatively recent convert to the Michael Jackson fan club , having imbibed the pop star ’s music and dance moves through his young son .
His son has since moved on to become a fan of other musicians but Chandrasekaran is a diehard .
Jackson ’s sudden death left the business owner thoroughly depressed .
He came up with the idea of carving a singular granite monument to show his own devotion and also show off Indian sculptors ’ skills .
It took six of his best sculptors several weeks to carve out the statue .
The monolith opened to rave reviews in a viewing in Bangalore .
The late Michael Jackson has his share of fanatical followers in India .
At the sculpture ’s showing in Bangalore , fans lined up to view and touch the glistening statue .
The expressive face and the eyes are a testimony to Indian sculptors ' handiwork , says Chandrasekaran .
Statues have long been a controversial subject in India .
From time to time , courts and government authorities have stepped in to stub out controversies surrounding these monuments .
A year ago , a 62 - foot statue of Hollywood ’s and the world ’s greatest comic cinema star Charlie Chaplin was caught in the eye of a storm .
The statue was built as part of a movie set and then donated for installation on a beach near Mangalore , on the west coast of India .

( GlobalPost )
But a local Hindu group protested that the statue of an outsider had no place on the beach and that it was too close to a temple .
That forced the hand of the filmmaker .
He hurriedly scouted an alternative location and finally found a home for Chaplin in a Bangalore theme park .
In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh , meanwhile , its chief minister Mayawati has recently initiated a move to set up a special security force to protect hundreds of statues of herself and those of her political mentors .
She has modeled herself as a political champion of the so - called untouchable Dalit caste that she herself belongs to .
Mayawati ’s attempts at self - glorification have already cost the public more than $ 1 billion , not to mention the cost of raising a security force to guard these statues from being vandalized or destroyed .
None of these storms have deterred Chandrasekaran .
The Jackson devotee wrote to the late singer ’s family in early February saying the statue is a token of admiration .
Chandrasekaran says he will freight the statue to Neverland Ranch at his own expense .
He says , “ This statue is dedicated on behalf of all Jackson fans in India . ”

Hugo Chávez , as he drafts in ever more Cuban aides to shore up his regime , is fulfilling a longstanding dream of Fidel Castro’s
AP
IN A small fishing village on the Caribbean coast of Venezuela stands a plinth .
Unveiled by government officials in 2006 , it pays homage to the Cuban guerrillas sent by Fidel Castro in the 1960s to help subvert Venezuela 's then recently restored democracy .
Almost entirely bereft of popular support , the guerrilla campaign flopped .
But four decades later , and after a decade of rule by Hugo Chávez , Cuba 's communist regime seems finally to have achieved its goal of invading oil - rich Venezuela — this time without firing a shot .
Earlier this month Ramiro Valdés , a veteran revolutionary who ranks number three in Cuba 's ruling hierarchy and was twice its interior minister , arrived in Caracas , apparently for a long stay .
Officially , Mr Valdés has come to head a commission set up by Mr Chávez to resolve Venezuela 's acute electricity shortage .
But he lacks expertise in this field , and Cuba is famous for 12 - hour blackouts .
Some members of Venezuela 's opposition reckon that Mr Valdés , whose responsibilities at home include policing Cubans ' access to the internet , has come to help Mr Chávez step up repression ahead of a legislative election in September .
Others believe he was sent to assess the gravity of the situation facing the Castro brothers ' most important ally ( Cuba depends on Mr Chávez for subsidised oil ) .
He has been seen in meetings with Venezuelan military commanders .
Although by far the most senior , Mr Valdés is only one among many Cubans who have been deployed by Mr Chávez under bilateral agreements that took shape in 2003 .
As well as thousands of doctors staffing a community - health programme , they include people who are helping to run Venezuela 's ports , telecommunications , police training , the issuing of identity documents and the business registry .
In 2005 Venezuela 's government gave Cuba a contract to modernise its identity - card system .
Since then , Cuban officials have been spotted in agencies such as immigration and passport control .
A group of Cubans who recently fled Venezuela told a newspaper in Miami that they had bribed a Cuban official working in passport control at Caracas airport .
In some ministries , such as health and agriculture , Cuban advisers appear to wield more power than Venezuelan officials .
The health ministry is often unable to provide statistics — on primary health - care or epidemiology for instance — because the information is sent back to Havana instead .
Mr Chávez seemed to acknowledge this last year when , by his own account , he learned that thousands of primary health - care posts had been shut down only when Mr Castro told him so .
Coffee - growers complain that in meetings with the government it is Bárbara Castillo , a former Cuban trade minister , who calls the shots .
Ms Castillo , who was formally seconded to Venezuela four years ago , refuses requests for interviews .
Trade unions , particularly in the oil and construction industries , have complained of ill - treatment by the Cubans .
No unions are allowed on Cuban - run building sites .
In September last year Froilán Barrios of the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers , which opposes the government , said that “ oil and petrochemicals are completely penetrated by Cuban G2 , ” the Castros ' fearsomely efficient intelligence service .
Oil workers planning a strike said they had been threatened by Cuban officials .
The new national police force and the army have both adopted policies inspired by Cuba .
The chief adviser to the national police - training academy is a Cuban , and Venezuela 's defence doctrine is based on Cuba 's “ war of all the people ” .
Foreign officials who watch Venezuela closely say that Cuban agents occupy key posts in Venezuela 's military intelligence agency , but these claims are impossible to verify .
Mr Chávez portrays Cuban help as socialist solidarity in the struggle against “ the empire ” , as he calls the United States .
When he was visiting Cuba in 2005 Fidel Castro said publicly to him that their two countries were “ a single nation ” .
“ With one flag , ” added Mr Chávez , to which Mr Castro replied , “ We are Venecubans . ”
These views are not shared by Venezuelans .
In a recent poll 85 % of respondents said they did not want their country to become like Cuba .
Perhaps Mr Valdés will include that in his assessment .
U.S. President Barack Obama is essentially grounding efforts to return astronauts to the moon and instead is sending NASA in new directions with roughly $ 6 billion US more , according to officials familiar with the plans .
A White House official confirmed Thursday that when next week 's budget is proposed , NASA will get an additional $ 5.9 billion over five years , as first reported in Florida newspapers .
Some of that money would extend the life of the International Space Station to 2020 .
It also would be used to entice companies to build private spacecraft to ferry astronauts to the space station after the space shuttle retires , said the official who was not authorized to speak by name .
The money in the president 's budget is not enough to follow through with NASA 's Constellation moon landing plan initiated by President George W. Bush .
An aide to an elected official who was told of Obama 's plans , but who asked that his name not be used because of the sensitivity of the discussions , said Obama is effectively ending the return - to - the - moon effort , something that has already cost $ 9.1 billion .
It all comes down to money .
The six - year - old Bush plan , which a former NASA chief called " Apollo on steroids , " sputtered when promised budget increases did n't materialize .
And now money is a big consideration in NASA 's latest shift in focus .
A new direction for NASA has been on hold for several months while an independent commission studied options and the White House weighed them .
Obama 's choice will be made clear Monday , when he releases his 2011 budget proposal .
" It certainly appears that the Bush moon mission [ is ] not going to be included " in future funding , said a senior NASA official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the plans .
' Moon by 2020 is dead '
Space policy scholar John Logsdon , who was on an Obama space campaign advisory committee and has served on NASA advisory panels , said Obama is adopting the preferred option of a White House - appointed outside panel of experts last year .
That concept includes reliance on a commercial spaceship , a space station that functions for five more years than planned , and a " flexible path " for human space exploration .
That might mean trips to a nearby asteroid , a Martian moon or a brief visit to the moon , instead of the Bush plan for a moon base by the end of the decade .
" What kills the moon mission is the decision to extend the space station to 2020 , " Logsdon said .
That means the Bush goal of " moon by 2020 is dead .
We can't afford using the station for five more years and going to the moon . "
While the Constellation program " is dead , exploration is not dead and that 's really important , " Logsdon said .
Already proponents of the moon mission and thousands of workers in space centers in Florida , Alabama and Texas are upset .
Congressional officials in those states have denounced such ideas and some of them sit on key committees where they could fight Obama 's plans .
For example , Senator Bill Nelson of Florida chairs the space subcommittee in the Senate .
And the chairwoman of the House space subcommittee , Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona is married to a space shuttle astronaut .
The budget numbers were first reported this week by the Orlando Sentinel and Florida Today .
If Obama does cancel the Constellation program , it would leave " NASA and the nation with no program , no plan and no commitment to any human spaceflight program beyond that of today , " said former NASA administrator Michael Griffin in a statement .
He said this would be recommending " that the nation abandon its leadership on the space frontier , " Griffin said .
Kosmas and others raised questions about the safety of switching to a privately run space travel system that NASA would pay to carry astronauts .
Companies pursuing such business include Space Exploration Technology Corp. which is already building a new rocket , called Falcon , and capsule , called Dragon .
The company is run by PayPal founder Elon Musk .
And a recent report by NASA 's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel warned NASA not pursue unproven technology and abandon the Ares I rocket — the first rocket in the Bush moon program and one resembling the Apollo design .
Program underfunded
The report called such a path " unwise and probably not cost - effective . "
But the Obama administration official said the Bush program was so underfunded that it would n't get astronauts to the moon until 2028 or 2030 .
The Bush moon plan was announced after the 2003 Columbia accident that killed seven astronauts .
After that disaster in which the shuttle broke apart as it returned to Earth , a special investigative panel said NASA needed a new goal .
In January 2004 , Bush proposed the return to the moon .
It would have involved the Ares I rocket , carrying astronauts in a capsule called Orion .
Another Ares spacecraft would carry heavier cargo .
So far , NASA has spent $ 3.5 billion on Ares I and $ 3.7 billion on Orion , and nearly $ 2 billion on other moon mission work .
In the mid-1990s , NASA went through a similar stutter - step that meant abandoning plans that cost billions .
That involved President Ronald Reagan 's Freedom space station , which ran into trouble after costing $ 11 billion without building any hardware .
President Bill Clinton had the space station redesigned and restarted .
Wholegrain bread is good and good for you , as most people know .
But it is not only the fiber - rich bran , the outer shell of the grain , that is healthful .
On the contrary , research at the Lund University Faculty of Engineering shows that bread baked with white rye flour , which is flour made from the inner , white part of the rye kernel , leads to better insulin and blood sugar levels compared with wheat bread with rye bran .
White rye flour thus leads to much better values than both regular wheat flour and rye bran .
At the same time , much of the bread that is sold in stores today in most countries is in fact baked with wheat flour and bran from various grains .
The great difference between white rye and white wheat surprises the researchers .
" Precisely what it is that makes rye lead to a stable blood sugar curve is as yet unknown .
But we are getting closer and closer to an answer .
There are several different types of rye , and all not all types have the same effect , which means that some of them can be omitted from future studies .
The rye flour that is sold in stores is often a mixture of different types , " says Liza Rosén , a doctoral candidate in Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry at the Lund University Faculty of Engineering , who has led the study .
The research is part of the EU project " Healthgrain , " in which researchers study how wholemeal products can be used to prevent diseases including type 2 diabetes and heart and vascular diseases .
According to Liza Rosén , if you want to optimize the health benefits , you should eat porridge or bread made from whole grain , where all the parts of the grain are included .
" This gives you all the benefits of rye .
The bran includes many healthful fibers , vitamins , minerals , and antioxidants .
This also helps give a feeling of satiety and helps lower blood sugar responses over the long term .
On the other hand , we did not see such good results regarding blood sugar and insulin directly after the meal , " she says .
In meal tests the researchers also found that individuals who ate boiled rye kernels for breakfast were fuller and ate significantly less for lunch , more precisely 16 percent less in energy intake , compared with those who ate bread made from white flour .
They also found that both bread and hot cereal made with white rye and wholegrain rye are more filling than white wheat bread .
The most effective form was rye porridges .

" It is probably the water in the porridge that increases the feeling of satiety .
But the water has to be mixed into the product .
If you drink the same amount of water with rye bread , the results are not as good , " she explains .
The original objective of Liza Rosén 's research was to try to determine the reasons that wholegrain products are so beneficial , in that they have been shown to protect against cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer .
There is also strong evidence that whole grains can prevent type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance .
" Since rye has been shown to yield low insulin responses , I started with that .
A high insulin response can lead to insulin resistance in the body , that is , that the body has a hard time responding to insulin .
Insulin resistance can result in high blood sugar , high blood pressure , and bad blood fats , which in turn increase the risk of age - related diabetes and cardiovascular diseases .
Since I have found so much of interest , I have n't had yet time to look into barley , for instance , but perhaps in the future .
On the other hand , several other researchers at Lund University have studied barley and its health benefits , " says Liza Rosén .
Liza Rosén has not carried out any studies of how rye affects humans over the long term , but her colleague Ulrika Andersson did such a study on mice .
For a half year a number of mice were fed wholegrain wheat or wholegrain rye , respectively .
The results show that the mice that ate wheat gained significantly more weight than the mice on a rye diet .
" A possible explanation would be that wheat prompts a higher insulin response than rye , which means that the cells in the body can store more fat .
The fact that rye contains more soluble fibers than wheat also plays a role , since they probably prevent the uptake of fat and other nutritional substances in the intestine . "
There are only a few studies of how wholegrain forms of various cereal grains affect our health , so there is a great need for more detailed studies of the issue .
Enhanced knowledge in this field creates a base for the development of a new generation of custom - designed wholegrain products that can counteract different types of diseases associated with our prosperity .

How the tests were done :
Study 1 :
Twelve subjects ate breakfasts consisting of white wheat bread , porridge from wheat flour , white rye bread , wholegrain rye bread , wholegrain rye bread with lactic acid , hot cereal porridge from wholegrain rye , and wheat bread with rye bran , all in rotation .
The researchers monitored blood sugar , insulin , and satiety over the following three hours .
The results for the various products were then compared with each other for each individual subject ( that is , subject 1's response to wholegrain bread was compared with subject 1's response to wheat bread and subject 2's response with subject 2's responses , etc. ) .
Since the researchers found that the products that led to low insulin release provided greater satiety after three hours , they designed a second study to address the question :
Can rye products that lead to low insulin response provide greater satiety and reduce the food intake in the following meal ?
Study 2 :
Ten subjects ate breakfasts consisting of white wheat bread , boiled wholegrain rye kernels ( the whole grain ) , boiled whole wheat kernels , white rye bread , white rye bread baked with acid ( corresponding to sourdough bread ) , wholegrain rye bread , and wholegrain rye bread baked with acid .
The researchers monitored blood sugar , insulin , and satiety over the following 4.5 hours .
For lunch , the subjects were allowed to eat as many meatballs and pasta as they wanted , until they felt full .
Then the results were compared for the various products with each other and for each individual subject .
In an ongoing third study , the researchers are investigating different kinds of rye .
Posada Carriles Tells the El Paso Court “ I lied because the CIA taught me how . ” – Español
By José Pertierra
Translation : Machetera – Tlaxcala
In a motion presented yesterday before the federal court in El Paso , where he is being tried for perjury rather than murder , Luis Posada Carriles offers the curious defense that due to his many years of work with the CIA , his statements when interrogated by U.S. immigration officials shortly after illegally entering the United States in March of 2005 were “ the result of confusion , mistake ” and “ faulty memory . ”
Posada alleges that throughout his employment with the CIA , he used various false identities and passports to facilitate his undercover work against Cuba , Venezuela and other Latin American countries .
So many lies have led him to be confused now , according to the 14 page legal argument his legal team has presented to Judge Kathleen Cardone .
The prosecutors wish to exclude all the evidence regarding Posada Carriles and the CIA from this trial , arguing that it is irrelevant as well as confidential .
Washington knows that Posada has plenty to tell and it is trying to limit his testimony and the evidence to the greatest extent possible so as not to expose the crimes committed by Posada Carriles throughout his decades of work for the CIA .
There are declassified CIA cables in existence , for example , as well as confessions from the material authors of the crime , which establish that Posada was the intellectual author behind the explosion of a Cubana airlines civilian airplane on October 6 , 1976 , where 73 passengers were killed .
Venezuela presented a request for his extradition in June of 2005 , and this remains pending , without the White House attending to it .
Posada confessed to the New York Times in 1998 that he had orchestrated a terrorist campaign against hotels and restaurants in Havana which caused the cold - blooded death of Fabio Di Celmo in the Hotel Copacabana , as well as wounding many others .
In previous documents , Posada alleged that everything he did in Latin America , he did “ in Washington ’s name . ”
He wants the jury , which is to decide whether he is guilty of perjury , to hear all the evidence on March 1st and be made aware of his close relationship with the CIA .
He also knows that the more he threatens to reveal about his relations with the CIA , the more those who conceal the skeletons in Washington ’s closet begin to tremble .
In order to convince Judge Cardone that his relationship with the CIA is relevant to the trial in which he is being accused of being a liar , Posada Carriles ’ defense is that it was the CIA who taught him how to lie .
Hmmmm .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
In a result that may have implications for financial regulation , researchers from computer science and economics have revealed potentially impenetrable problems with the pricing of financial derivatives .
They show that sellers of these investments could purposefully include pieces of bad risk that no buyer could detect even with the most powerful computers .
The research focused on collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs , an investment tool that combines many mortgages with the promise of spreading out and lowering the risk of default .
The team examined what would happen if a seller knew that some mortgages were " lemons " and structured a package of CDOs to benefit himself .
They found that the manipulation may be impossible for buyers to detect either at time of sale or later when the derivative loses money .
The team consists of Sanjeev Arora , director of Princeton 's Center for Computational Intractability , his colleague Boaz Barak , economics professor Markus Brunnermeier , and computer science graduate student Rong Ge .
It is now standard wisdom that a major culprit in the 2008 financial meltdown was use of simplistic mathematical models of risk at financial firms .
This paper , released as a working draft Oct. 15 , suggests that the problems may go deeper .
" We are cautioning that even if you have the right model it's not easy to price derivatives , " Arora said .
" Making the models more complicated will not make these effects go away , even for computationally sophisticated . "
Arora noted that the problem arises from asymmetric information between buyers and sellers , and goes against conventional wisdom in economic theory , which holds that derivatives reduce the negative effects of such unequal information .
" Standard economics emphasizes that securitization can mitigate the cost of asymmetric information , " Brunnermeier said .
" We stress that certain derivative securities introduce additional complexity and thus a new layer of asymmetric information that can be so severe it overturns the initial advantage . "
Brunnermeier noted that the finding came from combining computer science and finance , which has not been done before but has the potential for further insights .
“ I anticipate that both fields can enrich each other , ” he said .
As a converted geek I ’m always keen on keeping my digital tools updated .
You know the drill : backups and upgrades , cleaning up unneeded files and keep it slim .
I ’m almost always up to date and thoroughly enjoy it .
Oh , the secret bliss of running the latest version of my operating system !
The subtle satisfaction of watching how smoothly my laptop makes its apps literally flying over the carefully chosen desktop background image !
Alas , that ’s not always the case with my real self .
Unfortunately , my mental operating system is moreÂ than often obsolete .
I sometimes feel like I lack some crucial features or do n’t know how to handle specific events .
In some specific cases , this unstable behavior goes for years .
I run into the same patterns , like hitting the same keyboard combination , and always get the same result : a frozen screen , for instance .
Or , if it ’s a major crisis , even a “ blue screen of death ” , followed by a brutal reboot .
I ’m sure you ’ve been there too .
We all did .
This happens because we ’re not updated to our latest version of ourselves .
We did n’t upgrade .
We ’re still running an old and clumsy command line interface , we ca n’t address more physical memory to incorporate new experiences and we really do n’t know how to handle new devices in our life , because we ’re missing some important drivers .
Joke aside , our behavior as human beings can be comfortably described as an operating system metaphor .
Introducing the converted geek 5 steps guide to upgrade to your best version of yourself :
1. Balance Your Core Features
Any operating system has a set of core features .
Any human being has a unique set of qualities .
Be sure to keep a close balance between all parts .
An equilibrium in motion .
Too much of something will make the rest seem unfit .
An imbalanced structure of qualities will make your mental operating system crash without warning on the weak spots .
For example , some operating systems are better at networking , but they really suck at graphics .
Some other are good at office productivity but they lack a proper driver integration and so on .
What makes your presence so valuable is not personal excellence on a single topic , but rather a stable load under high pressure .
A well balanced mix of qualities .
2. Defrag Your Mind
We have a virtually unlimited capacity of information storage .
What makes us feel like we do n’t is the narrow channel used to access it .
Our conscious mind can process only 5 - 7 stimuli form the environment , but the unconscious mind is capable of much more .
It ’s like a having huge , actually infinite , hard - drive but a very slow access protocol to it .
Until we will be able to broaden this channel , we can try to improve some other parts .
We can take care of our mental clutter by defragmenting it every now and then .
GTD addicted will call this mental defragmentation “ emptying the mind ” while other people may simply call it meditation .
While even others call it : “ keep my things in good order ” .
Read more about how to defrag your mind in 5 easy steps .
3. Update Your Drivers
Every now and then we attach some new piece of hardware to our computers .
Like a printer or a nice camera .
But this new equipment will not function unless there is a driver , a way to communicate with the computer operating system .
This is exactly what happens when we incorporate something new in our lives : from a new car to a new relationship or job .
Unless we will strive to update our drivers to really understand how to talk with those new entities , we will not function properly .
We may look like we have a printer ( or a wife , or a luxury car ) attached , but it will not really work until we build a new communication protocol to it .
We ca n’t expect to have something new in our lives without changing ourselves to fully integrate it .
Read more about how to manage and upgrade your life device drivers .
4. Stay Virus Free
If you expose your operating system to untrusted sources , you may experience a very bad situation called “ virus ” .
These things are basically independent entities which are taking control over your system and make it their own toy .
For fun or for profit .
The same thing can happen to your mind .
More often than you think , your mind is actually controlled by somebody else .
Staying virus free is much more difficult for your mental operating system than for your computer operating system .
Especially the cleaning action is quite tedious .
Sometimes , your mind will remain partially infected for ever .
So , the best way to avoid a mental virus infection is prevention : trust your own mind , make your own judgment and take everything with a little bit of salt .
Read more about how to keep your mind virus free .
5. Enjoy An Unexpected Shutdown Every Now And Then
No operating system is perfect .
There are ( and there will always be ) minor memory leaks , open loops and untested functions which will , in time , make your computer unstable .
This is why is recommended to push the shutdown button every now and then , the same way you take an unexpected 15 minutes nap with the head on the desktop , when your boss is known to be in his lunch break .
At a higher level , this translates in a more relaxed way to look at the world .
Keeping yourself too focused can sometimes do more harm and good .
Too much tension will eventually break something around you , if not you .
Cease to believe you are in control and give your powers away every once in a while .
Trust that everything will be good in the end .
If it ’s not ok , then it is not the end .
The Undocumented Feature
Every geek knows that all operating systems have some deeply hidden treasures , also known as undocumented features .
Sometimes those features are just simple Easter Eggs , plain and useless pieces of information , only hidden .
But sometimes , those undocumented features are really valuable tools , precious improvements which are giving you more time and computing power .
InÂ your mental operation system , those undocumented features are in fact your personal power .
Your hidden , undercover potential waiting to be unleashed .
Those features are secret weapons you can use to do things nobody think you can do .
It ’s your identity .
Your uniqueness , your singularity , your own personal gift to the world .
Nobody really knows what your undocumented feature is , except you .
You are the carrier of this fantastic energy , of this unique feature which made you so necessary and needed that the world could n’t properly function without you .
That ’s right , you ’re here for a reason .
The world called for you and you have to deliver .
You really have to .
So , you ’d better pull yourself together and , for starters , go find a mirror and ask this to yourself : am I really running the best version of myself ?
Really , really ?

Two Maricopa County executives said Thursday they will appear before a federal grand jury next week to testify about allegations that Sheriff Joe Arpaio and others in his office have abused their power .
County Manager David Smith and Deputy County Manager Sandi Wilson said they met with representatives from the U.S. Attorney 's Office on Wednesday to prepare for the grand jury .
Arpaio denied knowledge of the grand jury .
" I 'm not commenting about the grand jury or what 's occurring , " he said .
" If people are saying it , let them say it .
We 're going to continue doing our job . "
Federal grand juries composed of local residents meet in secret to hear testimony to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to hold a trial .
Witnesses , however , are not prohibited from talking about the grand jury , which uses subpoenas to gather evidence .
If the grand jury hands up an indictment , a trial would determine guilt or innocence .
Smith and Wilson are scheduled to appear at the federal courthouse in downtown Phoenix at 8:45 a.m. Wednesday .
They were told that their testimony may take several hours over several days .
" We were told that we are now federal witnesses , and we will be protected , " Wilson said .
Based on their discussions with the U.S. Attorney 's Office , Smith said the grand jury appears to be focusing on a variety of issues .
Among them are budget negotiations , the county 's courthouse project , deputies questioning county employees at their homes , threats of investigations of county employees , and a fight over a criminal - justice computer system .
" I 'm certainly gratified that the system is starting to work , where this kind of abuse of power is looked into by a competent authority , " Smith said .
" A lot of people have suffered ; now I think that from the U.S. attorney , with respect to Sheriff Arpaio , justice will be served . "
The Justice Department announced last year it was also conducting a civil investigation into allegations of racial profiling against the Sheriff 's Office .
Representatives from the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Phoenix , the Department of Justice in Washington , D.C. , and the FBI office in Phoenix would not comment on the grand jury .
Since at least May , county employees have regularly met with FBI officials about Arpaio and allegations of misuse of power , according to Republic sources interviewed by federal agents .
However , sources said Thursday it 's unclear if the grand jury is a result of those conversations .
Over the past year , county leaders have fought over money and authority .
The fights originated among top officials at the county , the Sheriff 's Office and the County Attorney 's Office but have recently enveloped midlevel employees in other departments .
The conflict has created a breakdown between agencies , unnerved staff and cost taxpayers more than $ 2.9 million in legal fees and an untold amount of staff time .
Wilson , who oversees the county 's budget , traces the breakdown to last year 's budget negotiations with Sheriff 's Chief Deputy David Hendershott .
Those negotiations , along with everyday administrative functions , were criminalized by the Sheriff 's Office , she said .
Smith said he spoke with the U.S. Attorney 's Office about these issues :
� Budget negotiations .
In summer 2008 , the Board of Supervisors directed agencies to make massive budget cuts in the face of an economic freefall .
Hendershott accused Smith of threatening him , trying to intimidate him and attempting to thwart criminal investigations .
Smith denied the allegations .
The Sheriff 's Office eventually took a budget cut .
� Court tower .
When budget cuts were ordered in late 2008 , Arpaio began to publicly point to the county 's $ 360 million criminal - court tower under construction in downtown Phoenix as a waste of tax dollars .
Detectives later launched an investigation into the project .
No charges emerged , but the allegations against county elected officials , administrators , attorneys and judges appeared in a broad civil racketeering complaint filed in U.S. District court in December 2009 .
� Wiretap sweeps .
In December 2008 and March , county officials hired a company to sweep the county - administration offices for listening devices .
Hendershott told The Republic that he would investigate the legality of the sweeps .
� Information requests .
In June , the Sheriff 's Office asked for calendars , e-mails , and office and cellphone logs for 36 county employees .
A sheriff 's spokeswoman said the request was " for a criminal investigation . "
Throughout the year , deputies questioned many county employees in their homes .
� Computer system .
In August , the Sheriff 's Office took control of the Integrated Criminal Justice Information System from county employees after the office filed a lawsuit to try to get control of the computer system .
The system links the county 's criminal - justice agencies to state and national databases .
The sheriff 's investigations of Supervisors Don Stapley and Mary Rose Wilcox , who were indicted by a Maricopa County grand jury last month , were not identified as part of the federal grand - jury inquiry .
Arpaio and Hendershott have contended all along that their investigations into county operations are to thwart attempts by county officials to micromanage the Sheriff 's Office .
The other health - care reform option
My preference is that House Democrats pass the Senate bill and then run their fixes through the reconciliation process .
But I think there is an argument that the current health - care bill has been terribly compromised by the months of controversy , the shady deal with Ben Nelson , the ambivalence of key legislators , the endless meetings with industry players , the wasted time , and the collective freak - out of congressional Democrats in the aftermath of Scott Brown 's election .
There is another option .
Democrats could scrap the legislation and start over in the reconciliation process .
But not to re-create the whole bill .
If you go that route , you admit the whole thing seemed too opaque and complex and compromised .
You also admit the limitations of the reconciliation process .
So you make it real simple : Medicare buy - in between 50 and 65 .
Medicaid expands up to 200 percent of poverty with the federal government funding the whole of the expansion .
Revenue comes from a surtax on the wealthy .
And that 's it .
No cost controls .
No delivery - system reforms .
Nothing that makes the bill long or complex or unfamiliar .
Medicare buy - in had more than 51 votes as recently as a month ago .
The Medicaid change is simply a larger version of what 's already passed both chambers .
This bill would be shorter than a Danielle Steel novel .
It could take effect before the 2012 election .
If health - care reform that preserves the private market is too complex and requires too many dirty deals with the existing industries , then cut both out .
But get it done .
Democrats have a couple of different options for passing health - care reform this year .
But not passing health - care reform should not be seen as one of them .
The Hajj is the Pilgrimage to Mecca in Islam .
It is the fifth of the Five Pillars in Sunni Islam and one of the ten Branches of Religion in Shi'a Islam .
Every able - bodied Muslim who can afford to do so is obliged to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime .
The government of Saudi Arabia issues special visas to foreigners for the purpose of the pilgrimage , which takes place during the Islamic month of Dhu al - Hijjah .
Entrance to the city itself is forbidden to non-Muslims , and the entire city is considered a holy site to Islam .
Now ... let 's see a lot of people at Mecca .
