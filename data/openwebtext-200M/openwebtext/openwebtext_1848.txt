CLinq - LINQ support for the C++/CLI language
Introduction
The LINQ project which will be part of the next version of Visual Studio ( codename " Orcas " ) is set of extensions that make it possible to query data sources directly from the C# or VB.NET languages .
LINQ extends .NET
Framework with classes to represent queries and both C# and VB.NET language with features that make it possible to write these queries easily .
It also includes libraries for using queries with the most common types of data sources like SQL database , DataSets and XML files .
This article requires some basic knowledge of LINQ and C# 3.0 , so I recommend looking at the LINQ Overview available from the official project web site before reading the article .
LINQ includes extensions for the C# and VB.NET , but there are no plans for supporting LINQ in C++/CLI .
The goal of CLinq project is to allow using part of LINQ functionality from C++/CLI .
Thanks to very powerful operator overloading mechanism in C++/CLI it is possible to enable using LINQ to SQL for accessing SQL databases in C++/CLI as well as some other LINQ uses .
I will first demonstrate how the same database query looks in C# 3.0 and C++/CLI and then we will look at CLinq in more detail .
The following query ( written in C# 3.0 ) returns uses the Northwind database and returns name of contact and company for all customers living in London :
// create connection to database NorthwindData db = new NorthwindData ( " .. connection string .. " ) ; // declare database query var q = from cvar in db .
Customers where cvar .
City == " London " select cvar.ContactName + " , " + cvar .
CompanyName ; // execute query and output results foreach ( string s in q ) Console .
WriteLine(s ) ;
Now , let 's look at the same query written in C++/CLI using CLinq .
It is a bit more complex , but this is the price for implementing it as a library instead of modifying the language :
// create connection to database NorthwindData db ( " .. connection string .. " ) ; // declare database query Expr< Customers^ > cvar = Var< Customers^ > ( " c " ) ; CQuery < String ^>^ q = db.
QCustomers ->
Where ( clq : : fun ( cvar , cvar .
City == " London " ) ) -> Select( clq:: fun( cvar , cvar.ContactName + Expr < String^ >( " , " ) + cvar.CompanyName ) ) ; // execute query and output results for each ( String^ s in q-> Query ) Console : : WriteLine(s ) ;
LINQ & C++/CLI overview
In this section I 'll very shortly recapitulate a few LINQ and C++/CLI features that are important for understanding how CLinq works .
If you 're familiar with LINQ and C++/CLI you can safely skip this section .
Important LINQ features
Probably the most important extension in C# that makes LINQ possible are lambda expressions .
Lambda expressions are similar to anonymous delegates ( but the syntax is even simpler ) .
Lambda expressions can be used for declaring functions inline and you can pass them as a parameter to methods .
There is however one important difference to anonymous delegates - lambda expressions can be either compiled as executable code ( like anonymous delegate ) or as a data structure that represents the lambda expression source code .
The structure is called expression tree .
Expression tree can be also compiled at runtime , so you can convert this representation to executable code .
What LINQ to SQL does is that it takes the expression tree representing the query that contains lambda expressions and converts it to the SQL query , which is sent to the SQL Server .
LINQ to SQL also contain tool called sqlmetal .exe , which generates objects that represent the database structure , so when you 're writing the queries you can work with these type - safe objects instead of having to specify database tables or columns by name .
Important C++/CLI features
Now I 'd like to mention a few from the rich set of C++/CLI features .
LINQ itself is available for .
NET , so we 'll use the ability to work with managed classes a lot in the whole project .
We 'll also use the ability to work with both C++ templates and .NET generics .
CLinq benefits from the fact that .NET generics can be compiled and exported from an assembly , while C++ templates are interesting thanks to their template specialization support , which means that if you have SomeClass < T > template , you can write special version for specified type parameter ( for example SomeClass < int > ) and add modify behavior of this class , including the possibility to add methods , etc .
Basic CLinq features
In the previous example we used Expr< Customers^ > and Var< Customers ^ > classes .
This two classes are typed wrappers and are declared using C++/CLI templates .
We use templates instead of generics , because templates allow us to use template specialization - this means that there are basic Expr < > and Var <> classes and these can be specialized , so for example Expr< Customers ^ > can contain some additional properties .
Using these additional properties you can express operations with Customers class .
These template specializations can be generated using the clinqgen .
exe tool , which will be described later .
CLinq also supports a bit more complex syntax that you can use for manipulating with classes that do n't have template specializations .
Before we start , I 'll explain how the CLinq library organized is .
It consists from two parts .
First part is the EeekSoft .
CLinq.dll assembly which contains core CLinq classes .
You 'll need to reference this assembly from your project either using project settings or with the #using statement .
Second part is the clinq.h header file ( and 2 other headers ) which contain C++/CLI templates and you 'll need to include this header in every CLinq project .
The header files are used because CLinq relies on C++/CLI templates .
The classes from the core library can be used if you want to share CLinq objects across more .NET projects .
I already mentioned the Expr <> class .
This class is written using templates and it is included ( together with Var < > ) from the clinq.h file .
These two are inherited from classes in the CLinq assembly , namely Expression <> ( there are some other classes in the assembly , but this one is the most important ) .
This class can be shared in multiple projects and it is written using .NET generics .
It is recommended to use this class as a type for parameters of any public methods from your project that can be called from other .NET assembly .
Expr and Var classes
Let 's look at some sample code .
As you can see from the previous paragraph the Expr <> and Var <> classes are key structures of the CLinq project , so we 'll use them in the following example .
The example works with two specialized versions of these classes - one for the int and second for the String^ type :
// Declare variable of type int called ' x ' Expr<int > x = Var<int >( " x " ) ; //
Declare expression of type String initialized with literal Expr < String^ > str ( " Hello world ! " ) ; //
Expression representing addition of the x variable and // result of the method call to ' Index Of ' method .
Expr<int > expr = str. IndexOf ( " w " ) + x ;
If you look at the code you could think that the IndexOf method and other operations are executed after the code is invoked , but this is n't true !
This is important fact to note - the code only builds internal structures that represent the expression , but the expression is not executed !
This provides you with a similar behavior to the C# 3.0 lambda expressions which can be also used for building representation of the written expression instead of building executable code .
You can also convert the expression represented by the Expr <> class to the structures used by LINQ as demonstrated in the following example :
// Convert to LINQ expression System :: Expressions :: Expression^ linqExpr = expr.ToLinq ( ) ; //
Print string representation of LINQ expression Console : : WriteLine( linqExpr ) ;
The result printed to the console window will be :
Add ( " Hello world ! " .
IndexOf ( " w " ) , x )
Lambda expressions
Let 's now look at the syntax for writing lambda expressions in CLinq .
Lambda expressions are represented by generic Lambda <> class .
The type parameter of this class should be one of the Func delegates declared by LINQ in the System : : Query namespace .
For declaring lambda expressions you can use the fun function in the EeekSoft : : CLinq : : clq namespace .
Assuming that you included using namespace EeekSoft :: CLinq ; directive ( which is recommended ) , the source code will look like this :
// Declare parameter ( variable ) and method body ( expression ) Expr<int > var = Var<int > ( " x " ) ; Expr<int > expr = Expr < String ^>( " Hello world ! " ) .
IndexOf ( " w " ) + var ; //
First argument for the clq :: fun function is lambda expression // parameter , the last argument is the lambda expression body Lambda < Func<int , int > ^>^ lambda = clq :: fun ( var , expr ) ; // Print string representation of lambda ..
Console :: WriteLine( lambda->ToLinq ( ) ) ; // Compile & execute lambda Func<int , int > ^ compiled = lambda-> Compile ( ) ; Console : : WriteLine ( compiled ( 100 ) ) ;
After executing this example you should see the following output in console window ( first line represents the lambda expression and the second line is the result of lambda expression invocation ) :
x => Add ( " Hello world ! " .
IndexOf ( " w " ) , x ) 106
Similarly to the LINQ you can compile the CLinq expression at runtime ( actually CLinq internally uses LINQ ) .
This was done in the previous example using the Compile method .
The returned type is one of the Func <> delegates and this delegate can be directly invoked .
As in LINQ you can use only up to 4 parameters in lambda expressions ( due to the limitations of Func < > delegates declared in LINQ assemblies ) .
Accordingly to this limitation , the clq :: fun function has the same number of overloads .
Also note that you do n't have to specify type arguments to this function in most of the situations , because C++/CLI type inference algorithm can infer the types for you .
Let 's look at one more example that demonstrates declaring lambda expression with more than one parameter :
Expr<int > x = Var<int >( " x " ) ; Expr<int > y = Var<int >( " y " ) ; Lambda < Func<int , int , int > ^>^ lambda2 = clq :: fun( x , y , 2 * ( x + y ) ) ; Console : : WriteLine( lambda2->Compile ( ) ( 12 , 9 ) ) ;
In this example the body of the lambda expression is n't declared earlier as another variable , but composed directly in the clq : : fun function .
We also used overloaded operators ( namely * and + ) in the body of lambda expression .
If you run this code , the result will be ( 12 + 9 ) * 2 which is 42 .
Supported types and operators
In the previous example I used two overloaded operators .
These operators are declared in the Expr<int > template specialization ( so you can use them when working with an expression representing integer ) .
CLinq includes template specializations with overloaded operators for the following standard types :
Type Supported operators & methods bool Comparison : != , == ; Logical : && , || , ! int Comparison : != , == , < , > , <= , >= ; Math : + , * , / , - ; Modulo : % ; Shifts : << , >>
Other integral types Comparison : != , == , < , > , <= , >= ; Math : + , * , / , - ; Modulo : % float , double , Decimal Comparison : != , == , < , > , <= , >= ; Math : + , * , / , - wchar_t Comparison : != , == String^ Comparison : != , == ; Concatenation : + ; Standard string methods ( IndexOf , Substring , etc.. )
For complete list of supported types with list of methods and operators see generated documentation [ ^ ] .
The following example demonstrates using overloaded operators with expressions representing double and float ( mixing different type is another interesting problem , so that 's why we use two different floating point types here ) :
// Declare ' float ' variable and ' double ' literal Expr< float > fv = Var< float >( " f " ) ; Expr<double > fc( 1.2345678 ) ; // Function taking ' float ' and returning ' float ' Lambda < Func< float , float >^>^ foo4 = clq:: fun ( fv , clq::conv<float >( Expr < Math^ >:: Sin( fv * 3.14 ) + fc ) ) ;
You can see that we 're using another function from the clq namespace - the clq::conv .
This function is used for converting types when implicit conversion is not available .
In the sample we 're using a Sin function which accepts Expr< double > as a parameter .
The variable of type float is converted to the expression of type double implicitly , but when conversion in the opposite direction is not possible , so we have to use clq : : conv function .
CLinq allows implicit conversion only from smaller floating point data type to larger ( float to double ) or from smaller integral type to larger ( for example short to int ) .
This example also uses the Expr < Math^ > class , which is another interesting template specialization .
This specialization represents the .NET System :: Math class and contains most of the methods from this class .
Working with classes
I already demonstrated how you can work with basic data types , like int or float , but I mentioned only a few about working with another classes .
There are two possible approaches - you can either use template specialization ( if it exists ) which includes properties and methods that represent members of underlying class .
These specializations exist for some standard types ( like String^ ) and can be generated for LINQ to SQL database mappings .
If the template specialization is n't available you have to use common methods that can be used for invoking method ( or property ) by its name .
Typed wrappers
Using class if the corresponding template specialization exists is fairly simple .
The following example declares expression working with the String^ type :
// ' String^ ' variable Expr< String^ > name = Var < String^ >( " name " ) ; //
Expression that uses ' IndexOf ' and ' Substring ' methods Expr < String^ > sh( " Hello Tomas " ) ; Expr<int > n = sh. IndexOf ('T ' ) ; Lambda < Func< String^ , String ^>^>^ foo = clq :: fun( name , sh. Substring ( 0 , n ) + name ) ; // Print LINQ representation and execute Console : : WriteLine ( foo -> ToLinq ( ) ) ; Console : : WriteLine ( foo -> Compile ( ) ( " world ! " ) ) ;
In this example we used two methods that are declared in the Expr < String^ > class .
These methods were IndexOf and Substring and they represent calls to according methods of the String^ type .
If you look at the program output , you can see that it contains calls to these two methods ( there is also a call to the Concat method which was generated by CLinq when we used + operator for string concatenation ) :
name => Concat ( new [ ] { " Hello Tomas " .
Substring ( 0 , " Hello Tomas " .
IndexOf ( T ) ) , name} )
Hello world !
Indirect member access
To demonstrate the second approach , we 'll first define new class with sample property , method and static method ( you can also invoke static properties ) :
// Sample class that we 'll work with ref class DemoClass { int _number ; public : DemoClass ( int n ) { _number = n ; } // Property property int Number { int get ( ) { return _number ; } } // Standard method int AddNumber ( int n ) { return _number = _number + n ; } // Static method static int Square ( int number ) { return number * number ; } } ;
Now let 's get to the more interesting part of the example .
We will first declare variable of type DemoClass^ and later we 'll use the Prop method to read property by its name , Invoke to call member method and InvokeStatic to invoke static method of this class ( the AddNumber method could be a bit tricky , because it increments number stored in the class as a side - effect , which means that the value of expression depends on the order in which members of the expression are evaluated ) :
// Construct the lambda expression Expr< DemoClass^ > var = Var < DemoClass^>( " var " ) ; Lambda < Func< DemoClass^ , int >^> ^ foo = clq :: fun( var , var .
Prop<int >( " Number " ) + var .
Invoke < int >( " AddNumber " , Expr<int > ( 6 ) ) + Expr<DemoClass^>:: InvokeStatic<int >( " Square " , Expr<int >( 100 ) ) ) ; //
Compile the lambda and pass instance of ' DemoClass ' as a parameter DemoClass^ dcs = gcnew DemoClass ( 15 ) ; int ret = foo -> Compile ( ) ( dcs ) ; Console : : WriteLine ( " {0}
{ 1} " , foo -> ToLinq ( ) , ret ) ;
And the output of this example will be :
var => Add( Add(var.Number , var. AddNumber ( 6 ) ) , Square ( 100 ) ) 10036
I included the output because I wanted to point out one interesting fact .
You can see that there is no difference in the output if you use generated template specialization or invoke by name .
This is because if you 're using invoke by name , the method ( or property ) that should be invoked is found using reflection before the LINQ expression tree is generated .
This also means that if you execute the compiled lambda expression , it will call the method ( or property ) directly and not by its name .
Calling constructors in projection
So far we looked at calling methods and reading property values , but there is one more interesting problem that I did n't write about .
Sometimes you may want to create an instance of a class and return it from lambda expression .
CLinq does n't support anything like C# 3.0 anonymous methods , but you can invoke class constructor and pass parameters to it using clq : : newobj function .
The following sample assumes that you have a class called DemoCtor with constructor taking String^ and int as parameters :
// Arguments of the lambda expression Expr< String^ > svar = Var < String^ >( " s " ) ; Expr<int > nvar = Var<int > ( " n " ) ;
DemoCtor^ d = clq :: fun( svar , nvar , clq::newobj< DemoCtor^ >( svar , nvar ) ) -> Compile ( ) ( " Hello world ! " , 42 ) ;
After executing this code , he d variable will contain instance of DemoCtor class created using constructor that I wrote about earlier .
You should be very careful when using the newobj method , because there is no compile - time checking so if the required constructor does n't exist or has incompatible types , the code will end with run-time error .
Using LINQ
You 're now familiar with all CLinq features that you need to start working with data using LINQ in C++/CLI !
The key for working with data is the CQuery class which serves as a CLinq wrapper for the IQueryable interface , which represents query in LINQ .
This class has several methods for constructing queries , including Where , Select , Average and other .
You can construct this class if you already have an instance of class implementing the IQueryable interface , but for working with database , you can use a tool to generate code which makes it simpler .
CQuery class also has a property called Query that returns the underlying IQueryable interface - we 'll need this property later for accessing the results of the query .
Working with SQL Database
LINQ to SQL : Introduction
We will use two tools to generate CLinq header file with classes that will represent the database structure .
First tool is shipped as part of LINQ and is called sqlmetal .
This tool can generate C# or VB.NET code , but it can also be used to generate XML description of the database structure .
We will use the third option - the following example demonstrates how to generate XML description ( northwind.xml ) for database northwind at SQL server running at localhost :
sqlmetal / server: localhost / database : northwind /xml:northwind.xml
Once we have the XML file , we can use the clinqgen tool which is part of CLinq .
This tool generates C++/CLI header file with classes that represent database tables , according Expr <> template specializations and also the class that will represent the entire database .
You can customize the name and namespace of this class .
If you want to automate this task , you can include the XML file generated by sqlmetal in your project and set its custom build tool to the following command ( Hacker note :
You can also use pipe ( | ) to get these two tools working together ) :
clinqgen /namespace : EeekSoft.CLinq.Demo /class:NorthwindData /out:Northwind.h $ ( InputPath )
Now you 'll need to include the generated header file and we can start working with database .
We 'll first create instance of the generated NorthwindData class , which represents the database ( note , that the example uses C++/CLI stack semantics , but you can also use gcnew if you want instead ) .
Once we have instance of this class , we can use it 's properties that represent data tables .
The properties with the Q prefix return the CQuery class , so we 'll use these properties instead of properties without this prefix , which are designed for using from C# 3.0 or VB.NET .
The following example demonstrates some basic CQuery methods :
// Create database context NorthwindData db ( " .. connection string .. " ) ; // ( 1 ) Count employees Console : : WriteLine ( " Number of employees : { 0} " , db. QEmployees ->Count ( ) ) ; // ( 2 ) Calculate average ' UnitPrice ' value Expr< Products ^ > p = Var < Products ^ >( " p " ) ; Nullable < Decimal > avg Price = db.
QProducts -> Average ( clq:: fun( p , p.UnitPrice ) ) ; Console : : WriteLine ( " Average unit price : { 0} " , avg Price ) ; // ( 3 ) Get first employee whose ' Reports To ' column is NULL Expr< Employees^ > e = Var< Employees^ >( " e " ) ;
Employees ^ boss = db. QEmployees ->
Where ( clq :: fun(e , e.ReportsTo == nullptr ) ) ->
First ( ) ; Console : : WriteLine ( " The boss : {0} { 1} " , boss -> FirstName , boss -> LastName ) ;
In the first example we simply called the Count method which returns number of rows in the table .
In second example we use Average method which requires one argument , which is a lambda expression that returns some numeric type for every row in the table .
Since UnitPrice column can contain NULL values we 're working with Nullable < Decimal > type which can contain either real value or NULL which is represented using nullptr in C++/CLI .
Third example uses
Where method to filter only rows matching specified predicate ( lambda expression ) .
The result of this call is also CQuery class , so we can easily concatenate multiple operations .
In this example we append call to the First method , which returns first row from the result set .
LINQ to SQL : Filtering & projection
Let 's look at the more interesting sample that cover filtering ( Where method ) and projection ( Select method ) .
The result of the query will be collection containing instances of custom class called CustomerInfo , so let 's first look at this class :
ref class CustomerInfo { String^ _id ; String^ _name ; public : CustomerInfo( [ PropMap ( " ID " ) ]
String^ id , [ PropMap ( " Name " ) ]
String^ name ) { _id=id ; _name=name ; } CustomerInfo( ) { } property String^ ID { String^ get ( ) { return _id ; } void set ( String^ value ) { _id = value ; } } property String^ Name { String^ get ( ) { return _name ; } void set ( String^ value ) { _name = value ; } } } ;
The class has two properties ( ID and Name ) , one parameter - less constructor and one constructor that needs further explanation .
The constructor takes two parameters , which are used to initialize both two fields of the class .
There is also an attribute PropMap attached to every parameter , which describes how does the constructor initialize the properties of the class ( for example attribute [ PropMap ( " ID " ) ] attached to the id parameter means , that the value of ID property will be set to value of the id parameter in the constructor .
Why is this information important ?
First , it will not be used in the following query , but you could write a query that constructs collection of CustomerInfo objects and later filters this collection using the Where method .
The whole query will be passed to LINQ for conversion to SQL and if you use the ID property for the filtering , LINQ needs to know what the value that was assigned to this property earlier is .
For this reason , CLinq has PropMap attribute which maps property values to parameters passed to the constructor earlier .
In C# 3.0 the behavior is a bit different , because you can use anonymous types and you do n't need to pass values directly to the constructor .
// DB context & variable .. NorthwindData db ( " .. connection string .. " ) ; Expr< Customers^ > cvar = Var< Customers^ > ( " c " ) ; //
Query : select some information about customers living // in country whose name starts with the letter " U " CQuery < Customer Info^ > ^ q = db.
QCustomers -> Where ( clq: : fun( cvar , cvar.Country .IndexOf ( " U " ) == 0 ) ) -> Select( clq:: fun( cvar , clq::newobj<CustomerInfo^ >( cvar.CustomerID , cvar.ContactName + Expr < String^ >( " from " ) + cvar.Country ) ) ) ; //
Print SQL command sent to SQL server Console : : WriteLine ( "
Query :
{0}
Results : " , q-> Query -> ToString ( ) ) ; //
Print returned rows for each ( CustomerInfo^ c in q-> Query ) Console : : WriteLine ( " * { 0} , { 1} " , c-> ID , c -> Name ) ;
This code is quite similar to the code that you usually write when working with LINQ in C# 3.0 .
In this sample we first create the database context and declare variable that will be used in the query .
The query itself takes QCustomers property ( representing the Customers table in database ) , than filters ( Where method ) customers from country starting with the letter " U " and finally , it performs projection ( Select method ) where it selects only information that we 're interested in and creates the CustomerInfo object .
The sample also prints the SQL command that will be generated from the query - LINQ returns the SQL command if you call the ToString method on the IQueryable representing the query .
As I mentioned earlier , the underlying IQueryable of the CQuery class can be accessed using the Query property , so the code q-> Query -> ToString ( ) returns the SQL command .
The last thing that the code does is that it executes the query and prints information about all returned customers .
The query is executed automatically when you start enumerating over the collection , which is done in the for each statement .
LINQ to SQL : Joins & tuples
For the last example , I wrote very a more complex query .
It first performs GroupJoin operation on customers and orders , which means that it returns collection of tuples containing the customer and all her orders .
After this join , it performs
Where filtering and returns only customers who have at least one order that will be shipped to USA ( the customers are still kept together with their orders ) .
The last operation done by the query is projection where it generates string with the name of company and number of orders associated with it .
This query also demonstrates a few more interesting things that we did n't need earlier .
The example starts with two typedef s to make the code more readable .
First just defines shortcut for the collection of orders , but the second uses the Tuple class , which is part of CLinq and I did n't talk about it so far .
Tuple is very simple generic class with two type parameters which contains two properties ( called First and Second ) that have the type determined by the type parameters .
You can use this class if you want to return two different values from projection or join without declaring your own class .
The query returns the Tuple type from the projection and later uses
Where operation to filter the customers .
This reveals one advantage of using the predefined Tuple class - the co variable whose type is the expression representing the tuple ( Expr < Tuple < > ^ > ) is passed as a parameter to lambda expression and in the lambda expression we can directly use its properties ( First and Second ) .
Because we 're manipulating with expressions , we 're not working with the Tuple class directly , but we 're working with template specialization of the Expr class , in which the Expr < Tuple < > ^ > is expanded to contain these two properties .
I 'll comment other interesting features used in this example later , so let 's look at the query now :
// First declare type for storing Customer and her Orders typedef IEnumerable < Orders^ > OrdersCollection ; typedef Tuple < Customers^ , OrdersCollection ^ > CustomerOrders ; // Connect to DB and declare variables NorthwindData db ( " .. connection string .. " ) ; Expr< Customers^ > c = Var< Customers^ > ( " c " ) ; Expr< Orders^ > o = Var < Orders^ >( " o " ) ; Expr< OrdersCollection^ > orders = Var< OrdersCollection^ >( " orders " ) ; Expr<CustomerOrders^ > co = Var< CustomerOrders ^>( " co " ) ; // The Query CQuery < String ^>^ q = db.
QCustomers // Group customers and their orders and // produce collection of ' CustomerOrders ' -> GroupJoin ( db. QOrders , clq::fun( c , c.CustomerID ) , clq : : fun( o , o.CustomerID ) , clq:: fun< Customers^ , OrdersCollection^ , CustomerOrders^ > ( c , orders , clq::newobj< CustomerOrders^>( c , orders ) ) ) //
Filter only customers with order shipped to USA // Note : ' Second ' is the collection with orders -> Where ( clq : : fun ( co , co. Second .
Where ( clq :: fun( o , o. ShipCountry == " USA " ) ) .
Count ( ) >
0 ) ) //
Projection - string concatenation -> Select ( clq:: fun( co , co.First.CompanyName + Expr < String^ >( " , #orders = " ) + Expr< Convert^ >:: ToString( co.Second.Count ( ) ) ) ) ;
Let 's focus on the Where clause .
The lambda expression accepts expression of type Tuple , which I explained earlier , as a parameter and it accesses its second value ( co. Second ) .
Type of this parameter is expression representing collection ( Expr < IEnumerable < >^> ) - this is another specialization of the Expr <> class and you can discover using the InteliSense that this class has a lot of methods for working with collections !
These methods correspond to the methods available in the CQuery class , but are designed for working with expressions representing queries , instead of working with queries directly .
In this example we use the Where method , which returns expression representing query again and also the Count method .
Second class that was n't mentioned earlier is Expr < Convert > , which is just another template specialization similar to the Expr < Math > that contains several methods for type conversions .
In this example we use the ToString method for converting number of orders to string .
Project summary
Currently , the project is in very early phase , which means it needs more testing and also review from other people .
If you find any bugs or if you think that CLinq is missing some important LINQ functionality , let me know .
The project currently uses May 2006 CTP version of LINQ , but it will be updated to support Visual Studio " Orcas " , once more stable beta versions will be available .
The project is available at CodePlex [ ^ ] so you can download the latest version of the source code and binaries from the project site .
Because I 'm not C++/CLI expert I 'm very interested in your comments and suggestions and if you 're willing to participate in the project , let me know !

Depends On The Specific Meaning Of " Specific "
Q Thank you .
The Attorney General acknowledged yesterday that there were mistakes in the firing of prosecutors .
What is his future in your cabinet ?
Do you have confidence in him ?
And more importantly — or just as important — how effective can he be in Congress going forward when he 's lost a lot of confidence among Democrats and does n't have any defenders among Republicans ?
PRESIDENT BUSH : I do have confidence in Attorney General Al Gonzales .
I talked to him this morning , and we talked about his need to go up to Capitol Hill and make it very clear to members in both political parties why the Justice Department made the decisions it made , making very clear about the facts .
And he 's right , mistakes were made .
And I 'm , frankly , not happy about it , because there is a lot of confusion over what really has been a customary practice by the Presidents .
U.S. attorneys and others serve at the pleasure of the President .
Past administrations have removed U.S. attorneys ; they 're right to do so .
The Justice Department recommended a list of U.S. attorneys .
I believe the reasons why were entirely appropriate .
And yet this issue was mishandled to the point now where you 're asking me questions about it in Mexico , which is fine .
If I were you , I 'd ask the same question .
This is an issue that — let me just say , Al was right , mistakes were made , and he 's going to go up to Capitol Hill to correct them .
I appreciate the fact that he 's taken some action , because anytime anybody goes up to Capitol Hill , they 've got to make sure they fully understand the facts , and how they characterize the issue to members of Congress .
And the fact that both Republicans and Democrats feel like that there was not straightforward communication troubles me , and it troubles the Attorney General , so he took action .
And he needs to continue to take action .
—
Q Thank you , Mr. President , President Calderon .
On the dismissal of U.S. attorneys , there have been allegations that political motivations were involved .
Is political loyalty to your administration an appropriate factor ?
And when you talked to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales last year , what did you say , and what did you direct him to do ?
PRESIDENT BUSH : Thanks , Kelly .
I 've heard those allegations about political decision - making ; it 's just not true .
Secondly , just so you know , I get asked — I get complaints all the time from members of Congress on a variety of subjects — this senator , this congressperson so - and - so — there 's occasionally frustration with the executive branch .
And they will pull me aside and say , are you aware of this , are you aware of that ?
And I did receive complaints about U.S. attorneys .
I specifically remember one time I went up to the Senate and senators were talking about the U.S. attorneys .
I do n't remember specific names being mentioned , but I did say to Al last year — you 're right , last fall — I said , have you heard complaints about AGs , I have — I mean , U.S. attorneys , excuse me — and he said , I have .
But I never brought up a specific case nor gave him specific instructions .
Q Sir , might he have inferred that you discussed it with him was a need for him to take action ?
PRESIDENT BUSH :
You 're going to have to ask Al that question , but as I say , I discuss with my Cabinet officials complaints I hear .
When members of the Senate come up and say to me , I 've got a complaint , I think it 's entirely appropriate and necessary for me to pass those complaints on .
I do n't every single time , but people view their moment with the President sometimes as an opportunity to unload their frustrations about how things may be working in their state — or congresspersons how things may be working in their district .
And whether it be the Attorney General or the Secretary of State or other members of my Cabinet , I pass those complaints on at times .
Dan Bartlett , counselor to the president , told reporters traveling with Bush in Mexico on Tuesday that the White House had received complaints about U.S. attorneys ' handling of election fraud cases in New Mexico , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania , and Bush had a brief conversation with Gonzales about the complaints in October .
foreign leaders
Bush : Yo Blair How are you doing ?
Blair : I 'm just ...
Bush :
You 're leaving ?
Blair : No , no , no not yet .
On this trade thingy ...[ inaudible ]
Bush : yeah I told that to the man
Blair :
Are you planning to say that here or not ?
Bush :
If you want me to
Blair :
Well , it 's just that if the discussion arises ...
Bush : I just want some movement .
Blair : Yeah
Bush : Yesterday we did n't see much movement
Blair :
No , no , it may be that it 's not , it maybe that it 's impossible
Bush : I am prepared to say it
Blair :
But it 's just I think what we need to be an opposition
Bush :
Who is introducing the trade
Blair : Angela
Bush :
Tell her to call 'em
Blair : Yes
Bush :
Tell her to put him on them on the spot .
Thanks for the sweaters it 's awfully thoughtful of you
Blair :
It 's a pleasure
Bush : I know you picked it out yourself
Blair :
Oh , absoultely , in fact I knitted it myself
BUSH : " Right . . .
What about Kofi ?
That seems odd .
I do n't like the sequence of it .
His attitude is basically ceasefire and everything else happens . "
BLAIR : " I think the thing that is really difficult is you can't stop this unless you get this international presence agreed . " . . .
Bush : Yeah
Blair : I do n't know what you guys have talked about but as I say I am perfectly happy to try and see what the lie of the land is but you need that done quickly because otherwise it will spiral
Bush : I think Condi is going to go pretty soon
Blair :
But that 's that 's that 's all that matters .
But if you , you see it will take some time to get that together
Bush : Yeah , yeah
Blair :
But at least it gives people ...
Bush :
It 's a process , I agree .
I told her your offer to ...
Blair : Well ... it's only if I mean ... you know .
If she 's got a ... , or if she needs the ground prepared as it were ...
Because obviously if she goes out , she 's got to succeed , if it were , whereas I can go out and just talk
Bush :
You see , the ... thing is what they need to do is to get Syria , to get Hezbollah to stop doing this shit and it's over
Blair : [ inaudible ]
Bush : [ inaudible ]
Blair : Syria
Bush : Why ?
Blair : Because I think this is all part of the same thing
Bush : Yeah .
Blair :
What does he think ?
He thinks if Lebanon turns out fine , if we get a solution in Israel and Palestine , Iraq goes in the right way ...
Bush : Yeah , yeah , he is sweet
Blair :
He is honey .
And that 's what the whole thing is about .
It 's the same with Iraq
Bush : I felt like telling Kofi to call , to get on the phone to Bashad [ Bashir Assad ] and make something happen
Blair : Yeah
The American people must understand when I said that we need to be patient , that I meant it .
And we 're going to be there for a while .
I do n't know the exact moment when we leave , David , but it 's not until the mission is complete .
The world must know that this administration will not blink in the face of danger and will not tire when it comes to completing the missions that we said we would do .
The world will learn that when the United States is harmed , we will follow through .
The world will see that when we put a coalition together that says " Join us , " I mean it .
And when I ask others to participate , I mean it .

Short cuts bring the globe to your screen without crashing your computer .
Starting with an icosahedron ( a ) , the triangular tiles are split into 4 smaller tiles ( b ) , and re-mapped into a shape approximating a sphere ( c ) .
The process is then repeated ( d , e , f ) . © Ross Heikes
The globe - imaging software Google Earth has become a cult web product since its release last June .
Using the web - based tool , users can fly around the globe and zoom in on both natural features and whole worlds of information added by other users ( see <?xm- replace_text ?>' The web - wide world ' ) .
But how is it possible for you to zoom in from outer space to a point somewhere above the rooftop of your house without bringing your desktop computer to a grinding halt ?
The main obstacle to a convincing three - diménsional skydive is data transfer .
If one were to download over the Internet a one - metre resolution image of the entire world it would take 69 years with a 10 - megabit - per- second Internet connection , and 12,400 years with a standard 56 K modem .
To slash the amount of data they have to transmit across the Internet , virtual globes such as Google Earth approximate the sphere of the planet 's surface with a polygon made up of flat tiles .
The further away your viewpoint is from the surface , the fewer tiles are needed to create the illusion of roundness , and the lower the resolution of these tiles can be .
As you zoom in , the computer explodes each tile into smaller sub-tiles , each with higher resolution , and re-forms the polygon into a ball .
The process continues as you zoom .
This means that the virtual globe only has to download high - resolution data when the viewer is actively zooming towards it .
Virtual globes also use another trick to speed <? xm - replace_text ?> things up further : a disk cache .
Images for places you have already looked at are stored locally on your hard drive , so when you fly over this area again the software does not need to re-download the images , but instead quickly calls them up from your hard disk .

Google Earth was designed by Keyhole , a software company that Google bought in 2004 .
Many of the tricks it uses are n't unique : the tiling idea has been used by climate modellers , for example .
But with good software and the speed of Google 's enormous supercomputing platform , the results are impressive .
" I think Keyhole did a very good job , " says Michael Goodchild , a geographer at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
" There are some elegant design decisions in there . "

It ’s been nearly a year since I terminated my polyphasic sleep experiment .
If you did n’t follow that experiment , for 5 - 1/ 2 months ( Oct 2005 – Apr 2006 ) I followed a pattern of sleeping about 20 minutes once every four hours around the clock — 6 naps every 24 hours , about 2 hours of sleep per day .
I blogged about it as I went along , and you can find the links to all those log entries by following the link above .
Adapting to polyphasic sleep took many days , and I felt like a zombie the first week .
At one point I just sat on the couch staring at a wall for 90 minutes , unable to form any thoughts .
But eventually I was able to adapt , and it was one of the most unusual experiences of my life .
I was lucky to have a lifestyle that gave me every possible advantage in conducting this experiment , including working from home , a flexible schedule , and a supportive family .
Most people who attempt polyphasic sleep ca n’t make it fit their schedules , and it takes a lot of discipline to avoid oversleeping .
You can shift your naps around a little , but not by much .
As soon as you awaken from a nap , you have only 3 hours 40 minutes until your next one .
By adapting to polyphasic sleep , you may gain some waking hours each day , but you sacrifice a lot of schedule flexibility .
Eventually I abandoned the pattern and returned to monophasic sleep , mainly due to social reasons as I explained in my final post of the series : The Return to Monophasic .
The rest of the world simply is n’t polyphasic .
However , returning to my original sleep pattern was n’t quite the same after that experiment .
Something came back with me .
Cue eerie sci - fi music …
No , I did n’t come back possessed … although some might refer to my recent ramblings on subjective reality and polarity as evidence to the contrary .
What happened was that part of the polyphasic sleep adaptation seems to have stayed with me .
Polyphasic napping
The critical part of polyphasic adaptation is to reach the point where you can take a 20 - minute nap and hit REM sleep .
During typical nighttime sleep , you do n’t normally hit your first REM cycle until after about 90 minutes .
So when you first attempt polyphasic sleep , you ’ll initially suffer from terrible sleep deprivation because you wo n’t be getting any REM sleep during your naps .
You ’ll awaken feeling even more tired , and you WILL feel like a zombie for many days , possibly weeks .
If you can withstand the sleep deprivation long enough , your body eventually adapts , and you begin experiencing REM sleep during your naps .
Dreams occur during REM sleep , so you ’ll know you ’re getting there when you start having dreams during your naps .
Once this starts happening , it may take a few more days to make up for the sleep deprivation and start feeling functional again .
REM naps leave you feeling rested and rejuvenated .
After adapting to polyphasic sleep , I could lie down for a nap , set a timer for 20 minutes , fall asleep , and wake up remembering an extremely vivid dream .
During my polyphasic experiments I could normally fall asleep within a few minutes , and I ’d often wake up naturally a minute or two before the alarm went off .
The dreams I had during these times were extremely vivid , and I experienced a sense of time dilation .
Even though I was only asleep for 15 minutes or so , it felt like my dreams lasted more than an hour .
I ’d awaken amazed at how little time had passed .
The interesting thing is that I still have this ability today .
I suspect it may be a permanent adaptation .
I took a nap this afternoon , had a dream that seemed about an hour long , and woke up naturally feeling refreshed and with a clear memory of the dream .
But the total time I was lying down was only 13 minutes .
As long as I ’m in a fairly calm mental state , I can still basically do this at any time of day .
Also , during my regular nighttime monophasic sleep period , I will often awaken within the first 20 minutes after I go to bed , remembering a very vivid dream .
Usually I can fall back asleep again fairly easily after this happens .
Overall the quality of my nighttime sleep does n’t feel any different than it was during my pre-polyphasic days .
Mental clarity
Whenever I take a nap these days , I awaken with the same feeling I had when I was polyphasic .
I described this feeling in some of my log entries .
It ’s a feeling of being extremely mellow and relaxed , as if my mind is a blank slate with no background noise .
Before going polyphasic I never experienced this exact state of mind .
Today my 20 - minute naps virtually always return me to this mental state , which usually lasts for hours afterwards .
I ’m in this state right now .
This post - nap state is terrific for writing because ideas flow through my mind very easily .
I certainly had a high blogging output ( at least for me ) during my polyphasic experience — you can verify that just by looking at the archives ( Oct 2005 – Apr 2006 ) .
Permanent physiological changes ?
For good or ill , my sleep physiology appears to have been permanently altered by my polyphasic sleep experiment .
I would n’t even know how to completely revert back to my pre-polyphasic pattern .
I consider these after - effects to be positive , but who knows what the long - term consequences could be ?
Polyphasic nostalgia
Despite its weirdness I often miss my polyphasic days , except for the adaptation period of course .
Having so much extra time available was really nice , and to an extent I enjoyed the balance of social time and alone time .
I liked that I always had plenty of time to explore various interests .
It was strange tending a house of hibernating bears at night and the blurry borders between days took some getting used to , but I certainly got a lot done .
Re-adaptation ?
My current sleep pattern is that I go to bed around 10 - 11 pm each night and get up at 5 am , still using an alarm clock .
It ’s the basic early riser pattern I used before the polyphasic experiment .
In an average night I sleep about 6.5 hours , and I normally do n’t nap during the day anymore .
Because of the lingering after - effects of my polyphasic experiment , I ’m curious as to whether it might be possible for me to re-adapt to polyphasic sleep far more easily if I were to try it again .
Would I have to endure another week or two of zombie - hood , or could I readapt within a couple of days ?
Apparently I still possess the REM adaptation , which I believe is the most crucial element .
What if it were possible to switch back and forth between monophasic and polyphasic sleep patterns with relative ease after making the polyphasic adaptation the first time ?
What if a person could go one week on polyphasic sleep and the next week on monophasic sleep ?
Then you could gain the benefits of polyphasic sleep while falling back on a monophasic pattern when polyphasic sleep was impractical .
For example , a student could go polyphasic during spring break and return to monophasic the following week .
I feel polyphasic sleep would still be impractical for me as a long - term pattern , but I could make good use of it for a few weeks every quarter if it were possible to switch within a day or two .
I have no idea what it would be like to readapt to polyphasic sleep now , but I suspect it would be much easier the second time around .
I ’m certainly curious , but I ’m not committed to testing this just yet .
I just ran the idea past Erin , and she ’s opposed to it because she remembers all the schedule juggling that had to be done to accommodate my naps , especially when traveling .
Nevertheless , I ’m going to give it some thought and consider whether I ’d want to give polyphasic sleep another trial to see what a second adaptation period would be like .
The downside is that if I do this , I have to be prepared for it to take just as long as ( or longer than ) it did the first time , which was certainly no picnic .
I mainly wanted to share this information for the benefit of those who are considering altering their sleep patterns ( polyphasic , biphasic , triphasic , or otherwise ) .
I ’d caution that once you cross a certain threshold , things might never be the same again .
That is n’t necessarily a bad thing , but such experiments should n’t be taken lightly .

A local limit theorem for sampling without replacement : Mark Pinsky
In Feller 's Introduction to Probability theory and Its Applications , volume 1 , 3d ed , p. 194 , exercise 10 , there is formulated a version of the local limit theorem which is applicable to the hypergeometric distribution , which governs sampling without replacement .
In the simpler case of sampling with replacement , the classical DeMoivre - Laplace theorem is applicable .
Feller 's conditions seem too stringent for applications and are difficult t to prove .
It is the purpose of this note to re-formulate and prove a suitable limit theorem with broad applicability to sampling from a finite population which is suitably large in comparison to the sample size .

California ’s Department of Managed Health Care randomly selected 90 ( of more than 1,000 ) cancelled individual Blue Cross plans and investigated whether the company had cause to cancel them .
Score : 0 for 90 .
Blue Cross broke the rules in every single case .
The policies were individually purchased plans in which policy holders had become pregnant or sick , apparently triggering Blue Cross to rescind the policy .
Retroactively — leaving individuals , hospitals and doctors holding the bag for care already provided .
Policies can only be legally rescinded if the applicant lies on the application to conceal pre-existing conditions .
Individuals pay exorbitant premiums for coverage purchased outside of employer group plans , and are also more vulnerable to such cancellations in California law .
But this is bad news for everyone , not just those who have to buy individual plans .
Who pays when hospitals and doctors are n’t reimbursed ?
The taxpayers do , one way or the other .
The taxpayers also paid for the state ’s investigation , whose end result is a measly $ 1 - million suit against Blue Cross , whose annual profit is more than three times that .
Blue Cross policy holders funded an entire department of the company devoted to finding reasons to cancel the policies of sick or pregnant people .
About 6.5 million California residents , or about 18 percent of the population , lack health insurance .
A war of attrition
When your company poisons peer - to - peer networks for a living , public relations usually takes a back seat to discretion ; quiet is the rule in the P2P content - protection industry .
That 's why Jonathan Lee , the company 's VP of business development , is n't worried that the corporate web site is down when I reach him in his Santa Monica office .
" It 's kind of ugly anyway , " he says .
For a company like MediaDefender , the largest such firm in existence , privacy comes naturally , but a 2005 acquisition by ARTISTDirect has encouraged the firm to take its services public as it starts to look beyond its original client base — music labels and movie studios — and dives headfirst into the brave new world of providing legitimate P2P content for advertisers .
Such advertising deals may be the future , but the company 's bread and butter continues to be P2P disruption of movies and music downloads .
MediaDefender is quite good at this , as it should be after five years of antipiracy work .
Unlike DRM providers that focus on protecting the product , MediaDefender tries to protect the distribution channel — and only for a limited time .
Recognizing that it is impossible to shut down the sharing of copyrighted works , the company focuses instead on mitigation .
Record labels and movie companies can pay between $ 5,000 and $ 15,000 per title for differing levels of protection that extend over different time periods .
For most content owners , MediaDefender 's services are needed at the beginning of a product 's life cycle .
Lee points out that most movies and albums makes the majority of their money in the first few months after release .
MediaDefender 's value proposition is not that it can stop such files from being shared , but that it can make sharing difficult for a month or two in order to give the legitimate product more traction .
Is it live or is it MediaDefender ?
How it works
To work its magic on the various P2P networks , Lee describes four strategies that MediaDefender uses .
All four are powered by a back end of 2,000 servers co-located around the world , and the company has contracts for 9GBps of Internet bandwidth .
For a 60 - person operation , these numbers are ( to put it mildly ) a bit high , but the scale of its system usually ensures that the company gets prompt attention and good deals when it goes shopping .
It also means that employees who stay late after work to game on the corporate LAN always have a good connection .
Those 2,000 servers do four things that MediaDefender refers to as decoying , spoofing , interdiction , and swarming .
Here 's how they work ...

export ls
You can use regular expressions to search help .
If you want to learn how to stop duplicated commands in Emacs shell history , you would say , " Search for shell OR comint , followed by dup " or , in Emacs speak :
M-x apropos RET \( shell\|comint\ ) .* dup RET
Loading EMacro 's inet.el enables BBDB .
You can activate it in a supported mode , such as GNUS ( Internet Emailer and Usenet newsreader ) by hitting " : " , when the cursor is near an address .
This adds the address to the BB DataBase , and brings it up in a buffer at bottom , where a right mouse click brings up a popup menu .
locate - library ( ) is one of the slowest commands in elisp .
EMacro optimizes this command , by saving its results in ~ / emacs / preferences / e- cache.el ( or e-xcache.el for XEmacs ) .
This also has the side effect , that when you 've installed http://tiny-tools.sf.net or browse - url.el , and conditions work right , that you can click on the links to download these packages .
There are far more packages in [ X ] Emacs , than the EMacro team can support , but all the supported libraries , not bundled with [ X ] Emacs , are listed in the cache[s ] .
EMacro currently does not automatically refresh the cache , so you must delete them , when you change supported packages in your load - path .
This is what happens , when you run ~ / emacs / bin / [ os ]
/e-refresh .
EMacro will automatically repopulate any missing items in the cache .
Cancel commands with C-g
History of commands to repeat with M-x M-p .
. Repeat to cycle through history C-x ESC ESC
Sometimes C-x z repeats commands , too .
Before you make changes to EMacro , you should read INSTALL .
txt 's section on upgrading .
Rather than simply uncommenting code , copy your uncommented code to postload.el , ( or a file you call from it ) .
This file is meant to be modified .
Say you are running cua-mode , and you wish to use the command shortcut for M-x comment - region .
First , you mark the region by dragging the mouse , or shift - arrow .
You type C-c ( Control C ) and then C-o .
To your surprise , it copies text to the clipboard , then tries to open a file .
The trick is to execute these commands rapidly together : C - c C-o .
If you are in a programming mode ( modeline at bottom says c- mode or emacs - lisp - mode , etc ) , then the selected region will be commented out .
Using the variable file - name - handler - alist , you can execute arbitrary code when opening a file .
This is used by dired and ange - ftp / efs .
You can adapt this to other things , such as seamlessly editing text stored in a database , where ( X ) Emacs silently performs the select / update .
You can always hit C-x e after a closing parenthesis , to execute the preceding lisp function .
GNU Emacs also supports interactive interpretation : try M-x ielm
The best way to find emacs functions & variables is to install hyper - apropos , in hyperbole from http://www.beopen.com/
However , you can type C-h v , or C-h f then tab , to have the complete list of possible variable or function names , respectively .
Then click in the * completion * buffer that should have appeared and do an i-search C-s using for your keyword .
This also lets you inspect what values are currently set .
If you 're running NT Emacs and want to use the Cygwin port of ispell [ 1 ] together with the German and Swiss dictionaries by Bjoern Jacke ( he got them from Heinz Knutzen ) , here is the info you need .
The key is to get the binary distribution and install it , then get the source distribution , add #define MASKBITS 64 to local.h and run make programs ( the other targets fail , that 's why I need the binary distribution as well ) .
Copy the programs into whatever directory you keep the stuff from the binary distribution .
Now you can get the German and Swiss dictionaries by Bjoern and run make there ( no problem as soon as you have the MASKBITS stuff ) , and copy the .hash and .aff files into wherever the binary distribution puts them .
Into you .emacs , put the following lisp code .
It is copied from the deutsch8 entry .
If you want other command line options and word boundaries , just take another entry from ispell - dictionary - alist as a template .
( add - to - list ' ispell - dictionary - alist '( " german " " [ a- zA - Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374 ] " " [ ^a-zA - Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374 ] " " [ ' ] " t ( " - C " " - d " " german " ) " ~latin1 " iso - 8859 -1 ) ) ( add - to - list ' ispell - dictionary - alist ' ( " swiss " " [ a- zA - Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374 ] " " [ ^a-zA - Z\304\326\334\344\366\337\374 ] " " [ ' ] " t ( " - C " " - d " " swiss " ) " ~latin1 " iso - 8859 - 1 ) )
I just installed the Portuguese dictionary for ispell from http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell-dictionaries.html and had to add the following entry to ispell - dictionary - alist :
( add - to - list ' ispell - dictionary - alist '( " portugues " " [ a- zA - Z\301\302\311\323\340\341\342\351\352\355\363\343\372 ] " " [ ^a-zA - Z\301\302\311\323\340\341\342\351\352\355\363\343\372 ] " " [ ' ] " t ( " - C " " - d " " portugues " ) " ~latin1 " iso - 8859 -1 ) )
If you want to display Japanese fonts , you should have MULE & LEIM support compiled in to Emacs .
It may help to look at japanese.el & canna.el .
You will also need to have Japanese fonts installed .
You can put -*- coding : foo ; -*- in the first line of the file ( into a LaTeX comment , for instance ) , for the right value of foo .
You can use file - coding - system - alist to tell Emacs about the right coding system based on the file name .

Move all files in ~emacs / lisp / which do not end with '.el ' or '.elc ' .
Furthermore , move all files which end with '.el ' if a corresponding ' .elc ' file exists .
Do this for all subdirectories as well .
You can also move all files from the doc directory except for the DOC * files .

Let me introduce for you the first in our series of “ Only in Japan ” videos , made by two professional screenwriter / directors while they were living in Tokyo .
Simon Adams ( who provided a previous article as a guest writer ) , and Andrew Johnson were pleased to offer us the “ exclusive ” internet screening rights ( yeah right .. ) to their vids for stippy.com .
We will introduce one “ Only in Japan ” video every week , for the next 4 or 5 weeks , so come back soon ..!
For those who have been to Japan ( or are stuck here like us ) , you surely would n’t have missed the bicycle parking area attendants ( job description : bike mover ) , who swarm upon weary cyclists who dare to enter their mama - chari domains – there is no escaping them .
Bicycle parking attendants took a stronghold in Japan after the 「自転車の安全利用の促進及び自転車等の駐車対策の総合的推進に関する法律」( quite a mouthful for a law about bike parking lots ! ) was introduced in 1981 .
This video is a funny parody of these dedicated ojisans , who guard the bike parking areas of all kinds of facilities , from shopping centres and universities to community halls and kindergartens , and every other area where cycles tend to cluster .
These angry おっさん who follow this strange career path are the first target for our “ Only in Japan ” video series .

Ira Glunts sends the following :
In its lead story August 1 , the Hebrew edition of Ha’aretz online reported that the Israeli Defense Force ( IDF ) claim that Hezbollah missile launchers and Hezbollah fighters were in and around the building in Qana which they shelled early Sunday morning was false .
Oddly , this article , which points to Israeli culpability and recklessness in what some are calling the IDF ’s second massacre in Qana ( the first was in 1996 ) , has been largely ignored in the international press .
According to the newspaper , the IDF “ decided to attack houses in a specific radius of a place that was used in the past to launch missiles . ”
The article states that the tactic of choosing buildings as targets that are near areas from which rockets were launched in the past has been used before .
Initially , Israeli military sources had reported that the deaths in Qana where caused not by the Israeli air attack early Sunday morning , but by an accidental explosion , many hours later , of Hezbollah ordnance that was stored inside the building .
According to the Ha’aretz article , this is not true .
Israeli Air Force sources have admitted , according to Ha’aretz , that the deaths in Qana were caused by the Israeli shelling .
Between 30 and 60 deaths were reported as a result of the building collapse .
Many bodies are still believed to be buried beneath the rubble .
Additionally , the claim of the IDF that leaflets were dropped on the weekend warning of an attack were also untrue .
The leaflets were actually delivered “ some days ” before the weekend , according to military sources .
Fun with call / cc ( was RE : [ Python - Dev ] Stackless Python - Pros and Cons )
[ Tim ] >
On the one hand , I do n't think I know of a language * not* based > on Scheme that has call / cc ( or a moral equivalent ) .
[ Jeremy Hylton ] > ML also has call / cc , at least the Concurrent ML variant .
So it does !
I 've found 3 language lines that have full - blown call / cc ( not counting the early versions of REBOL , since they took it out later ) , and at least one web page claiming " that 's all , folks " : 1 . Scheme + derivatives ( but not including most Lisps ) .
2 . Standard ML + derivatives ( but almost unique among truly functional languages ) : http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/doc/SMLofNJ/pages/cont.html
That page is pretty much incomprehensible on its own .
Besides callcc ( no " / " ) , SML - NJ also has related " throw " , " isolate " , " capture " and " escape " functions .
At least some of them * appear * to be addressing Kent Pitman 's specific complaints about the excruciating interactions between call / cc and unwind - protect in Scheme .
3 . Unlambda .
This one is a hoot !
Do n't know why I have n't bumped into it before :
http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/madore/programs/unlambda/
" Your Functional Programming Language Nightmares Come True " Unlambda is a deliberately obfuscated functional programming language , whose only data type is function and whose only syntax is function application : no lambdas ( or other " special forms " ) , no integers , no lists , no variables , no if / then / else , ... call / cc is spelled with the single letter " c " in Unlambda , and the docs note " expressions including c function calls tend to be hopelessly difficult to track down .
This was , of course , the reason for including it in the language in the first place " .
Not all frivolous , though !
The page goes on to point out that writing an interpreter for Unlambda in something other than Scheme exposes many of the difficult issues ( like implementing call / cc in a language that does n't have any such notion -- which is , after all , almost all languages ) , in a language that 's otherwise relentlessly simple - minded so does n't bog you down with accidental complexities .
Does n't mean call / cc sucks , but language designers * have * been avoiding it in vast numbers -- despite that the Scheme folks have been pushing it ( & pushing it , & pushing it ) in every real language they flee to < wink > .
BTW , lest anyone get the wrong idea , I'm ( mostly ) in favor of it !
It can't possibly be sold on any grounds other than that " it works , for real Python programmers with real programming problems they can't solve in other ways " , though .
Christian has been doing a wonderful ( if slow - motion < wink > ) job of building that critical base of real - life users .
UPDATE : This advice is a bit outdated and only applied back when I was hosting Seaside on Windows servers ( which I advise against ) , see Scaling Seaside Redux Enter the Penguin for more up to date advice .
I 've been busy with non Seaside projects lately , but one of the things I have squeezed in was a bit of configuration to make Seaside scale better .
I was having some performance problems when more than a few sessions were running concurrently and after discussing the issue on the Seaside developers list , Avi popped in from DabbleDB and told us the way to scale was load balance many VMs with a few sessions running on each .
So I had to read up a bit on the issue and learn what to do .
It turns out one of the best ways to learn about scaling Seaside is to read about scaling Ruby on Rails .
The architecture for scaling both is pretty much the same .
Ruby developers use a web server called Mongrel , a light weight single threaded server that works well with Rails but is n't a heavy duty web server like Apache .
This is much the same position Seaside is in with Comanche , though not single threaded , the Squeak VM can't take advantage of multiple processors and does n't do well with too many concurrent connections .
UPDATE : I neglected to mention one major requirement of Seaside , your load balancer must support sticky sessions .
Seaside uses sessions heavily and does not support the shared nothing approach where every request can hit a different server .
This is n't an issue unique to Seaside , many frameworks use sessions and must deal with this .
Other frameworks handle such issues either by sticking a session to a server , or by having a shared session cache that all the servers can access , such as memcached or a sql server .
Currently , to the best of my knowledge , no one has externalized Seaside sessions in this manner , so sticky sessions is the only viable approach .
The solution for both is quite simple really , setup a heavier duty web server / load balancer ( Apache / LiteHttpd ) to serve up static content , and load balance and proxy connections to a farm of light weight application servers ( Mongrel / Comanche ) running on other ports .
I 'm actually using an F5 as my front end load balancer , but Apache has all the necessary features including the ability to create pools of virtual servers which it will load balance requests across with its new mod_proxy .
One only need Google scaling Rails to find many examples of detailed setup information and articles for such a setup , so I wo n't repeat it here .
I will mention that neither Mongrel or Comanche are anywhere near as rock solid stable as Apache , so one thing you 'll want when having a setup like this to ensure maximum uptime is a process running to poll all of your servers to ensure they are n't hung up for any reason .
UPDATE : I do n't want to imply Comanche is unstable , it is very rare that a service needs reset , I only do this because it " can " happen , not because it happens a lot .
Seaside is very stable and under normal conditions , does n't crash .
Here 's a little bash script I found somewhere that makes checking a site for a specific response string simple and easy to use from the command line allowing you to easily schedule some scripts to reset any hung processes .
Oh , I use cygwin on all my servers so I can have a decent Unix command line on my Windows servers .
checkSite.sh UPDATE :
This script eventually freaks out Windows and causes random network errors because lynx somehow eats up network resources .
Do n't use it , Seaside is quite stable without it .
#!/bin/bash if [ $ # - lt 2 ] ; then exit fi URL=$ 1 findText = $ 2 lynx - dump - error_file= / tmp/x$ $
$ URL 2>/ dev/null | grep " $findText " &>/ dev/null if [ $ ? != 0 ] ; then echo WARNING : Specified search text was not found fi stcode=`awk '/ STATUS / {print $ 2} ' / tmp/x$ $ 2>/ dev/null` if [ $ ? != 0 ] ; then echo site is down fi for code in $ stcode do case $ code in 200 ) echo OK ; ; 302 ) echo redirecting awk - F/ '/ URL / {print " " , $ 3} ' / tmp / x $ $ ; ; *) echo $ code esac done if [ -f / tmp /x$$ ] ; then rm / tmp / x$ $ fi
Then I use this in another script built specifically to monitor instances of my Seaside app .
Though this could be more generic , I have n't bothered yet because I only have one Seaside site in production to worry about .
checkSeaside.sh
echo " $ 1 $ 2 $ 3... " sh checkSite.sh http://$1:$3/seaside/someApp
" Some Required Text " | grep WARNING &>/ dev/null if [ $ ? = 0 ] ; then echo " restarting $ 2 on $ 1 " psservice \\\\ $ 1 restart " $ 2 " >/dev/null #NT util to restart services on remove machines echo " Restarting $ 1 $ 2 " | wsendmail -- - CGI - Ssome.mail.server.com \ - s " App Monitor reset $ 1 $ 2 " someEmail@someAddress.com - Fmonitor@someAddress.com - P1 fi
Then on each web server , I 'm running a pool of 10 instances of Seaside setup as services and ensuring they 're up by scheduling a simple batch file with the windows task scheduler .
monitorSomeApp.cmd
@echo off bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service1 " 3001 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service2 " 3002 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service3 " 3003 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service4 " 3004 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service5 " 3005 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service6 " 3006 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service7 " 3007 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service8 " 3008 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service9 " 3009 bash checkSeaside.sh serverName " Some Service10 " 3010
Yea , I 'm mixing and matching bash and dos scripts , so sue me !
Anyway , the setup works great , I 'm running 30 instances of Squeak across 3 servers and these scrips ensure they 're always up and responding , and reset them and email me if they go down for any reason .
Response time is now much better and I can fully take advantage of the multiple processors on the web boxes .
My process is n't nearly as fancy as Avi's ( he 's dynamically bringing images up and down based on the host header ) , but balancing the connections across a bunch of fixed sized pools works well .
I started with 10 processes per box , just for the hell of it , but I 'll increase or decrease the size of the pool as load dictates to eventually find the sweet spot for the pool size .
For now , 10 per box works , I 've got plenty of spare ram .
Of course , doing a setup like this means you 'll need to automate your deployment process for new code as well .
So far this mean keeping a master image I upgrade with new code and test , then a script to take down each process , copy the image file over the old one , and bring the process back up .
Seems
Avi's doing the same thing , works pretty well so far .
A POINT OF VIEW
By Clive James
Just the facts , Jack Anti-terror agent Jack Bauer routinely beats vital clues out of suspects in TV thriller 24 .
But West Point military academy has asked 24's makers to tone down the torture , worried that cadets might identify too strongly with his anti-terror tactics .
Somewhere in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles , there is a nondescript building where the giant creative brains get together who are responsible for creating the TV show 24 .
The show stars Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer , the counter - terrorist who has only one day , spread over 24 episodes , each an hour long , to stave off the latest threat to civilisation mounted by terrorists whose sole trace of human consideration is their willingness to mount threats that will exactly fit the production company 's format of 24 hour - long episodes ( minus time for commercials ) .
Richly rewarded in their task by a huge flow of international revenue and the admiration of ultra - right - wing boneheads everywhere who think the show is an educational tool , the masterminds who produce 24 have been having a more than usually good time recently , because their show , which has always been prominent in the TV preview pages wherever it screens in the world , is now in the news pages as well .
Alert to any ticking threat , Bauer would drive a Humvee through your bedroom wall to disarm your alarm clock
Clive James
Hear Radio 4's A Point of View
The news stories focus on the show 's alleged fondness for torture scenes in which counter - terrorist Bauer extracts from the terrorists the necessary information to disarm the ticking atomic bomb or the ticking bio -war canister or whatever else is ticking .
Alert to any ticking threat , Bauer would drive a Humvee through your bedroom wall to disarm your alarm clock .
Bauer does n't really want to torture the heavies , but he has to or else the microbe bomb will go off right there in Los Angeles and there will be no more seasons of 24 - or hope for mankind .
In some scenes Bauer has to get ruthless and grit his teeth even more than usual - and there 's another question .
How hard can an actor grit his teeth before they shatter ?
Kiefer Sutherland 's father had long teeth even when he was young , but he merely bared them , he did n't grit them .
Kiefer grits them to the point where you imagine a Ming vase in a vice .
When will they explode ?
Twenty - four hours from now ?
Licensed to torture
But back to the first question .
The torture scenes where Bauer has to get ruthless and grit his teeth even more than usual have always been a standard gimmick in 24 , but recently they 've been headline news because the West Point military academy has asked the producers of 24 to tone the torture theme down .
West Point cadets in a counter - terror class Apparently West Point cadets think the show represents their country 's real situation in a dangerous world , and they have started to envisage themselves as counter - terrorists first , soldiers second , giving scant thought to the exam question about what Custer should have done at the Little Big Horn , and looking forward instead to the first time when they will be obliged to grit their teeth and torture one or more ethnically - named terrorists in order to find - or locate , as the Americans say - the microbe bomb that will go off in 24 hours .
Even more disturbing than the possibility that officer cadets might be thinking like this is that the men they command may be thinking like this .
American troops are apparently surging into Iraq with DVDs of 24 stashed in their kit .
It was this last part that made my jaw drop .
You mean there are still people who actually care enough about 24 to carry a DVD of it ?
I thought that anyone with a brain in his head quit watching 24 after the first season , when it had already become clear that Jack Bauer 's daughter was going to go on getting kidnapped as often as she escaped .
Admittedly she was n't always kidnapped by exactly the same bunch of kidnappers , but that was what was so strange .
She would get away from one bunch of kidnappers and run towards another bunch of kidnappers .
Eventually you figured out that this was what united all the world 's terrorist groups , whatever their professed religious loyalties or political aims : the desire to kidnap Jack Bauer 's daughter .
People in the business of extracting information are united in the belief that pain is a clumsy inducement and that persuasion works better
Clive James
When it got to the point where Bauer could never pick up the phone without being told all over again that his daughter had been kidnapped , I gradually stopped watching 24 .
After half a dozen seasons had gone by , I was tuning in only for the final hour when Bauer , having determined the location of the anthrax missile after torturing everyone else in the cast who was still alive , arrived in slow - motion counterpoint against the last seconds of the countdown with his gritted teeth poised to cut the red wire instead of the blue wire , or the blue wire instead of the red wire .
But anyway it was bound to be the right wire because the information had been yielded to him along with the last agonised breath of the chief terrorist and therefore had to be true .
That last part is open to question even on the practical level .
People in the business of extracting information are united in the belief that pain is a clumsy inducement and that persuasion works better .
People questioned under torture will make up the wrong answer if they do n't know the right one .
And they can be quite resistant to torture , and even welcome it , if they think that the fact that you are torturing them proves that you are indeed the devil painted in their propaganda .
Extraordinary rendition
It really is a better plan to try proving to prisoners that they will eat better in your prison than they do at home .
The only conceivable circumstances when torture is the only way is when time is tight , and the creatively fertile writers of 24 have to invent those circumstances because the ticking clock scenario is unlikely in real life .
Terrorists usually take their time .
The real problem is with people who want to be torturers .
The shadow of abuse in Abu Ghraib looms large
These include nearly all terrorists , but they also include , unless we 're careful , far too many people in the home team .
Abu Ghraib under the Americans would have been regarded as paradise by anyone who was in the same place under Saddam Hussein , but it has to be faced that the soldiers who were subsequently convicted of abuse were n't alone in their dumb eagerness to turn up for work there .
There is always a supply of sadists in any army .
The thing to avoid is creating the demand .
Instructive , then , that West Point does n't want the maniacs to be encouraged .
When democratic states favour torture , either directly by themselves or indirectly by rendition - a fancy word for handing over people you suspect of loathing you to people you know you loathe - it not only destroys the credibility of any claim you might have had to be defending a value , it also encourages the formation of a gung - ho , pseudo - realist , would - be - warrior caste that thinks that ruthless is not just permitted , but desirable , in order to rule by fear .
But rule by fear works only if it 's total .
In the old Soviet Union , a regime that did rule by fear right to the end , there would have been no question of the Red Army politely asking a Moscow television station to tone down its 24 - part show about Janko Baurovitch torturing the captured CIA agent in order to locate the nerve gas capsule buried under Red Square .
The state would simply have declared its will .
The US , despite what its countless enemies think , is not a state that can simply declare its will , which is the very reason why we are n't wasting our time when we vocalise our scorn after Vice President Dick Cheney 's wife plays hostess to the creators of 24 as if they were a school of philosophers .
Copycat
For the US , flirtation with torture would be a terrible strategy simply for the way it squanders the last of the goodwill that the Americans still had going for them at the end of WWII when the Germans surrendered in their direction .
Even the Japanese got the point instantly when the first stick of gum appeared .
Inside Abu Ghraib
In the US there has always been torture on the screen , both large and small .
In NYPD Blue , a genuine television creation in a way that 24 conspicuously is n't , Andy Sipowicz routinely battered the truth out of the villains .
Whether what happens on the screen is a trigger for what happens in real life is a big question , but it turns out that even West Point thinks it might be .
West Point representatives , when they go to Los Angeles to plead their case , have no weapon available to them except persuasion .
They are up against one of the many drawbacks of a free society , which would n't be free if it were n't full of things we did n't like .
In a free society , creative types are free to explore possibilities .
One of the possibilities that the 24 masterminds feel free to explore is the possibility that a state based on legality might not be strong enough to defend itself .
The same possibility preoccupied Lincoln .
The question might never be settled .
But the question about torture was settled more than 200 years ago , by Montesquieu .
The first great exponent of multiculturalism , Montesquieu hailed its variety as a fact but also saw its drawback as an ideology .
He could quite see that torture might be functional in some cultures , but he said it was wrong in all of them .
So it is , and we 'll just have to find another way of getting at the truth if we are to foil the most frightening plan of the Universal Blessed Jihad against Jack Bauer 's Daughter - to develop a microbe bomb that will blow up in 23 hours .
Thanks for your comments .
24 is a great TV show and is designed like a lot of shows to draw an audience by being controversial and shocking .
It 's perfect junk TV , that does n't attempt to teach us right from wrong , simply to provide an hour of entertainment .
Claire Knowles , Cornwall , UK Great discussion about torture .
The one point which is seemingly not raised in the whole " War on terror " and extraordinary measures debate , is that torture is not an effective way to get to the truth .
Torture is only a method of showing superiority and power over people .
Chris , Nazareth , Israel Clive , it 's a TV show that provides entertainment to the politically - moronic and educated alike .
It is written to be suspenseful and , more importantly , to make Fox televison lots of money .
I do n't think it would have the same appeal if Jack Bauer was trying to extract vital information from terrorists with a pack of Juicy Fruit .
Go back to watching Poirot and leave the chin-dribbling machismo to the rest of us boneheads .
Mike , US Fascinating that people are so convinced that television has absolutely no effect on attitudes whatsoever .
Clearly , it does - it just is n't obvious and conscious .
What is on tv is what is culturally acceptable , especially when it 's run for several series , and it is a source of much conventional wisdom .
Add the idea that torture a ) works , and is b ) acceptable when your nation is under attack to the Milgram and Zimbardo experiments on the abuse of power , and you have a scary mix indeed .
Kaz , Macclesfield , UK
What a great article , it has left me with a very large smile on my face which in hindsight may well be perceived as a ghoulish enjoyment of all things within the torture domain .
But I can put your mind back in a state of ease as it's the Americans that again have provided me with much amusement .
West Point , I thought , taught people to become soldiers and is done ( as in this country ) by a stick regime of obedience , physical and mental exercise , and the learning of you specialised craft .
Surely if a TV program is able to interfere with this form of training it's not the program maker 's problem ; if the training being offered was direct and absolute there would be little chance of it being diluted by the media .
If this were to be the case then maybe we should show the American forces the back episodes of " the good life " , may give them the edge in rebuilding what they were so ready to destroy .
Steve , Glasgow I have never watched a full episode ; out of curiosity I did start to watch one episode part way through .
However , I found it unpalatable that someone with such a high profile ( such as Kiefer ) would jump on the bandwagon and become involved in anti-Muslim propaganda .
Perhaps I did n't do it ( 24 ) justice by watching only few minutes , but it came at a time when everything Muslim was being branded as being bad .
Nawaz , UK 24 is a ludicrous but addictively entertaining TV show which is watched by millions of non -" right - wing boneheads " everywhere .
Yes , a few stupid American military recruits will use it as a licence to do bad but the vast majority wo n't .
Anyone with a brain in their head might suggest that Clive James actually watched the show ( and not just half of series one ) so he could be better informed and not write such fatuous columns .
Another snobbish pseudo - intellectual having a cheap shot at America and popular culture .
It 's just a TV show .
N Murdoch , Scotland
The only serious questions I would raise would be directed more towards the boneheads who go around believing what they see on telly and copying such things .
These people simply require a reality check .
James Owen , Lancashire , UK Torture is a slippery slope and it separates the good guys from the bad .
When you use torture where do you stop , old men ?
women ?
children ?
At what age to you start ?
what level is acceptable .
Where do you stop .
What do you say to the innocent !
James Clarke , UK 24 happens to take examples from the real world and translate them to screen - not the other way round .
I doubt very much any one has watched 24 and been encouraged by terrorism .
24 has n't hidden away from the dubious nature of torture and has in fact questioned its use throughout the seasons - maybe if you carried on watching it you would have seen that , and also noted how Kim has been absent ( bar for three or so episodes in the last season ) .
Jack is never shown to enjoy the torture scenes and actually offers up more psychological questions than perhaps you are willing to read into it .
Paul Blakeley , Maidstone I 've often wondered of some branch of the US government is involved in producing the scripts for 24 .
This probably is n't the case , but an administration intent on building public support for the War on Terror could n't hope to produce better propaganda than 24 .
Maybe the writers just want a pat on the back from Bush .

What is most disturbing is the inability of many young people to be able to distinguish between fact and fiction .
Remember these young folk in the US Army are the same age as those at college who thought that the Lord of the Rings is historical fact ...

PEJ News Coverage Index Feb. 4 - 9 , 2007
On February 9 , about 24 hours after the death of Anna Nicole Smith , CNN curmudgeon Jack Cafferty was reading viewer emails complaining about non -stop cable coverage of that story — and agreeing with them .
“ That ’s the only story we reported [ yesterday ] for two solid hours and we were n’t the only ones , ” growled Wolf Blitzer ’s “ Situation Room ” sidekick .
“ Her death was tabloid gold and apparently , we just could n’t help ourselves . ”
“ I know a lot of people are complaining about that , ” said Blitzer , somewhat defensively .
“ But a lot of people are also watching . ”
For the first time this year , “ tabloid gold ” fever seized at least some of the news media last week in a significant way , according to PEJ ’s News Coverage Index from February 4 to February 9 .
Though it only made up two days of coverage , the sudden death of the Playmate turned heiress turned reality star was the No. 3 story in the news last week , almost edging out a bloody week in Iraq .
And that may be understating the feel of the coverage .
The bosomy blonde ’s demise consumed a staggering 50 % of the cable newshole PEJ examined on February 8 and 9 .
Those are levels reminiscent of those pre-9/11 celebrity sagas — think Princess Di and JFK Jr .
The story lines ran from police procedural to racy , with a little bit of moralizing about celebrity culture — what killed her , who fathered her infant , and where her money would go .
The February 9 headline in the New York Post , “ CSI Probe in Siren Shocker , ” seemed to sum it up .
Had it fallen more in the middle of the week , the Smith coverage , which made up 9 % of the newshole in just two days , would have doubtless knocked news of events in Iraq out of the No. 2 spot in the news ( at 10 % ) and come close to knocking out the debate at home over Iraq strategy as the No. 1 story of the week ( it made up 12 % ) .
It was enough to overshadow what had been a good tale of sex and almost murder that preceded it — news that diaper - clad astronaut Lisa Nowak allegedly tried to kill a romantic rival .
Nowak still made the Index ’s top five story list ( 6 % ) .
Coverage of the 2008 White House race , which got a boost from Rudy Giuliani ’s statement of candidacy , was the fourth biggest story at 8 % .
PEJ ’s News Coverage Index is a study of the news agenda of 48 different outlets from five sectors of the media .
( See a List of Outlets . )
It is designed to provide news consumers , journalists and researchers with hard data about what stories and topics the media are covering , the trajectories of major stories and differences among news platforms .
( See Our Methodology . )
On some levels , the Nowak and Smith stories had elements in common .
They were both female celebrities , and both tragedies conjured up human frailties such as lust , infidelity , and possibly , criminal behavior .
But the nature of the celebrity and the level of it may reflect something about the culture .
Smith , who was famous for nudity , marrying an octogenarian millionaire , and being involved in sordid paternity suits , was the much bigger celebrity .
Nowak , an astronaut and engineer , was virtually unknown until her infamy last week .
( And like her life , Smith ’s death became an exercise in paparazzi - commercialism .
A video of EMTs trying to revive her , which reportedly sold for more than a half million , quickly circulated online . )
In both cases , the media coverage purported to justify the intensity of the coverage by looking for deeper meaning behind the stories .
In the Nowak situation , the angle that quickly emerged was whether NASA was properly training and evaluating its astronauts .
“ NASA has never seen a story like this , ” declared Katie Couric , introducing CBS ’s February 6 newscast by characterizing the case as a “ bizarre story that has left some people wondering about how astronauts are screened . ”
A New York Times February 7 front page story wondered “ whether the ‘ Right Stuff ’ image of astronauts has been tarnished , or if that image somehow confused technical excellence with emotional stability . ”
In the Smith case , that deeper angle seemed more self - conscious and more guilt - ridden .
Why were we so intrigued by a woman who , as MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann put it , is “ principally famous merely for being famous ? ”
On her February 8 evening show , CNN ’s Paula Zahn proffered as an answer the theory that this was a case of “ America ’s fixation on celebrity , on tragedy , on sex , money , tabloid headlines and death . ”
Olbermann himself asked “ Access Hollywood ” correspondent Tony Potts : “ Why has her death seemed to resonate so loudly ?
What …was she actually famous for ? ”
“ Two words , Keith .
I would say ‘ Marilyn Monroe , ’ ” Potts responded , conjuring up comparisons to another troubled blonde bombshell who died under mysterious circumstances , but only after a much more significant acting career than Smith’s .
That angle was indeed repeatedly conjured up in the images oft replayed , her Marilyn poses , her Marilyn hair , and now her Marilyn - like death .
The pictures aired over and over as cable anchors waited for the slightest hint of new details , which were scarce in coming .
On the Fox News Channel , Bill O’Reilly led his February 8 show by claiming not to understand the fascination with Smith , who he called “ a tabloid queen … I ’m looking at her and seeing a media creation . ”
O’Reilly ’s guest , entertainment writer Jeanne Wolf , responded that Smith ’s fame was largely a result of her rags to riches ( or at least contested riches ) story that was “ part of the American fantasy . ”
That fantasy , however , was explored more heavily on cable news than elsewhere .
For the week , her death consumed 21 % of cable airtime–more than any other story .
In the programs .
it examined accounted for about 50 reports or stories on the February 8 and 9 prime - time shows .
Nowak ’s story , in contrast , was spread widely through the Index ’s five media sectors ( in online , network TV , and radio , the astronaut generated more coverage than the bombshell ) .
A look at the coverage also suggests that some elite mainstream media outlets were more comfortable giving major play to the astronaut story than to Smith ’s soap opera .
Unlike a number of papers , the New York Times did not yield space on page 1 for Smith ’s death .
And though it was covered on all three major networks , the story was positioned well down in the evening newscasts .
Nowak ’s arrest , conversely , was the first story on the CBS newscast and the second story on NBC ’s on February 6 .
It also made PBS ’s “ NewsHour . ”
On February 8 , NBC anchor Brian William ’s momentarily teased Smith ’s demise at the top of the newscast before moving to an interview with his network colleague , Tim Russert , who had just testified in the Scooter Libby trial .
When Williams finally got to the Smith piece about 10 minutes later , he added a touch of moralizing about one of those stories the media feel compelled to both cover and apologize for .
“ This may say a lot about our current culture of celebrity and media these days , when all the major cable news networks switched over to non-stop live coverage this afternoon when word arrived that Anna Nicole Smith had died , ” he said , a bit disapprovingly .
Even in a week of such Anna Nicole mania , the war in Iraq remained a media priority .
The debate over Iraq strategy was the biggest story for the fourth time in six weeks .
Yet the situation on the ground in Iraq ( at 10 % ) generated its highest level of overall coverage and was the leading story in both the newspaper and online sectors .
Coverage of that subject was fueled by the horrific February 3 Baghdad bombing that took more than 130 lives as well as questions being raised about the continuing loss of American helicopters flying over Iraq ( which included a new video of insurgents shooting down a chopper . )
The presidential campaign was a top five story for the fourth straight week .
The big news was that Republicans finally attracted as much media attention as their Democratic rivals thanks to Rudy Giuliani ’s Feb. 5 statement of candidacy .
While leading in GOP polls , Giuliani triggered plenty of coverage wondering whether his views on issues such as abortion and gay rights were too liberal for the Republican Party base .
And for the fourth time in six weeks , bad weather — this time mostly in the east — was a top 10 subject , finishing sixth at 3 % .
But neither heavy snowfall nor numbing freezes packed the power of the tabloid tornado that swirled around Anna Nicole Smith last week .

How Do You Say Your Name ?
People often ask how to pronounce my name in English context and I can't blame you - it 's tough to do as it originally has plenty of Russian - specific letters and sounds ( do n't get me wrong , I had to correct plenty of Russian documents to fix the misspellings too ) .
As a result , I created an English pronounciation which is hopefully not as hard .
And I use it myself every day so do n't feel bad about it .
New technology may force TV ad viewing SAN JOSE , Calif . 
In this era of easy ad skipping with TiVo - like video recorders , could television viewers one day be forced to watch commercials with a system that prevents channel switching ?
Yes , according to Royal Philips Electronics .
A patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office says researchers of the Netherland - based consumer electronics company have created a technology that could let broadcasters freeze a channel during a commercial , so viewers would n't be able to avoid it .
The pending patent , published on March 30 , says the feature would be implemented on a program - by - program basis .
Devices that could carry the technology would be a television or a set - top - box .
Philips acknowledged , however , that the anti-channel changing technology might not sit well with consumers and suggested in its patent filing that consumers be allowed to avoid the feature if they paid broadcasters a fee .
On Wednesday , company officials issued a statement that noted the technology also enables the opposite : allowing viewers to watch television without advertising .
The intention was never to force viewers to watch ads against their will , the company said of the technology .
" We developed a system where the viewer can choose , at the beginning of a movie , to either watch the movie without ads , or watch the movie with ads , " the company stated .
" It is up to the viewer to take this decision , and up to the broadcaster to offer the various services . "
The company also said it had no plans to use the technology in any of its products .
Philips wanted to provide the technology and seek the patent only as part of the broader developments within the industry , Philips spokesman Andre Manning said .

BBC , The World Tonight , Mirpur
People in the UK are proud their families originate from Mirpur
In a small village , in the foothills of the Himalayas , a group of men are discussing the challenges faced by Pakistanis when they go and live in the UK .
Should they integrate ?
How much should they take on the values of their new homeland ?
We are several thousand miles from Bradford and Birmingham .
But nearly everyone here has a relative in Britain .
And the debate there about multiculturalism has clear echoes round this table .
" The people who leave are in the middle , " Mowman says .
" They can not become like the British , but they have lost their own culture . "
He complains that his cousins in Rotherham are uneducated , and above all , that they have lost the most precious thing they have : a tight family structure .
Mistake
" Here we obey the head of the house .
There , they are independent .
It does not work . "
Tariq feels these differences more acutely than most .
He grew up here , in the village of Boha , and went to the UK as a teenager .
Now he is back visiting relatives .
" I used to say I would never have an arranged marriage .
But then I grew up and began to think how much my mum and dad had done for me , and I thought they would not make a mistake on this . "
What about his own children , now living in Nottingham - would he let them choose their spouses ?
Yes , of course , whoever they want .
What if they wanted to marry a non-Muslim , I ask ?
The very idea makes him look anxious .
He says , he would " interrupt " the process .
Around half the Pakistanis living in Britain can trace their origins to this tiny area of Pakistani - administered Kashmir .
Mirpur District was the site of a huge dam , built in the 1960s , which flooded the surrounding farmland .
A British company involved in the construction , compensated those who lost their homes by arranging permits for them to emigrate to the UK .
Deals negotiated
Since then , hundreds of thousands more have followed .
If you want to understand the culture of Pakistanis in Britain , you have to understand Mirpur .
I did not go anywhere I could meet English people
Rashid , speaking in Mirpur after returning from the UK
It is conservative , even by Pakistani standards .
Rural life here has not changed much over the years .
And families are not only a source of rigid hierarchies , but also the guiding influence behind everything from marriage to business .
Alliances are built , deals negotiated , all with an eye to how this affects relations between the different households .
Mirpur retains strong links with the UK
I asked Rashid if he had experienced any difficulty adjusting from this , when he went to work in the Midlands and East London for eight years , selling cosmetics and serving in a restaurants .
" No trouble at all , " he said .
" It was all a pleasure . "
But it turned out that he faced no challenges to his values , because he never mixed with anyone who lacked them .
Cultural difference
Rashid reckoned that 80 % of his customers in Britain had been Mirpuris , the rest from other sub -continental backgrounds .
He is a sociable man , lively and entertaining .
But he never made a single white , British friend the whole time he was there .
" I regret it , " he says , " but there was no chance .
I did not go anywhere I could meet English people . "
It is one way to avoid the difficulties of confronting cultural difference - to avoid cross-cultural contact altogether .
And it seems to be the route taken by many people of Pakistani origin .
There are statistics which suggest that of all communities , Pakistanis live in the most segregated areas of Britain , and their children attend the most segregated schools .
The British government has dedicated itself to integrating immigrants , providing some kind of shared identity to which everyone can sign up .
If they want to see how great the challenge is , they might start by visiting Mirpur .
The World Tonight is running a series of reports by Paul Moss on Pakistan - from Wednesday , 29 November , at 2200GMT .
The most basic comment is a question :
Who is this guy ?
If you follow the leads , this Everest of electric - guitar virtuosity , like so many other online artifacts , turns out to be a portal into a worldwide microculture , this one involving hundreds of highly stylized solo guitar videos , of which funtwo’s is but the most famous .
And though they seem esoteric , they have surprising implications : for YouTube , the dissemination of culture , online masquerade and even the future of classical music .
JOHANN PACHELBEL , the great one - hit wonder of the baroque period , originally composed his Canon in D Major for three violins , at least one chord - playing instrument ( like a harpsichord or lute ) and at least one bass instrument ( like a cello or bassoon ) .
With its steady walking rhythm , the piece is well suited to processionals , and the bass line is extremely easy to play , a primer on simple chords : D , A , B minor , F - sharp minor , G. A sequence of eight chords repeats about 30 times .
The exacting part is the canon itself : a counterpoint played over the bass , originally by the three violins .
The first violin plays variation A , then moves on to B , while the second violin comes in with A .
By the time the first violin gets to C , the second starts in with B , and the third violin comes in with A : like three people singing “ Row , Row , Row Your Boat . ”
With 28 variations , the piece becomes supercharged with complexity only to revert to a simpler structure as it ends .
If you had n’t heard it a thousand times before — in the movie “ Ordinary People , ” in commercials , at all those weddings — it might blow you away .
Last year Jerry Chang , a Taiwanese guitarist who turns 25 on Thursday , set out to create a rock version of the song , which he had been listening to since childhood .
It took him two weeks .
Others , like Brian Eno , had done so before him , and some listeners say his arrangement is derivative of one composed for the video game “ Pump It Up . ”
But one way or another , his version , “ Canon Rock , ” rocked .
Ondiep , a working class neighbourhood in the Dutch town of Utrecht , is in turmoil .
After the death last Sunday of Rinie Mulder , a 54 - year old indigenous Dutchman who was shot by a police officer , non-immigrant citizens went on a rampage , burning cars , looting shops and arsoning a community centre in “ inverted Paris style riots . ”
According to our sources the police officer who killed Mulder is a woman of Moroccan origin .
The Ondiep residents have been complaining for months about harassment and intimidation by immigrant youths of Moroccan origin .
The Dutch mainstream media do not go into much detail about what is going on .
Most of them do not mention the ethnicity of the victim and the police officer , though the riots clearly have an ethnic nature .
Apparently Mulder intervened when Muslim youths harassed a pregnant native Dutch woman .
He was able to grab the knife of one of the youths .
When the police arrived Mulder was shot because he had raised the knife .
Witnesses say Mulder was indicating to the police that he had called for them .
Locals claim the police has failed to protect them for years .
They say the authorities are afraid of the immigrants and tolerate their criminal behaviour .
After the death of Mulder the indigenous Dutch decided they had had enough and started riots which went on for two continuous nights .
The police made 130 arrests : 60 of them are Ondiep residents .
According to the mainstream media the others are mainly “ football hooligans ” from other parts of the country .
Annie Brouwer - Korf , the Socialist mayor of Utrecht , has ordered Ondiep to be sealed off from the rest of town to keep non-residents out .
She expressed some sympathy for the frustrated Ondiep residents .
“ I understand that residents are sometimes upset about the nuisance around their own house and neighbourhood .
That does you no good whatsoever . ”
The riots are no surprise .
As I wrote last January :
The Netherlands are bracing themselves for more [ Parisian style ] incidents this year .
An official report published last week states that the Government has seriously underestimated “ tensions between various ethnic and cultural groups of youths . ”
The report says that the Dutch authorities fail to grasp the gravity of the problem .
If nothing is done the country will soon witness situations similar to the French riots of 2005 and 2006 which led to the police abandoning immigrant suburbs to gangs of Muslim youths .
The result of the French ambivalence is that the same gangs have now taken over effective control of more than 750 French urban neighborhoods .
Ondiep is one of the Dutch urban neighbourhoods which seem to have been abandoned by the authorities .
It is hardly a surprise that the natives are beginning to fight back .
The same thing happened recently in Britain .
Say No To SEO Contests & Black Hat SEO Methods
I came across an SEO contest , which is rather a bizarre online event .
Why do people waste their time on black hat approaches to gain search ranking ?
Why do they engage in such bad online experiments ?
In the world of online business , there ’s such a thing as “ SEO ” or “ search engine optimization ” .
It ’s an important element required to make money online .
The more you know about this aspect of the online world , the better equipped you are for possible success as an online publisher .
Now I stumbled upon this rather strange sight ( pun intended ) the other day and I was n’t quite sure what it meant .
This was a blog that I thought was in some foreign language that I was unfamiliar with , or maybe I was just dense and this was beyond my intellectual capacity to comprehend .
But no , I stumbled upon another curiosity birthed by cyberspace — an SEO contest .
What were some people doing ?
They were trying to win money by gaming the search engines .
For the chance to win anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand in cash and prizes , you can join this contest which allows you to show off how skilled you are with Search Engine Optimization , the practice of rigging your website or weblog so that your site ranks well in search engines .
The main focus of optimization is for a site owner to attempt to get a high page rank in a web environment for a given set of keywords , using various methods such as keyword utilization .
However , many webmasters turn to terribly desperate measures such as keyword stuffing , spamming or outright plagiarism of the exact same posts .
Let ’s look at a few aspects of this set up :
Why SEO Contests & Black Hat Methods Are A Waste Of Time
Here are some reasons why SEO contests suck .
1 . They do n’t make sense .
Just take a look at how lame this looks .
It ’s gibberish , plain and simple .
As a first - time beholder of such an event , I got curious about how seriously some people took the experience .
Then again , this is just another example of how the internet can be a means for some people — even the underhanded types — to exploit its vulnerabilities in order to make a buck .
Some of these contests involve using nonsensical phrases that are used by sites for ranking purposes .
Those who make it to the top of the ranks for these made up phrases end up winning .
What possesses people to spend their time fussing over their blogs and keyword stuffing the heck out of it ?
The same thing that consumes people to hang out in chat rooms , message boards and even to write in their blogs compulsively : the lure of the net , and in this case the lure of competition and perhaps the wish to win a bit of quick money .
Overseas , this money can mean a lot to people who live on little income .
2 . Black hat methods do n’t work over the long term .
These days , however , search engines are getting more sophisticated .
For instance , it ’s become more apparent that Google can identify those engaging in questionable tactics to try to spam the Internet with poor material and content .
Those who resort to cheating , stealing , spamming and fraud ( or scams ) wo n’t have much of a presence online for long .
They may find themselves in the ranks or SERPs for a wee bit of time , but eventually , they are cleared out and removed .
So do n’t bank on these methods to get you far ; your online reputation now matters a great deal to how well you will be found and perceived in the search world and other online communities .
My suggestion to all publishers is this : STOP making shortcuts .
You ’ll make better money by attending to an online business that is legitimate and respected .
Build an online reputation and stick to honest practices , and you should do better .

Even before Mr. Ayers realized that his ambition was to go into business for himself , he said he was always conscious of the relationships he was building with his cafeteria patrons and the suppliers and vendors , which he plans to use as crucial help getting his venture off the ground .
A master chef in Rhode Island told him years ago that networking was the most important thing in the restaurant business , Mr. Ayers recalled .
" He said , ' You never know when that milkman is going to own his own dairy and be in the position to give you a price break . " '
Mr. Ayers has worked at expensive restaurants and middle - brow chains , cooked privately for families and ran the prepared foods department at a Whole Foods Market .
But it is his Google friends -- lawyers , business development professionals , engineers and financial experts -- that he expects to draw on most of all .
Born in Chicago and raised in Brooklyn , N.Y. , Mr. Ayers had a varied résumé even before he started cooking for Google .
His love of music led to behind - the - scenes cooking jobs at various music festivals , and Google says on its Web site that Mr. Ayers formerly cooked for members of the Grateful Dead .
( It was after Jerry Garcia 's death , when the band dissolved , Mr. Ayers said . )
Dressed in flip - flops and cargo shorts , Mr. Ayers recently sat in the coffee bar of a Whole Foods Market near his home in Redwood City here , spinning his vision for his new restaurant , called Calafia ( based on a Mexican myth from which the state of California draws its name ) .
He said his inspiration came in equal parts from Whole Foods , McDonald 's and Starbucks .
He is looking for about 8,000 square feet of space in high - priced downtown Palo Alto , where other restaurants include Wolfgang Puck 's Spago and the Cheesecake Factory .
Mr. Ayers has invested $ 100,000 of his own money for start - up costs , and expects to raise $ 4 million from some former Google employees and private equity investment groups .
Another friend , a former doctor , is helping him write the business plan .
" Everything is handshakes at this point , " Mr. Ayers said of the possible financial arrangements .
" My lawyer is looking at the paperwork and trying to figure out who 's going to give me the best deal and allow me to have the most control . "
None of the would - be financial backers were willing to be identified in print .
In this second part various scientific studies about reserve growth in the United States , the North Sea and Russia are analysed .
The third part will look at the reliability of the estimate from the United States Geological Survey in their World Petroleum Assessment 2000 with respect to future reserve growth .
This post is the second part in a three piece series about the phenomenon of reserve growth in already found oil fields .
Insight in future reserve growth , which is often attributed to advancement in technology , is crucial in determining the peak of conventional oil production .
For those not familiar with reserve growth it would be best to read part 1 first :
What can we tell from reserve growth in the United States ?
The situation in the United States is quite unique in the world .
The country shows the largest amount of reserve growth over time in the entire world .
Soveral fields have grown ten to twenty times their original size .
The cause of this huge resreve growth is the reporting practice of operators , which report proven reserves only :
" In principle , US companies are expected to follow industry guidelines that define Proved ( described as having " reasonable certainty " in the SEC rules ) as having a 90 % probability of occurrence , but in practice it appears that their estimates come closer to the Mode value .
For the last 20 years , the amount of positive revisions reported by the US Department of Energy were double the negative values , meaning that the original estimates had a probability of around 66 % .
That is close to the Mode value , which in fact represents what the engineers consider the most likely .
The huge " field growth " of the United States is clearly a reporting phenomenon , as only 6 % of the additions over the past twenty years have come from new discoveries .
The rest - of - the - world reports Proved & Probable estimates , because the industry has a greater need to know what the fields will actually deliver when they plan costly offshore facilities or pipelines to remote areas .
It is worth discussing this critical issue in greater detail .
The SEC rules were formulated long ago when most US production was onshore , and required that reserves for financial purposes were restricted to those being drained by a producing well ..
Such onshore fields could be placed on production as soon as the first well was drilled , meaning that the reserves grew as the field was drilled up over time , in some cases tapping subsidiary reservoirs or new pools at greater or lesser depth or in the immediate vicinity .
In some cases , infill drilling was also undertaken changing the reserve estimates .
In the rest of the world , the reserves of a field are normally reported when production starts , the earlier estimates being held confidential by the company .
Host governments take an interest to ensure that good oilfield practices are used to maximize recovery , and in some cases revenue .
The companies accordingly have to compromise in their reporting between their general desire to under - report and the demands of the host government .
For these reasons , more valid estimates are reported , although still often as much as half what the field is eventually found to deliver .
" ( J. Laherrère , 2000 )
Because US operators are obliged to report very conservative proven reserves , a huge amount of reserve growth occurs .
This makes it very difficult to estimate whether reserve growth is due to technological advancement or not .
It is important to know that the Energy Information Administration makes an excellent division between added contributions from new discoveries , field extensions , new reservoirs discovered in old fields and changes in the reserve estimates of a given oil field .
This makes it possible to exclude the contribution from added Oil Initially in Place in estimating Reserve Growth of the United States .
One of the main studies on reserve growth in the U.S. has been done by Attanasi and Root ( The enigma of oil and gas field growth , AAPG Bulletin , 1994 ) .
The authors show that in the United States reserve growth keeps occuring , even in very old basins , based on proven reserves data from the Energy Information administration .
The chart below shows the data from the article divided between oil discoveries per decade .
It is clearly visible that most oil in the U.S. has been discovered in the '30s .
The data from Attanasi and Root shows that reserves grew with 26 billion barrels between 1977 and 1991 .
More recent data from the Energy Information Administration shows reserve growth of 22 billion barrels between 1977 and 1991 and 10 billion barrels between 1991 and 2005 .
Chart 1 - Source : Attanasi & Root , 1994 .
Reserve growth shown over time , dividede between discovery years .
Data series 1900 - 1909 shows reserve growth in fields discovered between 1900 - 1909 in the years from 1977 to 1991
Thanks to the excellent division from the EIA between reserve growth caused by growth in the Oil Initially In Place ( OIIP ) and growth in estimates for recoverable reserves , growth in OIIP can be canceled out from estimated reserve growth increases .
However , it is impossible to tell based on the data to what extent reserve growth is caused by operator underestimates of recoverable reserves due to the practice of proven reserves reporting or due to technological advancement caused the growth in reserves .
Nonetheless , the USGS concludes that technological advancement is the main driver in case of the U.S. :
" After 90 years of production , reserves continue to grow for both oil and gas .
As part of their study , attanasi and Root ( 1994 ) ...
Although the reserve growth in common fields , as shown above , is attributed primarily to water flood as well as to other EOR techniques [ enhanced oil recovery techniques ] , it is not large enough to offset the decline in the remaining proved oil resreves caused by the ongoing production from the existing fields ....
The application of EOR techniques has occured in only a limied numbers of fields to date .
Therefore , there is potential for additional resreves if EOR techniques are extended to other fields .
" ( USGS , 2000 )
By analysing single field cases better comprehension of the influence of technology on reserve growth can be gained .
Jean Laherrère has done analysis on several single fields in the U.S. and the North Sea .
By plotting cumulative production versus annual production a reliable estimate can be made of the ultimate oil recovery of the field .
Several of his examples are shown below :
Chart 2 - Source : J. Laherrère .
East Texas is the largest oilfield in Texas with an API of 37 degrees and 0.21 % sufur content .
Production started in 1930 , a water injection program began at the end of the '60s .
Due to the water injection program east texas ultimate recovery of reserves ( URR ) estimate was changed to 6 billion barrels .
This URR was held between 1975 and 1991 .
The URR changed back to the old estimate of 5.4 billion barrels in 1992 due to a sharp increase in the decline rate towards 10 % , leading to an ultimate production value of 5.4 billion barrels .
No increase in the recovery rate is apparent in the later life of this oil field , one of the largest in the U.S .
Chart 3 - Source : J. Laherrère .
Wilmington is an oil field discovered in 1932 in the Los Angeles Basin in southern California with an API between 13 and 25 degrees .
In 1965 a Waterflooding program started .
Due to subsidence ( a downward shift of the surface ) , the reservoir became unitised which caused a large increase in the production level , peaking in 1970 .
The ultimate recovery of reserves ( URR ) estimate was increased due to this change from 1.2 billion barrels to 2.5 billion barrels .
This estimate slowly increased towards 3 billion barrels in 2002 .
In a 2002 annual AAPG publication it was noted that an optimized waterflooding program and the application of horizontal wells had lead to a significant increase in proven reserves .
Jean Laherrère noted however that an Ultimate of 2.8 billion barrels could already have been established in 1972 .
His observation leads to the conclusion that neither horizontal wells nor steamflooding did increase the reserves of the oil field .
Reserve growth occured due to the natural change in the geology of the reservoir .

Yates is an oil field discovered in the 1920's in Texas with an API of 30 degrees .
After a gas injection program began , oil production sharply increased from 1975 to 1979 .
In 1984 production started to drop after a sharp plateau and continued to drop despite a Polymer flooding and a CO2 injection program .
Between 1993 and 1997 production slightly increased for a few years due to a steam & chemical flooding program , soon after this program decline started again .
The ultimate production will probably be 1.6 billion barrels .
Enhanced oil recovery programs appears to have slightly increased the recoverable reserves of this field .

Eugene Island is an oil field in the gulf of mexico discovered in 1971 with an API between 23 and 35 degrees .
The field has an expectional structure with one of the largest faults ( planar rock fractures , which show evidence of relative movement ) .
This large fault ( the red fault ) allowed the reservoir to fill rather quickly from the source rock after pressure dropped 24 years from initial production .
This exceptional structure caused a significant increase in reserves by reserve growth .
Technological advancement does not seem to play a large role here .
Details about the reservoir can be found in an article published in an AAPG journal available online .

Kern river is an oil field in california discovered in 1889 with an API of 13 degrees .
An interesting detail is that the field was discovered by a hand dug hole .
A nice graph showing the fields history is also available online .
Production of this heavy oil field was first managed by conventional techniques .
After 25 years production started to decline towards nearly zero in 1950 .
In 1961 water injection tests began in the reservoir , causing a slow by steady increase in production .
Quite soon a steam injection program is started which helped to increase the production of the field once more , topping at 140.000 barrels per day in 1980 .
Finally in 1999 the fields production starts to decline again .
This example shows that in unconventional heavy reservoirs the application of steam injection helped to increase the reserves of the field .

Midway Sunset is an oil field in california discovered in 1893 with an API of 13 degrees .
The field shows the same pattern as in the Kern river oil field described above .
Based on the figures and examples that are available with respect to the United States it is not so easy to reach a very clear conclusion on this oil producing region of the world .
A large amount of reserve growth in the United has occured due to the practice of reporting proven reserves only .
While reserve growth does occur due to technological advancement this seems to be mainly in unconventional oil fields .
Several of these fields are also in the case of the U.S. added to the conventional oil reserve pool , and as such used in forecasting reserve growth for conventional oil reserves in the entire world by the USGS .
This likely leads to too optimistic estimates with respect to reserve growth for the entire world .
What can we tell from reserve growth in Russia ?
In June 2003 a study was published in the Natural Resource Research journal called : Reserve growth in Oil fields of West Siberian Basin , Russia by Mahendra K. Verma and Gregory F. Ulmishek of the United States Geological Survey .
This study compares reserve growth in the following 42 large oil fields in the West Siberian Basin :
Chart 8 - Source : Verma & Ulmishek .
The study shows the change shown in the chart below for reserves in two categories , after the discovery year and after producion starts .
These categories are divided between four different field sets of the 42 fields .
Chart 9 - Source : Verma & Ulmishek .
What can be observed is that reserve growth mainly occurs in the first six years after initial discovery .
The most likely explanation is an underestimate of initial reserves .
Furthermore very little to no reserve growth occurs in later stages of the fields production , supporting the idea that technology does not influence reserves .
The authors of the study conclude :
" All the models show rapid reserve growth in the first five years , though to different levels , but the West Siberian models show gentler growth in the following years .
Slower growth in West Siberian fields is caused by different reserve booking requirements and probably by insufficient investment in improved production technologies . "
In a latter reference to this study the main author , Verma conclude that based on this study and assessments from the US that :
Several doubtful claims about technology are lifted towards reality by the USGS , which are not supported by their own studies .
Reserve growth data from Russia does not support the idea that the advancement of technology causes reserve growth in conventional oil fields .
What can we tell from reserve growth in the North Sea ?
" The size distribution of recoverable oil reserves for oil fields in the North Sea basin has much in common with that elsewhere .
It is heavily skewed , with a predominance of smaller fields .
The hypothesis of lognormality would not be rejected .
The average field size in the UK is less than half that for Norway .
In both sectors , a minority of fields account for the majority of aggregate reserves .
Reserve appreciation between production start - up and the last observation year ( usually 1996 ) for the average field in the UK was about 20 % .
For Norway it was close to 50 % , over an average production period much the same as for the UK .
This difference is marked .
And given their larger average size , average appreciation of Norwegian fields approached five times that in the UK . " ( Watkins , 2002 )
The North sea is very interesting because the historic data for the United Kingdom and Norway vary wildly with respect to reserve growth .
At the same time , both regions have excellent ( but different ) reporting practices .
An early study from MIT ( 1997 ) showed large reserve growth in Norway and small reserve growth in the United Kingdom .
This was confirmed by a latter more detailed study called Characteristics of North Sea Reserve Appreciation from 2002 .
Both studies looked at reserve growth since first production started .
The author of the second study ( Watkins ) concluded that :
The author then goes on looking at the causes of reserve growth in the UK and Norwegian part of the North sea :
" More light on the contrast between appreciation of Norwegian and UK fields is shed by attempting to break down estimates of recoverable reserves into the two components of oil - in - place and the recoery factor , the proportion of oil - in - place expected to be recovered before shut - down .
About 75 % of appreciation recorded by Norwegian fields was accounted for by increases in the recovery factor , a factor averaging some to 32 % at start - up , 42 % in the last observation year , a 10 percentage point increase .
The rest represented appreciation of oil - in - place of some 13 % , on average .
The UK experience was quite different .
For the field sample used , the great majority of the ( lower ) appreciation was accounted for by increases of oil in place of 11 % ; the increase in the recovery factor was some three percentage points between start - up and its value in the last observation year of 47 % .
However , these UK results are based on information from only about one third of the 96 fields , Norway 's on 29 out of 30 .
The UK oil - in - place analysis , then , must be regarded cautiously .
Moreover , comparisons between the two countries may be bedevilled by differences in reserve reporting standards . "
( Watkins , 2002 )
" Apart from inherent variations in the physical nature of the fields , much of the difference in reserve appreciation characteristics between the two sectors has to do with the higher average recovery factors at production start - up in the UK .
UK field development relied on early inception of ER [ Enhanced Recovery ] schemes to a greater extent than seems to have occured in Norway .
Indeed , by 1996 average recovery factors in Norway still had not caught up with those in the UK . " ( Watkins , 2002 )
The first thing that we can conclude from Watkins findings is that reserve growth does occur in the North Sea .
The figures he quotes , 20 % for the UK and 50 % for Norway have been confirmed by Francis Harper , a geologist from BP :
Chart 10 - Source : Francis Harper , BP
Chart 11 - Source : Francis Harper , BP
Most of the reserve growth in the United Kingdom can be explained by an underestimate of the Oil Initially In Place .
The reserve estimate has been quite accurate over time .
For Norway it appears that an underestimate of the recoverable reserves is the right explanation .
The conclusion that an influence of technological advancement is the main cause of the increase in the recovery factor for Norway cannot be made from such aggregate figures .
Nonetheless the IEA still uses the North Sea to propagate this view of technological advancement .
After showing a chart on the increase in recovery rates in the Norwegian part of the North Sea , the IEA concludes in their resource to reserves report ( 2006 ) that " conservative recovery rate increases [ from enhanced oil recovery ] of 5 % of oil in place adds at least 300 billion barrels to the USGS figures . " .
Again , just like in the U.S. the only way to get a reasonable estimate of the influence of technological advancement over time on North Sea oil reserves is to look at individual cases of fields because the available aggregate data is too imprecise .
Jean Laherrère already did a comprehensive field by field study of North Sea oil fields back in 2004 .
A few examples of his work are shown below :
Chart 12 - Source : Jean Laherrère
Ekofisk oil field was discovered in 1969 in the Norwegian part of the North Sea with an API of 37.5 .
Initial production patterns led to far too low estimates for ultimate oil recovery .
In the 80's however production started to increase again because the reservoir collapsed when pressure decreased , causing a subsidence of 7 meters .
Soon after the collapse many wells for water injection were drilled leading to a large production jump in 1988 .
The collapse was caused because the reservoir comprises of a special chalk .
In 2002 production started to decline again , no changes due to technological advancement have been apparent so far .

Forties is an oil field in the UK part of the North Sea discovered in 1970 with an API between 43 and 45 degrees .
Production followed a normal pattern in the field , showing no increase in reserves over time .
A gaslift platform was introduced in 1986 , which slightly increased production for a few years until it dropped again to the old production level .
Chart 14 - Source : Jean Laherrère
Brent oil field in the UK part of the North Sea was discovered in 1970 with an API of 38 degrees .
Production followed a normal pattern until 1988 .
Due to the Piper Alpha Platform fire production was disturbed between 1989 and 1991 .
Afterwards , oil production quickly returned to normal leves and continued towards the expected oil recovery path .
At the end of the fields life , however , oil production collapsed , leading to a lower then expected ultimate recovery .
Reserves did not grow but declined in Brent oil field .
Chart 15 - Source : Jean Laherrère
Auk is an oil field in the UK part of the North Sea which was discovered in 1971 .
Production followed a normal pattern of peak and slow decline until the introduction of Horizontal wells in 1993 ( start of second blue part of the graph ) .
Production increased until 1995 , after which a sharp decline set in .
The implementation of horizontal and multilateral drilling did not change the ultimate recovery of the field .
Schneider in AAPG memoir 74 from the year 2000 mentioned that the recovery factor of the field would increased from 17 % to 30 % from the start - up to the end of the fields life :
" The estimated ultimate recovery in 1988 was 93 million barrels or about 13 million barrels remaining ( Trewin and Bramwell 1991 ) .
The estimated ultimate recovery in 1998 is about 180 million barrels or about twice the 1988 estimate .
A major share of the reserve additions at Auk is from a large field extension ( Auk North ) found previously by seismic , but considered uneconomic for many years .
Previous work by Shell / Esso showed Auk North production was not feasible to develop from a satellite platform or from extended reach wells from existing Auk platforms .
Improvement in economics that make Auk North development now possible for Shell / Esso comes from the use of multilateral wells from existing Auk development wells and the use of electric submersible pumps deployed and retrieved on coil tubing without the need of a semi- submersible rig . "
( Schneider , 2000 )
The expected extension ( AUK noth ) has , however , not come on - stream yet .
The claimed incerase in the recovery factor is not visible in the graph .
While it is apparant that reserve growth is a large factor in the North Sea , it is not so clear to what cause .
In the UK it appears that it was mainly due to an underestimates of Oil Initially In Place , in Norway mainly due to underestimates of ultimately recoverable reserves .
Technology does not appear to have a large impact , but this could be the wrong conclusion .
More study on the North Sea would be necessary to determine what the exact cause of reserve growth is .
Summarizing and Concluding remarks
1 ) Reserve growth occurs in all the three examined regions , Russia , the United States and the North Sea .
2 ) The huge increase in reserves due to reserve growth in the United States , which sets the US apart from other countries , can be explained because of the unique practice of reporting proven reserves only .
This makes extrapolation of the amount of reserve growth in the United States not applicable towards countries that do report in a different manner , which are most other countries in the world .
It is impossible to tell from aggregate figures what the influence is of technological advancement on reserve growth .
Separate case studies show that in uconventional heavy oil fields , technological advancement plays a main role in reserve growth .
In conventional fields no clear role of technological advancement is visible .
3 ) In Russia most reserve growth in the Siberian basin occurs in the initial phase after discovery / production in oil fields .
No reserve growth occurs in later stages of lives of oil fields that have been studied .
Reserve growth in Russia appears to be mainly due to initial underestimates of the oil fields potential , not to technological advancement .
4 ) In the North Sea reserve growth mainly occured to underestimating the Oil Initially in Place in the United Kingdom , while in Norway it was mainly due to changes in the reserves either by underestimates of reserves and / or by technological advancement .
Far less reserve growth occured in the UK then in Norway .
In the reserve reporting in the UK , enhanced oil recovery was already being taken into account , while in Norway this was not the case .
This could explain the difference between Norway and the UK , with respect to the high increase in the recovery factor in Norway and the lower increase in the UK .
However , is the difference due to the EOR techniques , or simply due to underestimating the recoverable reserves because of other reasons ?
And more importantly , can these effects be extrapolated to the future ?
If the increase in the recovery factor is caused by EOR techniques , this would probably be the case .
Single oil field cases do not show an increase in reserves in later stages of fields lives due to the application of enhanced oil recovery techniques .
5 ) While technology seems to play a part , reserve growth appears to be mainly a function of reserve accounting .
Due to more accurate reporting , reserves grow over time .
Technological advancement could very well play a role in reserve growth of conventional reservoirs , but this cannot be concluded from the data available in the studies above .
This makes claims that reserve growth will occur in the future as it did in the past unreliable .
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease in which blood sugar ( glucose ) levels are excessively high .
The symptoms vary , but may include excessive hunger or thirst , frequent urination , extreme fatigue , neuropathy ( nerve tingling ) , and blurry vision .
While they can seem vague , the earlier you notice them the better , as serious complications can arise when type 2 diabetes goes undiagnosed and treated .
Are You At Risk ?
More than 30 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes .
However , nearly 24 % ( approximately 7.2 million people ) of people with the condition are undiagnosed , ﻿﻿so it 's important to be aware of the symptoms , especially if you :
Are over 45
Have been diagnosed with prediabetes
Are overweight and / or inactive
Are African American , an Alaska native , American Indian , Asian American , Hispanic / Latino , or Pacific Islander American and are experiencing atypical symptoms
Common Symptoms
Knowing the most common symptoms of type 2 diabetes can give you a jumpstart on noticing any you might develop .
This way you can see your primary care doctor as soon as possible .
Verywell
Polyuria ( Excessive Urination )
Polyuria is an increase in the frequency of urination .
When you have abnormally high levels of glucose in your blood , your kidneys draw in water from your tissues to dilute the glucose , so that your body can get rid of it through the urine .
Your cells will also pump fluid into the bloodstream to help flush out sugar ; the kidneys are unable to reabsorb this fluid during filtering , which results in excess urination .
To meet the clinical definition of polyuria , urine output for an adult must exceed 2.5 liters per day﻿﻿ ( normal urine output is 1.5 liters per day ) .
Note if you 're visiting the restroom far more often than usual and if you 're staying there longer when you do .
Polydipsia ( Excessive Thirst )
Excessive thirst typically goes hand - in - hand with increased urination .
As the body pulls water out of the tissues to dilute the blood and get rid of excess glucose , the urge to drink increases .
Many people describe this thirst as unquenchable .
To stay hydrated , you may feel the urge to drink excessive amounts of liquids .
If those liquids contain simple sugars ( such as soda , sweet iced tea , lemonade , or juice , for example ) your glucose level will skyrocket even higher .
Extreme Fatigue
Your body is like a car — it needs fuel to function .
The body 's primary source of fuel is glucose , which is broken down from foods that contain carbohydrates .
Insulin , a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas , moves glucose from the blood into the cells to use for energy .
When you have diabetes , either your pancreas is n't making enough insulin or the insulin that your body is making is n't being used the way it 's supposed to be used , typically because the cells become resistant to it .
The result :
Your cells become deprived of glucose and you experience a lack of energy and extreme fatigue .
Polyphagia ( Excessive Hunger )
Excessive hunger is correlated with fatigue and cell starvation .
Because the cells are resistant to insulin , glucose remains in the blood .
The cells are then unable to gain access to glucose , which can trigger the release of hormones that tell the brain that you are hungry .
Excessive eating can complicate things further by causing blood sugar levels to increase .
Neuropathy ( Nerve Tingling )
Numbness , tingling , or a feeling of " pins and needles " in the arms or legs brought on by type 2 diabetes is called diabetic neuropathy .
This symptom tends to develop gradually over time as excess sugar damages the nerves .
Keeping glucose levels within the normal range can help prevent further damage and reduce symptoms .
People with severe neuropathy may require medication .
Cuts and Bruises That are Slow to Heal
When the blood is thick with sugar , it may not move as freely throughout the body .
Adequate circulation is required for healing : Poor circulation can make it hard for blood to reach affected areas , slowing down the healing process .
A cut or bruise that is slow to improve could be a sign of high blood sugar .
Blurry Vision
Blurred vision can result from elevated blood sugar .
Similarly , fluid that is pulled from the cells into the bloodstream to dilute glucose can also be pulled from the lenses of the eyes , causing them to become excessively dry and unable to focus .
It 's important to have a dilated eye exam shortly after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes .
Damage to the eye may occur even before a diagnosis of diabetes exists .
Rare Symptoms
Although the less common symptoms of type 2 diabetes are not experienced by everyone , they can signal the disease and are worth being aware of :
Dry mouth ( a sign of dehydration that can result from increased urination )
Irritability
Dry , itchy skin
Skin tags
Frequent infections , such as yeast infections
Acanthosis nigricans — dark , " velvety " patches of skin on the armpits , groin , and neck folds , and over the joints of the fingers and toes .
It is an indicator of high insulin and is seen most often in African Americans .
Unexplained weight loss ( usually associated with type 1 diabetes , but it can also occur with type 2 diabetes when there is insulin deficiency )
Erectile dysfunction ( after years of high blood sugar )
Complications
Complications of diabetes develop slowly , but may become severe if the condition is untreated .﻿﻿
By the time someone is diagnosed with diabetes or prediabtes the body has been fighting high sugar and insulin levels for about 10 years .
Stroke
High blood pressure
Coronary artery disease
Foot problems caused by insufficient blood flow and nerve damage , sometimes severe enough to warrant amputation
Nerve damage ( neuropathy )
Eye damage ( retinopathy )
Ketoacidosis
Kidney damage ( nephropathy )
When to See a Doctor
The symptoms of type 2 diabetes may occur gradually , but they should not be ignored .
If you begin to notice any of them , make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible .
If you 're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , they can connect you with a certified diabetes educator and provide guidance for receiving diabetes self - management education .
You also can get this help from the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists .
These services often are covered by insurance ; check your provider for details about your plan .
When to Go to the Hospital
Both very high blood sugar , or hyperglycemia , and very low blood sugar , or hypoglycemia , can be considered a medical emergency .
Hyperglycemia
If diabetes is left untreated and blood glucose levels become too high , serious complications can occur , such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome ( HHNS ) , sometimes referred to as diabetic coma , or diabetic ketoacidosis .
Get urgent medical care if you experience any symptoms related to hyperglycemia :
Extreme thirst
Frequent urination
Warm , dry skin that does not sweat
High fever ( over 101 degrees Fahrenheit )
Sleepiness or confusion
Loss of vision
Hallucinations
Weakness on one side of the body
Hypoglycemia
If blood sugar levels dip too low , you may experience any or all of the following :
Dizziness
Shaking
Headache
Sweating
Hunger
Have a food or beverage that contains sugar immediately and consider getting urgent medical care .
A Word From Verywell
Being diagnosed with diabetes can be unsettling , especially given it 's a disease that must be dealt with daily .
However , it 's manageable and whatever steps you need to take will become second nature .
Learning all you can about the condition will help as well .
For some people , lifestyle modifications such as weight loss , healthy eating , and exercise can actually get blood sugars below the diabetes threshold .
You can control your diabetes and not let it control you .
A team of British scientists investigating whether a tiny tropical hookworm could provide a cure for asthma and hay fever have committed the ultimate act of bravery by infecting themselves with the parasite to observe the effects .
The experts wanted to see if there would be any unpleasant or dangerous side effects from the worm , Ancylostoma duodenale , so they made the bold decision to allow their own bodies to be infected .
Each scientist had to stick some of the tiny hookworm larvae on to their skin with a plaster and wait for the larvae to wriggle through the skin into the lungs , through the bloodstream and into the intestine , where they would produce eggs .
The eggs are excreted , but once the adult hookworms are in the gut they start to suck blood from the walls of the intestine .
The theory is that this infection triggers an immune response which helps to ' dampen down ' the over - reaction of the rest of the system , which is why patients with allergies such as asthma develop symptoms .
Professor David Pritchard and his team at Nottingham University 's School of Pharmacy administered different amounts of the hookworms to themselves to prove that it would be safe .
Pritchard himself stuck 50 of the larvae onto his skin .
' It was fairly itchy when they first go through the skin , ' he admitted .
' After that you do n't really notice them . '
The trials proved that at a low ' dosage ' of 10 worms the infection was safe .
Last week the first patients arrived at the school of pharmacy to have the hookworm larvae administered , to see if it would quell hay fever symptoms .
Pritchard said : ' The pollen season is coming in spring and we hope that we might see an alleviation of symptoms in some of the patients who received the worms .
If we think there 's some indication of success , we would move on to asthma patients . '
In the Seventies doctors first noticed that people infected with hookworms did not seem to suffer from allergies such as asthma , and scientists have reported that Crohn 's disease also does not appear in countries where the infection is rife .
Pritchard wants to see if the hookworms are influencing regulatory T - cells , which seem to keep the immune responses in check .
' If we can work out how these cells are switched on , then the pharmaceutical industry could become involved . '
When asked , most people probably believe that today ’s children have become at least twice as fat as in past generations and plagued by health problems .
That ’s certainly the alarming image of the childhood obesity epidemic portrayed in the media .
But how many of us have stopped to examine the evidence and see for ourselves just how real and realistic the threat is to our children ?
As we learned in the “ Anatomy of an epidemic , ” how an epidemic is defined and marketed , and the intensity of efforts to identify cases , can create an epidemic where the evidence shows only modest increases in actual numbers and actual weights .
In creating the perception of a crisis , media and public health officials have spoken with unified certainty of a fat time bomb and a tsunami that ’s shortening the lives of our children .
In the past 25 years , the health status of our children has deteriorated and with it , their ability to learn and become productive members of society .
The proportion of overweight children has tripled , and the number of children who suffer serious medical , psychological and social repercussions has increased .
High blood pressure has quadrupled ... Other chronic diseases ... that used to be associated with older adults are now increasingly diagnosed in children .
Hospitalization costs for children with obesity - related conditions tripled between 1977 and 1999 . — Dr. Maria Goldstein , M.D. , of the Childhood Obesity Task Force and steering committee creating New Mexico ’s Strategic Action Plan , Physical Activity and Nutrition in the Schools , sponsored by Action for Healthy Kids and officially endorsed by the Governor ’s Council on Physical Fitness and Health .
( Albuquerque Tribune , February 1 , 2005 ) A tripling of childhood obesity sounds like a very real and dangerous threat , indeed .
But , as we ’ve learned , it is based on the prevalence , or numbers of children who fall within the definition of “ overweight ” and “ obese ” — not on actual weight increases among children .
It can take the merest growth in height or weight to tip a child into the rosters of “ too fat . ”
For the first time in our history , we ’ve had several generations of children who ’ve largely been able to enjoy their childhoods free from starvation , food shortages and rationing ; able to receive an education rather than toil alongside their parents ; and saved from the ravages of high infant mortality and devastating childhood diseases that have been largely eradicated thanks to immunizations , improved health care and safe water .
Instead of expending calories battling infections , more children than ever are surviving infancy and childhood and growing up healthier and larger .
Population - wide , we have fewer scrawny malnourished children .
Thanks to these positive advancements and better childhoods , every actual health statistic shows lifespans increasing and diseases dramatically dropping .
And there is absolutely no evidence to support fears that children ’s lives will suddenly shorten .
The popular assumption that the resulting increases in our children ’s sizes are somehow pathological can be critically questioned per the scientific evidence .
But we never hear the full story , with good reason .
If the facts were more widely known of just how modest the actual increases in children ’s sizes have been over the past forty years , it is doubtful that anyone would be as sold on the idea of a crisis .
So instead , we hear about skyrocketing increases in the prevalence of obesity — but even these figures have been carefully crafted to give us an exaggerated perception .
There are all sorts of figures bantered about , too , which can make it hard for consumers and professionals to keep track .
The most overstated numbers are based on self - reported surveys , including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data .
BRFSS is a telephone survey that ’s been conducted by health departments since 1984 .
Helping to skew the results , only those with land lines are included , eliminating many of higher socioeconomic status ; and as more publicity has been given to obesity over the years , people have been more likely to participate and to more accurately report their weights .
In contrast , the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ( NHANES ) have been conducted since 1963 and involve a representative sample of thousands of Americans with actual physical examinations , measurements and labwork taken by professionals .
In interpreting the data , the definitions for “ at risk for overweight ” and “ overweight ” for children and teens ( and “ obese ” adults , for that matter ) have been changed .
For years , kids ’ and teens ’ definitions had been based on 85th and 95th percentiles on weight and height growth charts designed forty years ago .
As today ’s children are maturing earlier and are taller and larger than past children were when the growth charts were developed , more were falling in the top percentiles .
Then , as we reviewed in “ New Age Numerology , ” when the CDC redesigned the growth charts in May 2000 and made them BMI - based , nearly two - thirds of children suddenly found themselves in higher percentiles .
According to the CDC , when the same definition for overweight was applied to all of the NHANES data , the numbers of “ overweight ” children and teens was actually fairly stable from 1960s to 1980 .
But that ’s not all ....
Take a look at the percentages of children who ’ve fallen within the clinical definitions for “ overweight ” ( “ obese ” by today ’s popularized term ) over the years :
In just the 8 years between 1980 and 1988 , prevalence of “ overweight ” nearly doubled .
And it increased another 50 % in just 5 years between 1994 and 1999 .
Does n’t that strike you as odd ?
It ’s interesting that no one has looked into just why the statistics show such dramatic surges in such short time periods , because , as we ’ve seen , there have been no notable changes in the calories or diets of children , or in their activity levels , since the 1960s to explain it — just a lot of phoney claims to make us believe something sinister has been going on .
It ’s also just plain easier and profitable to jump on the “ epidemic ” bandwagon .
But it is disingenuous for health officials to not explain what changed .
The NHANES surveys are statistics gathered on a population of people .
But the surveys themselves are different .
The more recent surveys have undergone significant design changes , in order to better reflect the increasing diversity and aging of our population .
They have been done on different people and different demographic groups over the years .
Earlier surveys did n’t reflect much racial diversity so when they were redesigned , selected population groups were suddenly disproportionately sampled in large numbers : children under 5 years , elderly over 60 , and minorities .
Black and Mexican - Americans , which according to the CDC are twice as likely to be " overweight " than whites , each now represent 30 % of the total sample populations .
So trying to compare surveys is like comparing apples and oranges .
Never mind that population statistics cannot be used to make any credible conclusions about individuals .
Still , during the height of the government ’s build - up of its anti-obesity initiatives during 1999 - 2004 , the NHANES data was not supportive of an obesity epidemic .
Yet an epidemic was needed to justify their programs and every vested interest continued to make increasingly frightening claims .
Meanwhile , a critical study was virtually buried in the media .
The CDC National Center for Health Statistics report published in the June 2004 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association , found that there had been no change in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among U.S. children , teens or adults since 1999 to 2002 !
It ’s been equally difficult for consumers and healthcare professionals to learn how much average weights and heights ( the two parts of the body mass index computation ) among children and teens have actually increased .
The available figures based on actual body measurements taken as part of NHANES suffer from the same difficulties in making conclusions because our population has become more diverse over the decades .
Even so , the measurements since 1963 paint a considerably different picture of the “ childhood obesity epidemic ” than we ’ve been led to believe .
The average weight of a 10 - year old boy surveyed in 1963 , for instance , was 74.2 pounds ; and less than 85 pounds in 2002 — an increase of around 10 3/4 pounds over the past 40 years .
Similarly , the average 10 - year old girl today weighs about 10 1 / 2 pounds more than girls surveyed 40 years ago .
The figures for teens over the past 36 years show nearly identical differences .
Meanwhile , over the past 4 decades , the average 10 - year old girl is about 1 inch taller , as is the average teenage boy .
These modest increases in population - wide heights and weights have been over nearly 40 years — a period when life expectancies have increased 10 % , to the longest in our history , and age - adjusted rates for chronic diseases have dramatically dropped .
Information enables us to give a more critical eye to the inordinately extreme claims about the deadliness of “ childhood obesity ” and doom and gloom threats about our children ’s health .
We can most credibly ask “ where ’s the evidence for a crisis ? ”

According to British media , the US and UK governments are on track to achieve a March victory in Iraq … Written by Bush and Blair ’s big oil business partners who serve as the leaders ’ advisors on foreign policy , the new Iraq hydrocarbon law opens the door for international investors , led by BP , Exxon and Shell , to siphon off 75 percent of Iraq oil wealth for 30 years .

Food is a system of energy transfer .
The main source is the sun ( other than a few interesting Chemosynthesis creatures ) , and then its all a matter of how many steps away from the sun your meal is .
For instance if you are a plant its pretty straight forward ,
( sun -> you )
If you are a cow ,
( sun -> plant -> you )
If you are a wolf ,
( sun -> plant -> deer -> you )
Being a human ( assuming you ARE a human ) it can get really interesting depending on how you get your food , but lets simplify :
carnivore ( meat only ) = ( sun -> plant -> animal -> you )
omnivore = [ ( sun -> plant -> you ) + ( sun -> plant -> animal -> you ) ]
vegetarian = [ ( sun -> plant -> you ) + ( sun -> plant -> egg / cheese – > you ]
vegan ( plants only ) = ( sun -> plant -> you )
So like any energy transfer system a little bit is lost at each stage .
The plant absorbs the sun and wastes some of it growing , and when we the cow eats the plant it wasts some of it growing and so on until it gets to your mouth .
That means it takes more energy to produce X number of cow calories than it does X number of vegetable calories .
Cleary , eating vegetables is more efficient .
It not only takes more energy from the sun to make that cow calorie , but it also takes more land to grow the crops that cow ate , it takes more water , it takes more oil , and it takes more chemicals ( most farms do n’t grow organic feed crops ) , and you feed less people .
Where is all this leading us ?
Should you all go out and become vegans , maybe but if you are not ready for that sort of change you can do something else .
There is a movement to push the old PB&J ( peanut butter and jelly ) sandwich .
The fine people at pbj campaign make a fine argument for why switching a couple of ham sandwiches a month to pb&j can make a good bit of difference in the world .
Here is just a taste ( sorry ) of what you can achieve by switching .
A PB&J will slow global warming .
Next time you have one you ’ll reduce your carbon footprint by saving the equivalent of 2.5 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions over an average animal - based lunch like a hamburger , a tuna sandwich , grilled cheese , or chicken nuggets .
That ’s about forty percent of what you ’d save driving around for the day in a hybrid instead of a standard sedan .
If you were going to have a ham sandwich or a hamburger , you save the equivalent almost 3.5 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions .
A PB&J will also save water .
That ’s about 280 gallons of water over the hamburger .
To put this in perspective , three PB&Js a month instead of hamburgers will save about as much water as switching to a low - flow shower head .
A PB&J will save land .
Have a PB&J and save 12 to 50 square feet of land from deforestation , over - grazing , and pesticide and fertilizer pollution . ( via )
Visit their site for more interesting ways the old pb&j can help the world .
There are other things you can do .
( in order of importance )
Eat local :
The average food item in the American market has traveled over 1000 miles to get there .
Eating local saves a lot of oil on transport , and makes the local economy stronger .
Check out that farmers market and make your mouth and someones wallet happy .
Paying a local farmer a couple cents more for an apple means that farmer might get 80 – 90 % more for that apple .
Large food companies take a big cut out of the final price of our food .
Not much of that money makes it back to the farmer .
Buying local means that farmer will have more money to come to your business .
Even if you eat meat , eating local meat will help reduce oil used in transport .
My father is a small town butcher and he can testify to the fact that large meat plants do horrific things to meat , get it local and know what is going into your cow .
Eat more vegetables :
Your mother was right , you should eat your vegetables .
Its good for you and the planet .
You will notice your waste line looks better as does your skin , your hair and your mood .
Eat organic :
Organic foods are produced without artificial chemicals and fertilizers , hence they use less oil .
If you are feeling a bit crazy , trying going vegetarian for a week .
You might like it , I know I did .
I lived with a couple of vegetarians in college and it was just easier to eat what they ate , over 5 years later I do n’t miss meat at all .
If you absolutely can’t live without meat , I would suggest raising your own .
If you have the space raising chickens is not as hard as you would think .
If you live in a big city , some farmers run programs where they will raise animals for you and even do the slaughtering , all you have to do is pay your money and pick up your meat .
If you go this route make sure you get to know the farmer before hand and pick one with farming practices that are gentle on the earth .
I have slaughtered chickens and can tell you that it gives you a whole new appreciation for where your food comes from .
If the idea of raising and then killing an animal for your food is revolting to you , and you still eat meat you might want to spend some time thinking about why that is .
Home grown meat can be a great way to get more in touch with nature and at the same time control what kind of weird stuff goes into that meat .
There are lots of things you can do to lessen the amount of energy you use to get your food , from eating some pb&j ’s a couple of times a month , to changing the way you get food , to changing WHAT you eat all together .
If you have any tips make sure to leave them in the comments .
Thanks .
UK chemists have discovered how to draw and erase pictures on the surfaces of ionic liquids .
The technique , a chemical version of the so - called Etch A Sketch toy , might be used for lithography or electrochemical patterning at the nanometre scale .
Pete Licence , one of the researchers at the University of Nottingham who made the surprising discovery , says his team were ’ astounded ’ to see that they could create dark patterns in a frozen ionic liquid , simply by using a standard mass spectrometry instrument to pass a focused gallium ion beam over the salt ’s surface .
’ And we can not only write and read the image , but erase it and rewrite as well , ’ said Licence .
The discovery was made entirely by accident .
The researchers were using spectroscopic techniques to investigate the properties of ionic liquids - organic salts whose ions are sterically hindered , so that they stay liquid at room temperatures .
As these liquids are made entirely of ions , they have almost zero vapour pressure - allowing them to be studied in the ultra - high vacuum condit ions necessary for secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) , where a gallium ion beam fires electrons out of the liquid ’s surface .
When the ionic liquid was frozen , imaging software plotting charge distribution showed dark areas of contrast , following the gallium beam ’s path .
Licence suggests that when electrons are fired out , a positive charge is left behind , which seems to stay localised in the frozen surface .
But this pattern was easily erased : melting the salt ( by raising the temperature ) wiped the slate clean .
Alternatively , flooding the surface with low - energy electrons also dissipated the positive charge .
Another image could be written when the ionic liquid was frozen again .
Since the team were using a standard SIMS instrument , their gallium ion beam only created micrometre - sized lines .
But Licence points out that state - of - the - art instruments can generate beams less than ten nanometres wide .
Aside from the new technique ’s potential for data storage , Licence suggests that it might be used for micro-lithography , where a masking image could be rendered onto a surface coated with an ionic liquid .
A positively - charged dark pattern could also be used to template the self - assembly of other charged molecules .
Licence is n’t sure that the technique would work with any other kind of frozen liquid .
A low - melting point polymer , for example , might just be physically scarred by the gallium beam , so that any pattern could n’t be rewritten .
The peculiar charge - stabilising properties of ionic liquids allow an image to be stored , but also wiped away without permanent damage .
The Nottingham team have patented their discovery , and are working on stabilising the image in non-vacuum conditions , where charged particles in the atmosphere may lead to it fading .

Exposure to the saliva of biting insects could later protect people against infection by insect - borne parasites .
If the components of saliva that confer protection can be isolated , they could be used to boost the strength of future vaccines against malaria and other deadly diseases .
The phenomenon has previously been documented in leishmaniasis – a skin disease spread by sandflies that currently afflicts many soldiers returning from Iraq .
Now a study in mice has shown mosquito saliva can protect against malaria .
People who live in regions where insect - borne parasitic diseases are widespread , such as Africa and the Middle East , often show greater resistance to infection than people from other parts of the world .
It had been assumed that the protection comes from repeated exposure to the parasite over a person ’s lifetime , but now it seems that repeated exposure to uninfected saliva could also play a part in generating immunity .
“ In some areas people can get up to a thousand mosquito bites a day , ” says Mary Ann McDowell , an immunoparasitologist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana .
“ That ’s a lot of mosquito spit . ”

After animal studies showed that prior exposure to sandfly saliva conferred protection against leishmaniasis , McDowell decided to test for the same effect in malaria .
Working with researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) in Bethesda , Maryland , her team exposed mice to mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite , some of which had previously been bitten by uninfected mosquitoes .
Mice that were pre-exposed to plain saliva in this way had lower amounts of parasite in their liver and blood .
The saliva stimulated their immune systems to produce infection - fighting chemicals called cytokines , which are generally associated with immune cells called T - helper 1 ( TH1 ) cells ( Infection and Immunity , DOI : 10.1128/IAI.01928-06 ) .
More research is needed before components of insect saliva find their way into a malaria vaccine for humans , says McDowell .
Her team is now searching for the specific salivary protein responsible for shifting the immune system to a TH1 response .
They then will test whether the same protein exerts a similar protective effect in people .
 Mice that were pre-exposed to mosquito saliva had lower amounts of the malaria parasite in their liver and blood 
Progress is already being made on vaccines for leishmaniasis .
The proteins in sandfly spit that stimulate the TH1 response have already been identified , says Jesus Valenzuela , a biochemist at NIAID who studies leishmaniasis .
The proteins are currently being tested for their protective abilities in dogs and monkeys .
“ We ’re trying to mimic what ’s happening in nature , to stimulate the same kind of immunity , ” says Valenzuela .
Several studies have shown a correlation in humans between exposure to sandfly saliva and resistance to leishmaniasis .
Valenzuela has shown that children in Brazil who are naturally resistant to leishmaniasis had a strong immune response to sandfly saliva , while those who contracted the disease showed no such response , indicating they had had no previous exposure to saliva .
McDowell ’s preliminary results from soldiers returning from Iraq show that those who reported being bitten by flies but did not have leishmaniasis produced more protective TH1 cytokines than those with the leishmaniasis parasite .
Similar studies will be necessary to determine if mosquito saliva has a similar potential , says Peter Billingsley of Sanaria in Rockville , Maryland , a company currently testing a malaria vaccine that uses an irradiated form of the parasite .
“ It would be really great if it did , ” he says .
Having been a longtime admirer of Pimp That Snack , we finally succumbed to the urge to make our own .
But , too many choices !
Do we go with Karnaugh ’s craving and make something caramely , or something for Tenacious W ’s chocolate tooth ?
We finally settled on duplicating a Snickers Bar , figuring that we could slice ’n dice according to our tastes .
Here we have the initial ingredients .
We say “ initial ” because it turns out we underestimated how truly pimpin ’ our Snickers Bar was going to be .
Actual ingredients were :
680g caramel
1587.57329g chocolate ( or 3.5 lbs chocolate if for those of us in the US )
8 egg whites
500g honey
500g powdered sugar
450g dry roasted peanuts
Estimated cost : $ 30
First we started with Karnaugh ’s beloved caramel .
We were psyching ourselves up to make our own nougat , so we chickened out and bought caramel for the topping .
15 minutes and a few pieces eaten later , we popped those suckers in a microwaveable bowl and heated ’m for 20 seconds at a time , stirring to make sure they did n’t burn .
About a minute later we drowned the peanuts in the caramel goo , then plastered the bottom of a plastic - lined Tupperware with the stuff .
Yummy !
Stuck that puppy in the freezer then went to work on the nougat .
For that , we snitched the gorgeous - looking nougat from LadyV and Soop Dogg of the Double Double Decker ( we are in awe ! )
We mixed their original recipe , and determined it just was n’t enough for our Pimp .
So we doubled the recipe : 4 egg whites , 250g of honey and sugar each , and 40 minutes of stirring later , we had this beautiful glob of sugar coma .
Turned it out onto a powdered sugar surface and kneaded it for 10 minutes .
Unfortunately , we totally disregarded LadyV and Soop Dogg ’s warning about 3rd degree burns and ended up with nougaty appendages permanently attached to our hands .
No pain , no Pimp I guess !
Sadly , gorgeous though our nougat was , it was n’t enough .
We needed double the amount we ’d made !
Back again to the burner .
At this point Karnaugh left to play Grand Theft Auto , having been put in the proper pimpin ’ mood .
The rest of the nougat was patted down on the caramel goodness then stuck back in the freezer .
Break time !
One car race and 2 delivered hookers later , we were ready to smear our Pimp with the crowning glory : all that lovely chocolate .
2 bricks of the chocolate melted , we slathered them all over the nougat and stuck it back in the freezer for 20 minutes .
This is why I love you guys , you make the content for me .
A reader going by Al E. posted this fascinating comment in regards to my post , The Confidence Myth .
His major point is that telling someone to “ be confident ” is a waste of time .
I could n’t agree more .
I do n’t like advice that does n’t have a practical strategy .
Unless you can tell someone how to be confident , such advice is a meaningless cliche at best .
Here it is , courtesy of Al E. :
Below is a copy of an email essay I sent out to a few dozen people in the “ self - help ” industry about 2 years ago .
Predictably I only got a handful of responses .
And of course they all insisted I was wrong .
After all , their livelihoods depend on maintaining the myths I debunk .
But they offered no evidence to disprove me , nor any useful insights .
THE MYTH OF CONFIDENCE
If I had a dime for every time someone told me to “ be confident ” , I ’d probably be a millionaire by now .
And as a millionaire , I ’d probably have a lot of women throwing themselves at me and a lot of men respecting & admiring me .
And the inevitable result of all this would beâ€ ¦
You guessed it !.. , Confidence .
So the next time you feel like telling someone to be confident , just throw them a dime instead .
It ’d be a thousand times more useful .
In fact , I ’ve noticed a disturbing trend in the last few years .
All of a sudden , everyone ’s talking about confidence .
( or it ’s pseudonym , “ self - esteem ” )
Everywhere I read , every show I watch , every dimestore shrink I consult .
Everyone ’s advising everyone else to be more confident .
( a hypothetical : What if everybody took this advice and suddenly everyone had perfect confidence ?
Would n’t it just level the playing field right back to where it already was , and thus , not make a damn bit of difference anyway ??? )
Suddenly , all the women on the dating shows and in the advice columns are telling us how much they ’re attracted to this mysterious new quality called confidence .
And conversely , how the lack of confidence is a big turn - off .
And predictably , men now feel the need to brag about how confident they are .
And the confidence fad seems to be growing at a rapid pace .
But I ’m about to point out how it ’s all just the psychological equivalent of the Pet Rock fad from the 70’s .
Like the Pet Rock , advising someone to “ be confident ” is useless and does nothing .
But like the Pet rock , it allows the giver to feel like they did something nice .
They did n’t .
Yet people keep buying it & buying it & buying it .
The reality about confidence is so simple and so obvious , it amazes me that otherwise intelligent people have n’t figured it out .
Or maybe they have figured it out and they ’re too dishonest with themselves to admit it .
Perhaps the reality is too uncomfortable .
After all , it ’s much easier to sell books and self - help courses with fantasy than with reality .
So here ’s the truth about confidence :
You can only have confidence when other people give it to you .
When others in your age group like you , respect you , admire you , and are attracted to you , you get confidence .
When they do n’t like you , scorn you , and reject you , you lose confidence .
Therefore , the level of confidence you have is controlled by others , NOT by you .
You can not just decide to be confident .
Confidence is not a choice or decision you can make .
You ca n’t just snap your fingers and , Abracadabra , you ’re confident .
It does n’t work that way .
It ca n’t work that way .
Social confidence , by it ’s very definition , requires support and acceptance from others ( in your own age group ) before it can exist .
( on an important side note :
When people mention confidence , 98 % of the time they are unwittingly referring to one specific kind : Social Confidence .
So please do n’t argue with me about other forms of confidence .
They are irrelevant to this issue .
For example , if you ’ve mastered the Klingon language or are an expert in stamp collecting , you may be very confident in your ability .
But that confidence CAN NOT translate into social confidence unless others respect , admire , and reward you for your abilities .
The average Klingon speaker is more likely to be shunned , particularly by the opposite sex , rather than admired .
Thus , please keep in mind that the kind of confidence I discuss here is only the most commonly discussed kind : Social confidence )
Confidence is merely a byproduct of success .
You need some kind of social / sexual / romantic success before you can have genuine confidence .
Confidence without success is delusional and / or dishonest , thus fake , and others will quickly recognize it as such .
Here ’s why :
It ’s not really the confidence itself that people are attracted to .
Confidence is merely what results when someone has the qualities that are really attracting us .
Obviously , if someone is good - looking , or wealthy , or funny & quick - witted , others will be attracted to them .
This , in turn , will give them confidence .
So when someone tells you they are attracted to confidence , they are lying !
( whether consciously or subconsciously )
What they ’re really attracted to are the traits that make confidence possible .
After all , we all know that wealth , good looks , and strong social skills are attractive to others .
Are we to believe it ’s just a coincidence that these are the very same traits that lead to confidence ?
Obviously , someone who is successful will have more confidence than someone who is unsuccessful .
So when someone says they ’re attracted to confidence , what it means is that they ’re attracted to success & the factors that make success possible .
The confidence itself merely exists as a sign that those other factors ( the real attractors ) are present .
So if you know or care about someone with low confidence , how can you help them ?
First , the worst thing you can do is to just tell them to “ be confident ” or give them a verbal list of traits they should be confident about .
That ’s just insulting their intelligence and it ’s going to frustrate and depress them even more .
Words are hollow and meaningless when not corroborated by actions .
So if you truly want to help someone increase their confidence , here are the areas you should focus on improving :
1 ) Physical Appearance
2 ) Social Skills
3 ) Wealth
1 ) Physical Appearance
( So you think this is shallow ?
It is .
Get over it .
Physical appearance is , of course , the first thing people notice about you .
And if they do n’t like what they see , it will be much , much harder to win them over . )
If the individual has flaws in their appearance , the worst thing you can do is to tell them they “ look fine ” .
Instead , help them improve their appearance .
If they ’re overweight , do n’t deny it .
Help them lose the weight .
If they have bad hair , help them find a stylish cut .
If they have unfashionable or ill - fitting clothes , help them find better ones .
And if you are not qualified to help them in these areas , find someone who can .
2 ) Social Skills
This one could easily become a chicken - or - egg argument .
Many would point out that a person does poorly socially because they lack confidence .
While this may be true in certain cases , I ’ve found in my own experience and observations that usually the reverse is true .
When a person has poor social skills , they will of course do poorly socially & inevitably , their confidence will suffer .
When confronted with this fact , the lazy - minded will regurgitate such hackneyed social advice as “ be happy and smile more ” , “ just be yourself ” , “ be upbeat and positive ” , “ just be nice ” , or something equally trite , short - sighted , and useless .
Being nice is fine .
I ’d encourage it .
But it ’s simply not enough on it ’s own to succeed socially .
If all you are is nice , you will be walked on like a doormat , used , and thrown away .
To truly succeed socially ( in the absence of looks and wealth ) , one needs two things : Material and Execution .
They need strong , interesting conversational material and they need to be able to execute this material in a smooth , charming manner .
How can you expect someone to have social confidence if they lack this ability ?
So if you honestly cared about someone suffering from low social confidence , you would n’t waste their time with empty “ be yourself ” pep talks .
You ’d help them learn and practice conversational skills in a supportive , rejection - free environment .
However , if you are outside of their age group , find someone closer to their age to help them .
This is because what is acceptable for 50 - year olds is not acceptable for 20 - year olds and vice versa .
3 ) Wealth
Unless you are in a position to give someone a job earning $ 50 K +
a year , there ’s not a lot you can do about this one .
But if you focus on the first two ( appearance & social skills ) , increased income is virtually guaranteed to follow .
To recap my main points :
DNS Message Decoding
A Case Study Comparing Java and Common Lisp
By Dave Roberts

Version 1.0 , 30 - May - 2004
Introduction
I have been a Java programmer for several years , writing almost exclusively in Java for the last six years .
Recently , I decided to give Common Lisp a try after reading some of the claims about increased programmer productivity and reduced development times associated with Lisp .
The last Java program I was working on was an implementation of a DNS resolver that allows a programmer access to every native DNS data time rather than just the simple address lookups provided by most TCP / IP APIs such as BSD sockets .
The DNS resolver library generates DNS queries and decodes DNS responses , per RFC 1035 .
As a first trial project in Common Lisp , I decided to implement a DNS resolver library .
The previous Java experience was still fresh in my head and I decided that it would make an interesting comparison .
This paper compares my Java and Common Lisp implementations using several simplistic metrics .
While this comparison is too small to be statistically significant , it gives anecdotal backing to the claims that Common Lisp is more productive than other languages such as Java .
This is particularly interesting in light of Java 's inclusion of some Lisp features such as automatic memory management which I have personally found to be very helpful versus languages like C/C++ which have manual memory management .
Previous Work
Several experiments have indicated increased productivity associated with high - level languages compared with low - level languages ( where “ high - level ” and “ low - level ” are defined a bit arbitrarily ) .
Lutz Prechelt , for instance , compared C , C++ , Java , Perl , Python , Rexx , and TCL [ 1 ] and found that “ scripting languages ” ( Perl , Python , Rexx , and TCL ) are more productive than “ conventional languages . ”
Prechelt had multiple programmers construct a solution to a common programming problem , using their choice of language from the set just described .
Prechelt then analyzed the solutions , recording a number of metrics for each language , including run time , memory consumption , program length , program reliability , work time and productivity , and program structure .
Prechelt found that scripting languages produced solutions to the standard problem that were one - half to one - third the length of solutions produced with the conventional language group .
Further , the scripts took less then half the time to write .
Note that this finding confirms the older benchmarks that suggest that programmer productivity measured in terms of lines of code produced per unit of time is roughly constant , no matter which language is used .
Said in a most obvious way , people write shorter programs faster .
Erann Gatt ran a similar experiment to that conducted by Prechelt , this time comparing C , C++ , Java , and Common Lisp [ 2 ] .
Gatt found that Common Lisp programs took less than half the time to construct as their C , C++ , and Java counterparts .
Further , Gatt found that Lisp had run times that , while slower than the fastest C/C++ programs , were on average faster than the average C/C++ programs .
Memory consumption for the Lisp programs was similar to that of the Java programs , both of which were larger than C/C ++.
Implementation Description
By nature , Java and Lisp foster different styles of programming .
Java is very object - oriented , while Lisp is multi-paradigm , supporting functional , imperative , and object - oriented programming styles .
The Resolver code written in each language reflects these fundamental differences .
The Java code uses objects heavily .
A DNS message is represented by a message , as are DNS resource records .
Each resource record type has a corresponding Java class .
The basic API expects that the user has used Java 's NIO routines to transmit a DNS request and receive a DNS reply .
The DNS UDP message data should be stored in an NIO ByteBuffer .
The Message class has a static decode method that takes a ByteBuffer and returns a Message object .
The Message object contains public fields that allow a client to access lists of resource records stored in the various sections of a DNS message .
In contrast , the Lisp implementation uses a functional / imperative programming style .
Rather than have the user interface with UDP sockets and implement timeouts and retransmissions , the Lisp implementation uses Kevin Rosenberg 's UFFI library to interface with Linux 's libresolv . so DNS library .
Libresolv.so interfaces with UDP and correctly handles retransmission of lost DNS messages .
When passed a domain name string , a DNS class code , a DNS type code , and a pointer to a message buffer , the res_query function returns the DNS reply message corresponding to the query parameters in the specified buffer .
The Lisp implementation uses a small amount of code ( 17 lines ) to interface with res_query in the libresolv. so library .
After calling res-query , a small Lisp glue function around res_query , the user has a UFFI byte buffer containing a raw DNS reply message .
The main Lisp decoding API is named decode - reply - message and simply takes a UFFI buffer pointer and byte count as arguments .
The function returns a list of sub -lists representing each section of the DNS message .
Each sub-list , in turn , contains header field values or is a list of resource records .
Each resource record is encoded as yet another list of Lisp primatives ( strings , numbers , etc. ) .
The two implementations are functionally similar , but not fully complete .
The Java version only decodes A , CNAME , MX , NS , and SOA resource records ( the main resource record types that were interesting to me at the time ) .
All other resource records are decoded as generic resource records and represented as a byte string .
The Lisp implementation decodes all RFC 1035 resource records except WKS .
Any unknown resource record type ( something standardized after RFC 1035 , for instance ) and WKS resource records are decoded as a raw list of byte values .
DNS Record Type Implemented in Java ?
Implemented in Lisp ?
A Yes Yes NS Yes Yes MD No Yes MF No Yes CNAME Yes Yes SOA Yes Yes MB No Yes MG No Yes MR No Yes NULL No Yes WKS No No PTR No Yes HINFO No Yes MINFO No Yes MX Yes Yes TXT No Yes
Table 1 : Resource recording types supported by each implementation
Table 1 summarizes the resource record types decoded by each implementation .
Of the 16 standard record types , the Java implementation handles five while the Lisp implementation handles 15 .
While most of the RFC 1035 resource record types are obsolete or rarely used , the Lisp implementation is far more complete than the Java version .
Implementation Metrics
In this section , I compare the Java and Lisp implementations using a few different metrics .
While the implementations are similar , there are differences that will force me to make multiple comparisons and some estimations .
Table 2 shows the raw data .
Table 2 : Comparison metrics for the Java and Lisp versions
First , I measured the raw line counts of the two implementations .
Two small AWK scripts were written to remove blank lines and full - line comments from both the Java and Lisp versions .
The Lisp version also removed documentation strings from Lisp definitions .
Lines containing just a brace ( “ { ” or “ } ” ) in the Java version or a parenthesis ( “ ( ” or “ ) ” ) in the Lisp version were also removed ( considered a trivial line of code ) .
The Java version was 462 lines of code while the Lisp version was 382 lines , a reduction of 17 % .
While the Lisp version is smaller than the Java version by 80 lines , this initial comparison neglects the difference in functionality between the two versions .
The Lisp version decodes 15 of 16 resource record types and includes a UFFI interface to libresolv.so while the Java version decodes only five resource record types and does not include any code to implement the DNS transmission protocol .
To correct for this , I edited the Lisp version to remove functionality that was not present in the Java version .
The resulting Lisp program was 332 lines long , a reduction of 28 % from the Java version .
Interestingly , the Lisp version was relatively insensitive to the number of resource records decoded .
Because it is written in a largely functional style , most of the code was used to decode the primitive DNS data structures and types .
Very little code was specific to the individual resource record types .
Another method of normalizing the comparison is to estimate the increase in Java code size associated with implementing the 10 extra resource record types decoded by the Lisp version .
This is relatively easy to do .
The average number of lines of each of the five classes implementing the A , CNAME , MX , NS , and SOA record types is 31.2 .
This is a bit skewed , however , because the SOA decoding is very large ( 50 lines ) .
The average of the other four resource records types is 26 lines .
We can estimate the number of lines to implement the other 10 resource record types as 260 lines .
Adding this to the 462 lines already part of the Java implementation yields a total line count of 722 .
Comparing this new estimated Java line count to the 382 actual lines in the Lisp version shows the Lisp version 47 % smaller than the Java version .
The next metric I used to compare the code was the number of Java methods versus the number of Lisp functions and macros .
The Java code contained a total of 47 methods while the Lisp code contained 50 function and macro definitions , a small increase of 6 % .
Again , this neglects the functionality differences between the implementations .
I measured the average number of methods in each of the five classes associated with the resource record types at 4.2 .
We can estimate that implementing another 10 resource record classes would require the creation of about 42 new methods , bringing the total for equivalent functionality to 89 Java methods .
Comparing this new estimation to the original 50 Lisp functions and macros shows a reduction of 44 % for the Lisp version .
While not really indicative of much , it is also interesting to compare the file counts .
The Java version forces a file for every class because of the way that Java implements its source code structure .
The total is 14 classes , or 24 if we estimate the creation of another 10 resource records to normalize the functionality .
The Lisp version only has three source files .
In fact , however , one of the Lisp source files is separate because of packaging conventions .
Another of the Lisp source files is separate to implement a workaround for a popular Common Lisp implementation .
Thus , the Lisp version could have been implemented in a single source file .
Again , this comparison is for informational purposes only and does n't necessarily say much about programmer productivity .
The final metric for comparison is run-time .
I created a small loop in each version that repeatedly passed a buffer containing the result of looking up the findinglisp.com MX record to the decoding routines .
The loop ran 1 million times .
The Java VM implementation was Sun's 1.4.2_02 running under Linux .
The Common Lisp implementation was SBCL 0.8.10 running under Linux .
Both implementations ran on an AMD Athlon XP 2500 + ( “ Barton , ” 1.8 Ghz ) with Fedora Core 1 ( kernel 2.4.22-1.2174.nptl ) .
The Java version took about 29 seconds to decode the buffer 1 million times .
The Lisp version took about 50 seconds to decode the buffer 1 million times , for a decoding time increase of 73 % over the Java version .
Unlike the Prechelt and Gatt studies , the creation of these two implementations were not done under controlled conditions and I did not keep records of the time spent actually creating the code .
In fact , there are a few factors which would skew the results even if I had kept detailed records .
I am very experienced with Java and have been writing Java code for about seven years .
I am very inexperience in writing Common Lisp code .
This project was undertaken to help me learn Lisp after only a couple months of basic Lisp study on nights and weekends .
It represents the first substantial program I have written in Lisp .
The Java code was written using the Eclipse IDE .
Eclipse has substantial programmer automation features that assist with routine coding .
For instance , a programmer can generate import statements for all classes in the current source file with a keystroke and Eclipse has a large set of refactoring commands to make major code restructuring easy .
Much of the time spent writing the Java version was consumed understanding the message coding described in RFC 1035 .
When writing the Lisp version , I had already absorbed most of the complexity in RFC 1035 and the only time spent reading the specification was to understand the particulars of the additional resource record types implemented in the Lisp version .
Analysis
The general conclusion reached after examining the objective metrics is that Lisp is a more efficient language than Java .
The Lisp version was smaller than the Java version in every instance , even when not normalizing the Java code to account for the differences in functionality .
When I made estimates of the Java code size with equivalent functionality , the Lisp code was 47 % smaller by line count and 44 % smaller by number of functions / methods .
Generally speaking , smaller code is better code .
Prechelt noted that programmer productivity measured in lines per hour is roughly constant across all programming languages in his study .
If this is true , a programmer will always finish writing the smaller program first .
It is interesting to analyze exactly why the Java version is longer than the Lisp version .
There are several factors that appear likely :
Java encourages object - oriented decomposition of problems , even when it may not be warranted .
In this case , classes were used for DNS messages and resource records .
While other decompositions could have been done in Java , this decomposition was the most “ natural ” and I would have had to go out of my way to generate something else .
Each class in the program has a prescribed amount of overhead .
Each class requires a file and at least a couple of lines for package info and class declaration .
Lisp has no such requirements .
It would be interesting to see if an object - oriented version using CLOS would have increased the Lisp version 's size substantially .
Object - oriented decomposition forces code to be associated with a specific class .
This leads to some code duplication across classes .
This can be minimized through inheritance and common utility routines , but these have other trade - offs .
Inheritance forces the creation of new intermediate classes with the common code .
Unless the common code is large , the per-class overhead associated with the intermediate class can be a large fraction of the savings associated with centralizing the code .
Utility routines may require complex interfaces since they do not necessarily have access to the private and protected data members of classes on which they operate .
Java import statements measured 26 lines alone , more than 5 % of the total Java line count .
Fortunately , tools like Eclipse can create these automatically and keep them updated with relatively little trouble .
However , Eclipse also tends to increase the number of import statements because human programmers would be tempted to use wild - card import statements ( “ import package . * ; ” ) instead of creating individual import statements for those classes actually used ( “ import package.class1 ; import package.class2 ; ” ) .
Lisp supports lists as a native data type with almost seamless usage .
Lists can be constructed and deconstructed with very little source code overhead .
Java includes lists as a standard data type in the java.util package , but there is no special status for lists and the language syntax is not specialized to handle them well .
In contrast , arrays have tighter syntax in Java than in Lisp .
Java includes type declarations .
While Lisp allows a programmer to include type declarations to improve compiler efficiency , they are not mandatory .
Java requires that every variable have a type .
Most type declarations can be hidden in Java by declaring the type at the point of first use ( “ int foo = ... ” ) .
In some cases this can not be done .
Lisp macros can eliminate large amounts of code by removing redundancy .
The Lisp code makes use of a 15 - line macro to eliminate upwards of 50 lines of rote coding .
In certain cases , macro usage can be truly amazing , generating hundreds or even thousands of lines of code from very small programmer written source code specifications .
The only area where the Lisp program seems to fall down is with runtime performance .
The Lisp code saw a 73 % increase in run time versus the Java code .
There are a few possible explanations for this :
First , the two programs differed slightly in how they access the data buffer holding the DNS reply message that is being decoded .
The Java version uses a Java ByteBuffer which wraps a standard byte array .
All access to the byte array remains in the Java runtime .
The Lisp version uses UFFI deref - array function calls to “ peek ” at the data one byte at a time .
The Java array accesses are probably compiled into efficient machine code by the Sun Hotspot compiler while the deref - array calls are macro- expanded into SBCL FFI function calls which have a higher overhead .
Both Java and Common Lisp use garbage collection to manage memory .
The decoding routines allocate lots of memory to store the decoded data items .
When running in a loop of 1 million decodes , the garbage collector associated with both implementations is going to be stressed .
The Sun Hotspot GC routines have been optimized extensively over two or three releases .
It is not clear that SBCL has optimized its GC routines as much as the Sun Hotspot VM .
Java has strong typing .
Every variable must have a type and the compiler and VM JIT are free to use this typing information to optimize runtime performance .
Lisp allows the programmer to include typing information but it is not mandatory .
In some cases , the Lisp compiler can use type inference to determine variable types without the programmer 's help .
In cases where this cannot be done and the programmer does not specify type information , the Lisp compiler must make conservative code - generation choices that preserve Lisp semantics .
For instance , the compiler may be forced to call a function to perform generic arithmetic rather than use a single efficient machine instruction .
The Lisp Resolver implementation uses some type declarations in the lowest - level functions but may be missing additional opportunities for optimization .
A more experienced Lisp programmer may be able to do better .
Conclusion
Comparisons between the Java and Lisp versions of DNS message decoding support the conclusion that Lisp is a more efficient language than Java .
The Lisp version was 47 % smaller than the Java version when measured by line count with equivalent functionality .
The Lisp version had 44 % fewer functions / methods .
The only area where the Lisp version did not seem better than the Java version was on runtime performance .
The Lisp version had 73 % greater run time than the Java version .
Some of this performance difference may be attributable to factors outside of the language itself , such as implementation optimizations .
Given a constant programmer productivity across programming languages , as measured in lines of code per hour , a programmer should produce the Lisp version of the program much faster than the Java version ( in almost half the time ) .
The smaller code size should also lead to fewer defects over time .

This is how they treat Americans By Adrian Duyzer
Published December 04 , 2006
( First published on Ade 's blog )
" One spring day during his three and a half years as an enemy combatant , " the New York Times reports , " Jose Padilla experienced a break from the monotony of his solitary confinement in a bare cell in the brig at the Naval Weapons Station in Charleston , S.C. "
Padilla was taken to the dentist that day and for whatever reason , his trip was videotaped .
That tape is one of the few glimpses into his incarceration .
Padilla , an American citizen , was accused of plotting a dirty bomb attack but was not charged ( his status has since been changed to criminal defendant and he awaits trial on other , lesser charges ) .
He was held for 21 months without seeing a lawyer .
His interrogations included " hooding , stress positions , assaults , threats of imminent execution and the administration of ' truth serums ' , " according to his lawyers .
His lawyers also say he was " held alone in a 10 - cell wing of the brig ; that he had little human contact other than with his interrogators ; that his cell was electronically monitored and his meals were passed to him through a slot in the door ; that windows were blackened , and there was no clock or calendar ; and that he slept on a steel platform after a foam mattress was taken from him , along with his copy of the Koran , 'as part of an interrogation plan ' " .
Jose Padilla
This is how they treat American citizens .
How do you suppose they treat everyone else ?
What if one day they " detain " you or me ?

Homeless children sit along a road outside a temple in New Delhi April 2 , 2007 .
Traffickers are selling children in India for amounts that are often lower than the cost of animals and most of them end up working as laborers or commercial sex workers , activists said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Tanushree Punwani
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - Traffickers are selling children in India for amounts that are often lower than the cost of animals and most of them end up working as laborers or commercial sex workers , activists said on Tuesday .
“ Children are purchased like buffaloes , ” said Bhuvan Ribhu of Bachpan Bachao Andolan ( Save the Childhood Movement ) , quoting a study that is due to be released later this year .
“ While buffaloes may cost up to 15,000 rupees ( $ 350 ) , children are sold at prices between 500 and 2,000 rupees ( $ 12 and $ 45 ) , ” he told Reuters .
For instance , two brothers in Bihar were recently given away for 250 rupees ( $ 6 ) each by their parents and trafficked out of the state in connivance with police , Ribhu said .
The group estimates that children account for 40 to 50 percent of all victims of human trafficking .
They are sold to work as domestic laborers , or in the carpet industry , on farms or as commercial sex workers .
The traffickers - police connection was so strong in some parts of the country that traffickers scout freely and children rescued from brothels and bonded labor were often victims again , he said .
The more you work , the more you get done , right ?
Well , I ’d like to encourage you to take the “ Four - Day Challenge . ”
Article Continues Below
The problem #section2
If you ’re like most people , you ’ve got too much to do and not enough time to do it .
The e-mail inbox is always overflowing and the list of to - dos never ends .
You always feel that twinge of guilt because you ’re never spending quite enough time on what you should be .
What ’s even more frustrating is that the more you work , the more it seems there is to do .
Argh !
So how do we manage the madness ?
The challenge #section3
My wife and I were recently having a conversation about our working schedule and our quality of life .
We were getting extremely busy and both of us were feeling pretty stressed out .
Between running Carson Workshops , building web apps like DropSend , organizing BD4D , updating Bare Naked App , and maintaining Vitamin , there just was n’t enough time to get everything done .
Gillian ( my wife ) said , “ Why do n’t we try working four days a week and see how it goes ?
It will give us more time to relax . ”
I thought the idea was ridiculous .
How in the sam hill would we be able to get everything done ?
We have way too much to do in five days a week , let alone four .
And then it hit me : there will always be more to do .
Working more wo n’t change that .
In fact , working more is actually counter - productive .
I was starting work everyday at 5:30 AM and working till 10:00 PM , but I still was n’t done with everything .
If I was working those extreme hours and still could n’t keep up with my to - dos , then clearly working more was n’t the solution .
The problem was n’t a time issue , it was a mental issue .
I knew I had a whole week to finish my work , so I spread it out over five ( or seven ! ) days .
If I knew I only had four days to finish a whole week of work , it would ’ve motivated me to get things done more efficiently .
So here ’s the challenge : work fewer hours .
How to make it happen#section4
So working less sounds great , but how does it work in the real world ?
It will depend on two main things :
Whether or not you are self - employed
If you sell products or services
If you work for yourself #section5
When you ’re self - employed , you have complete control over your schedule .
You can decide what days you work and how long you work each day .
Gill and I work Monday to Thursday from 9 AM to 6 PM .
It does n’t really matter how you do it , as long as you limit your work week .
If you work for someone else #section6
If you have a normal 9 - to - 5 job , you might be thinking “ Well that ’s great for you Ryan .
You can control your work week .
My boss will fire me if I propose working a four - day week ! ”
And you ’re probably right .
However , you can take the challenge in many different ways .
Instead of getting into work early and finishing late , tell yourself that you have exactly eight hours to finish all your work for the day .
Set a mental barrier at the end of the day and know that you will shut down your computer and pack your bags exactly at five o’clock .
When you tell yourself that you ’ve only got a limited amount of time to do a huge amount of things , you ’ll find it helps you focus and work faster .
Products vs. services #section7
Working a four - day week is much harder if you run a service - based company .
For instance , design companies will have to really work hard to keep a four - day week , simply because clients will expect you to be in the office five days a week .
If this is you , I ’d like you to ask yourself this question : “ Does my job facilitate my life , or does my life facilitate my job ? ” I believe it should be the former .
Yes , you will lose a few clients who expect you to be available at a moments notice , but in the bigger picture , does that matter ?
A possible solution to this problem is moving to a four - day week gradually .
Maybe start working a four - day week just once a month .
Then gradually increase this to twice a month .
Eventually , you ’ll have worked your way up to the entire month and ( hopefully ) your clients will be used to the idea .
Has it worked for us ?
#section8
The proof is in the pudding , right ?
It ’s easy for me to say that Carson Systems works a four - day week , but what actually takes place every week ?
It ’s harder than we thought # section9
What we found is that we were extremely tempted to work on Fridays .
We love what we do , and on top of that , there ’s a heck of a lot of stuff that needs to be done .
Not having that extra day to get things done actually felt a bit stressful at first .
In the first couple of weeks , we ended up working a bit on Friday , and even a little on Sunday .
Hmmmm…clearly we needed to get a bit more serious about implementing this whole four - day work week stuff .
Week three and onwards , I ’m happy to report , we successfully worked a four - day week .
The trick was shifting our mental perception of how long the working week was .
Thursday is the new Friday # section10
It took awhile to see Thursday like it was Friday .
What we realized is that Thursdays became very busy , because we had to finish everything for the week that had n’t been done yet .
We would look at our to - do lists and realize there was still a huge amount of things to be done .
Yikes .
So the result is that Thursdays can be a bit hectic .
Friday would ’ve been hectic anyway though , so why not get the work done one day early ?
Sometimes you ca n’t get it all done # section11
Now that we ’ve been working a four - day week for three months , we ’ve realized that we ca n’t always get the same amount of work done .
Let ’s face it , there are only so many hours in the day , and if you work fewer days , you will inevitably not get as much done .
But in the larger scheme of things , does that really matter ?
Will we lie on our death bed and say “ Damn , I wish I would ’ve got more done at work ? ” I doubt it .
So how ’re the results ?
#section12
Once we trained ourselves to stick to the four - day work week , the benefits were absolutely amazing .
It was like someone had added another Saturday to our week !
On Fridays , we sleep in , fire up the coffee around 9 or 10 AM and then relax around the house or head into town to a coffee shop .
It really is amazing .
We have more peace .
More time to think .
More time to enjoy life .
It ’s fabulous .
Practical tips # section13
If you want to take the challenge , you ’ll find you need to be extremely efficient when you ’re working .
Here are some tips to help you out :
Avoid using instant messaging :
It ’s a constant source of distraction .
Only check your e-mail twice a day :
The surest way to waste time is the ol ’ Send and Receive button .
Stick to what matters :
Take care of the most important stuff first .
Do n’t waste time on low - priority stuff .
( In fact , delete the low priority stuff from your to - do list .
It ’s not going to get done anyway ! ) .
Ask for alone time :
If you need uninterrupted time to get something done , politely notify your co-workers that you ’ll be unavailable for a couple of hours .
Limit blog - reading time :
Set a time limit on your blog reading .
If you do n’t get through all your blogs in that amount of time , hit the trusty “ Mark All As Read ” button and move on .
Make lists :
Write a “ to do ” list for each day ( on paper if you can bear to tear yourself away from Outlook ) .
Put the time - sensitive stuff at the top and be realistic .
Choose three time - intensive things to do and five quick things to do .
Make sure you finish all of them before you leave in the evening .
Restrict meetings :
If you can , restrict the amount of meetings you call , or are involved in .
Meetings drag on and can eat into your day .
Instead aim for one or two meetings per week and plan them carefully to ensure you cover all important topics and keep on track .
Why it matters # section14
So why is it important to work less ?
What ’s the big deal ?
The reason is that when you work less , it gives you more time to experience life and think ; you can use the extra time to not only spend with people you love , take up hobbies , or invest in causes you believe in , but also to have ideas .
Some of our best ideas have come while driving , gardening , reading , or painting on the weekend .
But what if your job is something you enjoy ?
What ’s the harm in working hard and long at it ?
Well , I can fully identify with this .
I absolutely love running Carson Systems .
It ’s fun , challenging , rewarding and profitable .
I often find it hard to work less because I love what I do .
Here ’s the problem though :
When I ’m old , I wo n’t wish that I spent more time building web apps or organizing events .
Spending time with people I loved or helping people is what will really have mattered to me .
Working less gives you the time to do it and also rejuvenates the brain cells so that you can come back to your work with a fresh outlook .
Variety is key .
Challenge the system # section15
What this article is really about is encouraging you to challenge what society tells you to do .
Is it written in stone somewhere that “ Thou Shalt Work a 40 Hour Week ” ?
A lot of the constraints and barriers we place on ourselves are completely unnecessary and even worse , keep us from being happy .
My hope is that taking the Four - Day Challenge will help you enjoy life more and pursue what really matters to you .

I am SICK of all this bullshit people are writing about the Iraq war .
I am abso - fucking - lutely sick to death of it .
What the fuck do most of you know about it ?
You watch it on TV and read the commentaries in the newspaper or Newsweek or whatever god damn yuppie news rag you subscribe to and think you 're all such fucking experts that you can scream at each other like five year old about whether you 're right or not .
Let me tell you something : unless you 've been there , you do n't know a god damn thing about it .
It you have n't been shot at in that fucking hell hole , SHUT THE FUCK UP !
How do I dare say this to you moronic war supporters who are " Supporting our Troops " and waving the flag and all that happy horse shit ?
I 'll tell you why .
I 'm a Marine and I served my tour in Iraq .
My husband , also a Marine , served several .
I left the service six months ago because I got pregnant while he was home on leave and three days ago I get a visit from two men in uniform who hand me a letter and tell me my husband died in that fucking festering sand - pit .
He should have been home a month ago but they extended his tour and now he 's coming home in a box .
You fuckers and that god - damn lying sack of shit they call a president are the reason my husband will never see his baby and my kid will never meet his dad .
And you know what the most fucked up thing about this Iraq shit is ?
They do n't want us there .
They 're not happy we came and they want us out NOW .
We fucked up their lives even worse than they already were and they 're pissed off .
We did n't help them and we 're not helping them now .
That 's what our soldiers are dying for .
Oh while I 'm good and worked up , the government does n't even have the decency to help out the soldiers whos lives they ruined .
If you really believe the military and the government had no idea the veterans ' hospitals were so fucked up , you are a god - damn retard .
They do n't care about us .
We 're disposable .
We 're numbers on a page and they 'd rather forget we exist so they do n't have to be reminded about the families and lives they ruined while they 're sipping their cocktails at another fund raiser dinner .
If they were really concerned about supporting the troops , they 'd bring them home so their families would n't have to cry at a graveside and explain to their children why mommy or daddy is n't coming home .
Because you can't explain it .
We 're not fighting for our country , we 're not fighting for the good of Iraq 's people , we 're fighting for Bush 's personal agenda .
Patriotism my ass .
You know what ?
My dad served in Vietnam and NOTHING HAS CHANGED .
So I 'm pissed .
I 'm beyond pissed .
And I 'm going to go to my husband funeral and recieve that flag and hang it up on the wall for my baby to see when he 's older .
But I 'm not going to tell him that his father died for the stupidty of the American government .
I 'm going to tell him that his father was a hero and the best man I ever met and that he loved his country enough to die for it , because that 's all true and nothing will be solved by telling my son that his father was sent to die by people who did n't care about him at all .
Fuck you , war supporters , George W. Bush , and all the god damn mother fuckers who made the war possible .
I hope you burn in hell .

The Sure Thing Almost Nobody Plays
Imagine you are entering a deluxe , well - appointed casino .
Off the lavish entry foyer , there are two ample gambling wings , one hued in reds , the other in muted greens .
The red wing looks enticing , but if I may insist , let 's first enter the less crowded green rooms to watch the action .
The atmosphere is unhurried , the blackjack tables are sparsely attended , and every player sits behind a mound of green and black chips .
You think at first you 've come to the wrong place .
You see the ordinary table limits , the ordinary clothes , the ordinary games .
But then how did these ordinary people get such piles of money ?
Then it comes to you .
They 're all winning .
In fact , as you walk around the green wing , you hardly can find a losing player .
You know , of course , that the average house take on table games is 5 % , but as you count winning and losing hands , you realize these players are getting a better break .
They seem to be gaining at a rate of 60 % to 40 % .
You start fresh and take another count .
The results are the same .
A pit boss appears at your shoulder .
" Excuse me , " you say , " but can this be right ?
The odds favor the players ? "
" Yes , indeed .
The odds in the green room usually run 60 to 40 .
It 's been that way since we opened . "
" But ... most of the players must go away winners . "
" They sure do .
At those odds , we calculate that 9,999 out of 10,000 make money .
At our high - stakes tables in the back , they do even better , with winners running about 20,000 to 1 .
It 's a good thing we get so few players , or they 'd break the house . "
Somewhat amazed , you thank him and shake your head .
There 's no time to lose , you decide , but you 'll need more than the few dollars you have in your pocket .
You hatch a plan to gather your life savings , come back to the casino , and win the bundle you 've been dreaming of .
On your way out , you glance into the red wing .
The action level is much , much higher .
The room is crowded and fairly roars with excitement .
Can it be even better here , you wonder ?
Curious , you go in .
Players bet multiple table positions , wave frantically for change , entreat the gods for luck .
You see few green and black chips , fewer winning players .
The piles of chips in front of them are dwindling with each hand .
In fact , the odds are worse than normal .
Again , you start to count .
Although the players continue to excitedly toss in their chips , the odds appear to be maybe 60 to 40 in favor of the house .
Once more , your curiosity whetted , you walk over to a pit boss and ask her the odds at these tables .
She tells you what you suspected .
They are 60 to 40 in favor of the casino .
Warming up to the subject , she chuckles and says , " This room coins gold for the casino , the chances are 9,999 in 10,000 rounds that we wind up winners . "
You do n't have to be a genius to see that this is obviously not the place you want to be .
You go home and get your stash .
You return to the casino with your fistful of money , excited , eager for action , all the time figuring how you 'll do even better at the game .
But then a strange thing happens .
You walk into the red wing and start to play .
On Markets and Odds
Sounds like a pleasant dream rapidly degenerating into nightmare .
Yet it happens daily in the market .
Moreover , the odds in the green and red rooms are not just attention grabbers .
They 're very real .
In the marketplace , in fact , some investments steadily make money , while others lose consistently at these identical odds .
Like the casino , most people want investments that have a good chance of beating the market .
Yet , despite considerable time and effort devoted to the mission , they gravitate toward investments where swarms of enthusiastic players are endangering their savings at odds similar to those in the red room .
It seems surrealistic , but it is n't .
Generations of investors have passed up sure things to buy losing investments .
We all know , for instance , that for safety we should invest in treasury bills and government bonds .
The investment environment has changed radically in the postwar period , however , as we 'll see in detail in chapter 13 .
Treasury bills and government bonds , gilt - edged securities for centuries , are now surefire ways to destroy your nest egg .
Conversely , investments always viewed as more speculative , such as common stocks , have become outstanding vehicles to protect and enhance your capital .
Yes , all the prudent rules of saving we learned at our fathers ' knees are out the window .
Since the Second World
War there has been a revolution every bit as violent to the old order of investing as the French Revolution was to the old order of Europe .
Revolution does not have to mean the destruction of your savings .
As the Industrial Revolution shifted fortunes from the titled nobility to entrepreneurs , as the railroad revolution enriched the Vanderbilts and Goulds , as the information revolution enriched the Gateses and Jobses , so this investment revolution , if you know what causes the changing structure , can enrich you .
In each of these revolutions , the odds strongly favored those who found the new road and disfavored those stuck in the same old path .
This book is about odds or probabilities in markets , and how to use them to your advantage .
There are probabilities of success or failure in the marketplace as surely as in gambling , business , or warfare .
Napoleon was the greatest probability player of modern warfare .
Most often outnumbered , he won by moving fast and concentrating his forces on the battlefield on the enemy 's weak points .
Yes , there was brilliance in his strategies , but a good part of his military genius lay in his knowledge of the odds in any situation .
On the first Italian campaign , for instance , he gambled on the perilous dash through Genoese territory rather than throw his ragged , demoralized men against the fortified Alpine passes , and was able to defeat the numerically superior but divided Austrians by keeping his forces unified .
While poised precariously before the gates of Vienna , however , he gave the Viennese a generous treaty rather than take a chance on being cut off from his supplies .
The story is told of Napoleon playing cards with his generals and staff to pass the time en route to Egypt with his invasion fleet .
He heard one of his aides whispering in the background and asked him to speak up .
The aide , fearing for his life , stammered , " I said , General , you are not playing fairly . "
Napoleon said , " That 's true , but I always give the money back at the end of the game . "
General Murat , who was to become one of his legendary Marshals , spoke up with trepidation , though he had always been fearless in battle .
" General , if I may be so bold , can I ask a question ? "
Napoleon nodded and he continued , " If you give the money back , why then do you cheat ? "
Napoleon replied , " Because I want to leave nothing to chance . "
" Interesting story , " you might say , " but how does it apply to the marketplace ? "
Believe it or not , despite appearances , the market does not run on chance or luck .
Like the battlefield , it runs on probabilities and odds .
These control markets every bit as strongly as they do roulette , blackjack , craps , or any other game in a casino .
Unlike Napoleon at cards , we do n't have to cheat , though our survival does depend on staying ahead of the opposition .
As this book will show you , the odds in the marketplace can be turned decisively in your favor .
What is behind the probabilities in markets ?
Is it a new system to divine the future , or differential equations critical to the development of physics and now used extensively in economics ?
Millions of dollars ' worth of the best research money can buy ?
No .
Our probabilities are not built on any of these techniques or on foreseeing the direction of markets , or on any other conventional approach .
Rather they are embedded in investor behavior in the marketplace .
I know it sounds strange .
" Psychology , " some people might snicker , " is the last place in the world to find any sort of reliable odds . "
It 's true all the same .
Betting on well - defined patterns of investor behavior will give you higher probabilities -- strongly backed by statistics -- than any other method of investing in use today .
These are the odds available in the green wing of my imaginary casino .
But how do you arrive at them ?
That is what this book will try to show you .
But the last thing I want to do is ask you to take my advice or anybody else 's on faith .
Too many systems and faith healers already clutter the marketplace .
None that I know of do what they claim -- beat the market .
And most cost .
We will carefully look at the odds of which investment methods work and which do n't , forgetting the popularity of one technique or another .
To start , we 'll look at the two methods heavily favored by knowledgeable investors : the use of professional money managers and the efficient market hypothesis .
The first relies on the " edge " the professional investor can give you by banking on his or her knowledge , skill , and experience to turn the odds in your favor .
Do these professionals understand the new market dynamics that I have discussed briefly ?
Do they win big in this dramatically changed environment ?
To find out , let 's look at the expert record .
Great Expectations
Professional investors manage large pools of money for mutual funds , pension funds , bank trust departments , money management firms , insurance companies , and similar financial institutions .
The assets under their management are growing phenomenally , surpassing $ 14.8 trillion by the end of 1997 , and expanding faster than the GDP ( gross domestic product ) .
They control over 70 % of the trading and 50 % of the stock holdings on the New York Stock Exchange .
Their buying power staggers the imagination .
By 1997 they were estimated to be buying and selling $ 2 trillion of stocks annually , generating $ 10 billion of commissions in the process .
They claim the crown as the elite of their profession .
The professional money manager is believed to bring a new depth of knowledge to securities markets .
Armed with the best research money can buy , and legions of well - trained , battle - hardened colleagues , they were said to have turned the odds decisively in their favor .
The change was welcomed by knowledgeable observers of the financial scene .
They urged the uninformed and emotional small investor to realize that he was ill equipped to deal with the complex modern market and to turn his money over to one of these seasoned pros .
Some writers on the subject have gone so far as to state that the average investor is " obsolete " today .
So , with some knowledge of the role these professionals play in the nation 's finances , we should now ask whether they have indeed brought the Age of Camelot to markets .
Unfortunately , in a word the answer is no .
The great majority of money managers have consistently lagged behind the market averages .
John Bogle , chairman of the Vanguard Group , one of the largest mutual fund organizations in the country , stated that 90 % of money managers underperformed the market in every ten - year period since their performance began to be measured in the early sixties .
Burton Malkiel , a professor of finance at Princeton and author of the widely read A Random Walk Down Wall Street , studied all domestic equity mutual funds and found that they underperformed their market benchmarks from 1971 to 1991 .
Information taken from Morningstar and Lipper Analytical Services , two of the largest services tracking the performance of mutual funds , measured the results for 3 - , 5 - , and 10 - year periods to the third quarter of 1997 for the six major classes of stock funds .
The results appear in Figure 1 - 1 .
As you can see , the market ( as measured by the S&P 500 ) outperformed all categories of mutual funds for all periods ( the one exception was small companies , which provided nominally better returns for five years ) .
Numerous studies by pension - fund consultants , who monitor the results of hundreds , and in some cases thousands , of money managers , have come up with similar findings .
What conclusions can we draw from the tepid performance of professional investors ?
The rational and unemotional professional , according to financial lore , coolly gauges value and buys securities at bargain prices in periods of panic , when the public sells them with no regard to value .
The portfolio manager , the legend continues , sells stocks in periods when the public is enamored with them , pushing prices to mania levels .
Evidence compiled by the Securities and Exchange Commission suggests otherwise .
The much abused and supposedly emotional individual investor sold securities near the 1968 market top and bought at the market bottoms of both 1970 and 1974 .
The institutional investor , on the other hand , bought near market tops and sold at the bottoms .
In the 1987 crash , the individual investor was scarcely involved .
According to SEC records of the crash , almost all of the selling was done by professionals .
The market panic in the third quarter of 1990 , following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , demonstrated once again that professional , not individual , investors were the largest , and often most desperate , sellers .
The same pattern shows clearly with mutual funds .
These funds should be fully invested near market bottoms -- with low cash reserves -- after snapping up bargains dumped on the market by panicky individual investors .
Conversely , near market tops , they should sell heavily , accumulating large cash reserves by taking advantage of the speculative whims of an excited public .
Again , theory and practice diverge widely .
Rather than supporting stocks when prices plummet , they get trampled at the exit .
When prices soar , they buy aggressively .
The pros seem to judge market direction poorly .
Are investment advisory services that sell advice to the public by subscription any better ?
Many of these services , as they readily advertise , aim to get you in near the market bottom and out near the top .
Would you have profited by subscribing to such services ?
Again no .
For years , pundits , myself included , have publicly charted an almost perfect correlation between the investment advice given and the future direction of the market .
Unfortunately , it is almost perfectly wrong .
When advisors go one way , markets go the other .
As the averages approach their highs , larger and larger numbers of advisors become bullish , and as they move toward their lows , an increasing number stampede for the exits .
The fact is so well known on Wall Street that many of us now use the advisory services as a contrarian indicator .
If over 70 % of services wax bullish -- look out -- markets are approaching a high .
Conversely , if 70 % are terrified of the bear , it 's time to buy .
This was true at the market high in 1972 , when 71 % of the services were bullish , at the bottom of the worst market break since the war in late 1974 , when 70 % thought the market was heading south , and just before the Great Bull Market began in the spring of 1982 .
Instead of the market following the advisors , the advisors seem to unerringly follow the market .
What then do we make of these statistics ?
Some skeptics and financial writers ( the two being often difficult to distinguish ) believe the figures indicate professional money management is inept .
The most important service investment management could perform for clients , they might say , would be to walk their dogs or perhaps advise them on their business attire .
Other skeptics have cheerfully suggested that blindfolded chimpanzees heavily fortified with margaritas could outperform the experts by throwing darts at the stock pages .
But humor aside , the knowledge that professionals do not outperform the market has been widely known for a generation .
This is before considering the effects of the investment revolution .
Adjusting for the new financial order , the results only get worse , putting the investor even further behind the eight ball .
No , the odds of winning big do not appear to lie with this group , regardless of how much media attention they get or advertising they chum out .
I opened this chapter by assuring you that investors have an excellent chance of beating the market .
Now we see even the experts cannot keep up with it .
Something obviously is out of whack here , as financial academics began to realize several decades back .
A new world has since been discovered and mapped .
The ivory tower explorers went sailing over seas of data , rather than uncharted oceans , but the attitude was similar .
They were conquering new intellectual realms for the greater glory of academe , making sweeping pronouncements in the process , and coming up with unbeatable odds -- or so they said .
Natives -- money managers , analysts , investors -- beware .
You are about to be conquered .
The New Conquistadors
Some of the country 's best academic minds looked at this problem soon after it was recognized in the early sixties .
The financial professors found a radical new explanation of why professionals do not perform better .
For a while , at least , this seemed to be the stock market 's equivalent of the theory of relativity , the smashing of the atom , or maybe even the fountain of youth .
Using enormous computer power , by the standard of the day , they put forward an all - encompassing theory .
Markets , they said , are efficient .
That meant that stock prices are determined by the thorough and diligent work of the brightest analysts , money managers , and other investors .
The combined knowledge of thousands of these experts kept prices exactly where they should be .
No one can beat the market consistently .
It might be hard to accept what the professors said , but they had proven this truth overwhelmingly .
Besides , there were benefits .
You no longer had to waste endless time and energy trying to outguess the market .
No reason to get stressed out ; it just could n't be done .
But you could still get higher returns .
All you had to do was to take more risk .
So there it was .
Forget the sweating , studying , and tossing and turning you used to do at night trying to buy the right stocks .
It did n't help a hoot .
Investing had been promoted to a science with the mathematical precision of quantum physics .
Just sit back and enjoy the ride .
This major new creed has pervaded our academic institutions for three decades .
Today , it affects almost every aspect of Wall Street thinking from the proper makeup of your retirement funds , to how to select an investment advisor .
It also plays an important role in the decision - making of many large corporations , and influences the SEC and government policymakers .
The hypothesis has been so widely accepted in academic circles and on Wall Street that several of its leading proponents -- Franco Modigliani , Harry Markowitz , William Sharpe , Merton Miller , Myron Scholes -- have received Nobel Prizes for their contributions .
The new theory came at a time when there was little to oppose it .
The old market methods were dying .
None of the ancient rituals seemed to work , no matter how rigorously they were applied , or how extensive the training , experience , or intelligence of the practitioner .
Into this vacuum came the seductive idea of efficient markets , offering a plausible explanation of the professionals ' failure , absolving investors of blame ( for it preached it was not in their power to change things ) .
Order replaced chaos .
Converts flocked to the new gospel by the millions .
The spread of the new faith was not unlike the conquest of the vast Inca empire by Francisco Pizarro and his 180 conquistadors .
Like the conquistadors , the scholars used both the faith and the sword to annihilate the pagans ' beliefs in the marketplace .
If the true faith was not accepted , why then there was the sword -- the unleashing of volleys of awesome statistics disproving everything the professionals believed .
The frightening new weapon of statistical analysis awed the Wall Street heathen more than Pizarro 's cavalry did the Incas , who had never before seen a horse .
What amazes , in looking back , is that the leaders of the new faith subdued millions of investors with a smaller troop than the original conquistadors .
But the golden age of efficient markets was not destined to last .
Smash , boom , bang , along came the 1987 crash and the pillars of the new paradise crumbled .
In retrospect , the elegant hypothesis had a minor hitch .
The professors assumed investors were as emotionless and as efficient as the computers they used to build their theory .
The October 19 , 1987 , crash , 80 % worse than 1929 in percentage terms and over a thousand times larger in actual dollars , showed it just was n't so .
Like a bizarre Rube Goldberg machine , the theoretically flawless trading systems the professors had introduced turned into a monster unleashing massive panic .
The market ended 508 points lower that day .
In five trading days ending on October 19 , the market had lost one - third of its value -- about one trillion dollars .
When the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) opened on the morning of October 20 , the professors ' supposedly foolproof trading mechanisms sent stocks into another devastating free fall .
To end the rout , the NYSE was forced to ban the new academic tools that were supposed to create Eden on Wall Street .
The entire financial system came within a hair 's breadth of disintegration , according to the Brady task force and SEC reports commissioned to study the crash .
The worst crash in modern history was caused by a theory devoid of any understanding of investor psychology .
The academic dogma that investor psychology played absolutely no role in markets justified the new trading mechanisms responsible for the debacle .
This was not something to be faulted only with 20 / 20 hind - sight .
Numerous market observers warned of the impending calamity .
Eighteen months before the crash , the new academic trading strategies caused Representative John Dingle of Michigan , then - chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce , which oversees the SEC , to fear a panic .
John Phelan , then - president of the New York Stock Exchange , had also warned that the interaction of the new academic programs could cause a market meltdown .
" When I first started talking about this in late 1986 , " Phelan was quoted as saying after the crash , " people would do almost anything but physically attack you . "
I was also worried about the dangers inherent in the academic trading systems .
Writing about them in a Forbes column six months before the crash , I noted that the enormous volume in computerized trading programs , portfolio insurance , and numbers of other such strategies all based on financial index futures at low margins , amounted to a potential doomsday machine .
The column concluded that if uncontrolled , these aberrations set up the possibility of a sharp correction , if not a crash , not far down the road .
Even though the most destructive of the low - margined trading systems created by efficient market believers were all but completely dismantled in the next several years , the academics who sponsored them , like the faithful of other disproved scientific theories , hung on tenaciously .
Everything was blamed but the actual reasons as determined by the commissions set up to study the causes of the crash .
To do otherwise would be no less than admitting that the theory was as useful as the eighteenth - century medical belief that bleeding the patient balanced the body 's humors .
No , the revolutionary new ideas that sprouted from ivory towers across the country wo n't give you the odds I 've discussed earlier , or for that matter even keep you afloat .
But though the theory began to disintegrate with the crash , it left an enormous void among investors .
Many of the basic teachings of the efficient market hypothesis ( EMH ) have now have been conclusively refuted by advanced forms of the same statistical analysis that devastated the investment heathen .
Yet contemporary investment practice is built around the belief in efficient markets .
Large numbers of investors , though they believe the theory bankrupt , do n't know where else to turn .
Where then do the odds of market success lie ?
Or are there any real odds at all ?
A Titanic Clash
We find ourselves in the midst of a sea change of thinking in the investment world , one whose ramifications extend far beyond the stock market , and even beyond economics .
Scientists call such changes paradigm shifts .
A paradigm encompasses the working beliefs underlying all theory and research in a particular science .
Paradigms shift rarely , and the shifts are always resisted by the creators of the old system of beliefs .
Bitter polemics and enormous rancor are usually spilled before the change prevails .
Still , it is within this paradigm shift that we will find the key to the winning odds in the marketplace .
It is never easy to give up your most basic beliefs .
As we all know from our school days , the Ptolemaic system , which held that the earth was the center of the universe , resisted change for centuries .
With improved telescopes and more accurate observation , sighting after sighting over the years found planets where the theory stated they should n't be .
The model became increasingly complex in order to incorporate each new piece of information .
The planets and stars moved around the earth in a combination of circles , epicycles , and deferents ( points moving on large circles around which the epicycles simultaneously revolved ) .
The result of this hodgepodge was a mind - boggling whirl .
Still , it took generations for scientists to accept the radically different heliocentric paradigm of planetary motion .
As Paul Samuelson once phrased it , " Scientific progress advances funeral by funeral . "
Markets whirl along in a similar state today .
Each new statistical finding throws the efficient market hypothesis into further disarray and requires additional explanations for the sighting of " anomalies " ruled impossible by the theory .
That said , this book is not a scientific treatise .
But it is important for the reader to have some understanding of the intellectual clashes in investments and economics today , because the winning odds we will examine , and the advice that stems from them , comes from a radically different paradigm than efficient markets , or for that matter conventional Wall Street thinking .
In many ways , it is as different as Copernicus from Ptolemy .
What then do these other methods lack ?
On paper , at least , they have a high probability of success .
The key principle of this book is that people are not the rational , omniscient decision - makers that the efficient market believers claim , and most investment practitioners believe .
Rather , we are constantly pushed or pulled by psychological influences .
To be fair , it is not only these groups who do not understand investor psychology and make major mistakes as a result .
All of us are affected by these powerful but unrecognized influences .
All of us have heard of how investor psychology has turned positive or negative on an industry or company , or on the market as a whole .
All experienced investors have no doubt pondered the extreme psychological variations that markets display over time .
The problem we face is that , although we know much of the cause of success or failure lies largely within the realm of psychology , we really do not understand how and where psychology meshes with investment decisions .
As a result , we make costly and sometimes disastrous errors time and again .
Learning the principles underlying investment behavior will allow us to develop successful market strategies .
The methods have worked well over long periods and should continue to succeed , because they are based on predictable patterns of investor behavior .
These are the odds available in the green wing .
The psychology of market success that I 'll describe is anything but " will - o' - the - wisp . "
Its bedrock is consistent and predictable investor errors in the marketplace .
This bedrock will support a new theory of markets and investing .
As you will see , the assumptions underlying the methods are well documented , both empirically and psychologically .
At every stage of the development of our new strategies , I 'll demonstrate the strong statistical proof the probabilities are built upon .
What we will see is that not only do investors go wrong , they go wrong in a systematic and predictable manner .
So predictable , in fact , that consistent investment strategies can be built on their mistakes .
More than that we can calculate odds on how well our strategies will work over varying periods , in a similar manner to the gambling casino .
These strategies , as I 'll demonstrate , have worked for generations , and I suspect since the dawn of markets .
That is , if human behavior has n't changed .
How and why these probabilities work is what this book is about .
In examining them we will go far beyond markets , to some seemingly universal laws of human behavior .
People encountering the same situation will act the same , within the marketplace or outside of it .
Our new investment approach stands on market history , on the latest psychological research , and on thorough statistical analysis .
I hope to demonstrate that we can harness psychology and use it systematically to attain our investment goals .
But before we attempt it , we must understand just how powerful these forces are , and why they lead most of us into the red rather than the green rooms .
This is the reason why most investors , including the experts , underperform the market averages over time .
The Journey Ahead
The journey will be wide - ranging both in time and breadth .
We will examine markets , psychology , finance , economics , statistics , even politics .
Part of the text will naturally be somber , but it will have its lighter moments .
I wrote in Psychology and the Stock Market over twenty years ago that " the integration of financial and psychological understanding is a new and basically uncharted field . "
To my amazement , the whole new field of behavioral finance has sprung up since .
Psychologists , economists , and investment academics are now beginning to study markets and are finding anything but rational behavior .
Their major new research can be of profound benefit to you .
Once you understand the principles , there is nothing magical or mysterious about the work .
To return to that great probability player of warfare again , Napoleon once asked , " Is it because they are lucky that [ great men ] become great ?
No , but being great they have been able to master luck . "
While no book can teach you how to make a " great " fortune , I believe this one can give you a much better chance of mastering your luck in markets .
Once you see the odds , all you need is an open mind and the courage of your convictions .
I am convinced that today the individual investor has an exceptional opportunity to beat both the market and the experts .
If you are a serious investor , I think our journey will prove rewarding .
I had originally intended to write some code to simulate quantum computers and implement some quantum algorithms .
I ’ll probably eventually do that but today I just want to look at quantum mechanics in its own right as a kind of generalisation of probability .
This is probably going to be the most incomprehensible post I ’ve written in this blog .
On the other hand , even though I eventually talk about the philosophy of quantum mechanics , there ’s some Haskell code to play with at every stage , and the codeives the same results as appear in physics papers , so maybe that will help give a handle on what I ’m saying .
First get some Haskell fluff out of the way :
> import Prelude hiding ( repeat ) > import Data.Map ( toList , fromListWith ) > import Complex > infixl 7 .*
Now define certain types of vector spaces .
The idea is the a W b a is a vector in a space whose basis elements are labelled by objects of type a and where the coefficients are of type p .
> data W b a = W { runW :: [ ( a , b ) ] } deriving ( Eq , Show , Ord )
This is very similar to standard probability monads except that I ’ve allowed the probabilities to be types other than Float .
Now we need a couple of ways to operate on these vectors .
mapW allows the application of a function transforming the probabilities …
> mapW f ( W l ) = W $ map ( \( a , b ) -> ( a , f b ) ) l
and fmap applies a function to the basis element labels .
> instance Functor ( W b ) where > fmap f ( W a ) = W $ map ( \( a , p ) -> ( f a , p ) ) a
We want our vectors to support addition , multiplication , and actually form a monad .
The definition of >>= is similar to that for other probability monads .
Note how vector addition just concatenates our lists of probabilities .
The problem with this is that if we have a vector like we ’d like it to be reduced to but in order to do that we need to be able to spot that the two terms and both contain multiples of the same vector , and to do that we need the fact that the labels are instances of Eq .
Unfortunately we can’t do this conveniently in Haskell because of the lack of restricted datatypes and so to collect similar terms we need to use a separate collect function :
> instance Num b =>
Monad ( W b ) where > return x = W [ ( x,1 ) ] > l >>= f = W $ concatMap ( \( W d , p ) -> map ( \( x , q ) - > ( x , p*q ) ) d ) ( runW $ fmap f l ) > a .* b = mapW ( a* ) b > instance ( Eq a , Show a , Num b ) =>
Num ( W b a ) where >
W a +
W b = W $ ( a ++ b ) > a - b = a + ( - 1 ) .* b > _ * _ = error " Num is annoying " > abs _ = error " Num is annoying " > signum _ = error " Num is annoying " > fromInteger a = if a==0 then W [ ] else error " fromInteger can only take zero argument " > collect :: ( Ord a , Num b ) => W b a ->
W b a > collect = W . toList . fromListWith (+ ) .
runW
Now we can specialise to the two monads that interest us :
> type P a = W Float a > type Q a = W ( Complex Float ) a
P is the ( hopefully familiar if you ’ve read Eric ’s recent posts ) probability monad .
But Q allows complex probabilities .
This is because quantum mechanics is a lot like probability theory with complex numbers and many of the rules of probability theory carry over .
Suppose we have a ( non-quantum macroscopic ) coin that we toss .
It ’s state might be described by :
> data Coin = Heads |
Tails deriving ( Eq , Show , Ord ) > coin1 = 0.5 .* return Heads + 0.5 .* return Tails :: P Coin
Suppose that if Albert sees a coin that is heads up he has a 50 % chance of turning it over and if he sees a coin that is tails up he has a 25 % chance of turning it over .
We can describe Albert like this :
> albert Heads = 0.5 .* return Heads + 0.5 .* return Tails > albert Tails = 0.25 .* return Heads + 0.75 .* return Tails
We can now ask what happens if Albert sees a coin originally turned up heads n times in a row :
> repeat 0 f = id > repeat n f = repeat ( n - 1 ) f . f > (->-) :: a -> ( a -> b ) -> b > g ->- f = f g > (-><) :: Q a -> ( a -> Q b ) -> Q b > g ->< f = g >>= f > albert1 n = return Heads ->- repeat n (->< albert ) ->- collect
Let me explain those new operators .
->- is just function application written from left to right .
The > in the middle is intended to suggest the direction of data flow .
->< is just >>= but I ’ve written it this way with the final < intended to suggest the way a function a -> M b ‘ fans out ’ .
Anyway , apropos of nothing else , notice how Albert approaches a steady state as n gets larger .
Quantum mechanics works similarly but with the following twist .
When we come to observe the state of a quantum system it undergoes the following radical change :
> observe :: Ord a => Q a ->
P a > observe = W . map ( \( a, w ) -> ( a , magnitude ( w*w ) ) ) . runW .
collect
Ie . the quantum state becomes an ordinary probabilistic one .
This is called wavefunction collapse .
Before collapse , the complex weights are called ‘ amplitudes ’ rather than probabilities .
The business of physicists is largely about determining what these amplitudes are .
For example , the well known Schrödinger equations is a lot like a kind of probabilistic diffusion , like a random walk , except with complex probabilities instead of amplitudes .
( That ’s why so many physicists have been hired into finance firms in recent years – stocks follow a random walk which has formal similarities to quantum physics . )
The rules of quantum mechanics are a bit like those of probability theory .
In probability theory the sum of the probabilites must add to one .
In addition , any process ( like albert ) must act in such a way that if the input sum of probabilities is one , then so is the output .
This means that probabilistic process are stochastic .
In quantum mechanics the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the amplitudes must be one .
Such a state is called ‘ normalised ’ .
All processes must be such that normalised inputs go to normalised outputs .
Such processes are called unitary ones .
There ’s a curious subtlety present in quantum mechanics .
In classical probability theory you need to have the sum of the probabilities of your different events to sum to one .
But it ’s no good having events like “ die turns up 1 ” , “ die turns up 2 ” , “ die turns up even ” at the same time .
“ die turns up even ” includes “ die turns up 2 ” .
So you always need to work with a mutually exclusive set of events .
In quantum mechanics it can be pretty tricky to figure out what the mutually exclusive events are .
For example , when considering the spin of an electron , there are no more mutually exclusive events beyond “ spin up ” and “ spin down ” .
You might think “ what about spin left ? ” .
That ’s just a mixture of spin up and spin down – and that fact is highly non-trivial and non-obvious .
But I do n’t want to discuss that now and it wo n’t affect the kinds of things I ’m considering below .
So here ’s an example of a quantum process a bit like albert above .
For any angle , rotate turns a boolean state into a mixture of boolean states .
For it just leaves the state unchanged and for it inverts the state so it corresponds to the function Not .
But for it does something really neat : it is a kind of square root of Not .
Let ’s see it in action :
> rotate :: Float -> Bool -> Q Bool > rotate theta
True = let theta ' = theta :+ 0 > in cos ( theta ' / 2 ) .* return
True - sin ( theta ' /2 ) .* return False > rotate theta
False = let theta ' = theta :+ 0 > in cos ( theta ' / 2 ) .* return False + sin ( theta ' /2 ) .* return True > snot = rotate ( pi/2 ) > repeatM n f = repeat n ( >>= f ) > snot1 n = return True ->- repeatM n snot ->- observe
We can test it by running snot1 2 to see that two applications take you to where you started but that snot1 1 gives you a 50/50 chance of finding True or False .
Nothing like this is possible with classical probability theory and it can only happen because complex numbers can ‘ cancel each other out ’ .
This is what is known as ‘ destructive interference ’ .
In classical probability theory you only get constructive interference because probabilities are always positive real numbers .
( Note that repeatM is just a monadic version of repeat – we could have used it to simplify albert1 above so there ’s nothing specifically quantum about it . )
Now for two more combinators :
> ( =>= ) :: P a -> ( a -> b ) -> P b > g =>= f = fmap f g > ( =><) :: P ( Q a ) -> ( a -> Q b ) -> P ( Q b ) > g =>< f = fmap ( >>= f ) g
The first just uses fmap to apply the function .
I ’m using the = sign as a convention that the function is to be applied not at the top level but one level down within the datastructure .
The second is simply a monadic version of the first .
The reason we need the latter is that we ’re going to have systems that have both kinds of uncertainty – classical probabilistic uncertainty as well as quantum uncertainty .
We ’ll also want to use the fact that P is a monad to convert doubly uncertain events to singly uncertain ones .
That ’s what join does :
> join :: P ( P a ) ->
P a > join = ( >>= id )
OK , that ’s enough ground work .
Let ’s investigate a physical process that can be studied in the lab : the Quantum Zeno effect , otherwise known as the fact that a watched pot never boils .
First an example related to snot1 :
> zeno1 n = return True ->- repeatM n ( rotate ( pi/ fromInteger n ) ) ->- collect ->- observe
The idea is that we ‘ rotate ’ our system through an angle but we do so in n stages .
The fact that we do it in n stages makes no difference , we get the same result as doing it in one go .
The slight complication is this : suppose we start with a probabilistic state of type P a .
If we let it evolve quantum mechanically it ’ll turn into something of type P ( Q a ) .
On observation we get something of type P ( P a ) .
We need join to get a single probability distribution of type P a .
The join is nothing mysterious , it just combines the outcome of two successive probabilistic processes into one using the usual laws of probability .
But here ’s a variation on that theme .
Now we carry out n stages , but after each one we observe the system causing wavefunction collapse :
> zen o2 n = return True ->- repeat n ( > \x -> x =>= return =>< rotate ( pi / fromInteger n ) =>= observe ->- join > ) ->- collect
Notice what happens .
In the former case we flipped the polarity of the input .
In this case it remains closer to the original state .
The higher we make n the closer it stays to its original state .
( Not too high , start with small n .
The code suffers from combinatorial explosion . )
Here ‘s a paper describing the actual experiment .
Who needs all that messing about with sensitive equipment when you have a computer ? 🙂
A state of the form P ( Q a ) is called a mixed state .
Mixed states can get a bit hairy to deal with as you have this double level of uncertainty .
It can get even trickier because you can sometimes observe just part of a quantum system rather than the whole system like oberve does .
This inevitably leads mixed states .
von Neumann came up with the notion of a density matrix to deal with this , although a P ( Q a ) works fine too .
I also have a hunch there is an elegant way to handle them through an object of type P ( Q ( Q a ) ) that will eliminate the whole magnitude squared thing .
However , I want to look at the quantum Zeno effect in another way that ultimately allows you deal with mixed states in another way .
Unfortunately I do n’t have time to explain this elimination today , but we can look at the general approach .
In this version I ’m going to consider a quantum system that consists of the logical state in the Zeno examples , but also include the state of the observer .
Now standard dogma says you ca n’t ca n’t form quantum states out of observers .
In other words , you ca n’t form Q Observer where Observer is the state of the observer .
It says you can only form P Observer .
Whatever .
I ’m going to represent an experimenter using a list that representing the sequence of measurements they have made .
Represent the complete system by a pair of type ( [ Bool ] , Bool ) .
The first element of the pair is the experimenter ’s memory and the second element is the state of the boolean variable being studied .
When our experimenter makes a measurement of the boolean variable , its value is simply prepended to his or her memory :
> zeno3 n = return ( [ ] , True ) ->- repeatM n ( > \ ( m , s ) -> do > s' <- rotate ( pi / fromInteger n ) s > return ( s:m , s ' ) > ) ->- observe =>= snd ->- collect
Note how we now delay the final observation until the end when we observe both the experimenter and the poor boolean being experimented on .
We want to know the probabilities for the final boolean state so we apply snd so as to discard the state of the observer ’s memory .
Note how we get the same result as zen o2 .
( Note no mixed state , just an expanded quantum state that collapses to a classical probabilistic state . )
There ’s an interesting philosophical implication in this .
If we model the environment ( in this case the experimenter is part of that environment ) as part of a quantum system , we do n’t need all the intermediate wavefunction collapses , just the final one at the end .
So are the intermediate collapses real or not ?
The interaction with the environment is known as decoherence and some hope that wavefunction collapse can be explained away in terms of it .
Anyway , time for you to go and do something down - to - earth like gardening .
Me , I ’m washing the kitchen floor …
I must mention an important cheat I made above .
When I model the experimenter ’s memory as a list I ’m copying the state of the measured experiment into a list .
But you ca n’t simply copy data into a quantum register .
One way to see this is that unitary processes are always invertible .
Copy data into a register destroys the value that was there before and hence is not invertible .
So instead , imagine that we really have an array that starts out zeroed out and that each time something is added to the list , the new result is xored into the next slot in the array .
The list is just non-unitary looking , but convenient , shorthand for this unitary process .
PS I ’m not convinced this LateX stuff is working .
If something does n’t make sense , looking around for equations that might have floated away 🙂 PPS wordpress teething troubles !
I see that despite LaTeX support , wordpress is even more annoying than blogger in its handling of less than and greater than .
It actually discards your HTML source sometimes .
I ’ve fixed one bit of discarded text .
Additionally it also seems to discard backslash for no good reason .
If you see something of the form a -> b it probably ought to be “ backslash ” a -> b.
Apart from that , the code seems to work when copied and pasted from the blog into ghc .

On Friday , Mark Foley the Republican Representative from Florida resigned from Congress .
He had been caught sending dirty email messages to an underage Congressional page .
One of the texts went like this :
" What are ya wearing ? " - Republican Congressional Representative Mark Foley
" Tshirts and shorts . " - Teenage boy
" Love to slip them off of you . " - Republican Congressional Representative Mark Foley
Here 's some things about Mark Foley .
He had led Congressional efforts to protect children .
He started a restaurant when he was only 20 years old .
He was named a deputy whip by disgraced Republican Congressman Tom DeLay .
He was a frequent guest on Bill O'Reilly .
His name will still be on the ballot representing Republicans in the election this November .
What 's illuminating here is not that a pedophile held Congressional office .
That 's just sad and awful , especially for the children he took advantage of and exploited .
What 's illuminating is the Congressman 's behavior .
Sending text messages and emails ?
As if he could never be caught ; as if he was invulnerable .
And it 's exactly the kind of arrogance and poor judgement that has come to dominate the Republican Party .
Like Bob Ney and Duke Cunningham who brazenly accepted bribes and illegal campaign contributions .
Same with Tom DeLay .
Worse , like George Bush and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , tirelessly insisting we 're winning , things are getting better in Iraq , when anybody can see they 're getting worse .
As if the truth wo n't come out .
It 's a culture of corruption that believes it can never get caught .
The Republican Party ( which turns out to have known about Foley 's indiscretions for months ) has become the nexus for bad judgement , criminality , hubris , and lies .
Mark
Foley got caught not because he 's a pedophile , but because he 's a dumb pedophile .
Cunningham and Ney are doing jail time not because they took bribes but because they were blatant , too sure of themselves .
It 's the same kind of thinking that has turned everything else in this administration so bad .
Mark Foley is a sad , sick individual and I 'm not capable of feeling sympathy for those that prey on the young so I wo n't pretend to .
Frankly , I know too many people that have never recovered after becoming victims to people like Mr. Foley .
But beyond all of that is his ignorance , the fact that he would leave a paper trail straight to his congressional office - he is also a symbol of everything wrong with a Republican Party that has rotted from within .

At NASA , Windows Vista Is n't Ready For Launch
Space agency among the growing list of federal agencies that have put a temporary hold on Windows Vista rollouts .
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is the latest federal agency to put a hold on PC upgrades to Windows Vista .
NASA has decided against deploying Microsoft 's five - month - old operating system anytime this year .
The decision puts NASA in company with the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation , both of which in February revealed temporary bans on Vista .
NASA has set January 2008 as a " target " for beginning the transition from Windows XP to Vista , according to a spokesman for the federal agency , which has approximately 60,000 Windows PCs .
NASA typically waits until a service pack is released for any new operating system to ensure stability , the spokesman says .
( Microsoft has not indicated when it will release a service pack for Vista . )
The interim also will be used to ensure that NASA 's applications are compatible with Vista and that its PCs meet the hardware requirements needed to run the operating system .
In a meeting with IT professionals and user - group representatives last week on Microsoft 's campus , CEO Steve Ballmer rejected an assertion by a NASA computer scientist that Vista has been banned by most sectors of the federal government .
" Vista has been anything but banned from most parts of the U.S. federal government , " Ballmer said , adding that he anticipated near - term adoption in " a number " of government accounts .
He stopped short , however , of naming any government agencies that are in the process of deploying Vista or about to do so .

Below are excerpts selected by Sharon Begley , Wall Street Journal science
columnist , from her own book , “ Train Your Mind , Change Your Brain . ”
The subject–mind over matter –would have been off - limits just a few years
ago when biological psychiatry held an iron grip on scientific discourse
about the brain , having banished even the concept of mind .
Neuroscience was revolutionized in 2004 when it was discovered contrary to
previous dogma , that brain neurotransmitters are plastic rather than rigid .
Adult brains , it was discovered , were plastic and changeable .
The brain’s
neuroplasticity means that the brain has the ability to change its structure
and function in response to experience .
Begley writes that the Dali Lama added another dimension : namely , the theory
that the mind has the ability –through directed meditation ( rigorous
thinking ) to change the brain as well .
This , I believe , may be a scientific turning point away from the dogma of
biological psychiatry and its reductionist approach to mental functions .
That mechanistic simplification of the human dimension is likely to be
relegated to the dust heap of history ’s long trail of failed theories .
The challenge posed by Canadian neuroscientist , Helen Mayberg , who in 2002
discovered that placebos - sugar pills –work the same way on the brains of
depressed people as antidepressants do , has never been addressed by
psychiatry ’s leadership .
She reported that in both groups : “ Activity in the
frontal cortex , the seat of higher thought , increased ; activity in limbic
regions , which specialize in emotions , fell . ”
However , when using brain imaging to measure activity in the brains of
depressed adults comparing brain responses of patients prescribed an
antidepressant ( Paxil ) compared to patients receiving cognitive behavioral
therapry , Dr. Mayberg and colleagues at the University of Toronto were
surprised by their findings .
They reported that all the patients ’
depression lifted , regardless of whether their brains were infused with a
powerful drug or with a different way of thinking .
Yet the only “ drugs ” that
the cognitive - therapy group received were their own thoughts .
The scientists scanned their patients ’ brains again , expecting that the
changes would be the same no matter which treatment they received , as Dr.
Mayberg had found in her placebo study .
But no .
“ We were totally dead
wrong , ” she says .
“ Cognitive - behavior therapy muted overactivity in the frontal cortex , the
seat of reasoning , logic , analysis and higher thought .
The antidepressant
raised activity there .
Cognitive - behavior therapy raised activity in the
limbic system , the brain ’s emotion center .
The drug lowered activity there .
With cognitive therapy , says Dr. Mayberg , the brain is rewired “ to adopt
different thinking circuits . ”
Thus , those patients who received cognitive
therapy learned not to catastrophize .
They were taught to break their habit
of interpreting every little setback as a calamity , as when they conclude
from a lousy date that no one will ever love them . ”
The possibility of reshaping one ’s emotions by redirecting one ’s own thought
process–opens the way toward changing people ’s perceptions about themselves
and others–violence ( and wars ) could be rendered as obsolete , unacceptable
solutions to resolving disputes .
In that case , there may be real hope for the human race to survive the
current era of bloodshed .

How Thinking Can Change the Brain
Dalai Lama Helps Scientists
Show the Power of the Mind To Sculpt Our Gray Matter January 19 , 2007 ; Page B1
Although science and religion are often in conflict , the Dalai Lama takes a
different approach .
Every year or so the head of Tibetan Buddhism invites a
group of scientists to his home in Dharamsala , in Northern India , to discuss
their work and how Buddhism might contribute to it .
In 2004 the subject was
neuroplasticity , the ability of the brain to change its structure and
function in response to experience .
The following are vignettes adapted from
“ Train Your Mind , Change Your Brain , ” which describes this emerging area of
science :
BOOK EXCERPT
Adapted from “ Train Your Mind , Change Your Brain ” , by Sharon Begley .
Ms .
Begley writes the weekly Science column for The Wall Street Journal .
The Dalai Lama , who had watched a brain operation during a visit to an
American medical school over a decade earlier , asked the surgeons a
startling question : Can the mind shape brain matter ?
Over the years , he said , neuroscientists had explained to him that mental
experiences reflect chemical and electrical changes in the brain .
When
electrical impulses zip through our visual cortex , for instance , we see ;
when neurochemicals course through the limbic system we feel .
But something had always bothered him about this explanation , the Dalai Lama
said .
Could it work the other way around ?
That is , in addition to the brain
giving rise to thoughts and hopes and beliefs and emotions that add up to
this thing we call the mind , maybe the mind also acts back on the brain to
cause physical changes in the very matter that created it .
If so , then pure
thought would change the brain ’s activity , its circuits or even its
structure .
One brain surgeon hardly paused .
Physical states give rise to mental states ,
he asserted ; “ downward ” causation from the mental to the physical is not
possible .
The Dalai Lama let the matter drop .
This was n’t the first time a
man of science had dismissed the possibility that the mind can change the
brain .
But “ I thought then and still think that there is yet no scientific
basis for such a categorical claim , ” he later explained .
“ I am interested in
the extent to which the mind itself , and specific subtle thoughts , may have
an influence upon the brain . ”
The Dalai Lama had put his finger on an emerging revolution in brain
research .
In the last decade of the 20th century , neuroscientists overthrew
the dogma that the adult brain ca n’t change .
To the contrary , its structure
and activity can morph in response to experience , an ability called
neuroplasticity .
The discovery has led to promising new treatments for
children with dyslexia and for stroke patients , among others .
But the brain changes that were discovered in the first rounds of the
neuroplasticity revolution reflected input from the outside world .
For
instance , certain synthesized speech can alter the auditory cortex of
dyslexic kids in a way that lets their brains hear previously garbled
syllables ; intensely practiced movements can alter the motor cortex of
stroke patients and allow them to move once paralyzed arms or legs .
The kind of change the Dalai Lama asked about was different .
It would come
from inside .
Something as intangible and insubstantial as a thought would
rewire the brain .
To the mandarins of neuroscience , the very idea seemed as
likely as the wings of a butterfly leaving a dent on an armored tank .
Neuroscientist Helen Mayberg had not endeared herself to the pharmaceutical
industry by discovering , in 2002 , that inert pills — placebos — work the
same way on the brains of depressed people as antidepressants do .
Activity
in the frontal cortex , the seat of higher thought , increased ; activity in
limbic regions , which specialize in emotions , fell .
She figured that
cognitive - behavioral therapy , in which patients learn to think about their
thoughts differently , would act by the same mechanism .
At the University of Toronto , Dr. Mayberg , Zindel Segal and their colleagues
first used brain imaging to measure activity in the brains of depressed
adults .
Some of these volunteers then received paroxetine ( the generic name
of the antidepressant Paxil ) , while others underwent 15 to 20 sessions of
cognitive - behavior therapy , learning not to catastrophize .
That is , they
were taught to break their habit of interpreting every little setback as a
calamity , as when they conclude from a lousy date that no one will ever love
them .
All the patients ’ depression lifted , regardless of whether their brains were
infused with a powerful drug or with a different way of thinking .
Yet the
only “ drugs ” that the cognitive - therapy group received were their own
thoughts .
The scientists scanned their patients ’ brains again , expecting that the
changes would be the same no matter which treatment they received , as Dr .
Mayberg had found in her placebo study .
But no .
“ We were totally dead
wrong , ” she says .
Cognitive - behavior therapy muted overactivity in the
frontal cortex , the seat of reasoning , logic , analysis and higher thought .
The antidepressant raised activity there .
Cognitive - behavior therapy raised
activity in the limbic system , the brain ’s emotion center .
The drug lowered
activity there .
With cognitive therapy , says Dr. Mayberg , the brain is rewired “ to adopt
different thinking circuits . ”
Such discoveries of how the mind can change the brain have a spooky quality
that makes you want to cue the “ Twilight Zone ” theme , but they rest on a
solid foundation of animal studies .
Attention , for instance , seems like one
of those ephemeral things that comes and goes in the mind but has no real
physical presence .
Yet attention can alter the layout of the brain as
powerfully as a sculptor ’s knife can alter a slab of stone .
That was shown dramatically in an experiment with monkeys in 1993 .
Scientists at the University of California , San Francisco , rigged up a
device that tapped monkeys ’ fingers 100 minutes a day every day .
As this
bizarre dance was playing on their fingers , the monkeys heard sounds through
headphones .
Some of the monkeys were taught : Ignore the sounds and pay
attention to what you feel on your fingers , because when you tell us it
changes we ’ll reward you with a sip of juice .
Other monkeys were taught : Pay
attention to the sound , and if you indicate when it changes you ’ll get juice .
Matthieu Ricard , a Buddhist monk , undergoing an EEG during a study of
compassion meditation
After six weeks , the scientists compared the monkeys ’ brains .
Usually , when
a spot on the skin receives unusual amounts of stimulation , the amount of
cortex that processes touch expands .
That was what the scientists found in
the monkeys that paid attention to the taps :
The somatosensory region that
processes information from the fingers doubled or tripled .
But when the
monkeys paid attention to the sounds , there was no such expansion .
Instead ,
the region of their auditory cortex that processes the frequency they heard
increased .
Through attention , UCSF ’s Michael Merzenich and a colleague wrote , “ We
choose and sculpt how our ever - changing minds will work , we choose who we
will be the next moment in a very real sense , and these choices are left
embossed in physical form on our material selves . ”
The discovery that neuroplasticity cannot occur without attention has
important implications .
If a skill becomes so routine you can do it on
autopilot , practicing it will no longer change the brain .
And if you take up
mental exercises to keep your brain young , they will not be as effective if
you become able to do them without paying much attention .
Since the 1990s , the Dalai Lama had been lending monks and lamas to
neuroscientists for studies of how meditation alters activity in the brain .
The idea was not to document brain changes during meditation but to see
whether such mental training produces enduring changes in the brain .
All the Buddhist “ adepts ” — experienced meditators — who lent their brains
to science had practiced meditation for at least 10,000 hours .
One by one ,
they made their way to the basement lab of Richard Davidson at the
University of Wisconsin , Madison .
He and his colleagues wired them up like
latter - day Medusas , a tangle of wires snaking from their scalps to the
electroencephalograph that would record their brain waves .
Eight Buddhist adepts and 10 volunteers who had had a crash course in
meditation engaged in the form of meditation called nonreferential
compassion .
In this state , the meditator focuses on unlimited compassion and
loving kindness toward all living beings .
As the volunteers began meditating , one kind of brain wave grew
exceptionally strong : gamma waves .
These , scientists believe , are a
signature of neuronal activity that knits together far - flung circuits —
consciousness , in a sense .
Gamma waves appear when the brain brings together
different features of an object , such as look , feel , sound and other
attributes that lead the brain to its aha moment of , yup , that ’s an armadillo .
Some of the novices “ showed a slight but significant increase in the gamma
signal , ” Prof. Davidson explained to the Dalai Lama .
But at the moment the
monks switched on compassion meditation , the gamma signal began rising and
kept rising .
On its own , that is hardly astounding : Everything the mind does
has a physical correlate , so the gamma waves ( much more intense than in the
novice meditators ) might just have been the mark of compassion meditation .
Except for one thing .
In between meditations , the gamma signal in the monks
never died down .
Even when they were not meditating , their brains were
different from the novices ’ brains , marked by waves associated with
perception , problem solving and consciousness .
Moreover , the more hours of
meditation training a monk had had , the stronger and more enduring the gamma signal .
It was something Prof .
Davidson had been seeking since he trekked into the
hills above Dharamsala to study lamas and monks : evidence that mental
training can create an enduring brain trait .
Prof. Davidson then used fMRI
imaging to detect which regions of the monks ’ and novices ’ brains became
active during compassion meditation .
The brains of all the subjects showed
activity in regions that monitor one ’s emotions , plan movements , and
generate positive feelings such as happiness .
Regions that keep track of
what is self and what is other became quieter , as if during compassion
meditation the subjects opened their minds and hearts to others .
More interesting were the differences between the monks and the novices .
The
monks had much greater activation in brain regions called the right insula
and caudate , a network that underlies empathy and maternal love .
They also
had stronger connections from the frontal regions to the emotion regions ,
which is the pathway by which higher thought can control emotions .
In each case , monks with the most hours of meditation showed the most
dramatic brain changes .
That was a strong hint that mental training makes it
easier for the brain to turn on circuits that underlie compassion and empathy .
“ This positive state is a skill that can be trained , ” Prof. Davidson says .
“ Our findings clearly indicate that meditation can change the function of
the brain in an enduring way . ”

Wireless networks at home give people freedom
Neighbours in Redditch , Worcestershire , contacted police on Saturday after seeing a man inside a car using a laptop while parked outside a house .
He was arrested and cautioned .
A woman was arrested in similar circumstances in the town earlier this month .
BBC Midlands Today correspondent Dr David Gregory said the cases are among the first of their kind .
He added that if people were using someone else 's network to enter illegal porn sites , for example , it would be very difficult to trace them .
The man arrested at the weekend was cautioned for dishonestly obtaining electronic communications services with intent to avoid payment .
In the earlier incident , a woman was arrested after attracting the attention of neighbours in the early morning .
She had put up cardboard around her car windows but the light from her computer could be seen through the back window .
West Mercia Police said people with wi- fi should follow security advice given by their internet provider .
ISPs recommend that wi-fi users secure their wireless networks .

CLICAL is a stand - alone calculator - type computer program for geometric algebras of multivectors , called Clifford algebras .
CLICAL evaluates elementary functions with arguments in complex numbers , and their generalizations : quaternions octonions and multivectors in Clifford algebras .
CLICAL works directly on intrinsic geometric objects : lines , planes and volumes , represented by vectors , bivectors and multivectors .
Oriented volume elementes , or segments of subspaces , are represented by simple multivectors , which are homogeneous and decomposable elements in the exterior algebra .
CLICAL works on Clifford algebras Clof real non-degenerate quadratic spaces
Clifford algebras are used to handle rotations and oriented subspaces .
Clifford algebra is a user interface , which provides geometrical insight .
However , the actual numerical computations are faster in matrix images of Clifford algebras .
CLICAL computer program was developed to enable input - output in Clifford algebras ( and fast internal computation in matrices ) .
CLICAL is intended for researchers and teachers of Clifford algebras and spinors .
In research , CLICAL has been applied to verify and falsify conjectures about Clifford algebras .
With the help of CLICAL , I have found counterexamples to conjectures and theorems about Clifford algebras .
I have used CLICAL to solve problems presented in Usenet newsgroups , for instance about rotations of the 4D Euclidean space R4 .
In teaching , CLICAL has been used in mathematics and physics courses in the USA , Mexico , Finland and Spain .
Take a look at a course delivered with CLICAL .
There are competing projects , most notably an online geometric calculator , two symbolic computer algebra packages for MapleV5 , one for Mathematica , MatLab geometric algebra tutotial , and C++ Template Classes for Geometric Algebras .

What started as a humorous observation got me thinking about the veracity of the statement .
I thought " people are getting bigger " and " houses are getting bigger " , how do they relate ?
In this environment of Googleified immediate access to random data , I had the opportunity to go figure that out , in my own non-scientific way .
Very quickly I was able to locate the data that I required to figure out whether Americans did have the tendency to grow to fit their environment .
I am not picking specifically on Americans , its just that housing is typically constrained in many other places around the world .
If one were motivated , they could put a finer point on this amusement by looking at regional trends in both datasets .
I 'll leave the conclusions up to you .
Keep in mind that this is pure amusement and not terribly scientific in any way .
The housing data can be found at : www.census.gov
The obesity data can be found at : apps.nccd.cdc.gov
Evidence from decades of discrimination studies has led Mark V. Roehling , an associate professor at the School of Labor and Industrial Relations at Michigan State University , to the conclusion that there is “ consistent evidence of weight discrimination . ”
One factor is that some employers do not want to be burdened with higher health insurance costs .
Other times it is a matter of appearances or a belief that “ people of size , ” as Mr. Roehling terms the obese , are lazy , weak - willed or considered too unattractive to interact with customers .
He has found that some employers are upfront about it , even in Michigan , which is the only state that outlaws weight discrimination .
While conducting research , he said , he was told by a personnel manager , who himself was overweight , that the company would not hire overweight people , even after Mr. Roehling told him that was illegal .
The bias is more pronounced toward white women than white men , Mr. Roehling said : “ Blacks are more accepting of large people and whites are more accepting of overweight black females . ”
Mr. Roehling is convinced that weight bias is stronger than bias stemming from race .
You can test that thesis yourself with the Implicit Association Test , at implicit.harvard.edu/implicit .
It was created by researchers at Harvard , the University of Virginia and the University of Washington to plumb an individual ’s attitude toward race , ethnicity and religion .
Take the test for prejudice against overweight people and compare your result against the similar test for race .
Brian A. Nosek , a psychology professor at the University of Virginia who helped develop it , said that test results showed that bias against blacks and the overweight was about equal , but that while people rarely admit to race bias , they freely admit to weight bias .
“ There is no social sanction against saying you do n’t like fat people , ” Mr. Nosek said .
The weight penalties come in other forms as well .
Sociologists have long noted that in developed countries , the higher - status people tend to be thin and the lower - status ones are fat .
“ That heavier people have a harder time getting married is pretty well supported , ” said Jeffery Sobal , a professor at Cornell University who has studied obesity .
Marriage can be crucial in wealth creation , especially when a person “ marries up ” to someone with money or a higher education .
That may be a rarer occurrence for the obese .
“ There is a stigma against the overweight that plays out in the social class world , ” he said .
The end result ?
The obese accumulate only about half the assets of the normal - size American , said Mr. Zagorsky , the Ohio State University research scientist .
He matched B.M.I. and wealth data in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth , a multiyear sampling done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics , and found that for every one - point increase in the index , net worth dropped by $ 1,000 .
The typical female baby boomer , he said , earned $ 313.70 less annually for every one - point increase in her B.M.I. , while the typical male earned $ 161.30 less for every point .
Missing eighteen - day stretch in Justice emails recalls infamous Watergate tape gap Josh Catone
Published : Wednesday March 21 , 2007 Print This Email This Josh Marshall reports there is an 18 - day gap -- first spotted by a commenter on the blog Talking Points Memo -- in the over 3,000 emails released by the Department of Justice pertaining to the attorney firing scandal .
The gap covers the days between November 15 and December 4 , 2006 .
So far , only one email has been found dated within that 18 day period among those released in Monday night 's document dump .
The lone email , from November 29 , 2006 , was one forwarded by Justice official Michael Elston to a fellow staffer asking for an attached review document to be printed .
" The firing calls went out on December 7th .
But the original plan was to start placing the calls on November 15th , " notes Marshall .
" So those eighteen days are pretty key ones . "
Politico reporters Mike Allen and John Bresnahan also picked up on the gap .
They surmise that the missing communication covers " a critical period , as the White House and Justice Department reviewed -- then approved -- which U.S. attorneys would be fired , while also developing a political and communications strategy for countering any fallout from the firings . "
The gap , specifically because of its length , is an eerie reminder of the infamous eighteen - and - a - half minute gap in the Nixon tapes .
As one blogger writes , " The Bush Administration is working overtime to make this attorney scandal look more and more like Watergate by the day . "
Around 40 % of women are said to experience low libido at some point
The hormone - releasing pill has so far only been given to female monkeys and shrews who displayed more mating behaviour and ate less .
The team from the Medical Research Council 's Human Reproduction Unit in Edinburgh believe a human version could be available within a decade .
But a psychologist said low - libido was usually caused by relationship issues .
Up to 40 % of women are thought to experience a lack of sex drive at some point in their lives .
' Rump presentation '
The Edinburgh team , led by Professor Robert Millar , have been looking at the properties Type 2 Gonadotrophin - releasing hormone .
When it was given to monkeys , they displayed mating behaviour such as tongue - flicking and eyebrow - raising to the males , while female shrews displayed their feelings via " rump presentation and tail wagging " .
When couples come to me and they are not having sex , the last thing they want to do is examine their relationship
Lesley Perman - Kerr , psychologist
But the animals also ate around a third less food than they normally would .
Professor Millar hopes to achieve a similar rise in libido and fall in appetite in a pill for women .
He told the Scotland on Sunday newspaper : " This hormone is distributed in the brain in areas that we suspect affect reproductive behaviour .
" It is considered a major pharmaceutical endeavour to address the area of libido .
" So the next stage is to produce a drug that simulates the actions of this hormone .
" It is most likely that we will do it in partnership with a pharmaceutical firm .
It could be available to women within the next 10 years . "
He said it may also be possible to develop a pill which worked for men , but he has so far not carried out any tests on male animals .
But psychologist Lesley Perman - Kerr said relationship problems usually had a psychological , rather than a biological , basis .
" Some women have problems specific to libido .
" But often if they go off sex , it 's more to do with their relationship than their level of libido .
" When couples come to me and they are not having sex , the last thing they want to do is examine their relationship .
" They want to believe that it 's nothing to do with their relationship . "
ANALYST URGES CAUTION ANALYST URGES CAUTION BEIJING —
Shi Yinhong , a leading Korea - watcher who teaches international relations at People ’s University in Beijing , said Friday he welcomed moves toward a concrete agreement but cautioned that Pyongyang ’s record of " playing games " means all parties should prepare for disappointment .
“ It ’s probable that there will be agreement in some form that North Korea will freeze part of its nuclear program in exchange for energy assistance , even implicitly , from the United States , ” Shi said .
“ No - one ca n’t say this is n’t great .
In the past three years of negotiations , we have never had such a concrete agreement .
But I ’m a little confused .
How can you interpret North Koreas suddenly being willing to abandon its nuclear program ?
It ’s almost incredible , ” Shi said .
He advised a cautious welcome to any agreement .
“ We should be prudent about not reading too much long - term significance into this .
Is North Korea really set on a course of denuclearization ?
At least up to now , I dare not to believe .
In the future , we may be disappointed again .
North Korea plays such games again and again .
The tragic story of the 1994 agreement could be repeated . ”
On the one hand , Pyongyang wants assistance and a better relationship with the United States , Shi argued , but at the same time the North Koreans ’ immediate purpose is to eliminate the U.N. sanctions .
Shi credits the recent intensification of bilateral talks between Washington and Pyongyang with improving the climate for agreement .
The other four parties to the six - party talks have basically been sidelined , he said .
“ North Korea and the USA provide the basis to the other four sides of the talks , they can only raise their point of view at the end of this process .
Their views are still important , but they have been less involved . ”
Shi warned that any agreement may only temporarily halt the North Korean nuclear program .
Will it represent “ a fundamental decision by North Korea to abandon nuclear bombs ?
I personally do n’t believe it .
The North Koreans always want to have their cake and eat it . ” — Calum MacLeod in Beijing Tentative deal calls for halt in N. Korea nuclear program WASHINGTON  North Korea reached a tentative agreement with five other nations Tuesday on initial steps toward ending its nuclear weapons program , U.S. negotiator Christopher Hill said .
The agreement would shut down a program that built and tested a nuclear device and amassed plutonium for as many as a dozen other weapons .
Initially , however , that plutonium and any completed nuclear weapons would remain in North Korea .
The deal , reached in Beijing by negotiators from North Korea , the United States , China , Japan , Russia and South Korea , requires a final OK by the six governments .
Under the agreement 's terms , North Korea would shut down a nuclear reactor that has been producing plutonium for four years , according to a senior Bush administration official and an Asian diplomat .
Inspectors from the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency would return to North Korea within 60 days to verify that the reactor has been shuttered , they said .
In return , North Korea would get a million tons of fuel oil a year .
The two officials , both of whom had been briefed on details of the agreement , declined to be identified because it has not gotten final approval from their governments .
After a fifth day of negotiations in Beijing , Hill said the agreement is only a first step toward the ultimate goal of dismantling North Korea 's nuclear weapons program .
" I 'm encouraged that we might be able to make a real step forward on the denuclearization issue , " he said .
North Korean diplomats made no immediate comment .
The parties resume talks Tuesday in Beijing .
Supporters and opponents of the agreement both say it resembles a 1994 accord , known as the Agreed Framework , which traded economic and diplomatic concessions for a freeze of the North Korean nuclear program and a pledge of eventual denuclearization .
Under that deal , North Korea received 500,000 tons of fuel oil annually .
The 1994 pact collapsed in 2002 when North Korea admitted working to enrich uranium , another potential source of bomb fuel .
John Bolton , the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. until December , said on CNN that the agreement is " a very bad deal " that would undercut sanctions against North Korea and make the administration " look weak ... dealing with Iran ( when ) it needs to look strong . "
He said President Bush should reject the deal because it is no better than the 1994 agreement : " If we ( are ) going to cut this deal now , it 's amazing we did n't cut it back then . "
Jack Pritchard , a former U.S. negotiator with the North Koreans in both the Clinton and Bush administrations , said the latest deal initially leaves North Korea " a declared nuclear - weapon state with a stock of plutonium for more . "
James Kelly , assistant secretary of State for Asia in Bush 's first term , said he was optimistic .
" It 's a mistake to prematurely trash " the agreement , Kelly said .
" It 's not a triumph yet .
It 's a first step . "
David Albright , head of the Institute for Science and International Security , a Washington think tank , said North Korea has produced enough plutonium for as many as 12 bombs .
It tested a nuclear device for the first time in October .

The gambling investigation caused less concern in the governor ’s office because officials there considered it without merit , Mr. Ehrlich said .
But because of lingering suspicions in Maryland political circles that Mr. Ehrlich ’s people had a hand in Mr. DiBiagio ’s departure in early 2005 , a longtime aide to the governor , Jervis Finney , called Mr. DiBiagio a few months ago to deny any involvement , Mr. Finney said .

Mr. Finney said in an interview Monday that he wanted to “ clean things up ” and to let Mr. DiBiagio know that “ neither Gov. Bob Ehrlich or his representatives had asked the Department of Justice to push him out . ”
Mr. DiBiagio said he did not accept the explanation .
“ I believe it was that investigation that played an integral role in what was done to me , ” Mr. DiBiagio , now at a law firm here , said about the gambling inquiries .
“ I clearly got the message that I had alienated my political sponsor and I would not have any political support to stay another term .
Clearly , they wanted me to leave . ”
Mr. DiBiagio pointed to tense conversations in 2003 and 2004 with advisers to the governor who , he said , intimated that the corruption investigations could derail his career .
He would not name them publicly .
The former prosecutor said he was particularly troubled by one visit in June 2004 in which , he said , a lawyer allied with the governor said the gambling inquiries were disrupting legislative consideration of the slots question and should be shut down .
Mr. DiBiagio said the lawyer inquired about his political future , asked whether he was interested in being a judge and suggested that his life could be closely scrutinized .
Mr. DiBiagio said he described the conversation in a memorandum for his records and reported it to an official of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Baltimore as a possible threat .

Our ancestors had more prominent features but lower foreheads
Modern people possess less prominent features but higher foreheads than our medieval ancestors .
Writing in the British Dental Journal , the team took careful measurements of groups of skulls spanning across 30 generations .
The scientists said the differences between past and present skull shapes were " striking " .
Plague victims
The team used radiographic films of skulls to record extensive measurements taken by a computer .
They looked at 30 skulls dating from the mid-14th Century .
They had come from the unlucky victims of the plague .
The skulls had been excavated from plague pits in the 1980s in London .
Another 54 skulls examined by the team were recovered from the wreck of the Mary Rose which sank off the south coast of England in 1545 .
All the skulls were compared with 31 recent orthodontic records from the School of Dentistry in Birmingham .
" This new research shows how bones ... can provide more knowledge to the scientific community , and ultimately the public "
Professor Robert Foley , Cambridge University
Dr Peter Rock , lead author of the study and director of orthodontistry at Birmingham University , told the BBC News website : " The astonishing finding is the increased cranial vault heights .
" The increase is very considerable .
For example , the vault height of the plague skulls were 80 mm , and the modern ones were 95 mm - that 's in the order of 20 % bigger , which is really rather a lot . "
He suggests that the increase in size may be due to an increase in mental capacity over the ages .
Repatriating bones
The study of human remains has previously fallen into controversy , and a report commissioned by the UK government called for human remains to be repatriated where possible .
The ancient skulls used in this study , from which the radiographic films were taken , have either been reburied or are now housed in museums .
Professor Robert Foley is director of the Leverhulme Centre for Evolutionary Studies at Cambridge University , and sat on a government working group which has drawn up guidelines on working with human remains .
" The study of human remains can provide vital information about our past .
There is a huge interest in our biological past - both from an evolutionary and a historical point of view - and research into human bones can tell us a great deal , " he said .
" This new research shows how bones , and even the records of bones , can provide more knowledge to the scientific community , and ultimately the public . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Soon after becoming defense secretary , Robert Gates argued the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , should be closed because the international community would view any trials there as tainted , The New York Times reported on Thursday .
Instead , Gates , who became Pentagon chief in December , argued that terrorism suspects should be tried in the United States to make the proceedings more credible , the Times said .
Vice President Dick Cheney , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and others argued against bringing detainees into the United States , and the discussion ended when President George W. Bush agreed with them , the newspaper quoted administration officials as saying .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had joined Gates in pushing for the facility to be closed , administration officials told the newspaper .
Indefinite detention and allegations of mistreatment at Guantanamo , which the U.S. military denies , have tarnished the U.S. image abroad .
Many countries , including U.S. allies , have urged the camp be closed .
One official said the issue may come up again if Gonzales is forced to step down because of the battle over fired U.S. attorneys .
“ Let ’s see what happens to Gonzales , ” the senior administration official told the Times .
“ I suspect this one is n’t over yet . ”
The newspaper said the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were recounting confidential conversations .
The United States has brought charges against just one of the 385 foreign captives at Guantanamo .
Australian David Hicks , 31 , has been accused of providing material support for terrorism by fighting for al Qaeda in Afghanistan .
Hicks is charged under a new system of war crimes trials authorized by the U.S. Congress last year .
The United States has declared its intention to try 60 to 80 of the 385 foreign captives held at Guantanamo , including 14 “ high - value ” prisoners sent there in September from secret CIA prisons .
Some administration lawyers oppose bringing the captives into the United States because that would give them more constitutional and statutory rights , the newspaper said .
The Bush administration has insisted it needs to hold and try suspects at Guantanamo as part of its war against terrorism launched after the September 11 attacks on the United States .

Senator asks Bush to explain signing statement that gives President authority to open mail without warrant
RAW STORY
Published : Monday January 8 , 2007 Print This Email This Print page sponsored by Velvet Revolution .
The following letter , acquired by RAW STORY , was delivered to President Bush Monday , in response to an article published in the NY Daily News which revealed that Bush had written into a " signing statement " that the President could open Americans ' mail .
January 8 , 2007 The Honorable George W. Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , NW Washington , DC 20500 Dear Mr. President : I am deeply concerned about the signing statement that you issued on December 20 , 2006 , regarding H.R. 6407 , the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act .
It raises serious questions about whether the government is reading Americans  first class mail without obtaining a search warrant or other court order as required by statute .
The Postal Accountability and Enhancement
Act recodified in a different location an existing provision of federal law , without change , that states as follows :
No letter of such a class of domestic origin shall be opened except under authority of a search warrant authorized by law , or by an officer or employee of the Postal Service for the sole purpose of determining an address at which the letter can be delivered , or pursuant to the authorization of the addressee .
[ 1 ]
In your signing statement , you stated that the executive branch would construe this provision in a manner consistent , to the maximum extent permissible , with the need to conduct searches in exigent circumstances , such as to protect human life and safety against hazardous materials , and the need for physical searches specifically authorized by law for foreign intelligence collection .
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in February 2006 on the National Security Agency warrantless wiretapping program , Senator Leahy asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales whether the executive branch was relying in other contexts on the theory that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force gave it the authority to violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) and other statutes .
Specifically , Senator Leahy asked :  Did it authorize the opening of first - class mail of U.S. citizens ?
The Attorney General attempted to avoid answering the question , but ultimately stated :  Senator , I think that , again , that is not what is going on here .
We are only focused on communications , international communications , where one party to the communication is al Qaeda .
That is what this program is all about .
You have already confirmed that you have authorized the NSA to conduct surveillance of communications without obtaining the court orders required by FISA .
Your December 20 , 2006 , signing statement now suggests that you believe you have the authority to violate the law with regard to opening regular mail .
The American people and Congress are entitled to know whether you have acted on that theory .
Please answer the following question : has your administration authorized any government agency to read Americans  first - class mail without obtaining a search warrant , complying with the applicable court order requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or satisfying Postal Service regulations ?
I look forward to your expeditious reply .
Sincerely , Russell D. Feingold United States Senator 1 : A separate regulation , promulgated in 1996 , states that the Postal Service can open a piece of mail when there is a credible threat that it contains a bomb or other explosive device .
39 C.F.R. § 233.11
Here are some software / computer / information - related patent claims I have stumbled across , with some thoughts on how they have changed over the years , and a sample claim of my own ( not filed ) that I think anticipates future trends .
Gregory A. Stobbs has , on a number of occasions ( for example in his inventively - titled book “ Software Patents ” ) , argued that the first software claim was in a patent issued to Samuel Morse in 1840 :
“ I claim as my invention , the system of signs , consisting of dots , spaces , and horizontal lines , for numerals , letters , words or sentences , substantially as herein set forth and illustrated , for telegraphic purposes . ”
However , most 19th century patents relating to information processing tended to have more hardware - oriented claims : Perhaps a typical example would be from one of the Hollerith punched - card patents , no .
395,781 , issued in 1889 :
6 . As an improvement in the art of compiling statistics , the hereinbefore - described method for facilitating the classification of individual records and simplifying the process of computation , which consists in first assigning to each item entering into the proposed series of computations one or more designated points or spaces ; secondly , forming a complete record of each individual or subject upon a single card by applying a circuit — controlling index point or points to each space appropriated to or indicative of each separate item in the given series which pertains to the individual or subject , and , finally , feeding said cards successively to an apparatus operated by the index - points on each card to designate the particular division to which it belongs , and depositing each card in a place or receptacle corresponding to the division thus indicated , substantially as described .
US patent 350,748 for a “ Perforated Music Sheet ” from 1886 , allowed multiple instances of the same note to be played at once , claiming :
A perforated music - sheet for a mechanical musical instrument , having its upper or treble notes or perforations duplicated or triplicated , & co. , and arranged above or below the regular scale of the music - sheet , for the purpose specified .
This is an interesting example of a patent for machine instructions encoded in a “ read - only ” memory medium .
Later we began to see claims that had a greater level of abstraction from the particular hardware .
As an example , we can look at one of the claims of US Patent 1,244,447 to Patrick Delaney ( 1917 ) :
5 . The method of protecting the secrecy of a telegraphic message which consists in producing a series of signals similar in nature to but constituting reversals of the signals comprising said message .
Or the famous 1919 US Patent 1,310,719 to Vernam :
1 . The method of enciphering signals where the characters are represented by a number of periods of different current values which consists in altering the normal code impulses of a character to be transmitted in accordance with a rule represented by some other character in a like code .
Another 1919 US Patent , no , 1,312,572 to R.D. Parker , “ Secret Signalling System ” claims :
1 . In a signal transmitting system , a main line , sending apparatus at one end thereof , receiving apparatus at the other end there of , a ciphering device at the sending end for rendering the signals unintelligible , a deciphering device at the receiving end for reconverting the transmitted impulses into intelligible signals and means for sending impulses over the line for synchronizing the operation of said ciphering and deciphering devices , simultaneously with the transmission of the signal impulses .
Yet another 1919 US Patent , no , 1,320,908 to the same inventor , “ Ciphering and Deciphering Mechanism ” claims :
1.An apparatus for enciphering and deciphering messages comprising a group of elements adapted to represent successively the characters of the message , a second
group of elements adapted to represent successively a series of ciphering characters and means controlled by the joint effect of said groups of elements for indicating the characters of the enciphered or deciphered message .
and
4 . A mechanism for enciphering or deciphering messages comprising means for representing the message characters by a series of sets of electrical conditions respectively representing the message characters in accordance with a predetermined code , means for concurrently representing a series of ciphering characters by a series of sets of electrical conditions and mechanism under the combined effect of successive sets of electrical conditions in said two series respectively for locally recording the resulting enciphered or deciphered message .
The well - known “ ENIAC ” patent to Eckhart and Mauchly ( 3,120,606 ) filed in 1947 , claimed things in terms of “ electric pulses ” and “ data pulses ” :
1.Means for producing electric pulses in sequence , electronic means for alternately transmitting certain ones of all said pulses as recurrent differentiated groups , electronic means for selecting particular pulses from one of said differentiated groups to represent quantitative values , electronic means for selecting particular pulses from another of said differentiated groups to represent certain qualitative values , reading means responsive to pulses representing both the qualitative and quantitative values for reading data to he processed upon command of at least one of said qualitative pulses , storing the data thus read , and making the data available in the form of data pulses in response to at least one other of said qualitative pulses , and electronic means for receiving said data pulses and responsive thereto for performing electrical switching operations of a nature determined by selected ones of said qualitative values and of a degree determined by selected ones of said quantitative values .
Another candidate for the world ’s “ first software patent ” was noted by Stobbs , patent number 2,552,629 from 1951 :
1 . In an information system employing equal length permutation code groups in which element values are characterized by one or the other of two possible signaling conditions , the improvement which comprises means for encoding information into single error - correcting code groups in which each of said single error - correcting code groups has element values differing from the element values of each of the other of said single error - correcting code groups in three or more element positions in a respective element position comparison of each of said single error - correcting code groups , and means for changing the value in any one of the element positions of each of said single error - correcting code groups so that the said element value difference created by said encoding means is maintained if no more than a single element error occurs in each of said single error - correcting code groups .
M.A. Goetz ’s patent number 3,533,086 filed in 1969 has often been put forward as the “ first software patent ” .
Claim 10 reads :
For use in a system for automatically controlling a computer having a storage , a processor , an output unit , and control apparatus for controlling the operation of said processor , storage and output unit to perform sequences of operations on blocks of data in the form of coded digital signals in a certain format stored in said storage and representing successive instructions of various types of a computer program including process .
unconditional transfer and conditional branch instructions ; a method for directing the operation of said control apparatus to process said data blocks sequentially and to produce a record of a flow chart representative of said program , said method comprising :
processing said data blocks successively included scanning predetermined fields of each of said data blocks to establish a flow chart symbol therefor or to reject said data block , respectively , in accordance with different coded signal groups in said fields ;
allocating successive ones of said symbols forming a sequence of the computer program as an array and
allocating each of successive ones of said sequences as an array in a section of each of successive flow chart pages ;
and producing a record of said symbol arrays in successive flow chart pages in accordance with the allocation thereof .
The Eckhart and Hoover patent number 3,623,007 ( 1971 ) has the following claim :
1 . In a stored program data processing machine which returns to perform certain routine tasks after performing various other classes of work and which stores the requests to perform each of the various classes of work in hoppers , the improvement comprising means for measuring the time it takes
the machine to return to performing said routine tasks and means controlled by said measuring means for selecting a variable number of work - requesting items to be taken from any of said hoppers at any one time by said machine .
Patent number 3,633,176 from 1972 claims :
1 . In a method of operating a digital computer in a network
with one or more user ’s remote terminals , wherein a command entered at a terminal controls execution of an indexed file containing a program , the steps of controlling ,
a reading of portions of the indexing data in a first file identified by the command ,
a reading of data records referenced by said portions of indexing data ,
a determination of whether each data record read contains a statement requiring that the statement be replaced by data located in a different file ,
a replacement of said statement with the specified data located in said different file when said data record is determined to contain such a statement , and ,
a repetition of said replacement step each time a data record is read from any file and determined to contain said statement .
Filed in 1988 , David Chaum ’s “ Returned - value blind signature systems ” patent 4,949,380 does not reference any hardware at all in its claim :
1 . In a method for transferring value between parties that is based on public - key - digital blind signatures , the improvement comprising the steps of :
diminishing the value of a first blind signature by a first party from an original value to a diminished value ;
communicating said diminished value of said first blind signature in a first message to at least a second party by said first party ;
communicating a blinded second message to said second party by said first party ;
checking the validity of said signature contained in said first message received by at least said second party ;
forming by said second party of a second digital signature on said blinded second message received , and the type of second signature formed responsive to the type of signature checked on said first message , and where the relationship between the type of signature checked on said first message and the type of said second signature formed being such that a higher - valued signature checked corresponds to a lower - valued second signature formed ; and
communicating by said second party said formed second signature to said first party .
Fast - forwarding to 2005 we find patent publication number 20050222903 “ Rendering content - targeted ads with e-mail ” ( this is one of a large group of pending applications that do n’t appear to be assigned to anyone at the moment , but have Google ’s fingerprints all over them ) .
A method for facilitating the serving of advertisements with e-mail content , the method comprising : a ) accepting a request for a document including e-mail content ; b ) generating a request identifier ; c ) serving the requested document in association with the request identifier ; and d ) obtaining at least one ad relevant to the e-mail content .
Inspired by these , here is a claim of my own :
1 . A method of constructing patent claims designed to prevent insomnia , comprising :
( a ) generating a database of words from a dictionary ;
( b ) presenting these words to a plurality of users ;
( c ) requesting these users to rank the words in order of their soporific effect ;
(d) Selecting a subset of the most soporific words from the database ;
(e) Inserting said subset in the claims of a patent application intended to result in an issued patent
( f) Upon issuance of said patent , creating a hyperlink to said patent ; and
(g) Presenting the hyperlink to a subject , thereby to sedate , tranquilize , incapacitate , subdue , or stupefy said subject when said subject accesses said hyperlink .
I just hope that this technology does n't end up classified as a munition .
Orgies are safer than driving April 9 , 2007
The odds of dying in a motor vehicle accident in your lifetime is 1 % .
Since you are n’t worried about driving , you certainly should n’t be worried about an activity with a lower risk of dying .
The odds ( pdf ) of a woman catching AIDS from a single act of vaginal sex with a condom , when the guy does n’t know his HIV status , is 1 in 5 million !
Fellatio without a condom is approximately the same odds .
For men it is 1 in 10 million , so let ’s just worry about women .
If a woman boinks 1000 men w/ a condom , the odds of getting AIDS is 0.02 % [ 1 – ( 1 – 1/5000000 ) ^1000 ) ] .
These are actually upper bounds , because AIDS is overwhelmingly trapped in small subgroups : poor blacks , drug users and gay men .
If you wish to throw a swinger sex party ( my page hits will soar now ! ) , you can require that participants show a valid negative AIDS test within the previous year .
This will reduce the single sex act odds to almost 1 in 100 million .
Actually , it ’s slightly higher because there is an infinitesimally small chance that someone caught AIDS between the test and the orgy .
If a woman engages in 10 sex acts at an orgy ( fellatio and vaginal sex ) , the odds of getting AIDS is 1 in 10 million .
And if she attends 100 orgies in her lifetime , the odds of getting AIDS is 0.001 % , which is 1000X safer than driving a car .
The odds of being struck by lightning in your lifetime is 0.02 % .
Again , the odds of getting AIDS is even lower if the orgy participants are not in a high risk subgroup .
Even if you forget to use a condom occasionally , the risks do n’t go up very much .
And remember , we are comparing the risk of dying in a car versus living with a manageable disease .
FYI : The risk of transmitting Herpes type II with a condom is practically 0 .
It goes to 0 if you just check for any visible lesions .
All other STDs are also low risk and are treatable .
So why are we bombarded with scary messages that equate casual sex with death ?
There are two main reasons , IMO .
First , most people do n’t use condoms consistently .
If this same woman had 100 orgies without ever using a condom ( 1/100K ) , the odds of getting AIDS is 0.1 % .
That ’s still quite low for each person , but it ’s a little high from a public policy standpoint .
People die in car accidents , but they become a source of disease w/ AIDS .
The infection rates would go up over time if everyone engaged in reckless sex .
See Africa .
Second , AIDS activists must lie to get support and funding for AIDS campaigns .
If AIDS activists admitted that this is only a serious problem for high - risk groups ( poor blacks , drug users and gay men ) , there would be no public support for funding .
The public does n’t like druggies and gay men , and has little sympathy for poor blacks .
So they had to scare you into believing that even your precious suburban white children might get AIDS .

It ’s been nearly five years since 9/11 , but it seems like a lifetime .
Certainly , a lifetime ’s worth of events for America and the world — elections and insurgencies , hurricanes and tsunamis , attacks and threats of attack — have unfolded with such speed that it can be hard to sort through , or even recall , everything of consequence .
The chart below is an attempt , admittedly selective and incomplete , to survey the first five years of our post - 9/11 world — a world that is certainly new , though not always brave .

Five Years of Consequence ( pdf )
Markus Kemmelmeier , assistant professor of sociology at the University of Nevada at Reno , set out to ask how political orientation affects a student 's college performance .
In a study entitled " What 's in a Grade ?
Academic Success and Political Orientation " , Kemmelmeier publishes some interesting results .
Previous studies have suggested that conservative students perform slightly worse than other students in certain liberal arts and " social science " courses , such as anthropology .
Kemmelmeier 's study does n't overturn this , but it does shed some light on the cause .
Rather than take up the commonplace argument that the liberal professors are punishing their conservative students , Kemmelmeier looks to another root cause : the students themselves .
While it has been long fashionable to describe ( or dismiss ) academia as being wholly dominated by liberals , little actual attention has been played to the supposedly oppressive relationship that exists between the liberal professor and her conservative students .
Kemmelmeier 's study suggests that , at least with respects to grades , no such oppression exists .
Looking at the records of almost four thousand students who had been asked to also identify their political leanings , Kemmelmeier found that among the liberal arts classes examined , no discernable difference in grades could be ascertained , even in courses in American culture , African - American studies , cultural anthropology , education , nursing , sociology , and women 's studies .
There 's a twist , however .
Kemmelmeier did find evidence of performative difference between conservatives and liberals in one general area , however : business & economics .
As it turns out , in courses dealing with economics and business , conservative students scored higher than their liberal peers .
In all , the study suggests that in the liberal arts arena , professors are " more accepting of a broad range of student perspectives , " whereas in economics courses , the " environments appear to be more sensitive to whether student perspectives are compatible with those of the academic discipline . "
In a sense , this is a reversal of the dominant caricature of academia , although Kemmelmeier does not see some insidious bias lurking here , either .
Rather , he argues that conservative students may simply take such courses more seriously , and they may be more structured towards a conservative ethos ( " competition " versus " cooperation , " etc. ) .
None of this addresses the political orientation of professors , nor the general political tone at most universities .
It does strongly suggest that those looking to blame their performance on their instructors or professors are misguided , however .
Liberal or conservative , the study suggests that its how well you meet the course requirements that matters most , and meeting those requirements does not appear to be a function of one 's political orientation .

The Longest Line in America !
Let me tell you a secret .
For years I have wanted to travel the longest straight line that traverses America .
My rules for such a line were simple .
The line could not pass outside America and could not go through the oceans and the Gulf of Mexico .
In other words , the line had to stay inside the continental boundaries .
I am happy to report that my friend , Mark Nandor , has finally been able to determine the town located on both ends of such a line .
Our four " test lines " are shown on the maps at right .
Our early attempts involved a line that attached to Northeastern Maine , but that 's the red line and clearly the best we can do is to get into West Texas , which wo n't give us a very long line .
Similarly , the orange line from Northern .
California to North Carolina does n't cut it on the normal map , although it is much better .
Going from the Southwestern tip of California up and through Cape Cod is n't so bad , but still is about 10 % shorter than the dark green line that stretches from Northwestern Washington to much of the way to Southern Florida .
We call this line the ultralineamentum , after the Latin word " lineamentum " [ a line drawn with pen or pencil ] ; read more below ...
Gnomonic map ,
where great arcs are lines .
Standard Map
We are Happy to Announce the Longest Line :
" The Ultralineamentum "
Our journey starts at Ocean Creek by the Makah Indian Reservation in Washington , and our amazing journey ends near 1 Ocean Drive , Jupiter , Florida , 33469 .
( Ocean Creek is not the name of a city or town , but the name of the actual stream . )
To reiterate , our trip starts in Washington state at the beach at Ocean Creek , 124° 41 ' 38 '' W , 48° 21 ' 44 ''
N :
Our journey ends on the beach at Jupiter , Florida at 80° 4 ' 29 ''
W , 26° 57 ' 11 '' N :
The straight - line ( on a sphere ) distance between the two is 2802 miles .
Mapquest ( using a 200 - 600 foot hike at either end to actually get from the road to the ocean ) tells me it would take us 52 hours and 37 minutes to get from one end to the other , and we'd have to travel 3431 miles to do it .
Of course , in our real journey we would make frequent stops to enjoy the surroundings .

Technical Notes
I downloaded a copy of all of the GPS landmark data from some supposed source at the CIA ( http://www.evl.uic.edu/pape/data/WDB/).
From this , I had to get out all of the coastline and boundary data for the United States .
This actually took quite a bit of labor since they have 4 levels of " useful " data , but they do n't rank them strictly as " all the 1s together " and " all the 2s together " and so on .
It was actually quite annoying .
But in any case , I ended up using 52332 points for the United States .
The only real screwup that I ended up keeping was the US / Canada border in NW Washington as the part that goes into the Pacific , and not just the land .
But I do n't feel like poring through all of the coastline data to figure out which points I 've left out .
Those points do n't matter for this case because when I ran my computer program it did n't find the longest line all the way out to the ocean , so it certainly could n't find the longest point closer in !
In any case , I tested each pair of points to see how long the distance was on the sphere we call the Earth ( yes , there are approximations involved there ) .
If the distance was over 2700 miles , I kept that pair of points .
If not , I just threw it away .
I took the pairs of points , as well as the original map data , and transformed them to a gnomonic projection , where all great arcs are straight lines ( thanks for finding the name of the projection , Graham ! ) .
Next , on the gnomonic plot , I connected the points I had found if the distance was over 2850 miles .
It was pretty obvious that none of these were candidates since they all left the country .
I kept lowering the limit and eventually I finally found a line that was just barely tangent to the corner of the Florida Panhandle , as I had suspected .
One more note : for any gnomonic projection , we get to choose where the projection plane is tangent to the sphere .
If one chooses the tangent plane to be tangent near the middle of the US , you get what most maps look like .
If you go off - center , you get crazier shapes , but the key is that for ANY of the gnomonic plots , straight lines are great arcs .

The latest research showed that couples who have supportive marital relationships can deal with disturbing children easier and this only makes their marriage stronger .
A new study was conducted by Schoppe Sullivan , Sarah Mangelsdorf , Geoffrey Brown from University of Illinois together with Margaret Szewczyk from University of Minneapolis .
The study involved 97 couples expecting a baby who were examined for the extended period of time .
Couples were questioned and videotaped before and after the child birth on the quality of their marital relationships and later on on their interaction with the child , when he or she was 3,5 months old .
Researchers focused on couple 's cooperation with each other , their activity with the child and how they managed to cope with the disturbing and fussy behavior of the child .
Researches came to a conclusion that good marital relationships are crucial in determining effective management with restless and agitated children .
Compared with the couples who showed disagreement towards each other and were not cooperative in dealing with their baby , supportive partners showed effective cooperation .
The previous study conducted by the same researches concluded that badly cooperating parents are likely to have aggressive children .
The result of the new study emphasized that effective parenting has more to do with the cooperation of both parents rather than with the fact how each of the parents deal with their child .
Although , good marital partners are likely to be good coparents , these two notions may not coincide .
However , in case when couple is better at coparenting , their marriage and dealing with the child benefit in either way .

In what 's become yet another festering boil of corruption on the " hind end " of the Bush " administration , " General Services Administration ( GSA ) chief Lurita Doan was called on the carpet before the House Government Oversight committee today , where she put on her best " I do n't recall " show for the incredulous panel .
Watch the shameless Doan duck and dodge when she 's asked to explain what in God 's name she thought she was doing when she convened a national teleconference of GSA managers for a briefing from White House political staffers on how they could best use federal government resources to help " our candidates " in 2008 -- a presentation , by the way , that included a list of the Top 20 targeted Democrats for 2008 .
This is as corrupt as corruption gets , folks :
As always , you 'll find more at The Gavel .
UPDATE : Nitpicker has a report that Doan is freaking out .
White House admits it conducted election briefings RAW STORY
Published : Thursday April 26 , 2007 Print This Email This " The White House acknowledged Thursday it has conducted about 20 briefings recently for federal agency employees on the election prospects of Republican candidates  the sort of meetings that sparked an investigation into whether Bush aides engaged in illegal political activity , " the Associated Press reports .
The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) found that the briefings may have been in violation of the federal Hatch Act , which prohibits presentations of a partisan nature as an impermissible " political activity . "
Earlier this week , the U.S. Office of Special Counsel launched a probe into a January 26 presentation for political appointees at the General Services Administration ( GSA ) , which was moderated by Bush aide J. Scott Jennings .
At a White House briefing Thursday morning , Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino suggested that the Bush Administration would not be releasing the PowerPoint demonstration used in January .
" I do n't think there 's any reason for us to release a PowerPoint presentation , " Perino said .
" Talking about informational briefings at the White House is  we do n't turn over lots of documents .
There 's work done at the White House , and that is appropriately done .
And I just think  I just caution everyone to take a step back .
These briefings were not inappropriate , they were not unlawful , they were not unethical .
There is nothing wrong with what they did . "
Excerpts from AP article : # White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said briefings were held at other federal agencies besides the GSA , for a total of about 20 - most in 2006 and a couple in 2007 .
They were conducted by White House political director Sara Taylor or Jennings , her deputy .
It had been known that other briefings had been held , but not how many .
Others were held in previous years as well , but Stanzel said the White House has n't kept a count of how many .
Bush spokeswoman Dana Perino said no laws were broken and that the White House counsel 's office signed off on the effort .
" It 's not unlawful and it was n't unusual for informational briefings to be given , " Perino said .
" There is no prohibition under the Hatch Act of allowing political appointees to talk to other political appointees about the political landscape in which they are trying to advance the president 's agenda . "
She added : " These briefings were not inappropriate , they were not unlawful , they were not unethical . "
Some Democrats beg to differ .
# FULL AP ARTICLE CAN BE READ AT THIS LINK Excerpts from Perino's White House briefing : # Q How about this political interference by the Hatch Act , in the Hatch Act ?
MS . PERINO : There was n't political interference within the Hatch Act .
What you 're talking about is -- Q
Use of the government agencies ?
MS .
PERINO : No , what -- it is perfectly lawful for the political appointees at the White House to provide informational briefings to political appointees at the agencies .
And no laws were broken , and we provided more information about that last night .
Q
Was that all vetted through the Counsel 's Office prior to those sorts of sessions happening ?
What sort of oversight was done within the White House ?
MS . PERINO : Yes , generally -- because it's not unlawful and it was n't unusual for informational briefings to be given .
They were run by Sara Taylor and Scott Jennings .
Q
But there 's a higher standard , obviously , at the White House than no laws were broken .
Are n't there ethical questions , as well ?
MS .
PERINO : There were no -- what ethical would have been broken ?
Q
No , in terms of using federal resources , federal people to encourage people .
The allegation is out there that people -- MS .
PERINO : There 's no -- Q -- were being encouraged to help Republicans .
Q Targeting certain Democrats -- MS. PERINO : No , political -- there is no prohibition under the Hatch Act of allowing political appointees to talk to other political appointees about the political landscape in which they are trying to advance the President 's agenda .
None . Q
You say it 's not a violation of the Hatch Act.
MS .
PERINO : Not a violation of law , or of ethics .
Q
So why is the Office of Special Counsel investigating it , if you 're still saying that it 's clearly -- MS .
PERINO : That you 'll have to -- Q -- fine , why would they be investigating ?
MS .
PERINO : You 'll have to ask them .
You 'll have to ask them .
Q
How many of those meetings did -- MS. PERINO : I think there was an average -- we had records from the 2006 - 2007 cycle .
It was around 20 .
.... Q Dana , on the political briefings , if it's the White House 's position that those are appropriate , and it was done with public funds in a public agency , will the White House consider releasing the PowerPoint demonstration that was used ?
And if not , why not ?
MS. PERINO : I do n't think there 's any reason for us to release a PowerPoint presentation .
Talking about informational briefings at the White House is -- we do n't turn over lots of documents .
There 's work done at the White House , and that is appropriately done .
And I just think -- I just caution everyone to take a step back .
These briefings were not inappropriate , they were not unlawful , they were not unethical .
There is nothing wrong with what they did .
Q
Who says so ?
MS .
PERINO : Who says so ?
I think -- I do n't know who is saying so .
Q
Then why not release the documents used and let -- MS .
PERINO : I 'll take it under consideration , David .
I 'll take it under consideration , but I sincerely doubt it .
Q
If they 're subpoenaed , they 'll be out .
Q
Did all the briefings take place at the White House or were some of at the agencies ?
MS . PERINO : No , not necessarily .
Sometimes at the agencies .
Q
In federal agencies .
MS .
PERINO : Yes , but there 's -- but there 's nothing prohibiting that .
Go ahead .
Q
Did you say that the Counsel 's Office has reviewed this at all ?
MS .
PERINO : I think the question was had -- did they know about it beforehand , and as a general matter , yes .
Q
Were they always presented to the Counsel 's Office , can I do this one , can I do this one , on an individual basis ?
MS . PERINO : I do n't know if that was necessary .
Q
It was just common practice and sort of known ?
MS . PERINO : I think that since it was allowed and since it had been -- the initial general sign off had been given , I do n't think -- I do n't know ; I 'll check and see if each one was checked .
Q
Can you clear up just one thing ?
You said you turned over a bunch of papers last night .
Turned them over to who ?
MS .
PERINO : No , no , no , we provide more information last night about these briefings , in which we said -- Q
To whom ?
MS . PERINO : To reporters who had been asking about it . #

Denver Post Staff Writer - An American Civil Liberties
Union legal team is using a lawsuit to challenge the expulsion of these activists [ from a public speech given by Bush ] , arguing in federal court that it violated their constitutional free - speech rights .
The Denver Three were ticketed to attend the event and said they were not disruptive .
[…]
Today ’s revelations by volunteer bouncers Casper and Klinkerman showed that the decision to eject the activists “ was made at the highest levels of the White House , ”
[…]
The bouncers ’ statements appeared to contradict a White House spokesman ’s assertion in 2005 that volunteers at the Bush event were responsible for ejecting the Denver Three
[…]
The event was a public , taxpayer - funded forum about Social Security and Bush administration plans to privatize that system .
[…]
The three said Secret Service agents told them they were ejected because their vehicle displayed an anti-Bush bumper sticker .
[…]
The Secret Service later investigated whether a Republican volunteer committed a crime of impersonating a federal agent .
The U.S. Attorney ’s office in Denver declined to press charges , giving no explanation .

On his blog , tickletux advocates the use of FizzBuzz to find developers who grok coding .
However , this kind of test may also cause difficulties .
What do you do if a candidate answers with the following ( correct ) C code ?
#include < stdio.h > static const char * t [ ] = { " %d
" , " Fizz
" , " Buzz
" , " FizzBuzz
" } ; int main ( ) { unsigned int i ; for ( i = 1 ; i <= 100 ; i++) printf ( t [ 3 & 19142723 >> 2 *i % 30 ] , i ) ; return 0 ; }
What explanation would you choose ?
the candidate is smart and managed to avoid any explicit test ( “ branches are evil ” philosophy ) : hired ;
the candidate tried to impress you and wo n’t explain the 19142723 in her code : she is likely to cause problems in the team : not hired ;
the candidate mind is so convoluted that she could not think of another solution : not hired
the problem you gave the candidate was so boring that she solved it while having some fun ; may be a real problem solver : hired ;
the candidate is perfectly suited for an embedded systems programmer position : hired or not , depending on the kind of software you want her to write .
If I were to interview people for a programmer position , I honestly do n’t know what I would do with someone writing such a code in response to the original problem .
I would probably assume that the programmer was bored and that she wanted to have some fun while doing her job , and I kinda like this idea .
Foreskin cells are thought to be more vulnerable to HIV infection
The World Health Organization and UNAIDS said circumcision should be added to current interventions to reduce the spread of HIV .
Three African trials have shown that circumcision halved the rate of HIV infection in heterosexual men .
The recommendations largely apply to countries where rates of heterosexual transmission is high .
Experts warned that greater use of circumcision would not replace the need for other prevention methods , such as condoms .
But modelling studies have shown that if male circumcision was more widely available , millions of lives , particularly in sub-Saharan Africa would be saved .
WHO and UNAIDS said access to the procedure should be urgently scaled up in areas with high rates of heterosexual infection and low rates of male circumcision .
But warned that it was an additional intervention and would not replace programmes providing HIV testing , or prevention or treatment for sexually infected infections .
Men and their partners must also be given counselling to prevent them developing a false sense of security , they said .
Training and monitoring must be done to check circumcision is being done by appropriate health professionals in a sanitary environment with proper equipment .
And they stressed there was no evidence yet as to whether circumcision has any impact on the risk of infection for the woman or on the risk among men who have sex with other men .
Significant step
Kevin De Cock , director of HIV / AIDS at the World Health Organization said : " The recommendations represent a significant step forward in HIV prevention . "
" Countries with high rates of heterosexual HIV infection and low rates of male circumcision now have an additional intervention which can reduce the risk of HIV infection in heterosexual men . "
However , he said it would be years before the impact on the epidemic would be apparent .
Catherine Hankins , UNAIDS , said : " Being able to recommend an additional HIV prevention method is a significant step towards getting ahead of this epidemic .
" However , we must be clear : male circumcision does not provide complete protection against HIV .
" Men and women who consider male circumcision as an HIV preventive method must continue to use other forms of protection such as male and female condoms , delaying sexual debut and reducing the number of sexual partners . "
All three African trials were stopped early because the results were so dramatic - with reduced rates of new HIV infections of 48-60 % .
There are several reasons why circumcision may protect against HIV infection .
Specific cells in the foreskin may be potential targets for HIV infection and also the skin under the foreskin becomes less sensitive and is less likely to bleed reducing risk of infection following circumcision .
When Aids first began to emerge in Africa , researchers noted that men who were circumcised seemed to be less at risk of infection but it was unclear whether this was due to differences in sexual behaviour .
Deborah Jack , chief executive of the National AIDS Trust , said : " These recommendations address many of the benefits of including male circumcision in a comprehensive HIV prevention package .
She added : " Additional research to determine the health impact for women and men who have sex with men is vital , as is ensuring that adequate resources are provided to fund existing prevention methods , as well as continue research into new technologies such as microbicides and vaccines . "
The new study estimating that 650,000 Iraqis have died as a result of the U.S. invasion was  naturally  dismissed out of hand in Washington and London and disdained by the War Party ‘s pet pundits .
My favorite comment came from the president , who announced : " The methodology is pretty well discredited . "
Yes , our genius of a chief executive is an expert on the subject of methodology : the methods he and his confreres utilized to project we’d be greeted by Iraqis throwing rose petals in our path are a monument to his expertise .
Asked about his previous estimate of 30,000 dead Iraqis , Bush replied :
" I stand by the figure .
Six hundred thousand or whatever they guessed at it ’s not credible . "
That Bush has the gall to challenge anyone ’s credibility is a testament to his complete cluelessness .
Here , after all , is a president who went to war under false pretenses , and now demands that we " stay the course " right over a cliff .
Let him look at his own methodology , which involves reading  or , at least , skimming  a presidential daily briefing entitled " Bin Laden Determined to Strike U.S. " and then going blithely on his merry way , oblivious to all dangers but a nonexistent one in Iraq .
Are we to be spared nothing ?
Tony Blair , too , put on his scientific genius hat and dismissed the Johns Hopkins University study , saying through a spokesman :
" The figure is an order of magnitude higher than any other figure .
It ’s not one we believe to be anywhere near accurate and that is not in any way to downplay the seriousness of the security situation in Iraq . "
This argument assumes that the conventional wisdom ca n’t be wrong : by Blairite standards , the West ’s early ignorance about what was happening in Hitler ’s concentration camps is all we need know about the Holocaust .
It means that low - ball estimates of the toll taken by Stalin in the former Soviet Union never required revision .
Anthony Cordesman , a security analyst who is no friend of the Bush administration and has always been highly skeptical of the Iraq war , says this study is just " politics . "
This characterization is baffling when one takes into account the traditional willingness of Americans to countenance casualties  so long as they are n’t our own .
When Truman dropped nukes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , there was no national outcry : rather , there was a celebration of unassailable American power .
Likewise , the bombing of Dresden caused nary a ripple of protest .
A long string of American - sponsored and - countenanced atrocities , ranging from the torture methods employed by the shah of Iran ’s U.S. - trained SAVAK to the " free - fire zones " of Vietnam , to the terror manual written by the CIA for the Nicaraguan contras during the 1980s , and on and on  none of this bothered much of anyone , either in Washington or in the country at large .
We withdrew from Vietnam not because we were repulsed by our murderous tactics , and those of our Vietnamese sock - puppets , but because we were beaten militarily by a ragtag bunch of insurgents .
If the Johns Hopkins study is " politics , " then it is an oddly ineffective effort : it is hardly politic to imply that your own side is engaged in mass murder on a scale approached by only the worst regimes of the modern era .
The U.S. military has steadfastly refused to maintain Iraqi body counts : for obvious reasons , they ’d rather we did n’t know how many Iraqi souls have been permanently " liberated " from their bodies .
More importantly , they ’d rather the Iraqis did n’t know .
Independent sources of such information invariably depend on reported deaths : the Iraqi media , Western news accounts , and figures from the UN and other humanitarian agencies .
Yet this kind of passive approach is not sufficient in wartime : the chaos makes it more than probable that a great deal of the killing goes unreported .
It therefore makes perfect sense that the Johns Hopkins survey  which involved researchers personally interviewing a total of 1,849 Iraqi households , most of whom produced death certificates  would be far higher .
That it is 10 times higher is not all that surprising  although quite sobering when one realizes the total represents 2.5 percent of Iraq ’s population .
The study has proved controversial , and anyone can summon their favorite experts to either support or debunk it .
Yet one has to say that , even if the figure of 650,000 is off by half , the vastness of U.S. war crimes in Iraq is quite a shocker .
No wonder the Americans are denying it : they ca n’t stand the sight of their own ruthlessness .
And the hypocrisy !
Here , after all , is a nation that was supposed to be " liberated "  and , instead , it has been turned into a slaughterhouse .
Whatever the numbers , that is the cruel reality .
The Iraqi government derides the Johns Hopkins numbers , as well they might : either that , or they ’d have to admit they were installed into power by a pack of mass murderers .
And that would be far too close to the truth .
I have no technical expertise in statistical analysis , so I wo n’t try to put on scientistic airs by waffling on about " baselines " and " clusters . "
I ’ll just cite the testimony of someone who is on the scene and has to deal with the horror on a daily basis :
" Some readers and viewers think we journalists are exaggerating about the situation in Iraq .
I can almost understand that because who would want to believe that things are this bad ?
Particularly when so many people here started out with such good intentions .
“ I do n’t know a single family here that has n’t had a relative , neighbor , or friend die violently .
In places where there ’s been all - out fighting going on , I ’ve interviewed parents who buried their dead child in the yard because it was too dangerous to go to the morgue . "
The hidden horror is so much worse than we imagine , yet the invisibility of evil is n’t at all unusual when it comes to the modern world .
The sheer scale of the crimes committed by the Nazis , the Soviets , the Khmer Rouge , and all the other mad tyrannies of the 20th century did n’t come to light until well after their demise .
One wonders if it will take the fall of the American Empire to uncover the full extent of Washington ’s war crimes .
As the number of children who are home - schooled grows — an estimated 1.1 million nationwide — some parents like Ms. Walter are opting for what is perhaps the most extreme application of the movement ’s ideas .
They are “ unschooling ” their children , a philosophy that is broadly defined by its rejection of the basic foundations of conventional education , including not only the schoolhouse but also classes , curriculums and textbooks .
In some ways it is as ancient a pedagogy as time itself , and in its modern American incarnation , is among the oldest home - schooling methods .
But it is also the most elusive , a cause of growing concern among some education officials and social scientists .
“ It is not clear to me how they will transition to a structured world and meet the most basic requirements for reading , writing and math , ” said Luis Huerta , a professor of public policy and education at Teachers College of Columbia University , whose national research includes a focus on home schooling .
There is scant data on the educational results of unschooling , and little knowledge about whether the thousands of unschooled children fare better or worse than regularly schooled students .
There is not even reliable data on how many people are unschooling , though many experts suggest the number is growing .
Here in Chicago , a group called the Northside Unschoolers has 100 families registered on its online list .
There are similar organizations coast to coast , including the San Francisco Bay Unschooling Network , Unschoolers Unlimited in Guilford , Conn. , and the Unschoolers of the Ozarks , serving Missouri , Oklahoma and Arkansas , although accurate figures for the number of families they serve are hard to come by .
Adherents say the rigidity of school - type settings and teacher - led instruction tend to stifle children ’s natural curiosity , setting them up for life without a true love of learning .
The inclusion of the phrase " Web 2.0 " in this article 's title is not , in any way , an acknowledgment of its validity , legitimacy , or relevance in the real world .

You do n't want to grow too quickly .
Limit yourself to the capacity of your outgoing mailserver , and omit users who have aggressive spam filters .
By the time the remaining users receive your confirmation email , their excitement and interest in your site has probably waned .
This should prevent them from contributing to your site , so you 'll save on hosting and administration costs .
Depend completely on user - generated content

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Leading governments of Europe are willing to let the United States again choose the next World Bank president if embattled current President Paul Wolfowitz agrees to step down soon , according to a published report .
The New York Times reported the European governments had wanted to end the tradition of the United States picking the World Bank leader , but they signaled Monday they were willing to drop that demand if it meant that a public split on the international bank 's board could be avoided .
European countries have proposed a deal that could lead to Paul Wolfowitz leaving his post as president of the World Bank .
" What I 'm hearing from colleagues is , ' Let 's not push the Americans too hard , ' " a senior European official involved in policy on the bank told the paper .
" We want to avoid a split between the United States and its European allies .
We 're willing to say : ' OK , you find a capable American to run this institution and we can live with that . ' "
There is some general resentment against the tradition at the bank that the president is always an American , named by the U.S. president .
The paper reported that even before Wolfowitz took office in 2005 , leading European countries had begun pushing to discard the custom that had existed since the 1940s that allowed the United States to select the bank president , a prerogative it received because it contributes the largest share of the bank 's financing .
But the United States has only 16.4 percent of the voting share on the World Bank board that chooses the president , while European countries have twice that vote .
Wolfowitz broke rules
An internal panel concluded Monday that Wolfowitz violated staff rules in arranging a promotion and pay raise for his girlfriend , according to a source close to the investigation who has seen the panel 's unreleased report .
Wolfowitz rebutted statements from former World Bank officials who claimed that he ignored Bank ethics committee directions on the Riza case and that he acted improperly .
He blamed what he calls " ambiguous bank rules and unclear governance mechanisms . "
He has been fighting a high - stakes campaign to hold onto his job .
His private attorney , Robert Bennett , told CNN Monday evening Wolfowitz has 72 hours to respond to the report with a rebuttal .
That 72 hour deadline began with delivery of the report to Wolfowitz Monday .
Bennett called it " unfair " that Wolfowitz was given such a short time to respond and " proves once again that the ad - hoc committee is rushing to judgment . "
Bennett said they hoped that the full board would be even - handed when they receive the report .
The 24 - member World Bank board will have the final say on Wolfowitz 's future , which could include a reprimand , asking him to step down , or firing him .
There is no word on when a decision will be made .
Some of the criticism of Wolfowitz dates back to when he was the No. 2 official at the Pentagon and one of the chief architects of the Iraq war .
He also drew fire for his anti-corruption policy at the bank , which some long - time bank employees thought unfairly victimized the poor in certain countries .
The brewing controversy at the World Bank also led to Kevin Kellems , Wolfowitz 's top communications advisor , to resign from the bank Monday , effective next week .
" Given the current environment surrounding the leadership of the World Bank Group , it is very difficult to be effective in helping to advance the mission of the institution , " Kellems said .

I ’m going to discuss the importance of false positives today .
I ’ve done this before , of course .
In this case , however , technical examples will only be used as analogies to the real point of this SOB entry — the Military Commissions Act , which President George Bush will be signing into law on the Seventeenth of this month .
Do n’t worry , I doubt they ’ll disappear me .
I ’m popular enough that people would notice I ’m missing , but not popular enough to be in the top - 1,000 list of people to disappear .
Back in April , I wrote about how I addressed the problem of blog spam at the time .
We might consider , in this case , comments to be analogous to people and blog spam comments to terrorists , all of which are trying to get into the “ country ” of SOB :
There was an objective measure of a preponderance of evidence in place , in the form of checking the number of links in a comment : if you have too many , you might be a spammer in need of elimination from my weblog .
As such , incoming comments with “ too many ” links are fed into a moderation queue , where they are not publicly displayed unless and until I approve them .
This is something like taking people aside at Customs in an international airport to check them out when they are found to have more than a predetermined limit of “ links ” to suspicious organizations .
This can be annoying , but is n’t as bad as random checks ( dumping one out of every four incoming comments into moderation , for instance ) , or using a “ no - fly list ” made up of common words that happen to appear in some spam messages .
It might be a bit like ethnic profiling , checking for Islamic connections rather than actual terrorist activity , though — and it might help cut down on the number of spam posts that slip through while still ( eventually ) letting all non-terrorists through .
Like terrorists faced with such a half - baked system of trying to detect terrorists , the spammers started using posts ( suicide bombers ) that do n’t have enough links to suspicious organizations to set off any “ alarms ” .
They started basically “ flying under radar ” .
They even started using the equivalent of blonde - haired Muslim converts named Bob Smith .
As such , I started requiring registration ( and being signed in ) to post at SOB .
This was a bit like a national ID card and keeping a database on Un - American Activities performed by each registrant .
People chafed at this ( silently , for the most part ) and did n’t post comments as much .
It was seen as burdensome and , frankly , only those who knew me well enough to trust me had any certainty I was n’t collecting personal information for sale to other spammers .
Nobody likes to be registered , and I started to get something of a “ false positive ” effect in that the system of protection against spammers was also “ protecting ” against legitimate comments sometimes .
Ultimately , I had to discontinue this policy for reasons of sanity .

Nobody likes to be registered , and I started to get something of a “ false positive ” effect in that the system of protection against spammers was also “ protecting ” against legitimate comments sometimes .
Ultimately , I had to discontinue this policy for reasons of sanity .
I made a conscious decision to avoid using validation images to ensure that “ real human beings ” were posting comments as a means of preventing blog spam .
Part of the reason for this is that “ real human beings ” sometimes post spam comments .
Another part is that sometimes “ real human beings ” have trouble viewing such images ( as demonstrated by the regular failures of Blogspot / Blogger antispam measures to actually show the image at all ) .
Yet another is that any method that is sufficiently clear to ensure its readability is potentially susceptible to spambots with OCR capability .
The biggest problem is false positives : I can handle a little bit of spam slipping through the cracks ( and cleaning it up later ) if it ’s the only way to ensure that no legitimate comments get blocked or otherwise lost forever .
What we have here , in analogy , is the principle of preferring that one hundred murderers go free rather than imprison a single innocent man .
Detain a couple minutes for questioning , maybe , as long as it ’s not enough to drive him away forever — but not imprison .
More recently — just last month , in fact — I commented specifically on false positives in more depth .
I opened with the following :
When you ’re talking about lines of communication , such as email , blogging comments , and your telephone , you ’re talking about a medium that is open to abuse .
To make a means of communication immune to abuse is to make it useless as a means of communication .
This does n’t mean you cannot reduce the incidence of abuse through clever tricks , careful use , and whatever jumping - through of hoops may come to mind .
It just means that the vulnerability still exists .
The key is not to believe we can eliminate abuse of a means of communication entirely , but to minimize it so that the abuse is manageable .
I later clarified and summarized , saying that to truly eliminate any ability to abuse a line of communication destroys it .
This is directly analogous to the notion that completely eliminating the ability of malicious people to act in a free society requires eliminating the “ free ” in society .
This is a concept that seems lost on a lot of politicians — apparently more Republicans than Democrats , and almost no Libertarians appear to suffer this delusion , but it does cut across party lines somewhat .
I further said , in that earlier entry :
The first mandate for solving a communications abuse problem is to avoid interfering with communication itself .
In the case of systems like spam filtering , this means that one should avoid false positives first and foremost .
In the case of systems like the United States system of law , where the abuse in question is of society ’s protections of individual rights and liberties , that means one should avoid violating those rights and liberties oneself in pursuit of protecting them from abuse .
One might say that , in the so - called War On Terror as in my own personal war on blog spam , false positives are the root of all evil .
What value is the security of our nation ’s innocent citizens if we imprison , torture , and kill them along with the terrorists from whom we wish to protect them ?
Yesterday , I commented on the passage of the Military Commissions Act , paying particular attention to its violations of habeas corpus , the redefinitions of torture ( and the bit of media attention that has gotten ) , and the voting record of the House of Representatives ( and , later in comments , the Senate ) on this particular issue .
Today , thanks to a Bruce Schneier security newsletter email I received , I was made aware of a brief illustration of the more obvious problems with the Military Commissions
Act that uses some C source code for an example .
Kevin Poulsen provides the following example of the Act as C code in his weblog post Bad Code :
if ( person = terrorist ) { punish_severely ( ) ; } else { exit ( - 1 ) ; }
For those of you who are not aware of how C code works , I ’ll see if I can explain this one .
The term person and the term terrorist here appear to be variables .
Normally , in an if conditional statement like this , it should be comparing the values of these two variables to see if they ’re identical .
Presumably , the terrorist variable might contain a statement such as “ kills civilian noncombatants for political purposes ” , while we do n’t know what the value of person is in this case — thus the need for the comparison .
The operator between person and terrorist is , in this case , = .
Unfortunately , that single equals sign is an assignment operator , not a comparison operator , in C .
In other words , this code is assigning the value of terrorist to the variable person , thus making person and terrorist identical in the eyes of this code rather than just checking to see if they ’re the same .
If you actually wanted to do a comparison , you ’d use the == operator instead — a double - equal - sign operator .
This is subtly critical to the analogy to the Military Commissions
Act , which just assumes that somehow the law enforcement personnel who are “ detaining ” ( imprisoning indefinitely or , in the case of citizens , for up to a year , without having to actually have probable cause ) people for “ questioning ” ( interrogation and torture ) know what the hell they ’re doing without considering whether they might make mistakes in picking out targets .
It ’s as if Congress believes the Department of Justice is infallible and can never “ accidentally ” detain a non-terrorist , so it does n’t matter if people get scooped up off the street and made to vanish without due process , because due process only slows down these morally perfect supermen incapable of error .
It gets worse , though — and slightly more subtle , too .
The line that reads punish_severely ( ) refers to a function , presumably defined somewhere else in the program .
It ’s a collection of code that performs some useful bit of action for you whenever it ’s called by the punish_severely ( ) syntax .
If you wanted to send it a parameter — some bit of information it needs to be able to change the way it operates when it runs — you ’d say something like punish_severely ( person ) , thus ensuring that it specifically operates on whatever the person variable currently contains .
If you happened to be correctly checking for equivalency between a given person and the value of a terrorist , via the statement if ( person == terrorist ) , the statement punish_severely ( person ) would effectively send that terrorist - equivalent person off to Guantanamo Bay or whatever .
Because no parameter is passed to the punish_severely ( ) function , however , it just sorta does stuff without any regard for what ’s going on in the conditional test .
In other words , we do n’t really know what it is doing at all .
If that does n’t scare you , I do n’t know what will .
So , in short , the question “ Is this person a terrorist ? ” has been replaced with “ Given that a person we target must be a terrorist . . . ” and the implication that terrorists will be severely punished as been replaced with the implication that someone , somewhere , will probably be punished severely — and it likely involves the person detained for questioning and anyone with the same name , or the same hair color , or . . . whatever .
We do n’t know the target of punishment , we do n’t know the form the punishment will take , we do n’t really know who ’s being punished , and all we know about the person is that we ’ve labelled the person a terrorist without bothering to check whether that person is , in fact , a terrorist .
Welcome to the Military Commissions Act .
As Kevin Poulsen seems confident will happen , the Supreme Court might catch this in debugging .
That assumes , of course , that the code will ever be sent to the Supreme Court for debugging at all .
Something he seems to have overlooked is the fact that the wording of the Military Commissions
Act specifically makes it difficult for the matter to ever reach a courtroom at all .

Somewhere along the way to free - market capitalism , the United States became the most wasteful society on the planet .
Most of us know it .
There is the waste we can see : traffic jams , irreparable VCRs , Styrofoam coffee cups , landfills ; the waste we ca n’t see : Superfund sites , greenhouse gases , radioactive waste , vagrant chemicals ; and the social waste we do n’t want to think about : homelessness , crime , drug addiction , our forgotten infirm and elderly .
Nationally and globally , we perceive social and environmental decay as distinct and unconnected .
In fact , a humbling design flaw deeply embedded in industrial logic links the two problems .
Toto , pull back the curtain :
The efficient dynamo of industrialism is n’t there .
Even by its own standards , industrialism is extraordinarily inefficient .
Modern industrialism came into being in a world very different from the one we live in today : fewer people , less material well - being , plentiful natural resources .
As a result of the successes of industry and capitalism , these conditions have now reversed .
Today , more people are chasing fewer natural resources .
But industry still operates by the same rules , using more resources to make fewer people more productive .
The consequence : massive waste — of both resources and people .
Decades from now , we may look back at the end of the 20th century and ponder why business and society ignored these trends for so long — how one species thought it could flourish while nature ebbed .
Historians will show , perhaps , how politics , the media , economics , and commerce created an industrial regime that wasted our social and natural environment and called it growth .
As author Bill McKibben put it , “ The laws of Congress and the laws of physics have grown increasingly divergent , and the laws of physics are not likely to yield . ”
The laws we ’re ignoring determine how life sustains itself .
Commerce requires living systems for its welfare — it is emblematic of the times that this even needs to be said .
Because of our industrial prowess , we emphasize what people can do but tend to ignore what nature does .
Commercial institutions , proud of their achievements , do not see that healthy living systems — clean air and water , healthy soil , stable climates — are integral to a functioning economy .
As our living systems deteriorate , traditional forecasting and business economics become the equivalent of house rules on a sinking cruise ship .
One is tempted to say that there is nothing wrong with capitalism except that it has never been tried .
Our current industrial system is based on accounting principles that would bankrupt any company .
Conventional economic theories will not guide our future for a simple reason :
They have never placed “ natural capital ” on the balance sheet .
When it is included , not as a free amenity or as a putative infinite supply , but as an integral and valuable part of the production process , everything changes .
Prices , costs , and what is and is n’t economically sound change dramatically .
Industries destroy natural capital because they have historically benefited from doing so .
As businesses successfully created more goods and jobs , consumer demand soared , compounding the destruction of natural capital .
All that is about to change .
Natural Capital
Natural systems provide trillions of dollars in services that have no man-made substitutes , as Biosphere II ’s failure shows .
Everyone is familiar with the traditional definition of capital as accumulated wealth in the form of investments , factories , and equipment .
“ Natural capital , ” on the other hand , comprises the resources we use , both nonrenewable ( oil , coal , metal ore ) and renewable ( forests , fisheries , grasslands ) .
Although we usually think of renewable resources in terms of desired materials , such as wood , their most important value lies in the services they provide .
These services are related to , but distinct from , the resources themselves .
They are not pulpwood but forest cover , not food but topsoil .
Living systems feed us , protect us , heal us , clean the nest , let us breathe .
They are the “ income ” derived from a healthy environment : clean air and water , climate stabilization , rainfall , ocean productivity , fertile soil , watersheds , and the less - appreciated functions of the environment , such as processing waste — both natural and industrial .
Nature ’s Services , a book due out this spring edited by Stanford University biologist Gretchen C. Daily , identifies trillions of dollars of critical ecosystem services received annually by commerce .
For anyone who doubts the innate value of ecosystem services , the $ 200 million Biosphere II experiment stands as a reality check .
In 1991 , eight people entered a sealed , glass - enclosed , 3 - acre living system , where they expected to remain alive and healthy for two years .
Instead , air quality plummeted , carbon dioxide levels rose , and oxygen had to be pumped in from the outside to keep the inhabitants healthy .
Nitrous oxide levels inhibited brain function .
Cockroaches flourished while insect pollinators died , vines choked out crops and trees , and nutrients polluted the water so much that the residents had to filter it by hand before they could drink it .
Of the original 25 small animal species in Biosphere II , 19 became extinct .
At the end of 17 months , the humans showed signs of oxygen starvation from living at the equivalent of an altitude of 17,500 feet .
Of course , design flaws are inherent in any prototype , but the fact remains that $ 200 million could not maintain a functioning ecosystem for eight people for 17 months .
We add eight people to the planet every three seconds .
The lesson of Biosphere II is that there are no man-made substitutes for essential natural services .
We have not come up with an economical way to manufacture watersheds , gene pools , topsoil , wetlands , river systems , pollinators , or fisheries .
Technological fixes can’t solve problems with soil fertility or guarantee clean air , biological diversity , pure water , and climatic stability ; nor can they increase the capacity of the environment to absorb 25 billion tons of waste created annually in America alone .
Natural Capital as a Limiting Factor
The new limits to prosperity are natural systems — not boats , but fisheries ; not sawmills , but forests .
Until the 1970s , the concept of natural capital was largely irrelevant to business planning , and it still is in most companies .
Throughout the industrial era , economists considered manufactured capital — money , factories , etc. — the principal factor in industrial production , and perceived natural capital as a marginal contributor .
The exclusion of natural capital from balance sheets was an understandable omission .
There was so much of it , it did n’t seem worth counting .
Not any longer .
Historically , economic development has faced a number of limiting factors , including the availability of labor , energy resources , machinery , and financial capital .
The absence or depletion of a limiting factor can prevent a system from growing .
If marooned in a snowstorm , you need water , food , and warmth to survive .
Having more of one factor cannot compensate for the absence of the other .
Drinking more water will not make up for lack of clothing if you are freezing .
In the past , by increasing the limiting factor , industrial societies continued to develop economically .
It was n’t always pretty : Slavery “ satisfied ” labor shortages , as did immigration and high birthrates .
Mining companies exploited coal , oil , and gas to meet increased energy demands .
The need for labor - saving devices provoked the invention of steam engines , spinning jennies , cotton gins , and telegraphs .
Financial capital became universally accessible through central banks , credit , stock exchanges , and currency exchange mechanisms .
Because economies grow and change , new limiting factors occasionally emerge .
When they do , massive restructuring occurs .
Nothing works as before .
Behavior that used to be economically sound becomes unsound , even destructive .
Economist Herman E. Daly cautions that we are facing a historic juncture in which , for the first time , the limits to increased prosperity are not the lack of man-made capital but the lack of natural capital .
The limits to increased fish harvests are not boats , but productive fisheries ; the limits to irrigation are not pumps or electricity , but viable aquifers ; the limits to pulp and lumber production are not sawmills , but plentiful forests .
Like all previous limiting factors , the emergence of natural capital as an economic force will pose a problem for reactionary institutions .
For those willing to embrace the challenges of a new era , however , it presents an enormous opportunity .
The High Price of Bad Information
Economists make no distinctions when reporting growth — whether we ’ve invested in new schools or paid to clean up a toxic waste spill .
The value of natural capital is masked by a financial system that gives us improper information — a classic case of “ garbage in , garbage out . ”
Money and prices and markets do n’t give us exact information about how much our suburbs , freeways , and spandex cost .
Instead , everything else is giving us accurate information : our beleaguered air and watersheds , our overworked soils , our decimated inner cities .
All of these provide information our prices should be giving us but do not .
Let ’s begin with a startling possibility : The U.S. economy may not be growing at all , and may have ceased growing nearly 25 years ago .
Obviously , we are not talking about the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , measured in dollars , which has grown at 2.5 percent per year since 1973 .
Despite this growth , there is little evidence of improved lives , better infrastructure , higher real wages , more leisure and family time , and greater economic security .
The logic here is simple , although unorthodox .
We do n’t know if our economy is growing because the indices we rely upon , such as the GDP , do n’t measure growth .
The GDP measures money transactions on the assumption that when a dollar changes hands , economic growth occurs .
But there is a world of difference between financial exchanges and growth .
Compare an addition to your home to a two - month stay in the hospital for injuries you suffered during a mugging .
Say both cost the same .
Which is growth ?
The GDP makes no distinction .
Or suppose the president announces he will authorize $ 10 billion for new prisons to help combat crime .
Is the $ 10 billion growth ?
Or what if a train overturns next to the Sacramento River and spills 10,000 gallons of atrazine , poisoning all the fish for 30 miles downstream ?
Money pours into cleanups , hatchery releases , announcements warning people about tainted fish , and lawsuits against the railroad and the chemical company .
Growth ?
Or loss ?
Currently , economists count most industrial , environmental , and social waste as GDP , right along with bananas , cars , and Barbie dolls .
Growth includes all expenditures , regardless of whether society benefits or loses .
This includes the cost of emergency room services , prisons , toxic cleanups , homeless shelters , lawsuits , cancer treatments , divorces , and every piece of litter along the side of every highway .
Instead of counting decay as economic growth , we need to subtract decline from revenue to see if we are getting ahead or falling behind .
Unfortunately , where economic growth is concerned , the government uses a calculator with no minus sign .
Wasting Resources Means Wasting People
Reducing resource waste creates jobs .
Industry has always sought to increase the productivity of workers , not resources .
And for good reason .
Most resource prices have fallen for 200 years — due in no small part to the extraordinary increases in our ability to extract , harvest , ship , mine , and exploit resources .
If the competitive advantage goes to the low - cost provider , and resources are cheap , then business will naturally use more and more resources in order to maximize worker productivity .
Such a strategy was eminently sensible when the population was smaller and resources were plentiful .
But with respect to meeting the needs of the future , contemporary business economics is pre-Copernican .
We cannot heal the country ’s social wounds or “ save ” the environment as long as we cling to the outdated industrial assumptions that the summum bonum of commercial enterprise is to use more stuff and fewer people .
Our thinking is backward :
We should n’t use more of what we have less of ( natural capital ) to use less of what we have more of ( people ) .
While the need to maintain high labor productivity is critical to income and economic well - being , labor productivity that corrodes society is like burning the furniture to heat the house .
Our pursuit of increased labor productivity at all costs not only depletes the environment , it also depletes labor .
Just as overproduction can exhaust topsoil , overproductivity can exhaust a workforce .
The underlying assumption that greater productivity would lead to greater leisure and well - being , while true for many decades , has become a bad joke .
In the United States , those who are employed , and presumably becoming more productive , find they are working 100 to 200 hours more per year than 20 years ago .
Yet real wages have n’t increased for more than 20 years .
In 1994 , I asked a roomful of senior executives from Fortune 500 companies the following questions :
Do you want to work harder in five years than you do today ?
Do you know anyone in your office who is a slacker ?
Do you know any parents in your company who are spending too much time with their kids ?
The only response was a few embarrassed laughs .
Then it was quiet — perhaps numb is a better word .
Meanwhile , people whose jobs have been downsized , re-engineered , or restructured out of existence are being told — as are millions of youths around the world — that we have created an economic system so ingenious that it does n’t need them , except perhaps to do menial service jobs .
In parts of the industrialized world , unemployment and underemployment have risen faster than employment for more than 25 years .
Nearly one - third of the world ’s workers sense that they have no value in the present economic scheme .
Clearly , when 1 billion willing workers can’t find a decent job or any employment at all , we need to make fundamental changes .
We ca n’t — whether through monetary means , government programs , or charity — create a sense of value and dignity in people ’s lives when we ’re simultaneously developing a society that does n’t need them .
If people do n’t feel valued , they will act out society ’s verdict in sometimes shocking ways .
William Strickland , a pioneer in working with inner-city children , once said that “ you ca n’t teach algebra to someone who does n’t want to be here . ”
He meant that urban kids do n’t want to be here at all , alive , anywhere on earth .
They try to tell us , but we do n’t listen .
So they engage in increasingly risky behavior — unprotected sex , drugs , violence — until we notice .
By that time , their conduct has usually reached criminal proportions — and then we blame the victims , build more jails , and lump the costs into the GDP .
The theologian Matthew Fox has pointed out that we are the only species without full employment .
Yet we doggedly pursue technologies that will make that ever more so .
Today we fire people , perfectly capable people , to wring out one more wave of profits .
Some of the restructuring is necessary and overdue .
But , as physicists Amory Lovins and Ernst von WeizsS cker have repeatedly advised , what we should do is fire the unproductive kilowatts , barrels of oil , tons of material , and pulp from old - growth forests — and hire more people to do so .
In fact , reducing resource use creates jobs and lessens the impact we have on the environment .
We can grow , use fewer resources , lower taxes , increase per capita spending on the needy , end federal deficits , reduce the size of government , and begin to restore damaged environments , both natural and social .
At this point , you may well be skeptical .
The last summary is too hopeful and promises too much .
If economic alternatives are this attractive , why are n’t we doing them now ?
A good question .
I will try to answer it .
But , lest you think these proposals are Pollyannaish , know that my optimism arises from the magnitude of the problem , not from the ease of the solutions .
Waste is too expensive ; it ’s cheaper to do the right thing .
Resource Productivity
Innovations — from ultrasound washing machines to virtual malls — will radically reduce resource inefficiency .
Economists argue that rational markets make this the most efficient of all possible economies .
But that theory works only as long as you use financial efficiency as the sole metric and ignore physics , biology , and common sense .
The physics of energy and mass conservation , along with the laws of entropy , are the arbiters of efficiency , not Forbes or the Dow Jones or the Federal Reserve .
The economic issue is :
How much work ( value ) does society get from its materials and energy ?
This is a very different question than asking how much return it can get out of its money .
If we already deployed materials or energy efficiently , it would support the contention that a radical increase in resource productivity is unrealistic .
But the molecular trail leads to the opposite conclusion .
For example , cars are barely 1 percent efficient in the sense that , for every 100 gallons of gasoline , only one gallon actually moves the passengers .
Likewise , only 8 to 10 percent of the energy used in heating the filament of an incandescent lightbulb actually becomes visible light .
( Some describe it as a space heater disguised as a lightbulb . )
Modern carpeting remains on the floor for up to 12 years , after which it remains in landfills for as long as 20,000 years or more — less than .06 percent efficiency .
According to Robert Ayres , a leader in studying industrial metabolism , about 94 percent of the materials extracted for use in manufacturing durable products become waste before the product is even manufactured .
More waste is generated in production , and most of that is lost unless the product is reused or recycled .
Overall , America ’s material and energy efficiency is no more than 1 or 2 percent .
In other words , American industry uses as much as 100 times more material and energy than theoretically required to deliver consumer services .
A watershed moment in the study of resource productivity occurred in 1976 , when Amory Lovins published his now - famous essay “ Energy Strategy : The Road Not Taken ? ” Lovins ’ argument was simple : Instead of pursuing a “ hard path ” demanding a constantly increasing energy supply , he proposed that the real issue was how best to provide the energy ’s “ end use ” at the least cost .
In other words , consumers are not interested in gigajoules , watts , or Btu , he argued .
They want well - illuminated workspaces , hot showers , comfortable homes , effective transport .
People want the service that energy provides .
Lovins pointed out that an intelligent energy system would furnish the service at the lowest cost .
As an example , he compared the cost of insulation with that of nuclear power .
The policy of building nuclear power plants represented the “ supply at any cost ” doctrine that still lingers today .
He said it made no sense to use expensive power plants to heat homes , and then let that heat escape because the homes lack insulation .
Lovins contended that we could make more money by saving energy than by wasting it , and that we ’d find more energy in the attics of American homes than in all the oil buried in Alaska .
His predictions proved correct , although his proposals remained largely unheeded by the government .
Today , the nuclear power industry has become moribund , not because of anti-nuclear protests but because it is uncompetitive .
In 1976 , energy experts used to argue about whether the United States could achieve energy savings of 30 percent .
Twenty - one years later , having already obtained savings of more than 30 percent over 1976 levels — savings worth $ 180 billion a year — experts now wonder whether we can achieve an additional 50 to 90 percent .
Lovins thinks we might possibly save as much as 99 percent .
That may sound ridiculous , but certainly no more so than the claim that textile workers could use gears and motors to increase their efficiency a hundredfold would have sounded at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution .
The resource productivity revolution is at a similar threshold .
State - of - the - shelf technologies — fans , lights , pumps , superefficient windows , motors , and other products with proven track records — combined with intelligent mechanical and building design , could reduce energy consumption in American buildings by 90 percent .
State - of - the - art technologies that are just being introduced could reduce consumption still further .
In some cases — wind power , for example — the technologies not only operate more efficiently and pollute less , they also are more labor - intensive .
Wind energy requires more labor than coal - generated electricity , but has become competitive with it on a real - cost basis .
The resource revolution is starting to show up in all areas of business .
In the forest products industry , clearinghouses now identify hundreds of techniques that can reduce the use of timber and pulpwood by nearly 75 percent without diminishing the quality of housing , the “ services ” provided by books and paper , or the convenience of a tissue .
In the housing industry , builders can use dozens of local or composite materials , including those made from rice and wheat straw , wastepaper , and earth , instead of studs , plywood , and concrete .
The Herman Miller company currently designs furniture that can be reused and remanufactured a number of times ; DesignTex , a subsidiary of Steelcase , a leading manufacturer of office furniture , sells fabrics that can be easily composted .
Although a new “ hypercar ” is now in development , “ new urbanist ” architects , such as Peter Calthorpe , Andres Duany , Elizabeth Plater - Zyberk , and others , are designing communities that could eliminate 40 to 60 percent of driving needs .
( A recent San Francisco study showed that communities can decrease car use by 30 percent when they double population density . )
Internet - based transactions may render many shopping malls obsolete .
Down the road we ’ll have quantum semiconductors that store vast amounts of information on chips no bigger than a dot ; diodes that emit light for 20 years without bulbs ; ultrasound washing machines that use no water , heat , or soap ; hyperlight materials stronger than steel ; deprintable and reprintable paper ; biological technologies that reduce or eliminate the need for insecticides and fertilizers ; plastics that are both reusable and compostable ; piezoelectric polymers that can generate electricity from the heel of your shoe or the force of a wave ; and roofs and roads that do double duty as solar energy collectors .
Some of these technologies , of course , may turn out to be impractical or have unwanted side effects .
Nevertheless , these and thousands more are lining up like salmon to swim upstream toward greater resource productivity .
Resource Politics
Reducing income taxes while increasing resource prices will stimulate employment and environmental restoration .
How can government help speed these entrepreneurial “ salmon ” along ?
The most fundamental policy implication is simple to envision , but difficult to execute :
We have to revise the tax system to stop subsidizing behaviors we do n’t want ( resource depletion and pollution ) and to stop taxing behaviors we do want ( income and work ) .
We need to transform , incrementally but firmly , the sticks and carrots that guide business .
Taxes and subsidies are information .
Everybody , whether rich or poor , acts on that information every day .
Taxes make something more expensive to buy ; subsidies artificially lower prices .
In the United States , we generally like to subsidize environmental exploitation , cars , big corporations , and technological boondoggles .
( We do n’t like to subsidize clean technologies that will lead to more jobs and innovation because that is supposed to be left to the “ market . ” )
Specifically , we subsidize carbon - based energy production , particularly oil and coal ; we massively subsidize a transportation system that has led to suburban sprawl and urban decay ; we subsidize risky technologies like nuclear fission and pie - in - the - sky weapons systems like Star Wars .
( Between 1946 and 1961 the Atomic Energy Commission spent $ 1 billion to develop a nuclear - powered airplane .
But it was such a lemon that the plane could not get off the ground .
History ’s dustbin also includes a nuclear - powered ship , the Savannah , that was retired after the Maritime Administration found she cost $ 2 million more per year than other ships . )
We subsidize the disposal of waste in all its myriad forms — from landfills , to Superfund cleanups , to deep - well injection , to storage of nuclear waste .
In the process , we encourage an economy where 80 percent of what we consume gets thrown away after one use .
As for farming , the U.S. government covers all the bases :
We subsidize agricultural production , agricultural nonproduction , agricultural destruction , and agricultural restoration .
We provide price supports to sugarcane growers , and we subsidize the restoration of the Everglades ( which sugarcane growers are destroying ) .
We subsidize cattle grazing on public lands , and we pay for soil conservation .
We subsidize energy costs so that farmers can deplete aquifers to grow alfalfa to feed cows that make milk that we store in warehouses as surplus cheese that does not get to the hungry .
Then there is the money we donate to dying industries : federal insurance provided to floodplain developers , cheap land leases to ski resorts , deposit insurance given to people who looted U.S. savings and loans , payments to build roads into wilderness areas so that privately held forest product companies can buy wood at a fraction of replacement cost , and monies to defense suppliers who have provided the Pentagon with billions of dollars in unnecessary inventory and parts .
Those are some of the activities we encourage .
What we hinder , apparently , is work and social welfare , since we mainly tax labor and income , thereby discouraging both .
In 1994 , the federal government raised $ 1.27 trillion in taxes .
Seventy - one percent of that revenue came from taxes on labor — income taxes and Social Security taxes .
Another 10 percent came from corporate income tax .
By taxing labor heavily , we encourage businesses not to employ people .
To create a policy that supports resource productivity will require a shift away from taxing the social “ good ” of labor , toward taxing the social “ bads ” of resource exploitation , pollution , fossil fuels , and waste .
This tax shift should be “ revenue neutral ” — meaning that for every dollar of taxation added to resources or waste , one dollar would be removed from labor taxes .
As the cost of waste and resources increases , business would save money by hiring less - expensive labor to save more - expensive resources .
The eventual goal would be to achieve zero taxation on labor and income .
The purpose of this tax shift would be to change what is taxed , not who is taxed .
But no tax shift is uniform , and without adjustments for lower incomes , a shift toward taxing resources would likely be regressive .
Therefore , efforts should be made to keep the tax burden on various income groups more or less where it is now .
( There are numerous means to accomplish this . )
The important element to change is the purpose of the tax system because , other than generating revenue , the current tax system has no clear goal .
The only incentive provided by the Internal Revenue Code , with its 9,000 sections , is to cheat or to hire tax lawyers .
A shift toward taxing resources would require steady implementation , in order to give business a clear horizon in which to make strategic investments .
A time span of 15 to 20 years , for example , should be long enough to permit businesses to continue depreciating current capital investments over their useful lives .
Of course , a tax shift alone will not change the way business operates ; a broad array of policy changes on issues of global trade , education , economic development , econometrics ( including measures of growth and well - being ) , and scientific research must accompany it .
For the tax shift to succeed , we must also reverse the wrenching breakdown of our democracy , which means addressing campaign finance reform and media concentration .
It is easier , as the saying goes , to ride a horse in the direction it is going .
Because the costs of natural capital will inevitably increase , we should start changing the tax system now and get ahead of the curve .
Shifting taxes to resources wo n’t — as some in industry will doubtless claim — mean diminishing standards of living .
It will mean an explosion of innovation that will create products , techniques , and processes that are far more effective than what they replace .
Some economists will naturally counter that we should let the markets dictate costs and that using taxation to promote particular outcomes is interventionist .
But all tax systems are interventionist ; the question is not whether to intervene but how to intervene .
A tax system should integrate cost with price .
Currently , we dissociate the two .
We know the price of everything but the cost of nothing .
Price is what the buyer pays .
Cost is what society pays .
For example , Americans pay about $ 1.50 per gallon at the gas pump , but gasoline actually costs up to $ 7 a gallon when you factor in all the costs .
Middle Eastern oil , for instance , costs nearly $ 100 a barrel : $ 25 to buy and $ 75 a barrel for the Pentagon to keep shipping lanes open to tanker traffic .
Similarly , a pesticide may be priced at $ 35 per gallon , but what does it cost society as the pesticide makes its way into wells , rivers , and bloodstreams ?
The Future
Our living systems and social stability are at risk .
But the solutions are profitable , creative , and eminently possible .
In 1750 , few could imagine the outcome of industrialization .
Today , the prospect of a resource productivity revolution in the next century is equally hard to fathom .
But this is what it promises : an economy that uses progressively less material and energy each year and where the quality of consumer services continues to improve ; an economy where environmental deterioration stops and gets reversed as we invest in increasing our natural capital ; and , finally , a society where we have more useful and worthy work available than people to do it .
A utopian vision ?
No .
The human condition will remain .
We will still be improvident and wise , foolish and just .
No economic system is a panacea , nor can any create a better person .
But as the 20th century has painfully taught us , a bad system can certainly destroy good people .
Natural capitalism is not about making sudden changes , uprooting institutions , or fomenting upheaval for a new social order .
( In fact , these consequences are more likely if we do n’t address fundamental problems . )
Natural capitalism is about making small , critical choices that can tip economic and social factors in positive ways .
Natural capitalism may not guarantee particular outcomes , but it will ensure that economic systems more closely mimic biological systems , which have successfully adapted to dynamic changes over millennia .
After all , this analogy is at the heart of capitalism , the idea that markets have a power that mimics life and evolution .
We should expand this logic , not retract it .
For business , the opportunities are clear and enormous .
With the population doubling sometime in the next century , and resource availability per capita dropping by one - half to three - fourths over that same period , which factor in production do you think will go up in value — and which do you think will go down ?
This basic shift in capital availability is inexorable .
Ironically , organizations like Earth First ! , Rainforest Action Network , and Greenpeace have now become the real capitalists .
By addressing such issues as greenhouse gases , chemical contamination , and the loss of fisheries , wildlife corridors , and primary forests , they are doing more to preserve a viable business future than are all the chambers of commerce put together .
While business leaders hotly contest the idea of resource shortages , there are few credible scientists or corporations who argue that we are not losing the living systems that provide us with trillions of dollars of natural capital : our soil , forest cover , aquifers , oceans , grasslands , and rivers .
Moreover , these systems are diminishing at a time when the world ’s population and the demand for services are growing exponentially .
Looking ahead , if living standards and population double over the next 50
years as some predict , and if we assume the developing world shared the
same living standard we do , we would have to increase our resource use
( and attendant waste ) by a factor of 16 in five decades .
Publicly ,
governments , the United Nations , and industries all work toward this end .
Privately , no one believes that we can increase industrial throughput by
a factor anywhere near 16 , considering the earth ’s limited and now
fraying life - support systems .
It is difficult for economists , whose important theories originated
during a time of resource abundance , to understand how the decline in
ecosystem services is laying the groundwork for the next stage in
economic evolution .
This next stage , whatever it may be called , is being
brought about by powerful and much - delayed feedback from living systems .
As we surrender our living systems , social stability , fiscal soundness ,
and personal health to outmoded economic assumptions , we are hoping that
conventional economic growth will save us .
But if economic “ growth ” does
save us , it will be anything but conventional .
So why be hopeful ?
Because the solution is profitable , creative , and
eminently possible .
Societies may act stupidly for a period of time , but
eventually they move to the path of least economic resistance .
The loss
of natural capital services ,
lamentable as it is in environmental terms , also affects costs .
So far ,
we have created convoluted economic theories and accounting systems to
work around the problem .
You can win a Nobel Prize in economics and travel to the royal palace in
Stockholm in a gilded , horse - drawn brougham believing that ancient
forests are more valuable in liquidation — as fruit crates and Yellow
Pages — than as a going and growing concern .
But soon ( I would estimate
within a few decades ) , we will realize collectively what each of us
already knows individually :
It ’s cheaper to take care of something — a
roof , a car , a planet — than to let it decay and try to fix it later .
While there may be no “ right ” way
to value a forest or a river , there is a wrong way , which is to give it
no value at all .
How do we decide the value of
a 700 - year - old tree ?
We need only ask how much it would cost to make a
new one .
Or a new river , or even a
new atmosphere .
Despite the shrill divisiveness of media and politics , Americans remain
remarkably consistent in what kind of country they envision for their
children and grandchildren .
The benefits of resource productivity align
almost perfectly with what American voters say they want : better schools ,
a better environment , safer communities , more economic security , stronger
families and family support , freer markets , less regulation , fewer taxes ,
smaller government , and more local control .
The future belongs to those who understand that doing more with less
is compassionate , prosperous , and enduring , and thus more intelligent ,
even competitive .

Austrian Rifles via Iran ? : Another Crock
An extremely well - informed observer sent me this comment on the story that Iran is sending high - powered Austrian rifles to Iraqi Shiites .
Like the whole USG story about Iran supplying deadly weapons to dangerous Shiite militias , this one turns out to be riddled with falsehoods .
‘ Please allow me to comment on the Austrian Sniper rifles .
There was a deal between Steyr - Mannlicher and the Iranians in the last year of Khatami ’s presidency , which followed as usual legal procedures , thus the Iranians handed out an end - user certificate .
Originally the Iranians wanted 800 but in the end only 300 were delivered .
The rifle has no automatic capability but can pierce metal plate at a distance of 1000 meters .
The Iranian border guards allegedly use it to shoot at long distance into the motor blocks of the SUVs and pickups of the Drug gangs operating alongside the Afghan border .
There were American and I think also British protests when the deal was concluded .
It is important that this was before Ahmadinezhad did his odious speech on Israel and the Holocoust , otherwise I cannot imagine that the Austrians would have concluded the deal .
The original article about Austrian rifles in Iraq appeared in the Daily Telegraph and is full of inconsistencies .
For instance they say that the US found 100 of these rifles in Iraq and 170 American and Coalition troops have been killed by that weapon .
As far as I know 170 is the total of US and Coalition troops killed by Shiite militias ; total combat casualties are about 3000 !
The vast majority has been killed by IEDs and other explosives .
The article bases its accusations on a US display of weaponry designed to prove that Iran has been supplying Shia insurgents in Iraq , but there is no single line about the Austrian rifles .
But both articles put the Iranian nuclear issue centre stage !
Meanwhile the US are unable to provide the Austrians with the guns ’ serial numbers .
Steyr - Mannlicher also hinted at the fact that these guns can easily be rebuilt as the licencing has expired and one can buy them in countries like Canada . ‘
Update : Right after I posted this , Seo Sanghyeon came up with another set of patches which address some of the issues I mention here .
Pretty amazing work .
I 've spent a bit of my personal time investigating IronPython .
I am using ASP.NET for many of my development tasks , and I feel in love with the idea of IronPython after watching Jon Udell 's screencast with Jim Hugunin , the lead developer on IronPython .
There is no doubt that Jim is a super smart guy that understands how dynamic language should behave on a VM .
In my opinion , the biggest value add of IronPython is the ability to easily integrate .NET with existing Python libraries .
Unfortunately , while the language itself seems very complete , there are many incompatibilities with the standard Python libraries .
I started with a simple objective of implementing OpenID consumer authentication using the JanRain OpenID python libraries .
I have n't been successful .
IronPython does n't ship with a .NET to WSGI implementation .
Fortunately community members had already started working on the problem .
With a little bit of massaging , we got an implementation I felt could work pretty well .
But I kept hitting problem after problem .
sys._getframe is n't implemented .
The default error handlers are n't registered by the _codecs module
os . makedir raises the wrong type when a directory already exists .
I can live with this .
It is low level functionality that most developers should n't concern themselves with , but it prevented web.py from working .
I developed this patch to address the problem , but this should be part of the IronPython distribution .
I documented my problem .
This
caused the OpenID library to fail when creating file associations .
Socket ._fileobject not implemented
re .Match.lastgroup is n't implemented
re module does n't work
I could live with this one .
This is supposed to be a non-public interface .
Unfortunately , urllib2 uses it , which I think is fishy , but it is part of the standard library , and it does n't work with IronPython .
I patched the FePy socket class which already patches the IronPython socket class to add _fileobject .
This one boggles my mind .
Microsoft implemented an re module for IronPython which is supposed to be compatible with CPython using the .NET framework System .
Text .
RegularExpressions library .
Compatibility bugs are inevitable , but ignoring publicly documented interfaces , that 's a job half done .
I 'm not a Python regular expression expert by any means .
I find regex 's hard to maintain .
But A LOT of code depends on a sane re library implementation .
I do n't claim to understand the incompatibilities between CPython 's re support and IronPython's , but when the the same string is matched with the same expression in CPython and IronPython , the results can differ .
That 's a recipe for code that will fail in subtle , very difficult to diagnose , ways .
The batteries included with IronPython are like the non-alkaline AAA 's that cost $ 0.10 and wear out ten minutes after you put them in your mp3 player .
I am a little disappointed .
I bought into the vision of seamlessly transitioning between Python and .NET , both on Microsoft 's CLR and Mono .
With a 1.0 version from what is still the largest and most powerful software company in the world , I frankly expected more .
I certainly did n't expect to become a volunteer member of Microsoft 's QA team .
If Microsoft is serious about IronPython , they need to put out at least two reqs .
One should be titled : IronPython compatibility PM .
This role should be solely responsible for making sure IronPython is compatible with CPython , and clearly documenting when it is not .
The second should be titled : IronPython community liaison .
This person should be the Ben Collins - Sussman of IronPython .
There are too many questions and patches with no response on the mailing list .
I should also note , that unlike most OpenSource projects , Microsoft is not accepting patches to the IronPython core .
IMHO that screams fork .
If your dream is to build the world 's greatest car – not just a science project or a concept car , but a real - world , 100 - mile - per - gallon vehicle that 's safe , can be mass - produced , and emits almost no pollutants – there 's a big , fat prize waiting for you .
It 's expected to be at least $ 10 million , maybe much more .
But here 's the rub :
If the first X Prize put a man in space on a shoestring budget , the 2009 Automotive X Prize by comparison looks timid to some .
Why aim for just 100 miles per gallon or its energy equivalent ?
What about a vehicle that gets double that ?
What about a vehicle that burns no carbon - based fuel at all ?
Such are the criticisms already being leveled at the Automotive X Prize " draft guidelines , " to be formally unveiled this week at the New York International Auto Show .
Most questions are being raised not by skeptics but by the contemporary soul mates of the Wright brothers and Henry Ford , true believers who would love to enter the " great race . "
More than 1,000 people have already contacted X Prize organizers , including some auto companies .
A number of concerns over the draft guidelines , which are open for public comment until May 31 , are already being voiced by these Henry Ford wannabes .
" Why stop at 100 m.p.g. ? " asks Robyn Allen , student codirector of the Vehicle Design Summit at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Last summer she and colleagues were designing and building vehicles aiming for a 200 m.p.g. equivalent .
" Given the magnitude of the climate - change problem , should n't we match that with commensurate effort ? "
But will her MIT - led team enter the race ?
" Absolutely , we will , " she says without a moment 's hesitation .
The competition requires that a car attain 100 m.p.g. of gasoline fuel economy ( or its energy equivalent ) and meet tough emissions standards .
The winner must also get the fastest time in two long - distance races to be held in 2009 .
There will be two categories of vehicles : traditional four - seat vehicles with four wheels and two - passenger vehicles with no requirement for the number of wheels .
The criteria leave some would - be contestants worrying that the X Prize does n't go far enough to unhook auto travel from oil dependence – and wo n't do enough to alleviate global warming .
" The way the current rules are written , solar - and wind - powered vehicles would be judged poorly , since it would not be given credit for having derived energy from the sun , " says Andrew Frank , a professor of engineering at the University of California at Davis , whose student teams have built high - mileage vehicles for years .
To him , the prize should be about dropping carbon - based fuels altogether to help squelch global warming .
Because competing vehicles must pass safety tests , too , big automakers with deep pockets have an advantage , he says .
He 's worried about liability questions , as well .
But does he want to enter ?
" Of course , we would like to , " he says in a phone interview .
" But a lot of questions still have to be answered before we commit . "
Organizers of the Automotive X Prize respond that they 've spent more than a year getting feedback from dozens of scientists and automotive experts .
That has led them to set goals that balance what is achievable , what will make a difference to humanity , and what will create a playing field where small teams and big auto companies can compete on the same level .
" What we 've presented is a nice round number [ 100 m.p.g. ] that 's going to be very difficult for all to achieve but which is clearly in the realm of the possible , " says Mark Goodstein , executive director of the Automotive X Prize .
" It 's the right number to encourage simultaneously hitting efficiency targets and still achieve market viability . "
Automotive technology has progressed rapidly in recent decades , even though mileage has stayed flat .
That 's because most technical advances in engines have gone to improve performance rather than fuel economy , experts say .
Now there may be a chance to change that dynamic .
" These kinds of prize competitions are very good at gathering public attention , the attention of the technical community , and can become a very good motivator for progress , " says Patrick Windham , a principal at Technology Policy International , based in Newton Center , Mass .
Polls show that the public wants it all : a vehicle with good performance , far better mileage , less pollution – yet that is comfortable , safe , and affordable .
It 's really that last part – affordable – that may be the key to winning .
Each team must present a business plan that shows 10,000 vehicles can be built at a reasonable cost per vehicle .
That last requirement – market viability – may be the toughest test , experts say .
" The biggest challenge of all in this competition will be to meet these performance objectives at a reasonable cost , " says John Heywood , director of MIT 's Sloan Automotive Laboratory .
" The goals they 've set will be hard , technically very challenging , but they can be achieved .
Then the real - world cost factors come in - and keeping the cost of the vehicle down will likely be the toughest challenge of all . "
The X Prize people think their competition comes at a propitious moment in human history .
" We are at a pivotal moment in time when promising new technologies , growing consumer demand , and global politics make it ripe for a radical breakthrough in the cars we drive , " said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis , founder of the X PRIZE Foundation , in a statement .
" We have made great progress in designing a competition that will capture the public 's imagination to solve these problems . "
Today I was listening to Car Talk on NPR while driving , coincidentally , a car .
Those guys are always good for some laughs , and sometimes I even learn something new about automobiles .
Today was one of those days .
Tom and Ray Magliozzi ( aka the Tappet Brothers ) were in adamant agreement that most people should use regular gasoline , rather than premium , no matter what car they drive .
They stated that the difference in performance is negligible ( unless you ’re racing ) , regular gas costs less , and premium gas may contain higher levels of MTBE ( which can contaminate drinking water ) .
Hearing that made me go , “ Huh ? ” I had always been told that using a higher octane gasoline would help prevent knocking and keep your engine running cleaner .
So I decided to do some research .
Does your car need premium gas ?
The FTC says to go with what the owner ’s manual says , but that the usual octane recommendation is met by regular gas .
However , Edmunds.com explains that for about the last fifteen years , on - board computers have been able to regulate knocking even at lower octane levels than are recommended by the manufacturer .
And regular gas appears to run just as cleanly as premium .
Both state that if your engine begins to knock , you should increase your octane level — but otherwise , go for regular .
What ’s the fuss over MTBE ?
MTBE is added to gasoline to raise its octane level and to oxygenate it .
Oxygenation helps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions of pollutants , so the EPA encouraged the use of MTBE — until they found out that it ’s also a carcinogen that mixes easily with ground water , and it often leaks from storage tanks .
Not all gasoline contains MTBE — some US states have already banned its use , and manufacturers are beginning to phase it out in preference for the more expensive ( but not carcinogenic ) ethanol .
But if you live in an area that does allow MTBE , premium gas is likely to contain more of it , in order to raise the octane level .
The money
In the US now , the price of premium gasoline can be as much as 30 cents a gallon more than regular .
That means that you could save three or four bucks on your average fill - up by switching to regular gas .
If you fill up once a week , you could save $ 150 – $ 200 a year .
Fitting topic for [ GAS ] , do n’t you think ?
Given the information above , I ’m ready to switch to regular — at least until someone comes a - knocking under the hood .
How about you ?
Some analysts are nostalgic for the days when they could appear intelligent merely by gushing about everything from Microsoft .
They felt safe in recommending everything the company released , knowing that there were no real alternatives , and that anything the company could deliver would more or less have to be purchased .
All their advice and analysis helped to create the general illusion that Microsoft was divinely fated to succeed , and that no rival could ever hope to challenge the company .
That illusion helped to reinforce the real power wielded by Microsoft as the dominant vendor of PC desktop operating systems .
Maintaining that illusion was as important to Microsoft as a properly running propaganda machine is to a banana republic dictator .
As power begins to falter , maintaining an illusion of strength becomes increasingly important .
Ironically , the desperate measures that are frequently taken to sustain such an illusion often serve to distract from the real problems that need to be fixed and subsequently cause greater damage .
The Ghost of Past Failures
Microsoft certainly is n't the first tech company to stumble in a grand way .
Apple fell from its position as a leader in the tech industry in the 80s to being " hopelessly beleaguered " within a decade .
In Apple 's case , the company began making serious mistakes during a decade of limited competition leading up to 1995 .
Once a real competitor appeared , Apple was not only also woefully unprepared for the challenge , but also stumbling in the delivery of its own plans .
Had Windows 95 never arrived , Apple would still have had plenty to worry about ; its future plans were uncertain , its product strategies were unfocused , and its System 7 software had grown obsolete .
Apple had originally launched onto the scene as a new startup in the late 70s , and earned huge profits from selling the Apple II line .
After reinvesting those profits into developing the Macintosh , the Apple of 1985 was situated with the still very profitable Apple II business , and the prospect of developing a huge new market with the then groundbreaking Mac .
How could it all slip away within ten years ?
High Prices , Low Product Innovation
Instead of working to develop and popularize the Mac as a consumer product with broad appeal , Apple 's CEO John Sculley artificially raised its price by $ 500 , pushing it out of the range that many could easily afford .
The original Mac was already a relatively expensive product , because it required more RAM and other specialized hardware in order to deliver its entirely graphical environment .
However , Sculley also packed the expense of a huge advertising campaign into the new Mac 's price , bumping it from $ 1995 to $ 2495 .
Between 1985 - 1990 , Apple continued to release Mac models priced significantly higher than most consumers could afford , and positioned the company 's Apple II computers as its entry level machines .
Apple continued to sell the Apple IIGS , which was not compatible with the Mac , up to the end of 1992 .
Jean Louise Gassée , Sculley 's replacement for Steve Jobs , ran the Mac platform into the ground by insisting on high price points for new models , following the logic that Apple needed to get the most money it could out of the Mac ’s technology .
His refusal to license the Mac interface , along with a demand to keep prices high on existing products without really pushing the state of the art , resulted in Macs being relegated to high end , professional niches .
By Gassée 's departure in 1990 , Apple 's only affordable Mac was a recycled version of a five year old machine .
Imagine Apple trying to resell the 2002 PowerBook G4 and Quicksilver Power Mac G4 as its low end laptop and desktop models today .
Many Apples , One Microsoft
The expensive , exclusive character of Apple under Sculley - Gassée , followed by rudderless drifting under CEO Michael Spindler , resulted in a company that was in fantastically bad shape by the time CEO Gil Amelio was handed the reigns .
Amelio had turned around failures before , but Apple really needed more than a hatchet man to layoff a bunch of employees and cash out afterward with a huge paycheck .
Apple needed a consistent direction and a pilot interested in getting there .
When Steve Jobs took over as CEO , Apple gained that sense of purposeful direction .
Jobs cut everything that did n't point in the direction the company needed to go .
Apple could no longer afford to spend huge fortunes running futuristic experiments in raw technologies that were not product related .
After a long , product - focused recovery between 1997 - 2002 , Apple was once again in a position to start doing interesting things .
The speed of development and new product introductions since then has exceeded anything in the company 's past .
In fact , it ’s difficult to identify any tech company that has been consistently able to debut as many successful new products as Apple has since 2002 .
Many Apples , One Microsoft
In the decade between 1986 - 1996 , Apple had three very different CEOs that presided over its descent into failure ; each could at least partially blame the former for portions of the company 's mounting problems .
In contrast , there has been one CEO of Microsoft since 1984 : Steve Ballmer .
Along with Chairman Bill Gates , Ballmer has always set the course for the company , giving Microsoft a singular personality in contrast to the turbulent changes during Apple 's middle decade .
That means Ballmer really has nobody to blame for the problems Microsoft is now experiencing .
Some of those problems are very much like Sculley 's Apple under the direction of Gassée : a reliance on high prices and low product innovation to stretch the company 's existing , threadbare assets while arrogantly ignoring the competition .
Competition Makes Companies Stronger
Just like Apple in 1990 , Microsoft appeared untouchable in 2000 .
In reality however , both companies had really been softened by the lack of strong competition , and were so intoxicated by the praise of market analysts that they ignored brewing threats that were soon to develop into formidable rivals .
In 1990 , Apple 's competitors -- including Atari , Amiga , and NeXT -- were delivering specialized hardware DSPs and advanced operating system features well in advance of the Mac , but Apple felt secure than none of these companies could provide any significant competition .
Apple also did n't count on Microsoft offering much of a threat , since the company 's Windows product had been an embarrassing joke until 1990 , and was still laughably behind .
Apple was n't prepared for Microsoft 's Windows 95 , followed by its four paid updates that were released over the next five years .
That lack of preparedness , exacerbated by poor governance , lead to major troubles for Apple within just a few years .
The analysts that had previously celebrated the company were quick to turn on it , and discount every effort the company made to recover .
Increasingly , analysts compared Apple to Microsoft - - a very different company with an entirely different business plan .
The Turning of Tables
In 2000 , Microsoft Windows was still a poor product , but it had replaced DOS on hundreds of millions of PCs , and was strong competition to the ten year old operating system that Apple was still trying to sell .
When Windows 2000 shipped , Apple 's efforts to sell Mac OS 9 and its delayed attempts to deliver Mac OS X similarly appeared laughably behind the times .
It was Microsoft that was n't ready when Mac OS X Jaguar was delivered in 2002 ; it offered many of the key features intended for Microsoft 's Longhorn , expected in 2003 .
Apple then rapidly delivered Panther in 2003 , Tiger in 2005 , and then moved Tiger to Intel in 2006 .
Meanwhile , Longhorn had n't gone anywhere but back to the drawing board .
Now that Windows Vista has finally shipped , critics are panning it as being an overpriced , unnecessary upgrade .
Customers who have been waiting for Vista to ship have taken the opportunity to investigate the Mac , which not only offers a better product now than Vista , but also promises a further leap beyond Vista later this year with the release of Mac OS X Leopard .
This All Happened Before
Ballmer 's incredulous confusion as to why Vista upgrades are not taking off sounds eerily similar to how Apple 's executives refused to acknowledge the threat of Windows 95 as Mac sales slowed .
Ballmer has repeatedly dismissed Apple as a competitor , recently stating , “ Remember , when you 're the little tiny niche guy who owns about 2 percent of the worldwide market , you can be cute one time and it helps you grow . ”
That was his brilliant response when asked by BusinessWeek about Apple ’s high profile ad campaign calling attention to the security and reliability problems in Windows in comparison to the Mac .
Back in the mid 90s , it was Ballmer ’s Windows 95 getting all the attention , while Apple ’s Copland and Taligent projects fell apart .
Apple revealed that it really had no alternative plans and started looking .
After finally delivering the disappointing Vista - - which is regularly compared to Apple ’s two year old Mac OS X Tiger -- Microsoft has yet to admit any mistep .
Instead , it talks about nebulous plans for the next version of Windows , which might be delivered in a few years .
Microsoft avoids direct comparisons with Apple and pretends there is no competition it needs to answer .
A Painful Vistula
Many of the pillars promised for Longhorn were stripped from Vista in order to have something to ship four years after it was originally promised .
Even so , reviewers have described Vista as “ beta quality ” and recommend waiting on Vista until Microsoft ships its first service pack .
Many companies have put off buying Vista entirely .
The US Federal Department of Transportation has put an indefinite moratorium on purchases of both Windows Vista and Office 2007 , stating in a memo :
" ... there appears to be no compelling technical or business case for upgrading to these new Microsoft software products .
Furthermore , there appears to be specific reasons not to upgrade . "
As PC sales continue through the year , Microsoft will be able to claim that an increasing number of users are " buying Vista , " which ships with new PCs .
However , many businesses are buying new PCs and installing their own software images , commonly Windows 2000 .
Some have only recently moved to the six year old Windows XP .
When Apple reports additional sales of Macs , it actually means more active users of the latest Mac OS X .
How the Battle for the Desktop is Changing
The real battle for the desktop is n't between Mac OS X and Vista , but rather between Apple 's Mac and the Windows - based products offered by PC hardware makers .
Apple is competing against Microsoft 's offerings , but it 's not a retail software battle .
Apple is using its integrated software to eat up the prime portions of the PC hardware market .
As PC makers fight to offer the cheapest boxes online and in big box retail stores , Apple is expanding its share of the market by building its own , smaller retail stores where users get a better buying experience and better support .
Apple is also targeting products to what consumers want , not just producing what is easy to build .
A Better Product Mix
Windows enthusiasts like to recount Apple 's long static 2 % share of the worldwide market for all computer systems .
However , Apple is no Dell or HP .
Apple sells systems targeted at profitable portions of the PC market :
• higher end Mac Pro workstations and Mac Book Pro laptops for creative professionals • complete , simple iMac , MacBook and Mac mini systems for consumers • entry and mid level workgroup servers and RAID units
Conspicuously missing from that lineup is anything like the volume loss leader PCs sold by HP , Dell , and no -name PC makers : the $ 600 systems that are stripped down to include just the core components needed to run Windows .
Those boxes offer scant profits , so they come with minimal support and are packed with adware and vendor junk that attempts to sign up users for additional security , anti-virus , and other services .
There is little interesting innovation going into cheap PCs , and the result is a product that is destined to disappoint .
That helps to explain why the desktop segment of the PC market is sagging .
The Death of the PC
Consumers are increasingly interested in laptops , where differences in quality are more obvious .
" In the U.S. market , the focus continues to be on the transition from desktops to notebooks , with notebook growth being the sole bright spot while desktop shipments continued to decline . ” - Bob O’Donnell , IDC , Oct 2006 .
It 's easier to see the vast difference an extra $ 400 makes for a new laptop purchase than with a basic PC that might end up shoved under a desk .
That 's why Mac Books are eating into rival laptop sales and the already stagnating market for basic PCs .
Consumers are willing to pay more for better laptop hardware because of its perceived value and potential for resale .
Vista is non-returnable , non-transferable , and has zero resale value .
It should be no surprise that there is little consumer demand for paying hundreds of dollars for such a software upgrade .
That ’s forcing Microsoft to push more activation restrictions in Windows Vista , killing the same pirate market that has helped prop up the Windows monopoly .
While Microsoft struggles to force its user base to pay for a half - baked upgrade , Apple is finding lots of new customers willing to pay for premium hardware .
The Cream of the Market
Microsoft makes no premium from sales of higher quality PC hardware ; it supports HP and Dell in their crusade to profit from selling more units of e-waste more often .
Overall market share numbers capture the vast scale of PC disposability , but do not reflect the product profitability that comes from building a better quality product .
While Apple is cited by Gartner and IDC as selling around 5 % of all the computers in the US , it is n't obvious that Apple 's 5 % share is the cream of the market ; it ’s actually worth more than the same or larger percentage shares held by rivals .
There were 9.8 million Macs sold in the last two years , up from 6.2 million in the previous two year period .
Those numbers do n't compare with the stunning volume of PCs shipped by HP and Dell - - which each sold 38 million PCs in 2006 alone -- but Apple 's profits do .
In the forth quarter of last year , HP and Dell combined sold 10 times as many PCs as Apple in the US , earned 5.5 times as much revenue as Apple , but together only ended up with 2.2 times as much net income as Apple .
In other words , Apple earned nearly half as much net income with its 5 % share the market as HP and Dell together , with their combined 55 % share of the US PC market : $ 1 billion for Apple vs $ 2.2 billion for HP and Dell together !
Adding in third place PC maker Gateway makes things look even better for Apple , because Gateway actually lost money all year , despite shipping more PCs than Apple and capturing a larger percentage of market share .
A large chunk of Apple 's profitability comes from the iPod and other consumer electronics .
Those sales are increasingly directing consumers to the Mac , and will help float the company through downturns in PC sales .
Consumer electronics is also a market segment that Apple ’s PC competitors beholden to Microsoft can't enter .
Dell struck out with its PlaysForSure DJ music players , and HP has similarly stumbled in trying to sell PDAs running Microsoft 's WinCE based Pocket PC .
Being independent from Microsoft actually helps
Apple tremendously ; the rest of the industry ’s reliance on Microsoft hamstrings them from effectively competing with Apple .
Fewer Windows = Better View
Microsoft has never cared about which vendors were selling PCs , because all of them had to buy Windows licenses .
However , as Apple takes away PC sales , an increasing smaller number of Windows licenses are sold .
Since Macs have a longer usable life span , every new Mac sold means a smaller future demand for cheap replacement PCs running Windows .
More Macs sold to consumers also means less demand for Microsoft - only solutions in general , such as websites that only work correctly in the Internet Explorer web browser .
Banks , retailers , and other businesses with IE - only web sites not only lose access to 5 % of their users , but 5 % of their best customers .
The End of a Monopoly
Combined with the dominance of the iPod over devices using Microsoft 's PlaysForSure , the imminent goring of Windows Mobile by the iPhone , and the shift of support across the industry from Windows to Linux in servers , the days of Microsoft 's monopolistic grip on the desktop are winding down .
Apple does n't have to take a majority share of the desktop market to win , it only needs to take the most valuable segments of the market .
Once that happens , Microsoft will be forced to choose whether it wants to battle Mac OS X for control of the slick consumer desktop , or repurpose Windows as a cheaper , mass market alternative to Linux in corporate sales .
If it does n’t make a choice , the company will face difficult battles on two fronts .
Microsoft has n't needed to compete for years , because had been able to use its monopoly position to prevent competition .
Those days are now over .
Microsoft is not exactly in great shape to be competing against smarter , nimbler , and less expensive rivals .
Is Apple big enough ?
One remaining bit of illusion is that Apple simply can't compare to the heavyweights that control the industry because of its " small market share . "
A comparison of Apple 's market capitalization -- the value of the company assigned by investors in the market -- helps to explain why Apple can't be ignored .

Soak that in a second .
So I 've got it in my head that as soon as the eve of my 30th birthday passed , I no longer wanted sex .
You know .
I was old .
Besides , without a reliable source of sexual activity , there was no true way to know for sure , just this thought in my head that once I turned 30 , I 'm supposed to drive slower , worried about finances more , and spend less time thinking about sex .
As such , I went from an every - morning habit , to say , every otherish .
You know , the motor needs less maintenance now .
I 'm 30 .
Enter new girl .
She 's this cute little thing that makes me laugh a lot .
She 's also got this completely slammin ' body that well , that 's none of you damned business .
Anyway , because I 'm 30 , I now feel that with my self - imposed - decreased sex drive , it 's time to uh , save it up .
NO PROBLEM !
I 'll see her 3 times a week or so , for the next 6 - 8 months we 'll be in that " sexual bliss " stage of the relationship where we basically preface and footnote every event with a good shag , so well , no need for routine maintenance .
After that , we 'll get into an argument about nose hair trimmings or used tampons or something , and we 'll finally realize we 're into a relationship ; thus it 'll be more important that I hang out with her friends at a poetry slam about Enchiladas than curl her toes EVERY night , so I 'll be able to fill some gaps in here and there .
Problem being ?
My over - thinking - neurotic - brain has n't taken into account that we 're both busy people , our schedules do n't always line up , and I 've now gone 6 days without sex .
Day 1 : It 's not so bad today .
I realize that it 's more of a force of habit , much like a smoker with nothing to do .
After deleting and throwing all forms of pornography ( mostly a non-binding resolution that ... it's not hard to get back with a few clicks and some simple math ; I 've been doing this computer security stuff for years , I 'm an EXPERT at undeleting shit ) , I turn on PBS , and grab a book .
Day 2 : It 's now becoming a bit of a pain to actually think about .
I have to REMIND MYSELF not to .
I turned on PBS again , but it was a documentary on the Washington Monument .
Instead I read engineering manuals , and walked the dog a lot .
Day 3 : I 'm now on the longest self - dry - spell since the great broken wrist of ' 92 .
That went 3 days , and ended when I finally learned one absolute fact :
When under dire stress , the human being can suddenly become ambidextrous .
Baggy pants are no match for a stiff breeze .
Day 4 : Miss perfect is out having drinks with friends .
I tried to see if she 'd need a ride home .
She told me she had a ride .
While I 'm willing to post an anonymous CL post to the fact , we 're not quite to the point where I can simply tell her it's a manipulative ploy to fuck her senseless .
I think the dog knows what I 'm going through , as he 's nowhere in sight .
I put on a shirt I wore this last weekend and it smelled just like her perfume .
That shirt is now charcoal .
Day 5 : I 'm about to crack .
I 'd quit this nonsense now and do the quickest data restore in modern history , but I 'm seeing her TOMORROW .
I have no idea how long it takes to reload the ole ' wheel gun .
The last thing I can do at this point is fizzle in the sack .
Luckily , I 'm on shift at the station tonight , so I 'll be completely without privacy .
Dog sent a note , something about a dangerous living situation ; he sent me a link to a mormon website and told me he'd come home if I 'd convert : http://www.nowscape.com/mormon/mormast2.htm
I tried # 11 , but the owner / operator of the fishing tackle store kicked me out when I told him what they were for and voiced concerns about a nightcrawler 's general toxicity .
Day 6 : I see her in 10 hours , 6 minutes , and 18 , 17 , no wait 16 seconds .
I came into the office instead of working from home .
I sit next to the HR department , where they 're talking about who 's been screwing who .
I hate them .
I miss the dog .
I miss PBS .
I miss my 20's .
Somebody help me .
Security checks are carried out in Baghdad after the abduction
Jalal Sharafi , the embassy 's second secretary , was abducted from his car on Sunday in central Karrada district by men wearing Iraqi army uniforms .
Iran condemned the kidnapping and said it held the US responsible for his life .
A US military spokesman said no US or Iraqi troops had been involved .
The news comes amid US - Iranian tension over Iranian activities in Iraq .
Last month in a dramatic pre-dawn helicopter raid , the Americans detained five Iranians in northern Iraq , prompting Iran to issue a formal protest to the US .
The US has denied any involvement in the latest incident , but recently has been expressing increasing concern about alleged Iranian support for militant activity in Iraq .
Correspondents say the stand - off over Iran 's nuclear programme is adding to the tension .
On Tuesday , UK Prime Minister Tony Blair accused Iran of " a strategy to create maximum trouble " in the Middle East .
Identification puzzle
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told the Isna news agency that Mr Sharafi had been kidnapped by a group linked to Iraq 's defence ministry " which works under the supervision of American forces " .
We 've checked with our units and it was not a [ multinational forces - Iraq ] unit that participated in that event
Lt Col Christopher Garver ,
US military spokesman
" The Islamic Republic of Iran holds the American forces in Iraq responsible for the life and safety of the Iranian diplomat , " he said .
Iraqi officials earlier said the gunmen were wearing uniforms of the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion - a special Iraqi unit under US direction .
US military spokesman in Baghdad , Lt Col Christopher Garver , could not confirm the diplomat 's abduction .
However , he said : " We 've checked with our units and it was not a [ multinational forces - Iraq ] unit that participated in that event . "
Mr Sharafi was reportedly kidnapped outside the Baghdad branch of the Iranian state - owned Bank Melli .
But the details of the abduction are still confused .
Kidnapping ' common '
An Iraqi government official told Associated Press news agency there had been a gun battle and a chase after the kidnapping but the car carrying the diplomat escaped .
RISING US - IRAN TENSION Dec 2006 : US forces detain several Iranians in Iraq suspected of planning attacks .
Iran says two are diplomats , who are later freed 10 Jan : US President Bush says in a major speech he will take a tough stance on Iran , whom he accuses of destabilising Iraq 11 Jan : US troops in Irbil raid a building Iran says was consulate , arresting five men 18 Jan : Iran demands the release of the five " diplomats " .
The US says they are Revolutionary Guard arming Shia fighters
Blair : No Iran attack planned
Some men were captured but the New York Times quoted Iraqi officials as saying they had legitimate defence ministry identification .
An official told the paper the men may have kept the identification after being dismissed .
It is not thought they are still being held .
The BBC's Mike Wooldridge , in Baghdad , says the fact that the kidnappers were wearing uniforms can mean anything in Baghdad .
Kidnapping is common - often criminal rather than political - and frequently carried out by people in some kind of official uniform , he says .
But against the background of the ongoing disagreements between the US and Iran , this is quickly becoming another source of diplomatic tension , our correspondent adds .
Speaking to a committee of MPs in London , Prime Minister Tony Blair accused Iran of " a strategy to create maximum trouble " in the Middle East .
Mr Blair said Tehran was trying to prevent reconciliation in Iraq .
" People are alarmed at the strategy they are pursuing , " he said .
This piece follows up a request from the World Economic Forum for thoughts about the Digital Ecosystem , in preparation for framing the 2007 agenda at Davos .
I would really appreciate any comments that would expand , improve , or correct these lines of thought .
10 . Images are king .
Verbal content , by virtue of its sheer volume , is increasingly perceived as noise .
We are entering a new era of collage , where the mind of the viewer is the assembling artist .
Verbalization happens post facto , the residue of headline skimming and subconscious synthesis .
The esthetics of digitally enhanced images will become increasingly powerful as a vehicle for cutting through the clutter .
Manipulating semantics or semiotics via images will become increasingly sophisticated , both in the private and public sectors .
High - definition displays and portable form factors will be popular mass markets .
Indexing and searching images , on the other hand , while technologically interesting , will be of peripheral impact .
9 . Songs are the spiritual property of the young .
They construct their identities around them and feel they own the rights to them in a way that no economic contract could interpret .
Sharing songs and sets of songs is a type of free speech .
By contrast , films have nowhere near this visceral appeal and matter much less .
Operating on songs is the paradigm for the new creative consumer who will not create content so much as modify it and send it along .
Tools and sites that let people extract , reframe , and re-present will be core enablers , a la MySpace , UTube , and the like .
8 . There is no place to hide .
This is good for exposing the horrors of man ’s inhumanity to man .
It is bad for the privacy advocates .
It is meaningless for the security forces as no command - and - control big brother can keep up with the sheer volume of self - organizing chaotic systems in flux .
Next - generation security will organize around the person and the personal identity instead of the data and the institution .
Mobility will only complicate this challenge .
7. Wikis rule and “ crowd - sourcing ” works !
Outsourcing tasks to a self - organizing community of volunteers , a la open source software , is proving to be a powerful tactic for tapping into the collective wisdom and experience of the planet .
Surprisingly , this mechanism is nowhere near as susceptible to demagoguery as edited media .
The wiki model is becoming a de facto collaboration paradigm within private enterprises with global reach .
It seems likely to spawn comparable efforts in the public sector : a wiki-versity , a wike - health - care - system , a wiki - disaster - recovery - effort .
We will get object lessons in the power of memes ( or the lack thereof ) .
6. Games tell all .
Anthropologists of future centuries can be spared digging through layers of sedimentary rock .
Instead they will just need to find game machines that let them play World of Warcraft or play back the history of an avatar in Second Life .
All the metaphors of contemporary culture are being acted out in one or another corner of this virtual universe .
And currency exchanges are beginning to link this universe to the physical one .
The emphasis on symbolic interactions in a digital lifestyle will have unpredictable effects on self - perception and social norms .
Historically the real world has set the norms and the digital world reflected them , but the obverse can be expected to be true going forward .
Games can become living laboratories to explore strategies for living , a role played by literature and drama in ages past .
5. Services displace products .
In the digital world , as bits substitute for atoms , products are reconceived as services .
This is the threat that Google poses against Microsoft .
Services companies still have not completely caught up with this .
They tend to describe their offers as products , which , although convenient as a means for integrating them into traditional organizational thinking , profoundly misrepresents their dynamics and causes companies to miss whole dimensions of consumer experience , need and value .
4. Everything is media .
While advertising will not pay for everything , everything will become a potential opportunity to advertise .
This means that at least some technology adoption life cycles can be short - circuited by providing the disruptive innovation for free .
If advertising is the default funder of digital offers , then consumption is the ultimate paradigm .
Over time people and cultures will weary of this , and socially constructed content will become more pervasive as an escape from constantly being pitched .
3. Outsourcing and offshoring are inevitable .
Digitization of work is profoundly world - flattening .
In an Internet - enabled world , as work itself becomes digitized , markets cannot be protected .
This will be hugely dislocating to the developed economies in the short term .
Longer term , it will be the single most effective tool to combat global poverty and its cousin terrorism .
Instrumentation and institutions that create visibility and control over processes that span geographical and enterprise boundaries will become increasingly powerful .
Everything will ultimately resolve to a Service Level Agreement and a series of compliance - assuring mechanisms .
2. Symbolic competence creates competitive advantage .
On the web , as one cartoonist famously noted , no one knows you are a dog .
All they experience about you is a function of your ability to manipulate vocabulary and symbols .
This puts liberal arts education in high relief .
The digital world will move from being an engineering phenomenon to a cultural one .
Memes , brands , reputations , causes — all will seek to recruit the most powerful symbolists to their ends .
1. Omnipresent distractions increase the need for inner peace .
Digital systems intrude into every aspect of life and , unrestricted and unbalanced , can overwhelm our perception of personal and social values .
The resulting alienation will lead to a search for direct personal spiritual experience .
Traditional religion , with its reliance on belief , will be undermined by digital communications , for as symbolic manipulations becomes increasingly transparent , it creates distrust in any institution that engages in it .
In this context , meditation , yoga , and other forms on non-mediated spiritual experience will become increasingly attractive .
JUNE 28 -- A
Tennessee mayor spewed racial slurs , attempted to set up foes for arrest , and tried to boost his town 's traffic ticket revenue by specifically profiling soldiers and Hispanics , according to a lawsuit seeking the politician 's ouster from office .
In a complaint filed yesterday in Robertson County Chancery Court , the State of Tennessee portrays Coopertown Mayor Danny Crosby as a boorish nutcase who has soiled the reputation of the 3176 - resident city , which is located about 25 miles north of Nashville .
The state lawsuit , an excerpt of which you 'll find here , includes an array of shocking charges , including the claim that , after swearing in a new police officer on Martin Luther King , Jr. Day , the mayor congratulated the cop by saying , " Happy James Earl Ray Day . "
Crosby , pictured at left , also allegedly sought to boost his city 's revenue by setting up speed traps and directing police to " engage in profiling soldiers of the United States Armed Services " since he believed that enlisted persons " would tend to mail in their fines rather to come to Court to contest the Citations . "
Crosby also thought Hispanics , who were " mostly illegal anyway , " would also avoid court , the complaint charges .
As such , Crosby encouraged giving multiple citations to Hispanics , remarking , " We can give them all the tickets we want . "
Crosby was elected mayor in November 2004 .

Well I did n't expect to jump right into a vigorous discussion about language , but I 'll give it a stab .
I came across the following article Why Ruby is an acceptable Lisp .
As expected the Lisp guys jumped up and shouted " Ruby is NOT a Lisp " with their typical disdain for anything not Lisp .
Then followed the expected obscure examples of what Lisp can do and why the Ruby version is * obviously * inferior .
Do n't get me wrong , Lisp is by far my favorite language .
I am completely sold that technically Lisp is much better than any other language out there , including Ruby .
Despite Lisp 's technical superiority it remains a small community while other languages flourish and prosper as they pillage features out of Lisp .
What interests me are a couple of things :
1 - Why is a language like Ruby taking off while Lisp continues to languish in relative obscurity ?
2- What is the appropriate trade off between populariy and power ?
First , why is Ruby flourishing instead of Lisp ?
To answer that we have to look at what is fueling Ruby 's growth .
Ruby On Rails seems to be the primary motivator , Ruby was around for years before Rails was born but it remained a very small community until Rails came along .
It 's interesting to note then the primary catalyst for Ruby 's increase in popularity was a framework written in Ruby , and not the core syntax of Ruby itself .
What initially attracted me to Ruby was definitely Rails and it's promised increase in productivity .
Perhaps part of the problem Lisp has always had is that " you can do that in Lisp too " .
Many people can and do write similar frameworks to Rails in Lisp and other languages .
While Rails brought me to Ruby it was the power , expressiveness and general clean feel of the language that kept me , instead of defecting back to Python when TurboGears was released .
Further I did n't stumble on to Rails , it came roaring onto the scene .
I came across a bold , audacious claim that got posted to Slashdot .
David Heinemeier
Hansson made the in your face claim that you could improve your productivity by 10 times if you switched to Rails for your database development work .
It was n't just this one article either , Hansson was a wonderful and provacative evangalist for Rails and Curt Hibbs wrote several great introductory articles .
Most programmers were n't sitting around going " I am so sick of Java , I need to find a better way to do this .. maybe I 'll try Ruby " Rather when Rails was released Hansson practically hit them upside the head with the superiority of Rails .
Now I 'm not claiming most Lispers are n't touting the superiority of their language ( I 'd wager they have that part down pat ) , instead I 'm saying Lisp needs a better coordinated and more concerted marketing campaign and a product to sell to people beyond core language features .
Additionally Lispers would do well to offer a warm and welcoming environment to newcomers .
Now to the second question , what is the proper trade of between popularity and power ?
I 'm going to let you in on a little secret , when I first came to Ruby On Rails the framework was n't that great .
The idea behind it was fantastic , but the implementation was far from complete and it definitely lacked consistency .
Of course this is to be expected , it was a very early release and I did n't expect it to be a polished completed framework .
What it did have though was momentum .
To me this is the key issue .
When it comes to core language features you want to have the most powerful language you can get .
However when it comes to frameworks and libraries , popularity definitely matters .
It 's not so much that I mind writing certain features in Lisp , it 's that I do n't want to have to write those features at all .
For an entrepreneur trying to get a product out the door it seems like a mistake to start in a position where you have to implement a major framework in order to be able to compete effectively .
If you enjoy that type of thing , why the crap are n't you writing the full stack Lisp On Rails equivalent ?
Instead , Lisp has the same problem that Python did before Rails came out , it 's not the lack of frameworks , it 's the lack of a good integrated framework that is easy to setup and get running .
Something I have learned from books about positioning your product is that you can typically only occupy one place in the consumers mind .
You must occupy a niche if you will .
The best way to invade a fortified position is through a concentrated attack on a weak part , rather than a generalized attack at all points .
If you can do that you will be successful at driving adoption .
This advice seems to hold up to real world observation as well .
How does this apply to programming languages ?
Let 's see : Fortran : scientific and mathematical programmingC : Operating System programmingC++: Object Oriented CJava : Safer and more object oriented version of C++C# : cheap knockoff of Java ( sorry could n't resist ;) ) Visual Basic : A Beginners LanguageJavaScript : scripting language for the webPhp : dynamic web programming languageRuby : ( with Rails ) powerful database backended website languageLisp : AI ?
Scheme : Teaching languageOf course this list may not be fully accurate , and I could 've gone on much longer , but I think you get the point .
Those are the positions those languages seem to take in most people 's mind .
If Lispers want to drive adoption , they need to build good complete frameworks and I suspect they really need to address the issue of positioning in the mind of the consumer .
On the other hand , it 's also possible that many Lisp programmers enjoy the position of martyr for a tragically misunderstood language .

Londovir asks : " Recently , our school board made the decision to block Wikipedia from our school district 's WAN system .
This was a complete block — there are n't even provisions in place for teachers or administrators to input a password to bypass the restriction .
The reason given was that Wikipedia ( being user created and edited ) did not represent a credible or reliable source of information for schools .
Should we block sites such as Wikipedia because students may be exposed to misinformation , or should we encourage sites such as Wikipedia as an outlet for students to investigate and determine the validity of the information ? "

Paul Curtis aka Moose is no regular graffiti artist .
In fact , he 's the reverse - graffiti artist .
He created his street art by * cleaning * the dirt and grime off of surfaces !
Authorities are baffled : is selective cleaning a crime ?
The tools are simple : A shoe brush , water and elbow grease , he says .
British authorities are n't sure what to make of the artist who is creating graffiti by cleaning the grime of urban life .
The Leeds City Council has been considering what to do with Moose .
" I 'm waiting for the kind of Monty Python court case where exhibit A is a pot of cleaning fluid and exhibit B is a pair of my old socks , " he jokes .
http://symbollix.com/main.html | NPR Interview
As some of you know , I started a new job this month as a consultant helping clients to adopt Agile practices .
It 's been an interesting experience so far .
Working with people who have different philosophies and experiences is always a good opportunity to learn .
I 'm getting exposed to different techniques and being forced to examine the things that I believe .
In the end , we all want about the same things — to write quality software in an efficient manner without working too many weekends or late nights .
We all agree on the basic goals , but our philosophy in achieving these goals are different .
I know there 's been a few cases where the clients have cocked an eyebrow at some of my opinions , but in every case I 've simply had a different set of ideas for how to build software .
Mostly unrelated , but in the spirit of the infamous Agile Manifesto , I 'm writing down my own manifesto in an effort to explain the method to my madness .
Many of you are going to disagree with me , and that 's okay .
It 's my set of values after all , and I 'm happy to hear your comments .
Or better yet , go write your own manifesto .
Let 's get this out of the way , and please read this literally : while I do believe there is some value in the stuff on the right , I think the stuff on the left is more valuable and important .
Unit Testing and Testability over Defensive Coding , Tracing , Debugging , and Paranoid Scoping
I think we can all agree that you can't ship code until you remove enough defects from the code .
While you certainly have to apply a mix of techniques and practices to remove a high percentage of defects , I want to talk about the things we do to our code to wring out the defects .
Off the cuff , I can think of these :
Use a debugger to walk through the code to try to uncover the errors through observation
Use defensive coding to provide more contextual information about erroneous usage of a section of code
Tracing statements in the code to provide debugging information at runtime
What I can only call Paranoid Scoping .
Ratcheting up the protection on classes and members to prevent developers that use this code from " harming " themselves .
A very high degree of granular unit testing , like that afforded by adopting Test Driven Development .
I 'm talking near 100 % developer test coverage here .
An axiom of software development is that problems are cheaper to fix the sooner that the problems are detected .
If you take that axiom at face value , it 's easy to see why I put far more weight into comprehensive test - first unit testing because it gives you far more rapid feedback to find problems fast .
Small , isolated unit tests work on very granular pieces of the code , so the number of variables in any single unit test should be small ( if it 's not , look for a different way to write the code ) .
You should n't even try to run the code as a whole until all the constituent pieces have been validated through unit tests .
Debugging is not efficient , period .
It 's simply not smart to try to debug a lot of moving code parts together if you do n't have a high confidence level in any of the parts .
If anything goes wrong you 've potentially got a lot of variables to check out all at once .
Yes , you can help yourself out by providing tracing to see what data is passing through the code or defensive programming to short circuit processing when you hit a bad value or provide a more descriptive error message .
But no matter how hard you try to add tracing and defensive coding , I still think unit testing will get you to working code faster than any possible kind of debugging .
Last week one of the developers working on our server side component asked us , the GUI team , to make sure that we had plenty of tracing in our codebase so that integration issues could be adequately diagnosed .
I certainly do n't think that 's a bad idea , but I 'm far more keen on sinking energy into a rigorous set of automated unit tests on both the client in isolation and the server side in isolation before we even attempt to integrate the two pieces .
Since I am a believer in interaction style testing , we 'll test our code extensively to prove that our code passes the correct information to the backend through mock objects .
Do n't get me wrong here , I do believe in some amount of defensive coding and tracing , I just think that it 's not something you rely on as your primary means for removing defects from the code .
My issue with tracing and defensive coding is the often speculative nature of the activity and the negative impact on code readability .
I strongly prefer to use tracing and defensive coding " defensively . "
I 'll put in specific exception warning for things we hit in testing that are difficult to debug or around external dependencies .
If I had to choose though , I 'd rather have a good suite of environment tests to detect configuration or connectivity problems before I even try to execute the code .
In the end I might also say that I just think that you hit a point of diminishing returns with tracing and defensive coding rather quickly .
Oh , and by the way , every time I 've come across code that had copious amounts of tracing ?
The code was truly awful , failure prone code .
Excessive tracing is a code smell .
The paranoid scoping is probably the single biggest area of disagreement I 've hit with my client .
They have n't traditionally used TDD or any kind of comprehensive unit testing strategy in the past , so I do n't think they understand the negative impact on automated testing caused by this scoping .
Because they depend more on debugging and waterfall testing for removing defects , they 're big on using protected scoping on classes to prevent downstream developers from using objects incorrectly .
In several cases already , I 've seen that attitude hamper the testability of the code .
Granular unit testing is dependent on an ability to quickly setup the inputs for a little piece of the code and run that code in isolation .
In a specific case , the server side developers have quite purposely protected all of the setters of the entity classes in the system that should only be set by the server side code .
Reasonable right ?
Actually , I 'd argue that that strategy ends up doing a great deal of harm to us .
In the current architecture , the entity classes can only function with the complete server side connected .
If we can't change that design , it will dramatically slow down the feedback cycle of the user interface development because we can't unit test the presenters and views in isolation .
I 'm perfectly happy to make that code more " dangerous " in exchange for being able to write isolated tests more efficiently .
Besides , we are going to prove that we use the server side code correctly by testing the interaction with the backend as well .
In my world view , improving the testability of the code does far more good to remove defects than the reduced protection levels do bad by letting defects in .
Sharp Tools over Coding with the Kid Gloves On
Quoting Bruce Tate :
We need to let our craftsmen work with sharp tools , rather than protect them from themselves .
Recently , Paul Stovell took issue with a presentation from Scott Hanselman suggesting that you aggressively mark classes as internal or sealed to protect the users of your API or framework .
I 'm going to very strenuously agree with Paul on this one .
In the week after reading Scott Hanselman 's post I bumped into three different cases where the exact functionality in a framework that I needed to either use or override was sealed or internal .
In one case I resorted to reflection to manipulate a private member .
In another case I forked the open source framework and I really , really hate to do that .
The attitude of " seal everything " is just going to limit the usefulness of your code .
Make your framework or code easy to use by providing a good Facade and a bit of documentation ( i.e. tell me which class is the Facade ! ) , but leave the little underlying pieces accessible and available for usage and modification .
Remove all that sealed and internal " protection " and I can certainly break something , but I can do more positive things with your code as well .
I 'm perfectly willing to be responsible for my own solution .
To put " Sharp Tools " in perspective , let 's consider some of the languages I 've coded in throughout my career .
Assuming you used " Option Explicit " and pretend for a moment that the reference counting strategy was n't a huge memory leak , VB6 is the ultimate kiddie glove language .
It shelters developers from a wide range of coding issues by limiting the range of coding constructs .
You can't possibly deny that VB6 was very successful , but it is an extremely limited language in capability .
Limited Object Oriented Programming support and no real multi- threading severely constrained the usage of VB6 , especially in server applications ( though we certainly tried did n't we ? ) .
C# and .
Net came along with a lot more power and potential to royally screw things up .
I think it 's been a great trade .
I routinely build things in C# that were n't possible in VB6 ( windows services to name one ) and use OOP techniques that were n't supported by VB6 to great advantage .
I 'm happy with C# , or was , until I started seeing some of the capabilities of Ruby .
Ruby is a dynamically typed language that also supports metaprogramming , i.e. code that writes code on the fly .
Metaprogramming can be scary to debug , and there 's a tremendous opportunity to thoroughly confuse developers , but it 's soooo powerful .
A lot of the eye popping features of Ruby on Rails ( think ActiveRecord ) are clever utilizations of metaprogramming .
When we worked together , Jeffrey Palermo and I had a running Abbot and Costello routine about static languages ( C# ) versus dynamic languages ( Ruby ) .
In order , it went something like this :
I gush about something cool from Ruby or Ruby on Rails ( migrations , the built in testing support , metaprogramming tricks , etc. )
Jeffrey says " just wait until you inherit a really lousy Ruby codebase without any unit tests .
How are you going to support that without compiler checks ?
I freely admit that I would panic in that situation , but then I remind Jeffrey of the really lousy C# legacy code we 've dealt with that does n't have any unit tests and say that I do n't want to support code without unit tests in any language .
My point being that just like a sharp knife or power tools , " sharp tool " techniques are safe when combined with some proper precautions ( TDD ) .
Of course I 've got a little scar on my bicep from shooting myself with a pneumatic nail gun , so what do I know about safety ?
Several years ago , and long before it was AJAX and Web 2.0 , I used to do a lot of DHTML scripting in JavaScript that heavily utilized JavaScript 's " Expando " typing and a bit with " eval ( ) . "
It worked , but as I recall the debugging was nasty and it was n't really supportable .
This summer I was on big Ruby and Ruby on Rails kick .
As an experiment and a way to work in a familiar problem domain before I dived into Rails , I decided to go back to some of the JavaScript controls I wrote 4 + years ago and recreate them using Rubyesque coding techniques and Test Driven Development throughout .
Using JSUnit and Prototype , I wrote most of a TreeView control and a sortable , pageable grid .
Granted , I 've got much more experience this time around , but even so it went much , much faster .
I was able to shrink the code down considerably compared to the previous versions .
Since I was using TDD I really did n't have to use the debugger very often .
With duck - typing and expando members , mocks and stubs are almost trivial .
The very features that make dynamic languages " unsafe , " also lead to easier mechanics for TDD , which in my book is more valuable for " safety " anyway .
Writing Maintainable Code over Architecting for Reuse and the Future
A couple weeks ago one of the architects at my client asked us to make sure a piece of functionality we 're building is reusable later .
I started to object on the grounds of violating YAGNI before I realized that I completely agree with him — on the ends if not the means .
Some of the other developers are worried about making sure that the code meets future needs and maximizes code refuse .
I think there 's an underlying , unspoken assumption that the code cannot efficiently be changed later .
It has to be designed " right " upfront .
I think that the code needs to be able to change to meet future needs , whatever those turn out to be .
I want our code to be reusable as well .
What I do n't believe is that the way to meet these goals is to prematurely generalize the solution or speculatively build in unused hooks that " we 'll need in the future . " *
If we spend a substantial amount of effort building infrastructure for future needs we risk delaying the initial release .
Even worse , what if the specific infrastructure turns out to be unnecessary ?
That turns into waste .
Additionally , I 've often observed systems where the biggest impediment to extensibility was actually the very extensibility mechanisms put into place early in the project !
What I believe in is meticulously creating loosely - coupled , highly cohesive code backed up by comprehensive test and build automation that can accept change .
I think reuse is best accomplished by well factored code , not by specific intention .
If I can really create code that can be efficiently changed , and I firmly believe this is possible , I can add infrastructure and functionality to the code at a later date .
I want my code to be able to safely accommodate a broad range of change because you never really know what the future will bring .
We think we know what the future needs are , but one of the sales guys could easily swoop in with something completely off the wall .
Call me naive , but I really do think that you effectively flatten the change curve through an emphasis on very solid , maintainable code .
I want to be able to build the sales guy 's wacky ideas that we do n't even know about yet , not just the future features that we " know " we 'll need .
I 'm very dubious about a lot of the unbridled SOA enthusiasm I 've seen practiced on projects .
In particular , I think the idea of exposing pieces of a new system as web services upfront for a single consumer to be borderline idiotic .
If there 's only a single consumer , and the team owns both sides , just write the " service " in process .
The extra cost of writing and debugging the out of process integration point is a complete waste of effort if there is n't a second consumer .
You 've simply taken on additional technical risk on the chance that that exact service point will be useful to another consumer at a later point .
But wait Jeremy , what if I do need web service later ?
What do I do now smart guy ?
I told you I should have written the web service .
Well , if the code is really maintainable , i.e it can be safely changed , adding the web service wrapper to expose the existing code base remotely should be strictly an exercise in writing additional code , not changing existing code .
I very honestly , and sincerely , believe that high quality , maintainable code goes a long way towards obviating the need for SOA .**
I 've been working up a long - ish post on writing maintainable code that will expound on this point quite a bit .
Explicit Code over Design Time Wizards
My team has been coding for about three weeks on a WinForms client using copious amounts of Visual Studio .
Net 's design time support .
I 'm already thinking it 's time that we , the .
Net community , take a hard critical look at the RAD tools in Visual Studio .
What I 'm often seeing is that a little bit of explicit , hand - rolled coding leads to less duplication , better understandability , and vastly better testability than leaning too heavily on the wizard magic .
The effort it takes to create code is n't just the writing of the initial code , it 's also the effort it takes to test the code and modify that code later .
In specific , I 'm starting to become disenchanted with Data Binding .
I 'm really not convinced that the design time support for configuring the data binding justifies itself .
I 'm really seeing that pushing user interface behavior into Supervising Controllers with explicit code leads to a more maintainable system than depending on design time configuration of that same behavior .
Again , this circles back to the idea of making code work through testing and therefore seeking to enhance testability .
Software Engineering over Computer Science
I through this in here just to get some flames .
It 's a huge pet peeve of mine to see teams agonize over incremental improvements in sorting algorithms or caching or optimizing the number of IL instructions while neglecting to use sound Software Engineering practices .
The success of a system and the staying power of a codebase are rooted in solid configuration and build management practices .
Your algorithm might be fast , but you are n't going to reap much reward for it if you can't consistently get your code to install correctly .
Computer Science knowledge comes into play in some projects .
Good software engineering practices are valuable in every single software development project .
Here 's a longer explanation of the coding ecosystem I believe in .
* How 's that for loaded language ?
** Of course , the natural state of code tends towards entropy , so I think SOA 's future is perfectly safe .
Not long ago , Corinne Maier boasted in The New York Times that " ... in many years French workers have a higher productivity rate than their American counterparts . "
Measures of productivity do regularly reveal French workers to be more productive than American workers .
So Ms. Maier , a trained economist , must be right to conclude that this statistic is " proof that you can work better by working less . "
In fact , she 's probably mistaken .
France 's labor regulations are much more burdensome than those in the US .
By artificially raising the cost of hiring workers in France , these regulations make it unprofitable to hire the lowest - skilled workers .
One result is that only higher - skilled workers get jobs in France .
But because US labor regulations are less restrictive , a higher proportion of low - skilled workers find jobs in America .
With a larger proportion of highly skilled workers , France 's average productivity is bound to be higher .
But the French should n't be cheering .
I drive this point home to my students by asking them what would happen to average worker productivity if Uncle Sam were to impose a minimum wage of $ 500 per hour .
The correct answer is : " The productivity of the average worker would skyrocket ! "
This achievement , however , would be no cause for celebration , for this higher productivity would result chiefly from the firing of all workers incapable of producing at least $ 500 worth of output per hour .
Measured productivity in America would jump impressively even as the US economy tanked and most workers were cast into lasting unemployment .
The larger lesson is that proper interpretations of statistics often are surprisingly counterintuitive .
After all , our intuition tells us that countries with higher labor productivity do better economically than do countries with lower worker productivity .
But our intuition is wrong .
Statistics can also fool us when averages change over time .
Suppose that the average real - wage rate in the US falls .
Do we conclude that American workers are worse off ?
That 's one possible explanation .
But before jumping to that conclusion , be aware that another , very different , explanation might better fit the facts .
If lower - skilled workers enter the labor force in unusually large numbers , the average wage rate will fall without necessarily reducing any worker 's pay .
Indeed , the typical worker can even see his real - wage rate rise while the average rate falls !
To see how , suppose that you calculate the average height of people in the room where you now sit and find that it is 5 ft. , 6 in .
Now suppose a 2 - year - old child enters the room .
The average height of people in that room suddenly falls .
Few of us would make the mistake of concluding that those people were shrinking in size .
Some of them might even have grown taller .
Yet how often do we hear politicians use statistics in just this specious manner .
The same logic applies to the calculation of average wage rates .
Changes in this figure can be caused by changes in the composition of the labor force rather than by changes in the wages of individual workers .
For example , if teenagers , immigrants , and other lower - skilled workers start entering the labor force in larger numbers , they will lower the average wage rate because lower - skilled workers generally are paid lower wages than those paid to higher - skilled workers .
This fall in the average wage rate , however , does not signal that workers ' fortunes are declining .
In fact , in this case it is evidence of economic health :
The economy is sufficiently flexible to provide jobs to workers who have n't yet acquired valuable skills .
A less - flexible economy , such as France 's , which makes it difficult for lower - skilled workers to find jobs , will not " suffer " any such fall in its average wage rate .
But that fact , surely , is small comfort to the many poor people left unemployed .
Of course , in the other direction , if higher - skilled workers begin entering the labor force in unusually large numbers , they can pull up the average wage rate even if the wages of ordinary workers do n't change .
None of this is to suggest that statistics are useless .
Quite the contrary , statistics are indispensable to grasp reality better and to distinguish explanations that are correct from explanations that are merely plausible or even downright erroneous .
But statistics will assist us in our quest for understanding only if we approach them critically , aware that they can mislead as easily as they can enlighten .

The virus is spherical and has a diameter of 30 nanometres
The virus , which infects black - eyed peas , was employed as a " scaffold " on to which other chemicals were attached .
By linking iron - containing compounds to the virus 's surface , the John Innes Centre team was able to create electronically active nanoparticles .
The researchers tell the journal Small that their work could be used in the future to make tiny electrical devices .
The work is yet another example of how scientists are now trying to engineer objects on the scale of atoms and molecules .
At the nanoscale , materials can be " tuned " to display unusual properties that could be exploited to build faster , lighter , stronger and more efficient devices and systems .
Stores charge
The mosaic virus used in the experiments infects black - eyed pea plants ( Vigna unguiculata ) , causing their leaves to become mottled and yellow .
Not infectious to humans or animals , the miniscule virus measures just 30 nanometres across - where one nanometre is a billionth of a metre .
" We started to think about the virus particles as nano - building blocks , " explained Dr David Evans , a chemist at the John Innes Centre and the lead author on the Small paper .
" Because they have a defined size and a spherical shape , we thought they would be useful particles to use as a template or scaffold in nanotechnology . "
Black - eyed peas infected with the virus become mottled and yellow
After isolating a virus particle from the peas , the researchers then bound ferrocene compounds to amino acids on its surface .
The team managed to attach approximately 240 of the organometallic compounds , each containing an electronically active iron atom .
The addition of these compounds meant the nanoparticle became like a molecular capacitor - a device that could store electronic charge , explained Dr Evans .
After further development , this could lead to the particles being used in biosensors , nanoelectronic devices , or for electrocatalytic processes .
The research marks the first foray into nanotechnology for the John Innes plant science research centre .

I loved that edition of Top Gear where they said we should break the law .
And then there was that time when they introduced speed cameras to make we sure were n't breaking the law and nobody put up any fuss at all !

Do n't wanna piss on your parade
but the principles of the church on this subject were in place thousands of years before the new law so it is n't a case of them flouting anything , as in your two examples .
It 's the other way round .
The new laws are flouting long established principles on the basis of " anti prejudice " regardless of what is right or wrong .
Still , if you find it funny .......

Im pretty sure the horseless carrage appeared before any speeding laws .
In fact Im pretty sure people were doing everything which we now consider illegal before it was made so .
If the church can't handle the fact that prejudice is wrong then its high time it disappeared .

Not sure that the speeding laws
are a good example to hold up .
I disagree with your view that laws prevent crime ,
There are still societies with very low crime and none of them have passed over 2000 pieces of new legislation in the last ten years .
Some people have an innate sense of right and wrong and would n't do anything out of order just because there is n't a law against it .
I do n't see that the church is pre-judging here .
Rather they are going on experience that a child is most likely to prosper with two parents of opposite gender because they can each bring different natural aspects of parenting .
For this reason they would n't place a child with a lone parent either .
To me this is the opposite of prejudice , especially when you include the vetting procedure , which by definition does n't assume that any couple , gay or straight , is capable of giving a child a good home .

' different natural aspects of parenting ' , my arse ..
Hey , you might have a point except that a ) the church will happily let single atheists adopt and b ) research tends to show that same sex couples are actually more capable than many opposite sex couples at bringing up children .
Shall I mention the 50 % divorce rate , too ? ( , Fri 26 Jan 2007 , 11:22 , archived ) ( , Fri 26 Jan 2007 , 11:22 ,
Your point a ) is totally erroneous
and your point b ) is as well .
The Catholic church adoption societies do not place children with single atheists any more than they place them with heterosexual same sex Catholic couples who want to live together , brothers , sisters , fathers and sons etc .
There is n't a single piece of research on the " parenting success of homosexual couples compared to heterosexual couples " but I think you know that do n't you ?
There are parents of all persuasions who are totally unsuitable but it does n't mean that a " good " pair of homosexual parents are as suitable as a balanced heterosexual pair , unless you are saying that nature has had it completely wrong through millions of years and countless thousands of species .
As you have mentioned the 50 % divorce rate , yes , of course it 's a problem but that is the country as a whole .
If you count the divorce rate amongst couples accepted for adoption after thorough vetting by the church you will find it to be a much lower figure , naturally .
Trying to turn the argument into a comparison between " nice homosexuals " and " incapable , uncommited , divorce prone " heterosexuals is an irrelevance to this subject but so far I have n't seen a sensible , thought through , opinion so you 're still in the lead .

what a load of crap .
parenting models in the human species have only very recently been largely comprised of two opposite gender parents and their offspring .
more traditionally we are clan or tribally pulled together for survival purposes , for all breeding , eating and defensive matters we'd have been extinct had we not , as a species , banded together .
the very basis of our species , as we 've evolved , has necessitated a banding together and we 've evolved collectively .
had we not , we 'd not be here at all .
what that means , of course , is that dominant males have always had their genetic legacies and the ' weaker ' or less wealthy males have had to either not breed or settle for less choice mates .
since humans are tribal , though , these extraneous non-breeder members have had to serve some purpose , so they become the caretakers of children , teachers , food - procurers and - producers and the like .
obviously they are an integral part of the survival of the species and now that our species is dominant , they are also integral to the social fabric .
any attempt to reject or diminish the value of ( or more horrifically , to punish and eradicate ) the non-traditional breeding pairs is not only specious but counter to the natural way in which our species has evolved for thousands of years .
for this , and for the hateful claptrap in which the various churches try and defend their bullshit , they and their apologists can all go suck a tailpipe .
it 's infuriating to have people not only preach hatred and xenophobia , but to have their rationale for such ' compassionate disagreement ' be based upon lies of which they are perfectly well aware and perpetuate so their idiot followers will continue to lend them money and power makes all sane people wish to cut their collective throats .
burn the churches and do humans , the planet and all decency a favour .

Still not seen a
sensible thought through argument but have seen plenty of liberal fascism .
Nobody is suggesting harming homosexual people but there 's plenty of " Burn the churches " attitude around here .
People who believe in a god can be harmless or harmful , good or bad , paedophiles or non-paedophiles .
For you to advocate mass destruction of what they believe in places you alongside every other tyrant who walked the earth .
The hateful claptrap is on the other foot I 'm afraid , just read through these posts and you 'll see it .

go eat a bus .
you 're defending bigotry because you think that the traditions of insipid death cults should be honoured and valued over real people .
your accusation of ' liberal fascism ' is laughable -- there is no need for anyone with a liberal ( or any ) outlook to make a case for the extending of rights and privileges to people of all sexual orientations .
the case must be made by those seeking to exclude any one person or group that their reasoning is valid and based on reality , not the assumptions of what amounts to the oral traditions of a cargo cult .
a failed game of broken telephone championed by corrupt thieves and hallucinating gullibles eager to listen to the commands of imaginary beings should render one fit for an asylum , not policy - or lawmaking .
churches should be burned because they are almost universally corrupt black holes sucking the lives out of the communities that tolerate them and allow their untaxed extortion to continue .
when they begin open , honest review of their fiscal practises , stop operating as brainwash camps , cease functioning as zealously political champions of oppressive regimes and edicts and end all their physically and psychologically oppressive and harmful predation , then they may be allowed to stand .
go back to your time of tolerance of the intolerant and spoken and tacit agreement for the vile tactics of the god- botherers .
we here in the present do n't need the snake charmers of the past to have any effect on our sane , sensible lives .
and , if you think that knowing and communicating basic zoology is specious , you 're a fool .

Well there I was , a gay athiest ,
thinking that an adoption agency would know enough about choosing suitable parents for vulnerable children .
I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that a good and kind heterosexual father figure would benefit a straight boy more than I could .
When other children find out or even suspect you are gay they can make your life intolerable .
I do n't even want to think about what it would be like for a straight lad when his peers find out about his two dads .
And if you think your " rights " laws make any difference they do n't , and they never will .
You can not change attitudes by legislation , in fact you invariably make things worse for reasonable people and harden the attitudes of the bigots .
Since this discussion started other major religions have now sided with the RCs on this issue .
I know this is another opportunity to vent your bile on anyone who ever believed in god , whether they were good or bad people , but I can tell you from personal contact that a great many lay people also agree .
Unfortunately there is no room for a proper discussion to take place because of the sort of tirade I have seen here if anyone dares to disagree that EVERYBODY has a RIGHT to adopt children .
I believe everybody should have equal rights but that does n't meaan all people are suited to all situations .
I can remember the dark days when gangs would regularly bus into town for a spot of " queer bashing " ( also " nigger bashing " ) .
This mostly died out , not because of legislation , which was already in place , but because others gradually accepted homosexuality until eventually the law was changed to allow it .
Over a period of a couple of decades people became more accepting of differences , through integration and discussion .
Now the pendulum has swung right out through the side of the clock and we have to be multicultural , multi- genderal and never say how we actually feel about important issues .
Positive vetting is the buzz - policy everywhere you go .
What the policymakers and their followers do n't seem to realise is that positive vetting automatically produces negative vetting of someone else , in otherwords prejudice .
This in turn produces resentment , but this time from the majority , which makes life harder and harder for people like me .
So by all means keep up your crusade and continue to present your extremely constructive and rational arguments , I loved the one you made about all the gay male cavemen sitting around babysitting while the straights went out hunting !
All I ask is that if you ever see me in any kind of predicament , for goodness sake do n't speak on my behalf , I can manage very well without a stoning thank you .
Tolerence , if anything , is what will save this troubled world and you my friend are so consumed by your own anger and hatred for your fellow men that you have no room for any .

The Courier Journal of Kentucky is running a story on the success of local businesses which are promotiing on MySpace.com via setting up MySpace profiles .
Seems that bars , clothing shops , coffee shops and gift stores in the area are focusing highly on establishing popular MySpace profiles and connecting with users in their local areas .
Peter Berkowitz , owner of Old Louisville Coffee House , [ says ] the effort was so successful that he abandoned his traditional Web site in favor of MySpace .
“ It just seemed redundant , ” said Berkowitz , 32 , who uses the MySpace profile to post electronic bulletins about live music events , art shows and poetry readings .
…
Berkowitz said he gets about five requests a day from people who want to be “ friends ” of the shop ’s MySpace page , giving them access to its calendar listings , photos and other details .
The shop , at Fourth and Hill streets , is described online as male , 101 years old , with the following interests : coffee , tea , food , books , art , music .

And another amazing MySpace profile centered local search & marketing case study from the article :
John Timmons , owner of ear X - tacy on Bardstown Road , said the store ’s all - time top marketing scheme remains its trademark bumper sticker , although he acknowledged that campaign is rooted in “ old school ” advertising techniques .
Timmons , 51 , does n’t plan to replace his billboards , his Web site , or his radio , television and print advertising .
But he said the store ’s MySpace presence provides something those other tools can’t .
A couple of weeks ago , he said store employees found that they did n’t have enough time to promote an upcoming live music performance with traditional ads , so they put details on the store ’s Web site and on MySpace .
More than 200 people showed up .

And how does MySpace.com ’s reach compare with the online Yellow Pages ?
Here ’s a traffic reach comparison from Alexa of MySpace , Craigslist , YellowPages.com , Superpages.com and Local.com :
Not only is MySpace incredibly more popular , but it lets business owners interact with their local target markets , something other local search and marketing sites do not do very well .
Greg Sterling touched upon how MySpace has the ultimate set up as the Next Generation Yellow Pages … it ’s great to see these examples in action down in Ol ’ Kentucky .

( AP Photo / Pablo Martinez Monsivais ) Republicans Fear 2008 Meltdown
Republicans across the country are warning that increasing public discontent toward President Bush , the Iraq war and the GOP brand in general threatens to send the party 's 2008 campaign planning into a tailspin .
Already , the problems are having tangible effects .
Some of the party 's top recruits in key races from Colorado to Florida are refusing to run for Congress .
Business executives -- the financial backbone of the GOP -- are sending more and more money to Democrats .
Overall Republican fundraising is down sharply from the same time frame during the past two presidential elections .

Then there are the voters .
Polling data released this month confirm what GOP officials are picking up anecdotally : Swing voters are swinging away from Republicans at high velocity .
Most alarming to GOP strategists is a new survey by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center that found 50 percent of those interviewed consider themselves a Democrat or leaning that way ; only 35 percent tilt Republican .
" People are concerned and worried about the party 's prospects , " said Steve Duprey , former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP and a backer of Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) in the White House race .
" There 's a certain nervousness I hear that if the war is going badly and we 're still in this intractable fight between a Democratic Congress and President Bush about the course of the war , we may have a tough time . "
Duprey 's comment echoes the concern among many Republican operatives : Each of the multiple bad trends facing the party tends to reinforce the others , potentially creating a dynamic in which it will be nearly impossible for the party to improve its position before next year 's elections .
How to restore the GOP brand ?
" That 's what we 're struggling with , honestly , " said Rep. Shelley Moore Capito ( R - W.Va . ) .
" Do you positively brand yourself , or do you negatively brand the other side ? "
Bush 's low approval ratings are an illustration .
Some experienced GOP campaign strategists believe that there is virtually no chance that a Republican can succeed Bush if his approval ratings remain mired in the 30s .
The Democratic strategy of investigating administration scandals and policy blunders is calculated to achieve exactly that goal -- and the burgeoning controversy over the firings of eight U.S. attorneys has given Democrats in Congress yet another inviting target .
To make matters worse , as long as Bush is unpopular , Republicans on the Hill -- already frustrated at what they perceive as White House indifference to lawmakers ' political problems -- are less inclined to defend Bush from attacks .
This painful cycle has some high - level Republicans braced for the likelihood that last fall 's rout , in which Democrats won the House and the Senate , may be a prelude to a 2008 knockout that would leave the GOP without control of Congress or the White House for the first time since 1994 .
To underscore how tough things are for the GOP , Bill Pascoe , a Chicago - based Republican consultant with Urquhart Media , said " there are Republican consultants scouting state legislators for 2014 .
That 's how far the long - range planning is going . "
Why 2014 ?
Because that would be the second midterm of a Democratic president .
Political fortunes , of course , can change rapidly based on events and the candidates picked for the presidential ticket .
Yet even the most relentlessly optimistic of Republicans sound skeptical .
Ken Mehlman , the former Republican National Committee chairman who now gathers political intelligence for the Akin Gump lobbying firm , said the GOP is in need of urgent rehabilitation , which wo n't come unless it can defy long - term voting patterns .
" We have to win back the confidence we lost in '06 from swing voters and ticket splitters , " said Mehlman .
" The way you do that , in part , is by being a party that is less reliant on white guys and expands its support among Hispanics , among African - Americans . "
Congressional Republicans , however , are not focused on expanding minority support .
In fact , they are pursuing an immigration deal that Mehlman has warned could poison the GOP with Hispanic voters .
History offers even more reason for worry .
Only once in the past half century has a party won the White House three times in a row ( Reagan - Reagan - Bush ) .
And when a party loses the White House , it often loses congressional seats , too .
" That is obviously a formidable challenge for us , " said Mehlman .
Already , there are some troubling trends on the money front , according to GOP fundraisers and Federal Election Commission documents .
First , corporate PACs gave almost 60 percent of their money to Democrats in the first two months this year , a striking shift away from Republicans , according to the nonpartisan Political Money Line .
Republicans snagged about two - thirds of corporate PAC money over the previous four years .
Overall GOP fundraising for the three major campaign committees was also down during January and February .
The RNC , National Republican Senatorial Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee raised a combined $ 30 million this year , compared with $ 40 million during the same period in 2005 and $ 38 million in 2003 .
At the same time , Democratic fundraising surged , narrowing the GOP 's money advantage .
Two GOP lobbyists said Capitol Hill Republicans , fearful of another bloody election cycle , are pushing hard to get donations from companies before month 's end to discourage Democrats from expanding the battlefield .
" There has been some frustration out there , but as the consequences of a Democratic majority sink in to the base , they will respond , I think , with fervor , " said Florida Rep.
Adam Putnam , a member of the GOP leadership team .
What 's not clear is whether frustration among GOP activists , especially religious conservatives , will translate into less grass - roots assistance for Republican candidates in next year 's campaigns .
" Our activists are disappointed with federal spending , disappointed we lost Congress , " said South Carolina GOP Chairman Katon Dawson .
Like Dawson , Michigan GOP Chairman Saul Anuzis argues that some conservatives are trying to put the 2006 debacle and the Bush presidency behind them .
" There are a lot of people turning to the future already , " Anuzis said
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said , however , that the painful lessons of 2006 have yet to be learned .
" I do n't think there has yet been a full appreciation for what just happened " in the November elections , Pawlenty said .
" There remains an element of denial about the message that was just sent and the reality we face . "
Even in a neutral political environment , 2008 would be a very tough year for Republicans , especially in the Senate .
Simply put , the Republicans are defending more seats than the Democrats -- 21 Republican seats are up this cycle , while only 12 Democrats plan to seek reelection .
So the playing field automatically is in the Democrats ' favor .
Only one of those Democrats , Sen. Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana , is likely to face a serious challenge at this point .
Republicans could face a tough challenge in New Hampshire , Minnesota , Maine and Oregon , where a recent poll showed incumbent Gordon Smith ( R ) trailing by several points .
The Senate outlook could get worse for the GOP in coming months .
Party officials said they are concerned Sens. Pat Roberts ( Kan. ) , Pete V. Domenici ( N.M. ) and John Warner ( Va. ) all might retire .
In all three states , Democrats could pick up seats that have been securely in GOP hands for years .
( UPDATE : Despite such concerns , Roberts said Jan. 26 that he 'll run again and his staff reiterated that again Thursday . )
Republicans are also having trouble landing the strongest candidates in key House races .
In Florida 's 22nd Congressional District , for instance , the top three prospects have all refused overtures to challenge first - term Rep. Ron Klein , a top GOP target .
In New York 's 19th District , the GOP is having trouble luring a blue - chip candidate to challenge Rep. John Hall in the Republican - tilting district .
" Obviously , we 'd prefer the environment to be a little different , but the things that count are the votes we 're having " to motivate voters , said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Cole ( Okla . ) .
He said the presidential contest could turn things around for the GOP and help attract more top - shelf candidates .
Said former New Hampshire representative Charlie Bass , now president of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership : " I do n't think Republicans would do any better today than we did last November , but we have another year and a half . "
Josh Kraushaar , Patrick O'Connor and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed to this report .
“ There were days I considered shutting the garage door and letting the car run until I was dead , ” says Colorado mom Erin Griffin , of the time nine years ago when she learned that both her boys — not just her firstborn — suffered from autism .
Brendan , her angular , dark - haired older child , was diagnosed in 1996 at age 4 .
Kyle , her round - faced , hazel - eyed younger son , was diagnosed in 1998 at age 2 ½ .
But Kyle and Brendan ’s story does not have a tragic ending .
After interventions that included occupational and speech therapy , as well as dietary change and nutritional supplements , both boys improved significantly .
Their tale of slow , steady recovery reflects the changing landscape of autism today .
The condition , traditionally seen as genetic and originating in the brain , is starting to be viewed in a broader and very different light , as a possible immune and neuroinflammatory disorder .
As a result , autism is beginning to look like a condition that can , in some and perhaps many cases , be successfully treated .
That is astonishing news about a disorder that usually makes headlines because it seems to be growing rapidly more widespread .
In the United States , the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders has increased about tenfold over the past two decades , and a 2003 report by the Centers for Disease Control suggests that as many as one in every 166 children is now on the autism spectrum , while another one in six suffers from a neurodevelopmental delay .
This explosion of cases has raised countless questions :
Is the increase real , is it the result of increased awareness and expanding diagnostic categories , is it due to environmental changes , or all of the above ?
There may be no single answer .
But the public concern about autism has caught the ear of federal lawmakers .
The Combating Autism Act , approved last December , authorized nearly $ 1 billion over the next four years for autism - related research and intervention .
Meanwhile , on the sidelines of that confusing discussion , a disparate group — immunologists , naturopaths , neuroscientists , and toxicologists — is turning up clues that are yielding novel strategies to help autistic patients .
New studies are examining contributing factors ranging from vaccine reactions to atypical growth in the placenta , abnormal tissue in the gut , inflamed tissue in the brain , food allergies , and disturbed brain wave synchrony .
Some clinicians are using genetic test results to recommend unconventional nutritional therapies , and others employ drugs to fight viruses and quell inflammation .
Above all , there is a new emphasis on the interaction between vulnerable genes and environmental triggers , along with a growing sense that low - dose , multiple toxic and infectious exposures may be a major contributing factor to autism and its related disorders .
A vivid analogy is that genes load the gun , but environment pulls the trigger .
“ Like cancer , autism is a very complex disease , ” says Craig Newschaffer , chairman of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Drexel University School of Public Health , “ and it ’s exciting to start asking questions about the interaction between genes and environment .
There ’s really a very rich array of potential exposure variables . ”
In one way , the field seems like a free - for - all , staggeringly disordered because it is littered with so many possibilities .
But one can distill a few revolutionary insights .
First , autism may not be rigidly determined but instead may be related to common gene variants , called polymorphisms , that may be derailed by environmental triggers .
Second , affected genes may disturb fundamental pathways in the body and lead to chronic inflammation across the brain , immune system , and digestive system .
Third , inflammation is treatable .
“ I ca n’t think of it as a coincidence anymore that so many autistic kids have a history of allergies , eczema , or chronic diarrhea . ”
“ In spite of so many years of assumptions that a brain disorder like this is not treatable , we ’re helping kids get better .
So it ca n’t just be genetic , prenatal , hardwired , and hopeless , ” says Harvard pediatric neurologist Martha Herbert , author of a 14,000 - word paper in the journal Clinical Neuropsychiatry that reconceptualizes the universe of autism , pulling the brain down from its privileged perch as an organ isolated from the rest of the body .
Herbert is well suited to this task , a synthetic thinker who wrote her dissertation on the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget and who then went to medical school late , in her early thirties .
“ I no longer see autism as a disorder of the brain but as a disorder that affects the brain , ” Herbert says .
“ It also affects the immune system and the gut .
One very striking piece of evidence many of us have noticed is that when autistic children go in for certain diagnostic tests and are told not to eat or drink anything ahead of time , parents often report their child ’s symptoms improve — until they start eating again after the procedure .
If symptoms can improve in such a short time frame simply by avoiding exposure to foods , then we ’re looking at some kind of chemically driven ‘ software ’ — perhaps immune system signals — that can change fast .
This means that at least some of autism probably comes from a kind of metabolic encephalopathy — a systemwide process that affects the brain , just like cirrhosis of the liver affects the brain . ”
In 1943 Johns Hopkins University psychiatrist Leo Kanner first described autism as a now - famous collection of symptoms : poor social engagement , limited verbal and nonverbal communication , and repetitive behaviors .
Back then , autism was considered rare ; Kanner first reported on just 11 patients , and Johns Hopkins still has records of about 150 patients he examined in total .
Even within this small group of patients , other , less visible symptoms were evident .
In his 1943 paper , “ Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact , ” Kanner noted immune and digestive problems but did not include them in the diagnosis .
One reads with a shiver sentences lifted out of various case histories : “ large and ragged tonsils . . . she was tube - fed five times daily . . . he vomited all food from birth through the third month . . . he suffered from repeated colds and otitis media .

" Welcome to Mod My Body , the show where we take someone 's tired , run-down physical form and make it into something sensational , spectacular and trans - human , all for less than 10,000 North American Dollars .
" This week our subject is Branson Quaternary .
Branson just finished his Applied Philosophy degree , and all he has are the few starter mods he could fit into his student - sized budget : a three - sense data port , a standard AetherFi AggreNet interface and an abdominal blood scrubber .
A little something for those late nights at the bar , huh Branson ? "
" Well , you know , it 's cheaper than paying for cabs . "
" Now that Branson 's out in the real world , working as a designer for a top philosophical - virtual reality firm , he 's starting to feel like he needs a little something extra to keep up with his peers .
Right , Branson ? "
" Well , you know , I 'm working with guys who have wolf spider optics and retractable limbs , and here I am with my three - senser .
They never say anything , but I know they 're transmitting things about me . "
" We 're not going to be able to match that , but we should be able to give Branson some nice mods that will help him out at work and at play .
We 're going to put you under now , Branson . "
" Well , you know , I really appreciate ... uh , sleepy .... "
" Working with a budget means that we 're going to have to find parts with many uses from early morning meetings to late - night parties .
We 'll start with the blood scrubber .
Most people think of these are party implants , but Brandon bought a modular scrubber , which means we can add a blood infuser at a discount .
So while he 's clearing the alcohol and sensutropics out of his system , he can throw a little stimulant into the mix and be ready to get down to work as the sun rises .
The price is a mere 800 NADs .
" Next , we 'll take a look at his three - sense data port .
I 'm sure Branson would love to upgrade it to a five - senser or even a six - senser , but that 's way out of our budget .
Luckily , with his skills in applied philosophy , Branson is able to create new virtual worlds just by arguing for their existence .
We 'll give him a philosopical - virtual projector , so he can create new experiences for himself and those around him .

First it was a challenge to make LEDs that created truly white light instead of that yellowish or bluish glow , but that problem has long been solved .
Now the race is on to enhance their efficiency .
Cree Inc. just raised the bar , producing a white LED that can crank out 131 lumens per watt .
This is not just idle talk , either — the achievement was confirmed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology .

This feat leapfrogs Japan - based Nichia Corp. , which in March of this year announced a white LED capable of 100 lumens per watt .
All this remarkable efficiency is a far cry from everyday incandescent bulbs which suck up gobs of energy and create lots of heat , all the while only giving up 10 to 20 lumens per watt .
Heck , even compact fluorescents can only do 50 to 60 lumens per watt .
These ultra high - efficiency LEDs will prove themselves to be valuable not only in solar lighting fixtures , but in everyday uses around the home and everywhere else , too .
Now if they can just get the cost of manufacturing these LEDs down to a reasonable level , the energy savings could be world - changing .

bulletin from the city of Lafayette : http://www.cityoflafayette.com/News.asp?NewsID=1466
City Withdraws Ordinance Ordinance No. 06 , 2007 , which amended Section 75 - 41 and 75 - 42 of Lafayette 's Municipal Code regarding the maximum penalties for possession of cannabis ( marijuana ) , has been withdrawn .
City staff and City Council have determined that more information and analysis are needed on this matter , and it will be the subject of a Council Workshop Meeting on April 3 .
If and when the ordinance is brought forward after the workshop City Council 's process for voting on the ordinance will start from the beginning , with votes required at two separate Council Meetings .
The April 3 City Council Workshop will be held at City Hall , Council Chambers , 1290 South Public Road , at 5:30 PM .
The workshop meeting is open to the public and will be broadcast live on Cable Channel 8 .
also , a press release from SAFER about it : PRESS RELEASE For Immediate Release -- Feb. 16 , 2007 Lafayette City Council withdraws bid to increase marijuana penalties Officials reconsider drastic and unnecessary ordinance in light of strong public opposition Contact : Mason Tvert , SAFER executive director , 720-255-4340 DENVER --
The Lafayette City Council has withdrawn a municipal ordinance that would have drastically and unnecessarily increased the fine for possession of small amounts of marijuana .
The proposed measure would have increased the fine for possessing less than one ounce of marijuana from a maximum $ 100 fine and no time in jail -- as called for under state law -- to a maximum $ 1,000 fine and up to one year in jail .
Safer Alternative For Enjoyable Recreation ( SAFER ) , along with the ACLU of Colorado , the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition , and Sensible Colorado , coordinated a strong grassroots response in opposition to the proposal , which the council initially approved at its Feb. 6 meeting .
According to a statement on the Lafayette City Council 's Web site ( see below or http://www.cityoflafayette.com/
News.asp?NewsID=1466 ) , " City staff and City Council have determined that more information and analysis are needed on this matter . "
The measure came at the behest of a Lafayette municipal court judge and was introduced by Lafayette police .
Proponents failed to provide any evidence supporting the stated intent of the ordinance , and no public support was demonstrated for such heightened penalties for simple marijuana possession .
A majority ( 53.2 percent ) of Lafayette voters and an even larger majority ( 55.5 percent ) of Boulder County voters approved Amendment 44 last November , which would have removed all penalties for adult possession of less than one ounce of marijuana .
" We are very pleased that the Lafayette City Council has withdrawn this drastic and unnecessary measure , " said SAFER Executive Director Mason Tvert .
" We appreciate their responsiveness to the concerns of Lafayette and Boulder County citizens , and we look forward to serving as a resource for accurate information on marijuana at the council 's public workshop on this issue in April . "
" Every objective study on marijuana has found it to be less harmful than alcohol to both the user and to society , " Tvert said .
" There is simply no justification for penalizing adults so severely -- if at all -- for making the safer choice .
Colorado 's criminal justice system is already overwhelmed and Boulder County 's jail is full , so there is no sense in further cluttering either of them with adults doing nothing more harmful than having a couple cocktails .

Google has quietly axed the web services API to its eponymous search engine .
The stealth move was made without any announcement , but visitors to the page now receive a blunt message , backdated to 5 December , advising them that the SOAP API is no longer supported .
The service was launched in spring 2002 , giving developers a limited chance to develop applications using data drawn from Google 's main search index .
Amazon.com followed with its own web services interface weeks later .
Both companies used SOAP , or Simple Object Access Protocol , the much - hyped web services protocol that is anything but simple .
But Google restricted the number of queries that could be made using the API to 1,000 searches a day , and 10 results per query .
More recently , the accuracy of the results it returned has been criticised .
Google 's original project manager Nelson Minar comments on the decision here .
Google now points developers to the more restrictive AJAX API instead .
" The AJAX Search API is better suited for search - based web applications and supports additional features like Video , News , Maps , and Blog search results , " Google said . ®
215 metro logos , sorted by city
There are different kinds of metro logos :
In some cities , a logo stands for the metro system itself , while in others , logos represent one or several operating companies .
So there may be more than one logo in one city , while in another , a logo can consistently stand for the system .
Some logos are ubiquitous , at least nationwide :
Germany : all metros use a blue U logo ( LRTs have slightly derived ones ) .
Suburban railways use a green S logo .
Italy : most cities use a white letter M on a red square for metros .
Spain : most suburban railways ( called Cercanias ) bear the same red C logo .
Former Soviet Union : many cities are using derived versions of a red sloped letter M for their metros .
子どもの頃、母親に毎朝毎晩 「歯磨きしたの？」と言われ続けていた。
大人になった今では「磨く」ことが習慣になっているが、「歯磨き面倒だな〜」と思う子どもたちは多いのではないだろうか。子どもでなくても、疲れ切って眠い夜などはパスしたいものの一つかもしれない。
そんな人に楽しい歯ブラシがクリスマス商戦を狙ってか、年末に米国トイメーカーの「ハズブロ（Hasbro）」から発売される。その名も「トゥース・チューンズ（tooth tunes） 」。
歯ブラシにマイクロチップが内蔵され、歯磨きをすると音楽が聞こえる仕組みになっている。
歯磨きしながらどうやって音楽を聴くのか、というと、骨伝導方式だという。
歯ブラシの毛先が歯に触れると顎骨から中耳に直接音楽が届くということらしい。
子ども向けの音楽歯ブラシだもん、きっと童謡かなんかが聞こえるんじゃないの？
なんて声が聞こえてきそうだが、ディスティニーチャイルドやヒラリー・ダフのようなアイドルから始まり、懐かしのクィーンやキッスの曲までもがある。
来年には、スマッシュ・マウスやブラック・アイド・ピーズなどの曲も加わるというので、iPod世代の若者にも受け入れられるかもしれない。
一本の歯ブラシに一曲のみ 約2分間が入っている。
こ の2分間というのは、歯磨き1回に費やす時間の目安で、アメリカ歯科協会が薦めているものだ。歯にブラシをしっかり当てないと、お気に入りの曲もよく聴こえないので、効率よく磨けるというのが利点のようだ。
逆に、一曲のみというので同じ曲に飽きる可能性もあるが、あらかじめ何本かそろえておき、その日のムードで曲を選択する（歯ブラシを選択する）というのもありだと思う。
将来的には曲をダウンロードできる歯ブラシなんてことになるんだろうか。
気になるお値段は、日本円で約1200円程。今時点では日本での販売は未定ということだが、Jポップ歯ブラシというのも充分魅力的だと思う。
さて、何の曲の歯ブラシを買おうかな。

Do n’t hold your breath for music subscriptions from Apple 's iTunes music store – Steve Jobs will never offer them .
Renting music flies in the face of consumer behavior .
Consumers want to buy music , not rent it , and a big part of Steve Jobs ' genius is his firm , intuitive grasp of how consumers behave , and tailoring Apple 's technology to accommodate it – not the other way around .
Nonetheless , there 's a lot of speculation that Jobs may soon offer subscriptions , mostly because he 's currently renegotiating contracts with the record labels , which love subscriptions because of the steady , predictable revenue stream .
Some speculate that the labels will force Jobs to offer monthly music rentals as part of new licensing terms , the same way they forced him to add DRM copy protection to music in iTunes ' early days .
Jobs may have been hinting at this scenario last week , when he told Reuters :
" Never say never , but customers do n't seem to be interested in it , " Jobs said .
" The subscription model has failed so far . "
Jobs is right .
There 's no mainstream demand for music subscriptions .
The music business is n't built on long - term rentals ; it 's built on one hit after another .
It 's confectionary .
Tunes are addictive for a while and then discarded .
It 's like the drug business : Users are always looking for the next hit .
I 'm currently hooked on The Good , the Bad and the Queen – it's all I want to listen to , all day , all night .
I 'm not interested in hearing any other music at the moment .
There 's no sense " subscribing " to this album .
I 'd much rather buy it .
I just canceled my subscription to Microsoft 's Zune service after about three months as a subscriber .
I finally realized that I 'll never change my music - consuming behavior to fit its business model .
Like all subscription services , Zune is analogous to a cheap Vegas buffet .
At first you stuff your face like a pig , but when you go back , there 's nothing you want to eat .
After an initial burst of activity where I downloaded everything I could find , my usage dropped off a cliff .
I thought the Zune subscription service would be good for finding for new music , but it is n't at all .
I 've found more music from TV ads than I found through Zune .
A lot of people tell the same story .
Even die - hard fans of subscription services do n’t use them for music discovery .
They use Pandora or Last.fm , they hear tunes on the radio or read about bands in magazines .
Then they go to their subscription service to download it .
I 've yet to find anyone who uses a subscription service to find new music .
Subscriptions make sense in a group setting , like an office , where a lot of people want to listen to a lot of different music , but not for individuals .
The Zune service is pretty slick .
It 's all you can eat , and has a surprisingly deep catalog .
The online store is nicely designed and easy to navigate .
But I just did n’t use it .

The financial returns for reducing carbon could be considerable , said Daniel M. Kammen , a professor at the University of California , Berkeley .
In Europe , where there is a market for carbon credits , it is now worth only $ 2 to offset a ton of carbon emissions .
But not long ago , that figure was $ 35 , and it is expected to rise again as the limits imposed under the Kyoto Protocol on global warming start to bite .
Planktos believes that it can make a healthy profit if it receives $ 5 a ton for capturing carbon dioxide .
“ The cost of offsetting carbon through these technologies is less than the cost of building solar panels or windmills , ” Mr. Kammen said .
“ There ’s no question that this is going to grow , ” he said of various carbon offset strategies .
But the question in the case of iron fertilization is whether the exuberance and marketing spirit of Silicon Valley and its can - do attitude are getting ahead of scientific reality .
And some oceanographic experts say that there is a risk of doing more harm than good from artificially stimulating plankton growth in the ocean .
It is widely accepted by scientists that dumping iron in certain areas of the ocean can cause plankton to bloom .
But there is considerable skepticism over whether doing so will lead to long - term absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , said Ken Buesseler , senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .
Mr. Buesseler said that while carbon might be absorbed initially , there was ample evidence that when the plankton was eaten or decomposed , at least some of the carbon wound up going back into the atmosphere .
The level of absorption depends on how much of the resulting mass of plankton sinks to the sea bed .

Critics worry that there may be unintended side effects .

And some scholars in the field are concerned that creating plankton blooms could release methane and nitrous oxide , which might increase greenhouse gases .
“ There are some potentially dangerous side effects , ” said Paul G. Falkowski , professor of geology and marine science at Rutgers University .

Mr Fu has helped people displaced by the Three Gorges Dam
Mr Fu , who campaigned for people displaced by the Three Gorges Dam , was beaten up returning home after he was summoned by police in Hubei province .
The June beating was so severe he is not expected to walk again , according to Human Rights in China ( HRIC ) .
But an official investigation has ruled the attack was fabricated .
Officials told Mr Fu's son , Fu Bing , that investigators had failed to find anyone else 's footprints at the scene of the attack , and had concluded that he must have hit himself .
The blow to the back of his neck was so severe that three of his vertebrae were broken , HRIC said .
HRIC said it was strongly concerned about the independence of the investigation , which was carried out by the same public security bureau that had a record of harassing Mr Fu .
Mr Fu has highlighted the plight of people moved to make way for the Three Gorges dam .
He had been subject to a series of threats , attacks and harassment in the past year , the group said .
China says the dam , which will be the world 's largest hydro- electric project , will provide electricity for its booming economy and help control flooding on the Yangtze River .
But it comes at the expense of villagers , who in many cases have been resettled on inferior land and been deprived of compensation by corrupt local officials , the rights group said .

For the second straight day , 35 % of Americans approve of the way that George W. Bush is performing his role as President .
That ’s the lowest level of Approval ever measured by Rasmussen Reports .
It is interesting to note that the last time the President ’s Approval Ratings hit a new low followed the President ’s speech on immigration .
Typically , President ’s ( sic ) expect to get a positive bounce following a national address .
Washington Post
pointlessness
did
The picture that emerged [ from the Times story on NSA eavesdropping ] presented a sharply contradictory set of circumstances .
A president who commanded the support and loyalty of national politicians in both parties .
A president who sought , and was given , expanded powers by Congress to combat terrorism .
A Congress that , in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , repeatedly and with virtual unanimity agreed to every request the president made .
And yet a president who chose to secretly order eavesdropping on American citizens , on U.S. soil , in violation of the very law he had just requested .
wanted purposely not to comply with the law
escalate
UPDATE
From Rasmussen Reports , the favorite polling firm of Bush followers : That polling was conducted after the President 's " surge " speech .
What is particularly notable is this observation :
It really is striking that whenever one is convinced that Bush 's unpopularity ratings have reached their nadir , the one thing that can always drive them even further downward is Bush 's appearance on national television to explain himself to the country ( or , to use Jules Crittenden 's classic formulation : for the President to " address us . . . and show us the way forward " ) .
Even after six years , the more Americans see and hear from George Bush , the more they dislike him .
The collapse of the Bush presidency is truly historic .
It is always worth remembering that when Richard Nixon was forced to resign the Presidency , his Gallup approval rating was 25 % .
The 35 % Rasmussen figure for Bush is above the low points measured by most other polls ( which is why it is the favorite metric for Bush followers ) , but it is still abominably low .
AP - Ipsos reported several days ago that Bush had just reached an all - time low in its poll -- 32 % .
If George Bush continues to appear in public and makes speeches , he 's going to soon be within the margin of error of Nixon 's resignation - compelling unpopularity .
While a weakened Bush presidency may appear intuitively to be a cause for celebration , it poses a serious danger .
In a characteristically perceptive Op - Ed in this morning 's , Dahlia Lithwick makes the point that Bush 's extremist actions -- such as Jose Padilla 's detention , the Guantanamo abuses , and omnipotence - declaring signing statements -- have no real objective except one : " The object is a larger one : expanding executive power , for its own sake .
" When I began writing about the Bush administration 's violations of FISA , what confounded me at first was the sheerof the lawbreaking .
It was not merely that the FISA court has always allowed the President -- all presidents -- to do whatever eavesdropping they wanted , and that bypassing it was therefore unnecessary .
That is true .
But more significantly , if the President wanted FISA changed , even radically , to vest him with still greater powers , the unprecedentedly compliant post - 9/11 Congress was as eager as could be to grant all of his wishes and to give him whatever new powers he wanted .
It did so repeatedly , at exactly the time ( October , 2001 ) when he ordered eavesdropping in violation of the law .
In fact , Congressamend FISA to grant expanded eavesdropping powers -- in complete accordance with the President 's request -- at the very same time Bush ordered illegal eavesdropping .
As I wrote in my book :
The reason Bush violated the law when eavesdropping is the same reason Lithwick cites to explain his other lawless and extremist measures -- because hein order to establish the general " principle " that he was not bound by the law , to show that he has the power to break the law , that he is more powerful than the law .
This is a President and an administration that are obsessed first and foremost with their own power and with constant demonstrations of their own strength .
Conversely , what they fear and hate the most is their own weakness and submission to limitations .
For that reason , the weaker and more besieged the administration feels , the more compelled they will feel to make a showing of their power .
Lashing out in response to feelings of weakness is a temptation most human beings have , but it is more than a mere temptation for George Bush .
It is one of the predominant dynamics that drives his behavior .
His party suffered historic losses in the 2006 midterm elections as a result of profound dissatisfaction with his presidency and with his war , and his reaction was tothe war , despite ( really , because of ) the extreme unpopularity of that option .
And as Iraq rapidly unraveled , he issued orders that pose a high risk of the conflict engulfing Iran .
When he feels weak and restrained , that is when he acts most extremely .
Bush officials and their followers talk incessantly about things like power , weakness , domination , humiliation .
Their objectives -- both foreign and domestic -- are always to show their enemies that they are stronger and more powerful and the enemies are weaker and thus must submit ( " shock and awe " ) .
It is a twisted world view but it dominates their thinking ( and that is how our country has been governed for the last six years , which is what accounts for our current predicament ) .
As John Dean demonstrated , a perception of one 's weakness and the resulting fears it inspires are almost always what drive people to seek out empowering authoritarian movements and the group - based comforts of moral certitude .
The most dangerous George Bush is one who feels weak , powerless and under attack .
Those perceptions are intolerable for him and I doubt there are many limits , if there are any , on what he would be willing to do in order to restore a feeling of power and to rid himself of the sensations of his own weakness and defeat . :
This great Digby post ( including the update ) concerns Iran and relates to all of the issues in this post .
By analyzing the COSMOS field , the largest field of galaxies ever observed with the Hubble space telescope , an international team of scientists led by researchers from the California Institute of Technology ( United States ) and researchers from the associated laboratories of the CNRS and the CEA , made the first three - dimensional map of dark matter in the Universe using gravitational lensing effects .
This historic first seems to confirm the standard theories on the formation of the large structures of the Universe .
This study was presented in the January 7 , 2007 issue of the journal " Nature . "
For astronomers , mapping the distribution of the mass in the Universe from its light component is a considerable challenge .
It is an exercise as complicated as determining the extent of a city solely from aerial photographs taken at night .
Luminous matter ( stars , galaxies , ionized gas ) represents only about one sixth of the total matter of the Universe .
The remainder is invisible and composed in particular of the mysterious component called dark matter .
Nonetheless , despite the complexity of the task , a three - dimensional map of all of the mass , luminous and dark matter was made for the first time in the COSMOS field .
An international team of astronomers achieved this feat by using the gravitational lens effect to measure the large - scale distribution of matter .
This new map brings more information comparable to what we would have by seeing a city in daylight rather than at night to be able to distinguish all of the fine details .
The map of dark matter was made by measuring the shapes of half a million distant galaxies .
To reach us , their light had to cross the " fields " of dark matter and the beams of light were slightly deflected .
This phenomenon is a direct consequence of Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity which predicts that the presence of a large mass locally distorts Space - Time .
In consequence , the trajectory of particles passing close to this concentration of mass is diverted .
Photons , particles associated with electromagnetic radiation , are not an exception .
The deformation observed in the shapes of the galaxies was used to reconstruct the distribution of the mass along the line of sight .
The COSMOS field covers a region of the sky nine times the size of the Moon ( 1.6 square degrees ) .
The COSMOS survey done by Hubble includes 575 images from the ACS camera ( Advanced Camera for Surveys ) , corresponding to close to 1,000 hours of observation .
Following the observations made with Hubble , many additional observations with telescopes ( like the Subaru , the VLT and the CFHT ) and in space ( XMM - Newton ) on the ground were carried out .
In particular , the multi-color images from the Subaru and the Canada - France - Hawaii Telescopes , as well as the thousands of VLT spectra measured with the VIMOS instrument allowed for estimation of the distance of the various structures , thereby enabling this 3 dimensional map to be made .
It shows that luminous matter concentrates along the densest regions of the dark matter and a network of filaments that intersect where clusters of galaxies are located .
Furthermore , the map covers close to half of the age of the Universe and makes it possible to monitor the evolution of the distribution of dark matter , as it becomes more and more structured over time .
" Mapping the distribution of dark matter in space and time is fundamental for understanding how the galaxies developed and grouped themselves over time .
The results obtained through the COSMOS survey seem to be in accordance with the standard theories of the formation of the large - scale structures of the Universe , " says Jean Paul Kneib , CNRS researcher at the Marseilles Laboratory of Astrophysics .
The COSMOS survey thus brings us a three - dimensional map of the dark matter in the Universe and will allow us for the first time to monitor the relationship between the distribution of dark matter and the formation and evolution of galaxies .
This type of mapping of the Universe by the weak gravitational lens effect is already orienting future space missions that are now already underway ...
We can thus imagine that in the decades to come the whole Universe could be mapped , in an even more detailed manner , perhaps making it possible to shed light on the existence and the nature of dark energy , the elusive force which is thought to be accelerating the expansion of the Universe .

This chart depicts the public acceptance of evolution theory in 34 countries in 2005 .
Adults were asked to respond to the statement : “ Human beings , as we know them , developed from earlier species of animals . ”
The percentage of respondents who believed this to be true is marked in blue ; those who believed it to be false , in red ; and those who were not sure , in yellow .
A study of several such surveys taken since 1985 has found that the United States ranks next to last in acceptance of evolution theory among nations polled .
Researchers point out that the number of Americans who are uncertain about the theory ’s validity has increased over the past 20 years .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
It 's the week before Thanksgiving , and Chris Kofinis , the never - at - a - loss - for - words communications director for Wake Up Wal - Mart , is going through his organization 's secret holiday campaign plan .
We 're in his drab , windowless office in downtown Washington , D.C. , surrounded by handmade posters , press clippings and assorted flip charts full of ideas and scheduling details .
" You know , I probably should n't be doing this , " he says as his cell phone rings .
" If this got out , it would screw everything up .
Wal - Mart would know too much . "
The PowerPoint presentation entitled " Hope for the Holidays " details how the 1 1/2 - year - old union - backed group plans to rattle Wal - Mart 's carefully crafted image precisely when Americans are frequenting the mega - retailer most .
It includes a ten - part timeline for attacking the company from mid-October through the end of the year .
The week before Christmas , for example , the group plans a mini- campaign titled " America , Pray for Wal - Mart to Change . "
It calls for reaching out to religious leaders and groups , targeted media buys and candlelight vigils in front of the stores , with families and children asking for health care .
It 's topped off by a national day of prayer .
" When you frame it as a family values and faith issue , almost all of Wal - Mart 's core customers pay attention , " Kofinis says .
Another week the group plans to frame its campaign as a women 's issue .
" That 's the whole idea behind what we do :
We try to come up with innovative and creative ways to reach out to as many different demographic groups as possible . "
Generate headlines , spin the news , trash your opponent .
If this sounds like a presidential campaign , you 're not too far off .
Oh , and just as in The Boys on the Bus , these political junkies take few vacations , get little weekend rest and dating - well , that 's for civilians .
In many ways , not much has changed since they were with the Howard Dean , Wesley Clark and John Kerry presidential campaigns .
Only this time they think they 're backing a winner .
Even better , their candidate does n't have to win - Wal - Mart ( Charts ) just has to lose .
" If we want to talk about what kind of America we want for our children , " says Kofinis , " we 've got to talk about what is the responsibility of companies like Wal - Mart . "
David vs. Goliath
Plenty of companies complain they get bad press .
But Kofinis and Paul Blank , the group 's campaign director , are part of what is quite possibly the most relentless public relations assault ever launched against a company .
Simply put , Wal - Mart cannot do anything right in the eyes of these groups .
When Wal - Mart lowers prescription drug costs , it " needlessly exaggerated " the scope of the plan .
New environmental policies ?
" A publicity stunt . "
Even CEO Lee Scott 's vacation raised " serious questions . "
Wake Up Wal - Mart and another union - backed group , Wal - Mart Watch , spend just a few million dollars a year in contrast to Wal - Mart 's $ 1.6 billion advertising budget .
But thanks to the explosion of news outlets and modern Internet campaigning , the opportunities to point out the retailer 's misdeeds - often through internally leaked documents - are limitless .
( Imagine if Standard Oil muckraker Ida Tarbell had had a blog . )
Kofinis and Blank are liberals - but say they are n't radicals out to destroy Wal - Mart .
Kofinis , 37 , who grew up outside Toronto and recently became an American citizen , was a political science professor at Cal State Northridge before he was drafted to help run General Clark 's campaign .
And Blank , a New Jersey native who began his political career at 12 as a volunteer for Senator Bill Bradley , graduated from Exeter and Duke , then went to work in politics , most recently as the political director for Howard Dean 's campaign .
It 's difficult to gauge what effect their efforts have had on Wal - Mart 's bottom line .
" Our customers see these attacks as part of a tired and failing campaign , " says Wal - Mart spokeswoman Sarah Clark .
" We have 127 million customers who visit our stores each week .
We think that in itself tells the whole story . "
That 's true - and those customers have saved billions .
Still , Wal - Mart 's stock is down 30 percent since 2000 .
Same - store sales growth has slowed to 1.5 percent in the third quarter , compared with 4.6 percent at Target ( Charts ) .
And opposition to stores in urban areas is as high as ever .
With all that going on , the PR offensive , which was spurred by a 2004 grocery workers strike in California that the unions blamed on Wal - Mart , certainly can't be helping .
The demands
But what does Wake Up Wal - Mart want , exactly ?
It depends on whom you ask .
Kofinis and Blank say their aim is to drum up enough public awareness about the company 's practices , so it 's forced to treat workers better , which will in turn make smaller companies follow suit .
( Target is much smaller than Wal - Mart and does n't sell nearly as many groceries , which explains why they are n't , well , a target . )
Wal - Mart " made $ 11.2 billion in profits last year , " says Kofinis .
" If they took even a few billion of that and used it to pay better wages and provide more affordable health care , they could change their public image overnight .
They would be a model employer . "
But ask the union leaders - the people who pay the bills - the same question , and additional motives emerge .
" Success would be if Wal - Mart would bring their working standards up to what we consider decent , " says Joseph Hansen , president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union , who founded Wake Up Wal - Mart .
" We just do n't think they are going to do that without a union . "
" The average Wal - Mart worker will have to work 1,000 years to make what Lee Scott made last year , " Kofinis bellows in front of 27 people holding small mechanical dials .
It 's a rainy Sunday evening in Bedford , N.H. , and Kofinis is " live - dialing " a focus group to pinpoint the messages that resonate most with voters .
He 's got a winner - the focus group attendees are twisting their knobs furiously , registering an 80 percent approval rating for his message , something most politicians would kill for .
Then Republican strategist Frank Luntz ( famous for helping Newt Gingrich forge his Contract With America ) takes a turn .
He 's been brought in to analyze the focus group , and when he tests classic Wal - Mart rebuttals , including how much the company saves consumers , he bombs , scoring a Dukakis - like 30 percent .
Labor issues
The guys are elated : they 'll use this research to help convince politicians on both sides of the aisle to make Wal - Mart an issue on the campaign trail .
Luntz 's takeaway : " Everyone in that room thinks Wal - Mart is a legitimate issue in ' 08 . "
That 's the whole idea , says the UFCW 's Hansen , a former meat cutter who took over the union in 2004 .
That year the UFCW barely survived the crippling grocery strike in California , which came about after Wal - Mart announced it was moving its grocery - carrying " Supercenters " into the state .
Traditional chains used that threat to play hardball with their unions , slashing benefits and precipitating the strike .
The UFCW had already spent more than a decade trying to unionize Wal - Mart with no success .
( When they signed up meat cutters in Texas , for example , the company centralized all meatpacking for that region ; when they organized one Canadian store , Wal - Mart simply shut it down . )
Now it was war .
In January 2005 , Hansen approached Howard Dean 's former political director , the then 29 - year - old Blank .
The question was simple : Could he replicate the populist groundswell that the Dean campaign embodied against a single corporation ?
" I thought about it for a little while , " Blank says .
" Then it hit me :
This was a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to change America through one company . "
Around the same time , Andy Stern , the chief of the Service Employees International Union , hatched a similar plan .
He called it Wal - Mart Watch and designed it more as a watchdog research organization than a take - it - to - the - streets campaign .
Run by Democratic operative Andrew Grossman , its $ 4.6 million budget comes primarily from Stern 's union , with help from groups like the Sierra Club .
Grassroots campaigning
Blank 's group , which receives all its money from the UFCW , modeled itself after the Dean and Clark campaigns .
One of the first things it did was to set up a snappy Web site where supporters could enter their zip code to find nearby Wal - Marts and then get involved in pickets , informational house parties or letter - writing blitzes .
With campaigns like " Love Mom , Not Wal - Mart , " and " All I Want for Christmas Is Health Care for Mommy , " the group says it has signed up more than 287,000 supporters .
Last summer they took their message on the road .
With an old bus painted red , white and blue , they held rallies , press conferences and town hall meetings in 35 cities in 35 days .
The eight staffers slept on the bus ; there were few showers and far too many meals at Denny's .
" By the middle of the tour , the bus was n't smelling so good , " says Kofinis .
Not that their office is deluxe either .
The quarters are cramped , the carpet is green , and workdays can go as late as midnight working the phones , lobbying Capitol Hill and talking with Wal - Mart employees .
Staffers have become experts at leaking Wal - Mart documents to the press .
Recently they exposed an unpublicized salary cap that was part of a much - publicized Wal - Mart pay raise .
Rival Wal - Mart Watch found the single most embarrassing document : a leaked memo from Wal - Mart 's VP of benefits that recommended , among other things , discouraging unhealthy people from working at Wal - Mart .
Political pressures
Lately several A - list politicians have spoken out for the cause .
Wake - Up Wal - Mart 's holiday - campaign kickoff conference call featured Senators John Edwards and Barack Obama .
" Wal - Mart is making enormous profits , and yet it has chosen to go with low wages and diminished benefits , " Obama told listeners .
Wal - Mart is n't the first American company to face such withering attacks .
Standard Oil 's dominance provoked widespread public outcry around the turn of the 20th century .
Henry Ford 's labor practices came under intense criticism in the late 1930s .
In recent years Nike ( Charts ) and Gap ( Charts ) faced scrutiny for what critics said were sweatshop conditions at its overseas factories .
Each company eventually yielded , says Nelson Lichtenstein , a labor historian at University of California at Santa Barbara and editor of " Wal - Mart : The Face of 21st - Century Capitalism . "
Standard
Oil fell to new antitrust laws .
Ford ( Charts ) unionized , and Nike and Gap opened their factories to inspection .
" If history is any guide , Wal - Mart will eventually have to do the same , " he says .
" No company can withstand this kind of criticism forever . "
Clark , Wal - Mart 's spokeswoman , says that although the company recently changed its environmental policies with the help of various activist groups , it does n't plan to meet with any union - backed groups .
" Wal - Mart creates tens of thousands of jobs every year , we offer associates health plans for as little as $ 23 a month , and we 're good stewards of the environment , " says Clark .
" Americans view Wal - Mart as a good neighbor , a good place to work , and a good place to shop . "
Still , a confidential 2004 report prepared by McKinsey & Co. for Wal - Mart , and made public by Wal - Mart Watch , found that 2 to 8 percent of Wal - Mart consumers surveyed have ceased shopping at the chain because of " negative press they have heard . "
And Wal - Mart has n't taken the attacks lying down .
Last year the company , which has historically had a tiny PR department , hired Edelman , one of the world 's largest public relations firms .
After setting up a " war room " in Bentonville , one of Edelman 's first projects was to help organize a pro-Wal - Mart grass - roots organization called Working Families for Wal - Mart .
But its leader , Andrew Young , the first African - American U.S. ambassador to the UN , was quickly forced to resign after making anti-Semitic and anti-Korean comments .
Then , in October , Wal - Mart Watch exposed another independent - looking site , Wal - Marting Across America , a travelogue by " Jim and Laura , " as being company - funded .
( Edelman referred all questions to Wal - Mart . )
With both sides locked in a standoff , will the activists ever get the retailer to make concessions ?
Live to see Wal - Mart workers unionized ?
Nobody knows .
But the longer Wal - Mart stonewalls , the more time the unions have to influence public opinion .
" I ca n't let it end until somehow Lee Scott and Joe Hansen figure out a way to end it , " says the UFCW 's Hansen .
" I do n't see that happening anytime soon . "
Kofinis agrees .
" Wal - Mart could easily change .
They just do n't want to , " he says .
" That 's what gives this campaign power . "
It 's also what keeps Kofinis 's phone ringing off the hook .
Back in his office , feet up on his desk , he 's taking call after call , his voice becoming louder with each successive point .
It 's CNN : " Do n't think I can do it today unless you send a camera crew over . "
The Associated Press : " Did those workers I sent you pan out ? "
But he has the best response for the Wall Street Journal , which wants a comment on Wal - Mart 's new high - powered head of corporate affairs and government relations , Leslie Dach : " Last time I checked , he would n't have a job if it were n't for our campaign . "
He stops , turns my way , and chuckles : " That 's pretty good , right ? "

Religious group calls off Wal - Mart boycott
Wal - Mart extends $ 4 generic drug program
I just came back from the demonstrations …
No , that 's a lie .
I 've been back almost an hour and a half now , and it took me this long to get myself together , shake myself out of the shock I am feeling , and actually sit down and write this .
Here is what happend .
Around 5:15 pm today I was in Talaat Harb square with my friend M. when I called Hosam and asked him his whereabouts .
He informed me that he is at 7 amadah cafe next to the AUC .
So I went there with M. and sat with him , while waiting for the people to gather up .
On the road over we counted about 40 state security cars and we saw the delpoyment of SS troops everywhere .
We joked about what awaits us during this demonstration and how if we get beat up we will just start beating up Hosam and pretend to be part of the plainclothed SS thugs , and how it's not a good sign that Rice is meeting up with Mubarak today and how the US does n't give a damn anymore what happens to us .
Slowly more people came and joined us , including M's friend H. , Bassem and gemyhood ( Mohamed Gamal ) and his girlfriend R. Bassem and Hosam started arguing back and forth over which strategy to use : Bassem in favor of small group infiltration , while Hosam for big group formation .
I could n't care less either way .
I just wanted to move .
And we finally did .
We got out on Tahrir square and were trying to figure out which is the best strategy to get to the square itself , which was surrounded by SS soldiers .
While walking you could n;t help noticing the redicilous amount of plainclothed SS agents just standing around and holding walkie - talkies .
Whenever someone would stop they would tell them they could n't stand where they were standing and that they had to move along .
While walking with the group , I got a phonecall from Alia , who was one street behind us with two more friends , one of them is Salma .
I met up with them and we started to walk together towards the bigger group which was now surrounded with police officers and plainclothed thugs .
When we tried to cross the street towards them the police would n;t let us , and then they did allow us to cross the street but not get on the otherside of the pavement , forcing us to go back and cross the street again .
I was holding M's hand from one side and Alia 's from the other , when I heard Salma say : " Fuck this " and started running across the street towards the square with the other girl , who pulled Alia with her .
Alia tried to pull me with them but M. held my hand and said " Do n't you leave us ! " so I had to let them go .
And right before they reached the square they were tackled by the police who swarmed on them from every direction .
Some of the guys from the bigger group went directly to their rescue and pandamonium broke out for about 2 minutes , all the whole the police officers were pushing us to move forward .
I could see the girls back in the bigger group , but the bigger group was n't moving because it was trapped .
And then I saw someone break free and run , and recognized him as Jimmyhood , and also saw 5 plainclothed police thugs run after him and hold him and started to pull him towards the Paddywagon .
One of his friends triued to come to his rescue and was grabbed as well and thrown in the same car with him , and then the car started moving taking them to an unknown destination .
That break , however , allowed the other demosntartors to break free and start walking towards Talaat Harb sqaure , while chanting Anti-Mubarak slogans .
As people were walking , you could see the police walking behind them , as well as you can see the police lining up on the sidewalk in order to entrap them .

When some of the protesters saw this , they went all hyper and tried to storm the line hoping to break it , only to fail .
The Police started encirceling them , so I grabbed M , H , and R. - who was pretty shook up after seeing Jimmy getting arrested - and we crossed the street to the other side , and a group of 10 people followed our lead .
The rest tried to go to the rescue of those who were held in the police net .
In a matter of seconds , I started seeing the police who were following the demonstrations start to encircle the protesters .
They then started to push the protesters together and beat them .
On top of the sound of the battle , you could hear distinct female screams .
Really loud ones .
Overpowering all others .
The average egyptian walking on the street just stood there , some of them took their cellphones out and started using their cameraphones to videotape what 's going on while joking about it .
I really hated them at that moment .
I was yelling the police to let us through , that there were women getting assaulted , and they just looked at me as if I was speaking kantonese .
They would n't even lift an eyebrow , as if they were not hearing the same screams we were hearing .
And then the Police started targeting us again and tried to push us away again , while we stood our ground and tried to see what was happening with the people on the other side .
We could see the police taking people one by one and throwing them into the big Paddywagon , while a group of them SS soldiers started walking towards us , identifying us as their next target .
They all formed a line , entwining their arms together and stood behind us for one second , then started pushing us .
R. started yelling at them and screaming at them , while H. was tryingt o calm her down and push her away .
I decided that the best course of action would be not to allow the police to actually touch the girls , so I stood between them and the girls , and using my body and my arms as a barrier to the constant shoving of the SS line , while urging the girls to move because I would n't want them to even get touched by any of those pieces of scum .
The girls moved , although each took a very different way of doing so : R. continued to yell at the police , while H. grabbed her and M. pulled on them both , and Alia was trying to reason with the officers behind us .
So you can imagine , this was n't exactly making the SS officers happy , so they started pushing the soldiers behind us in order to push us further away from the square .
When we finally reached the other side we saw the big Police Paddywagon leave and move .
I looked around me and noticed that besides the 10 people who joined me on the otehr side , I was surrounded by foreigners .
But all the egyptians were gone .
The Police , apparently , started selecting the egyptians from the big mob and threw them and only them into the paddywagon .
Anyone who looked foreign they let go .
This meant that Bassem and Hosam , alongside of Malek and Salma a group of other demonstraters were all arrested .
This also meant that I had to make some very unpleasant phonecalls , which I started doing .
I called Elijah , Hosam 's fiance , Alaa , Gharbeia .
Everybody .
And then I started paying attention to what 's going on around me .
Malek getting arrested .
Picture by Nasser Nouri
Surrounding me was a group of about 30 people , comprised of journalists , activists and tag - alongs and we did n't know what to do next .
Some people suggested we head towards the Tahrir square to see if anyone else was there .
Others suggested starting a sit-in in the middle of the street .
Me and Alia suggested we head towards the Press syndacite , where another demonstration was taking place .
Everyone agreed on going to the P ress syndicate , despite Alaa 's warning to me on the phone that getting inside the syndicate will be almost impossible .
We decided to give it a try anyway because , well , what else are we going to do ?
By the time we arrived at the press syndicate , a number of phone calls came through with information on what 's going on : 1 ) Hosam and Bassem did n't get arrested , both had managed to run away in time , with Hosam heading home and Bassem staying in downtown , 2 ) Ahmed Droubi got arrested with bthe demonstrators , which was strange because I did n't see him there at all and 3 )
The police had decided to release the girls , So Salma and Bassem and this other girl I do n't know jumped in a taxi and started following the Police truck holding all the demonstrators , and they managed to follow them all the way to the Mukhabarat ( egyptian Intelligence agency ) prison in the Madba7 neighbourhood , which did n't spell good news to them .
Anyway ..
When we arrived at the syndicate , there was about 200 protesters standing on the stairs and chnating , while approx .
800 SS soldiers surrounded them .
We managed to get through and join them and met up with other people that we thought got arrested but apprently managed to escape as well .
Alia
Then came to me and told me to come and help her get Sharqawi in here .
It seems that he could n't go through on his own or was afraid of getting arrested if he did .
Anyway , me and Alia got out of the protest and headed towards the Judges club where he told us he was waiting for us , but he was n;t there .
We tried calling his cell phone but it did n't pick up .
A minute later we saw a figure leave the area that the polcie was gatherd in and walk towards us .
It was Sharqawi and he seemed really disturbed .
He urged us to move faster and to get him inside the syndicate as fast as possible , so we hussled and we got him in .
Once we were in me and Alia noticed that he was n't acting like his usual self .
He was , for the lack of a better word , sullen .
He then teared a bit and then composed himself .
He would n't respond to any of our inquiries about what was wrong with him .
He just kept silent and sullen the whole time .
While standing there , I started noticing that the number of SS soldiers started increasing , which was n't a good sign , and that many of the foriegn journalists , now satisfied with the story they had , started leaving the area , which also was n't a good sign and then we noticed that the police was n;t letting their egyptian companions through , which defintely was n't a good sign .
I have seen this before .
We were being trapped here .
I yelled at the girls to get up , that it was time to go and get out of here , since they started not letting people go .
I asked Alia and a gorup of otehr people if they wanted to try and leave with us , but they said they were staying , which meant it was me and the 3 girls again .
I found a an american journalist friend of mine , Paul ( thanks by the way ) , who was heading out anyway and asked him if we could tag along .
I grabbed M , H and R and headed after him .
They passed him , but would n't let us go .
They told us only the press was allowed out and since we were n't press , we were n't allowed to leave .
We tried to reason with them , asking them at elast to let the girls go , since they will need to be home soon anyway .
The soldiers would n't budge .
Paul then managed to get a senior SS officer and asked him to come and help us get out .
The Officer asked for my hand to get me out and I told him that I would n;t leave without the girls and that he has to let them out first .
So he orderd the troops to let the girls pass and then let me pass .
And we were finally out .
We then took a cab and ehaded to M's car , which we took to drive R. home while promising her that if we hear anything about Jimmy we would let her know .
The poor girl just had her face platserd on TV cameras and digital pictures , was in a demonstration without telling her parents , which means if they find out they will crucify her , and yet the only thing she was worried about was Jimmy .
Whether he was ok , whether he would get tortured , whether they would release him soon or keep him for a while .
I honestly felt really bad for her .
On the way back to downtown I started receiving another set of phonecalls , which gave me some really disturbing news :
The police was still surrounding the Press syndicate , and since the foriegn press was almost gone , they were n't letting people out at all ( Alia managed to get out by a miracle ) .
Also , we found out that the police had attacked the Ghad Party offices , which is right on top of the greek club and staretd beating people up .
The whole thing seemd insane .
And it was n;t until we got home that we found out the entire story :
There was two women demonstrators who , escaping arrest and beatings , ran into the building and tried to hide inside the greek club .
The Police follwoed them both up there and dragged them out .
The Ghad Party people tried to intervene so the police started beating them up as well .
They then took the two women and started assaulting them ( some reports claim sexually ) inside the Ghad Party .
The loud sound of female screams I mentioned earlier ?
That was them .
The people inside of the greek club were not allowed to leave it or leave the building , and the Police crowded the enterance of the buidling to stop anybody from going in or out .
The people inside the greek club had to endure hearing the sound of the police beating up innocent people , the shrieks and screams of the men and women that the police assaulted , with no recourse or escape .
And as far as I know , this is still happening while I am writing those words .
And the worst part ?
There is nothing any of us could do to help .
Who do you go to when it 's your police that 's assaulting , kidnapping and raping ?
What can you do to stop them , when they are the law ?
What do you do when you need protection from those who swore to protect you ?
Where exactly do you go ?
Anyway , when I reached home 2 things happend :
My phone suddenly died , which has all my numbers .
It 's practically my lifeline , and until it gets fixed I am screwed .
The second thing was that as soon as I put them sim card into another phone , I got a phone call from sharqawi , who informed me that droubi called him from the police car and gave him some of the names of the people arrested with him .
Here they are : Adham el sabty , Omar Mustafa , Ahmed Droubi , Karim El Shaer , Sherif Ragab , Mohamed Abdel Kader , Ahmed Samir , Khaled Mustafa , Mohamed Gamal , Malek Moustafa , Omar el Hady and Medhat Shaker .
If you know of anyone else , please add their name to the comment section of this post .
Also , check out Hosam 's post for updates !
So , that 's what happend .
Now what ?
How do I end this ?
Do I tell you how depressed I am at the moment ?
How this signals the end of the dream of a democratic Egypt ?
No point there .
Anyone who has been following this blog knows that democracy is dying around here .
The truth of the matter is , I am really mad , really really fuckin mad , at the egyptian people , whom we risk our lives for .
I am mad at them for not caring , for accepting the roles of sheep , for not fighting for their rights and not doing anything while they see what we go through in order to fight for those same rights that they know they need and lack .
I am mad at them for just standing there while they could hear the screams of women getting beat up in front of them , and not even voice an objection .
I am mad at them for the looks of fear in their eyes while we passed by , as if they are afraid to be tainted by us or something .
But , between you and me , none of that is the main reason why I am really hating them right now .
The real reason is simple :
Where does the government , the corrupt ministers , the ruthless SS officers and their soldiers come from ?
Are n't they egyptians ?
Do n't they come from egyptian families and households ?
Are n't they born and raised here like the rest of us ?
Well , what does that exactly say about us ?
Whether we like it or not , the government is a reflection of the people .
So if the government is ruthless , corrupt and dictatorial , what does that say about the people ?
What does it say about the parents of the police officers that order their soldiers to beat up and sexually assault women ?
What does it say about the families of those corrupt government officials who sign away our future and that of our children for a bunch of dirty money ?
What does it say about a nation that produces such a government , and accepts it , even as it plunders the country and enslaves its people ?
Maybe the government is right : Maybe we do n't deserve Democracy .
Maybe we do n't deserve our rights .
Maybe we deserve everything that happens to us .
We , as people , seem to lack the sense of self - respect and dignity that makes the human being demand his / her right , so how do we expect the government to respect us or give us those rights ?
We clearly do n't deserve them .
We clearly deserve to have our rights stolen , our friends imprisoned , and our women assaulted .
Cause , otherwise , how would you explain how accepting we are of those things ?
Maybe we do n't deserve any better .
For the first time ever , I will go to sleep feeling utter hatred and disdain for my countrymen , while my heart weeps silently for my country !
I hope that none of you , ever , gets to experience that feeling !
Part One Nowadays , it ’s all too easy to take today ’s fast processors for granted .
At the risk of sounding like an old fogey , I get the impression that a lot of developers do just that .
This devil - may - care attitude is not , in my opinion , the result of complacency but far more likely due to inexperience or even – dare I say it ?
– ignorance .
Just as a good driver has a certain understanding of , and empathy with , the mass of rotating , reciprocating hardware a few feet in front of him , I reckon the best programmers have some ‘ feel ’ for the way in which their code is mapped onto machine code instructions ; an understanding of the demands they ’re making on the processor , if you will .
I ’ve felt this way for some time , but the point was recently hammered home while I was browsing around inside the internals of a certain Mac OS X utility – as one does .
The programmer in question wanted to use OpenGL effects in his application , and in order to do that , he needed to establish the capabilities of the installed OpenGL system .
In particular , the developer wanted to check for the presence of the GL_EXT_texture_rectangle extension which , as you probably know , indicates that borderless , 2D rectangular textures are supported .
The conventional way of doing this is to make the following call :
char * extensions = glGetString ( GL_EXTENSIONS ) ;
This will give you a plain - vanilla C string containing a list of all the available extensions .
Having got hold of this string , here ’s what our anonymous Cocoa developer did ; firstly , he used the NSString stringWithCString : method to convert the C string into an instance of NSString .
( This particular method is deprecated in Tiger , by the way , but let ’s not go into that ) .
Next , he used the componentsSeparated ByString : method to chop the string up into an array of its component parts – this relies on the fact that there ’s a space between each extension name .
Finally , he used the containsObject : method of the NSArray class to look for the string ‘ GL_EXT_texture_rectangle ’ .
OK – I ’m not disputing the fact that this code works , but to me , it seems a really roundabout way of doing things .
For starters , a more experienced Mac programmer would simply have used the rangeOfString : method to determine whether the wanted extension name was present ; this would have eliminated the need to chop the original string into a list of separate extension names .
Of course , we ’d still have to first use stringWithCString : to convert our original C string into an instance of NSString .
Surely , there ’s a better way ?
Cutting to the chase …
Sure there is .
As the title of this article points out , Objective - C is built on top of C , and the C runtime language has a perfectly good , tried and trusted runtime library routine for finding one string within another !
All of the above convoluted shenanigans can be replaced with this :
BOOL gotTexturedRects = strstr( glGetString ( GL_EXTENSIONS ) , " GL_EXT_texture_rectangle " ) != nil ;
I guarantee that the above statement will execute far more quickly than the aforementioned alternative .
Why ?
Because this code involves exactly two native subroutine calls while the Cocoa alternative makes an assortment of calls , both inside and outside the Cocoa frameworks , and of course each time you use a Cocoa message , the Objective - C dispatcher is invoked to figure out which actual routine to call .
To be clear : I ’m not knocking Cocoa or Objective - C here .
All I ’m saying is that a little familiarity with the underlying C runtime library can translate into big dividends in performance terms .
Determining the capabilities of the OpenGL system is something that you ’ll typically do once only , in the initialisation part of your program .
But looking for one string inside another is something that you might do tens of thousands of times inside a text crunching application .
Using strstr as I ’ve shown here , we cut right to the chase .
As a general rule , if you ’re working with an API which expects / returns C - style strings ( such as OpenGL ) then it ’s often much quicker to use a standard C library routine than it is to convert the string into an NSString class before doing the necessary .
For example , if some non-Cocoa API hands you a C string and you need the length of it , only a complete Cocoa - headed klutz would do this :
NSString * str = [ NSString stringWithCString : myCString encoding : [ NSString defaultCStringEncoding ] ] ; int len = [ str length ] ;
You might think I ’m exaggerating , but I have seen code that does this .
My friend , let me introduce you to strlen …
Again , do n’t get me wrong : NSString has lots of advantages when compared to a barefoot C string ; built in support for Unicode being a key benefit .
At the risk of making sweeping generalisations , Mac programmers tend to be far more oriented towards creating language - neutral , easily localisable applications than is the case on the Windows platform .
Part of the reason for this lies in the flexibility of NSString – hence the reference to encoding formats in the above code snippet .
But do n’t break out the Cocoa sledgehammer when you ’re working with C strings ; the runtime library will often have done the job by the time you ’ve created your first NSString instance .
Next time round , we ’ll be looking at other Cocoa programming issues from a runtime efficiency perspective , and I ’ll be looking at ways in which Cocoa applications can be structured more effectively .
I drove into New Haven on a recent morning with a burning question on my mind .
How did my daughter do against the chimpanzees ?
A month before , I had found a letter in the cubby of my daughter Charlotte at her preschool .
It was from a graduate student at Yale asking for volunteers for a psychological study .
The student , Derek Lyons , wanted to observe how 3 - and 4 - year - olds learn .
I was curious , so I got in touch .
Mr. Lyons explained how his study might shed light on human evolution .
His study would build on a paper published in the July issue of the journal Animal Cognition by Victoria Horner and Andrew Whiten , two psychologists at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland .
Dr. Horner and Dr. Whiten described the way they showed young chimps how to retrieve food from a box .
The box was painted black and had a door on one side and a bolt running across the top .
The food was hidden in a tube behind the door .
When they showed the chimpanzees how to retrieve the food , the researchers added some unnecessary steps .
Before they opened the door , they pulled back the bolt and tapped the top of the box with a stick .
Only after they had pushed the bolt back in place did they finally open the door and fish out the food .
Deal site BlackFriday .info yesterday removed the Best Buy " Black Friday " sales price list after the big box retailer threatened to deliver a DMCA takedown notice to Black Friday 's ISP .
In a brief posting , Black Friday said , " While we believe that sale prices are facts and not copyrightable , we do not want to risk having this website shut down due to a DMCA take down notice . "
In recent years , information on the post - Thanksgiving sales has become a highly prized commodity , with a number of sites featuring copies of major retailers ' ads .
Consumers looking for the best prices and wanting to streamline their shopping are responsible for the sites ' popularity .
Deal sites such as BlackFriday and Fat Wallet are a source of irritation to retailers at this time of year , although DMCA takedown notices tend to be the exception rather than the rule .
In November 2003 , Best Buy issued a takedown notices to FatWallet over a Black Friday ad posted on the site .
FatWallet responded by suing Best Buy for abuse of the DMCA .
Such lawsuits are permissible under the DMCA if a company knowingly misrepresents a DMCA notice .
FatWallet 's case was dismissed with the judge ruling that the bargain - hunting site had not suffered injury because of the takedown notice .
By issuing DMCA takedown notices , Best Buy is alleging that its sale prices are copyrighted information and that posting the information before it is publicly released constitutes copyright infringement .
While companies may be able to argue that disclosing sale prices weeks ahead of time can cause them harm , it does n't necessarily follow that a list of products and prices is copyrightable .
Best Buy and other retailers that churn out takedown notices are misusing the DMCA , but the larger problem is the law itself .
The powers granted by the DMCA are broad enough that it is tempting for companies to wield the law as a bludgeon against whomever is displeasing them .
Until the law is changed , companies will continue giving into the temptation to misapply it .

It 's supposed to say sweet things to little girls like , " You 're a wonderful friend , " but push its button the wrong way and the Little Mermaid Shimmering Lights Ariel doll may say something else -- " You 're a slut , " according to a California mother whose allegation came to light in a newspaper report .
The doll 's manufacturer , Mattel , does n't believe it 's possible , and a company spokeswoman said the complaint by Stephanie Herrera of San Jose , Calif . -- first reported in the San Jose Mercury News -- is the only one it 's heard of .
Normally , the doll says the phrases , " Your sparkles are so beautiful , " " Life is the bubbles " and " You 're a wonderful friend . "
It also hums a song without words .
Herrera said she discovered the fluke when her 3 - year - old daughter , Juliana , was pressing the button quickly so she could skip the phrases and get to the melody .
Instead of just moving to the song , Herrera said her daughter got the wrong message .
" I was in absolute shock , " said Herrera , " especially after my daughter repeated it . "
Mattel has asked Herrera to return the doll , and the company has offered her a voucher for a toy of equal value .
" We do n't believe that any of the product out on the market is affected , " said Mattel spokeswoman Sara Rosales .
" A lot of times this is something that 's very adult directed , " Rosales told ABC News .
" A child would never hear this , that 's not a part of their vocabulary . "
Rosales said she checked another Shimmering Lights Ariel doll and did n't hear anything unusual .
She said it was double - checked by engineers and designers who do n't believe such a snafu is possible .
Mattel currently has no plans to recall the toy , since the company has only received one complaint .
Ariel is a character from the Disney - produced film , " The Little Mermaid , " and Mattel has a licensing deal with Disney to produce the doll .
Disney is the parent company of ABC News .
Stephanie Oppenheim , who publishes the independent toy guide Oppenheim Toy Portfolio , told the Mercury News that she put Arial to the test .
After pushing the buttons on another Shimmering Lights Ariel doll , she said she heard the naughty word but had to listen really closely to get an earful .
Oppenheim said it could actually be good for business .
" Sometimes , this type of controversy makes a toy all the more desirable , " Oppenheim told the Mercury News .
" The more quirky toys tend to be more attractive to adult collectors . "
She advised parents to test the " try me " buttons on toys before making a purchase .
ABC News bought an Ariel doll , and after pressing the doll 's button several times quickly , some employees thought they heard the doll say , " You 're a slut " -- but only after listening very carefully .
They warned that they could have heard it based on the power of suggestion .
Others said they could hardly understand what the doll was saying when it was sped up , let alone hear the phrase .
Since the alleged mouthy mishap , Shimmering Lights Ariel is not a welcome playmate in the Herrera house .
Herrera has taken the beloved doll away from her daughter and given her a different Arial doll to play with .
Herrera said she bought similar Ariel dolls to sell on eBay , but scrapped her plans after the incident .

Like a child , the dog came with his own idiosyncrasies .
He will only sleep on the bed , on top of the covers , nuzzled as close to my face as he can get without actually performing a French kiss on me .
Lest you think this is a bad case of no discipline , I should tell you that hubby and I tried every means to break him of this habit including locking him in a separate bedroom for several nights .
The new door cost over $ 200 .
But I digress .
Five weeks ago we began remodeling our house .
Although the cost of the project is downright obnoxious , it was 20 years overdue AND it got me out of cooking Thanksgiving dinner for family , extended family and a lot of friends that I like more than family most of the time .
I was , however , assigned the task of preparing 124 of my famous yeast dinner rolls for a delayed celebration among friends this past weekend .
I am still cursing the electrician for getting the new oven hooked up so quickly .
It was the only appliance
In the whole house that worked , thus the assignment .
I made the decision to cook the rolls on Friday evening to reheat on Saturday morning .
Since the kitchen was freshly painted you can imagine the odor .
Not wanting the rolls to smell like Sherwin Williams latex paint # 586 , I put the rolls on baking sheets and set them in the living room to rise for 5 hours .
After 3 hours , hubby and I decided to go out to eat , returning in about an hour .
An hour later the rolls were ready to go in the oven .
It was 8:30 pm .
When I went to the living room to retrieve the pans , much to my shock one whole pan of 12 rolls was empty .
I called out to Kismet and my worst nightmare became a reality .
He literally wobbled over to me .
He looked like a combination of the Pillsbury dough boy and the Michelin Tire man wrapped up in fur .
He groaned when he walked .
I swear even his cheeks were bloated .
I ran to the phone and called our vet .
After a few seconds of uproarious laughter , he told me the dog would probably be OK , however , I needed to give him Pepto Bismol every 2 hours for the rest of the night .
God only knows why I thought a dog would like Pepto Bismol any more than kids do when they are sick .
Suffice to say that by the time we went to bed the dog was black , white and pink .
He was so bloated we had to lift him onto the bed for the night .
Naively thinking the dog would be all better by morning was very stupid on my part .
We arose at 7:30 and as we always do first thing ; took the dogs out to relieve themselves .
Well , Kismet was as drunk as a sailor on his first leave .
He was running into walls , falling flat on his butt and most of the time when he was walking his front half was going one direction and the other half was either dragging the floor or headed 90 degrees in another direction .
He could n't lift his leg to pee , so he would just walk and pee at the same time .
When he ran down the small incline in our backyard he could n't stop himself and nearly ended up running into the fence .
His pupils were dilated and he was as dizzy as a loon .
I endured another few seconds of laughter from the vet ( second call within 12 hours ) before he explained that the yeast had fermented in his belly and that he was indeed drunk .
He assured me that , not unlike most binges we humans go through , it would wear off after about 4 or 5 hours and to keep giving him Pepto Bismol .
Afraid to leave him by himself in the house , hubby and I loaded him up andtook him with us to our friend 's house .
A 10 to 15 minute drive .
Rolls firmly secured in the car ( 124 less 12 ) and drunk dog leaning from the back seat onto the console of the car between hubby and I , we took off .
Now I know you probably do n't believe that dogs burp , but believe me when I say that after eating a tray of risen unbaked yeast rolls , DOGS WILL BURP .
These burps were pure Old Charter .
They would have matched or beat any smell in a drunk tank at the police station .
But that 's not the worst of it .
Now he was beginning to fart and they smelled like baked rolls .
God strike me dead if I am not telling the truth !
We endured this for the entire trip , thankful she did n't live any further away than she did .
Once Kismet was firmly placed in my friend 's garage with the door locked , we finally sat down to enjoy our celebration with friends .
The dog was the topic of conversation all morning long and everyone made trips to the garage to witness my drunk dog , each returning with a tale of Kismet 's latest endeavor to walk without running into something .
Of course , as the old adage goes , " what goes in must come out , " and Kismet was no exception .
Granted if it had been me that had eaten 12 risen , unbaked yeast rolls , you might as well have put a concrete block up my behind , but alas a dog 's digestive system is quite different from yours or mine .
I discovered this was a mixed blessing when we prepared to leave my friend 's house .
Having discovered his " packages " on the garage floor , we loaded him up in the car so we could hose down the floor .
This was another naive decision on our part .
The blast of water from the hose hit the poop on the floor , and the poop on the floor withstood the blast from the hose .
It was like Portland cement beginning to set up and cure .
We finally tried to remove it with a shovel .
I ( obviously no one else was going to offer their services ) had to get on my hands and knees with a coarse brush to get the remnants off of the floor .
And as if this was n't degrading enough , the dog in his drunken state had walked through the poop and left paw prints all over the garage floor that had to be brushed too .
Well , by this time the dog was sobering up nicely so we took him home and dropped him off before we left for our second celebration at another friend 's house .
I am happy to report that as of today ( Monday ) the dog is back to normal both in size and temperament .
He has had a bath and is no longer tricolor .
None the worse for wear I presume .
I am also happy to report that just this evening I found 2 risen unbaked yeast rolls hidden inside my closet door .
It appears he must have come to his senses after eating 10 of them but decided hiding 2 of them for later would not be a bad idea .
Now , I 'm doing research on the computer as to how to clean unbaked dough from the carpet , and how was your day ?
There 's something about black holes that draws in scientists and the rest of us terrestrial dwellers , besides of course their tremendous gravity .
It could be because nothing has yet escaped one to tell us what 's in that shadowy abyss .
Or that no one has gotten close enough to peek inside these cosmic wells .
In an interview with SPACE.com , astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson , the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History , discusses the mysteries surrounding these exotic entities and the reason he chose to name his new book , " Death by Black Hole and other Cosmic Quandaries . "
Video : All About Black Holes
SPACE.com :
What is a black hole ?
Neil deGrasse Tyson : A black hole is a region of space where so much matter is crammed into it that the gravity is so high that not even light can escape it .
SPACE.com :
Is that why we call it a black hole ?
NdT : If light can't come out , then it 's black .
And light is the fastest thing we know , so if you fall in and you can't travel faster than light , that 's it , you 're stuck .
So it 's black and it's a hole , so we call it a black hole .
SPACE.com : How do they form ?
NdT : There are two broad categories of black holes .
One of them is the monstrous black holes that we find in the centers of galaxies .
Those could be up to a million times the mass of the Sun , and we do n't completely understand how they form .
But all of best data tell us that we got one in the middle of every galaxy .
Then there 's a much smaller kind , in some ways a more dangerous kind , that is the end product of the life of a star .
And those could be in your way as you journey across the galaxy .
SPACE.com :
Is that why they are more dangerous ?
NdT : Yeah , exactly because you can sort of accidentally stumble on it .
The ones that we know about are rendered visible because they happen to be next to another star where they orbit each other in space and that other star in many of these cases is losing its outer gaseous material .
In a way it 's getting flayed by the gravity of the black hole .
And as the gas spirals down , kind of like water down a toilet bowl , or when you pull the drain on any body of water , you see the water begin to circle and as it goes down the hole , the gas from the nearby star does that too .
As it spirals down , it begins to glow just before it 's lost forever in the black hole .
So we see glowing gas that has been removed from nearby stars so that 's kind of like the smoking gun that there 's a black hole there .
All the ones we know about that are scattered around the galaxy are made visible to us by this process .
SPACE.com :
What varieties of black holes are there ?
NdT : There are different ways to split them up .
I do n't make a big deal of that in the book .
There are black holes that spin and black holes that do n't spin at all .
The two broadest categories are simply the black holes that come from the death of a star and then the kind that you find in the centers of galaxies .
That 's the broadest concept that we need to know .
SPACE.com :
What happens if you jump into one ?
NdT : If you 're the one who took this one way trip , as you descend down towards its center you begin to feel the strength of gravity increase at your feet compared with the gravity at your head .
SPACE.com :
Will you feel gravity significantly less at your head ?
NdT : Yeah , what happens is that the difference in gravity becomes so great that your body initially stretches a little bit .
There 's nothing wrong with that sensation , which is what you do every morning when you wake up from bed , get out of bed .
But the stretching sensation is unrelenting .
And it reaches a point where the strength of the difference in gravity becomes greater than the strength of the bonds or the molecules that hole your flesh together .
And the moment that happens , that 's it , that 's kind of the end of you .
You snap into two pieces .
It 's likely to happen at your midsection , at the base of your spine .
Then those two pieces , they 'll begin to feel the same effect as you continue to descend towards the center of the black hole .
And they then snap into two pieces and this continues on down .
You go from one to two , to four to eight as you approach the center of the black hole .
SPACE.com :
So you 're going to turn into infinite pieces ?
NdT : Not only that .
If you can imagine that , it 's worse than that because the very fabric of space - which we learned from Einstein is curved due to gravity - in the vicinity of a black hole is like a funnel and so in fact as you fall toward a black hole , you 're being funneled through the fabric of space .
So you 're not only being stretched , you 're being extruded like toothpaste through a tube .
SPACE.com :
Do your pieces come out the other end ?
NdT : That was the science fiction writer 's dream - that you fall in one side and come out the other side .
Not until recently , a couple of years ago , Stephen Hawking demonstrated that all the information that falls into a black hole is recoverable information .
So in other words , the black hole does n't lead into someplace else where things exit .
In this case , the best way to think of information is you 're composed of a number of electrons , protons , neutrons , quarks and such .
There 's an inventory of your particle composition .
Let 's just call that information for you .
Well it turns out , that if you fall in , all that information remains there inside the black hole , and Hawking was able to demonstrate this mathematically .
SPACE.com : How exactly did he demonstrate this ?
NdT : People had suggested that once you fall into a black hole , you basically leave this universe and so all bets are off .
You 're done .
But what we 've known since the 1970s is that there 's such a thing as a Hawking radiation , and this is a kind of an interesting , spooky phenomenon .
You may remember the equation E=mc2 , which we all learn in elementary school even before we know what it does , but it 's the recipe to exchange a quantity of matter with a quantity of energy and back again .
We do n't have daily experience with this equation because things that happen in the life of a human , the conditions of your environment are not such that E= mc2 gets revealed in any measurable way .
But if you go to centers of stars , if you go to the big bang , if you go to the very strong gravity field of a black hole , the conditions are just fine for that and so what happens is that the gravity field of a black hole is so intense that particles can pop into existence from the energy of that field .
Again this is according to E= mc2 .
Well this is called Hawking radiation , and this was a profound result because it actually said that black holes can evaporate by this method , that they 're not completely black .
You can actually escape a black hole , but it 's kind of like cheating .
The particle is n't rising up from the center and crossing the black zone and coming into our universe .
The way it 's happening is the energy field created by the gravity of the black hole and that gravity is created by the matter it 's eaten throughout its life .
The field produces a particle .
And every time the field produces a particle , the black hole weighs less .
That 's been known since the 1970s , so a recent result said that if you take the inventory of the particles that issue force from the gravity field and compare it with everything that was eaten throughout the life of a black hole , that it will match one for one .
So somehow the gravity field has a memory , has some kind of an understanding has access to the information that we thought was gone forever .
And I find that remarkable .
But it also said that you can't just go somewhere else in the universe , so it kind of closed the creativity door for science fiction writers .
SPACE.com :
How will researchers study black holes in the future and what kind of instruments will give us more information ?
NdT : Black holes are such an exotic expression of gravity that right now there are gravity detectors that are being built to try and detect when things happen in the vicinity of a black hole such as if a black hole eats a star or if two black holes collide with each other .
One way to observe that is what the material is doing in the vicinity of a black hole :
Is it giving off light ?
Do we have a telescope that can detect the light ?
But it 's not only light that 's emanating from it ; it 's sort of gravity waves .
Einstein predicted that there should be such a thing as gravity waves that would reveal themselves under exotic gravitational events such as the collision of black holes .
So you have this gravity telescope - this is just as good a way to describe it - looking for gravity waves for just these kinds of signatures .
Because of the phenomenon that goes on in the vicinity of black holes you need telescopes that are particularly tuned to that kind of phenomenon .
That phenomenon gives off ultra violet light , x-rays and even gamma rays , so you need a telescope that 's honed for those parts of the spectrum .
There 's an accretion disk that will circulate in the vicinity of a black hole before it descends out of you forever .
And there 's a whole cottage of industry of astrophysicists who worry about the nature of that accretion disk what it 's made of , how it works , how thick it is .
How does the energy get out ?
What 's at the center ?
What 's at the source of energy ?
SPACE.com :
In the book you say that death and destruction is the business of black holes .
NdT : If you bring anything near them that 's what they do , but if you leave them alone they kind of quietly minding their own business .
SPACE.com :
Do you think we live inside of a black hole ?
NdT : No .
There 's sort of a philosophical idea that the entire universe is a black hole but on that level it 's more semantics than scientific .
SPACE.com :
What 's the temperature like inside a black hole ?
NdT : Who knows ?
Nobody knows .
We presume it could be anything but we otherwise do n't know .
It 's not a measurable thing because when you measure temperature , you 're measuring the vibrations of molecules that are in touch with your thermometer .
And so to get in there , you have to stick the thermometer through and then never come back out again .
It 'd be a one - way experiment .
You 'll know , but you wo n't be able to tell anybody about it .
SPACE.com :
You call you 're book " Death by Black Hole , " yet it 's a collection of essays only one of which is about black holes .
What prompted you to choose that chapter 's title as the book title ?
NdT : Well , that 's the importance of the subtitle , " Death by Black Hole : And Other Cosmic Quandaries . "
And so the " Death by Black Hole " essay is in a section that is all the ways the universe turns bad .
One comment about the essays .
They are really designed for you to curl up on in front of the fireplace or in front of your favorite lamp or your favorite desk chair , reading chair , and just drink in the universe .
My hope is that the reader has become so enchanted by the universe that they want to keep learning more .
So many people think of the universe as this other worldly thing , that it does not connect back to them in any kind of way that 's interesting , but that 's a lot of energy and effort demonstrating connection .
SPACE.com :
But somehow you found that essay and the idea of black holes important enough to make it the book title .
NdT : Not really important , but it was just kind of a fun title .
I mean , you can't not put that as the title of the book .
I could have said , oh it's 10 years of essays from my " Natural History " magazine , but that 's not as fun .
I did make sure that among the 10 years of essays that I had to choose from , these represent quandaries that had to be resolved , either historically or today .
If you look through you 'll see each essay is addressing some challenge of understanding or of execution .
SPACE.com :
Do you think we will ever directly " see " black holes ?
NdT : There 's no obvious way to see them directly .
But if they do n't otherwise have something feeding them material , one way to know that they 're there is how they distort the path of light from objects behind .
It 's almost as though you take someone who has very poor eyesight , punch out the lens of their eyeglasses and then slide it across your field of view and you 'll see that things will look very different through the thick glass than they do from outside the thick glass .
That distortion is simply what the glass is doing to the light that 's trying to pass through .
And so with a black hole , it will also distort the light from behind it , that 's trying to pass through , and so if you 're careful you might be able to detect one of these headed your way simply by the distortions of the background galaxy .
SPACE.com :
What do you think is the biggest mystery surrounding black holes ?
NdT : I think the biggest uncertainty is our current laws of physics that say that the material that became the black hole continues to collapse to a point that is infinitesimally small in the center .
No matter how large it started out , there 's no known laws of physics that would resist the strength of that gravity to collapse .
And to say that it 's infinitesimally small would then mean that it 's got infinite density .
You put any amount of matter in a small volume , it gets more and more dense .
I want to know what 's happening at the center of the black hole .
There 's a word for it , it 's called the singularity .
That remains a mystery , and string theorists , they are kind of in business to solve that .
SPACE.com :
Why do you think this knowledge of black holes is important in the grand scheme of things ?
NdT : Well , there 's two ways to answer that .
How does it help the person on the street ?
Well , it does n't .
It 's that simple .
It does n't .
It does n't help you find food if you 're looking for food .
It does n't help pay the rent if you can't pay the rent .
However , it does give you something else to think about in your day 's routine .
It does allow you to look up at night and recognize that we 're part of this larger cosmos .
And these are thoughts that are enriching for a culture .
There are cultures that do not have traditions of exploration .
If you visit them you 'll know it immediately , because no one is thinking about the future , everyone is thinking about just that moment .
No one is planning for a new way to live as technology transforms their lives , and you realized how impoverished they are for not having those thoughts .
And so I feel fortunate that I live in a country that on some level values exploration .
Pacific Islanders become first official climate refugees Rising seas and frequent flooding have forced a small community in the Pacific island chain of Vanuatu to leave their homes and become one of the first examples of formal climate change refugees .
Taito Nakalevu , climate change adaptation officer with the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme ( SPREP ) which carried out the work with funding from the Canadian government , said the villagers were moved to grounds 600 metres from the coast and 15 metres above sea level .
" We are seeing king tides across the region flooding islands .
These are normal events , but it is the frequency that is abnormal and a threat to livelihoods .
People are being forced to build sea walls and other defences not just to defend their homes , but to defend agricultural land , " he said .
Over recent years rates of flooding have increased , triggering a variety of problems including increased malaria and skin diseases among children as a result of more standing water for mosquitoes to breed in .
Erosion rates around the village had also accelerated to between two and three metres a year and seas frequently breached the one metre high coral reef which acted as the only line of defence for the island .
The main problem for relocation had been fresh water supplies , as the coastal strip had fresh water springs at low tides .
However , under the project water tanks , able to harvest rain water , have been supplied and installed in the interior .
The six tanks are able to hold 6,000 litres each , giving a total freshwater supply of 36,000 litres .
Rainwater harvesting mechanisms have also been installed on the roofs of buildings feeding into the tanks .
Details of the scheme which was completed at the end of August this year were unveiled at a meeting organised by the UNEP 's polar centre in Norway this week .
Klaus Toepfor , UNEP 's Executive Director , said : " The peoples of the Arctic and the small islands of this world face many of the same threats as a result of climbing global temperatures , the most acute of which is the devastation of their entire ways of life . "
" The melting and receding of sea ice and the rising of sea levels , storm surges and the like are the first manifestations of big changes underway which will eventually touch everyone on the planet .
The plight of these vulnerable peoples should be a clear signal to governments meeting here in Montreal that we must hurry up if we are to avert a climate - led catastrophe for current and future generations , " he added .
Other vulnerable areas include mountain regions where the melting glaciers are creating huge lakes , whose mud , stone and soil banks could burst sending huge quantities of water down gulleys and valleys .
This threat is particularly acute in the Himalayas where studies by UNEP in collaboration with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ( ICIMOD ) have found 50 glacial lakes of concern to Nepal and Bhutan .
UNEP is seeking further funding for this initiative through the Global Environment Fund to help pin point more newly formed glacial lakes at risk of triggering floods and to develop early warning systems for such events .
" At least in the case of this community on Tegua , " Mr Nakalevu said , " we know that for the next 50 years , the community of Lirak will be safe from floods , tsunamis and storm surges .

CARACAS , Venezuela , Feb. 16 — Faced with an accelerating inflation rate and shortages of basic foods like beef , chicken and milk , President Hugo Chávez has threatened to jail grocery store owners and nationalize their businesses if they violate the country 's expanding price controls .
Venezuela 's collectivist dictator Hugo Chávez is surprised by the fact that there are shortages in Venezuela .
Despite the fact that the science of economics has been explaining it for over two hundred years , he did n't know that inflation of the money supply serves to make prices rise .
Again , despite the centuries - long teachings of economics , he did n't know that when the rise in prices is prohibited , the effect of inflation is to increase the quantities of goods that people want to buy , but not the quantities available for sale , and thus results in precisely the situation that is described as a shortage , i.e. , people attempting to buy more of a good than is available for sale .
Chávez does n't know , and probably does n't want to know , that if he wants to end the shortages , all he has to do is abolish the price controls .
The rise in prices will serve to reduce the quantities of the various goods demanded to a point within the limit of the supplies available .
He does n't know and probably does n't want to know that if he then wants the rise in prices to stop , all he need do is stop the inflation of the Venezuelan money supply .
Finally , Chávez does n't know , and undoubtedly does n't want to know , that if he would then want prices actually to fall , and for goods to become more and more affordable by more and more of his countrymen , what he would need to do is make a 180 - degree turn in the rest of his policies .
What this means is that he would have to replace his policy of socialization / nationalization with privatization , and his policy of ever increasing regulation and controls with economic freedom .
These are the polices that would provide the incentives and opportunity to rapidly increase production and thus make goods more and more abundant and thus lower - and - lower - priced and ever more affordable .
But all of this is way too much to expect .
Because this is , after all , the same Hugo Chávez who apparently slept through the collapse of the Soviet Union and of socialism almost everywhere in the world but Cuba and North Korea , where it 's still maintained by dictatorship in the face of starvation .
As such , he 's a man who gives new meaning to the expression " out of it " — he's so far out of it , so incredibly ignorant , that one may wonder what century he's in and what planet he 's on .
What stops the antics of this collectivist throwback from being laughable is the fact that people are suffering from them and soon will probably suffer a lot more .
Large numbers of Venezuelans may even be killed before this buffoon leaves office .

Amazon Mechanical Turk ( MTurk ) is a crowdsourcing marketplace that makes it easier for individuals and businesses to outsource their processes and jobs to a distributed workforce who can perform these tasks virtually .
This could include anything from conducting simple data validation and research to more subjective tasks like survey participation , content moderation , and more .
MTurk enables companies to harness the collective intelligence , skills , and insights from a global workforce to streamline business processes , augment data collection and analysis , and accelerate machine learning development .
While technology continues to improve , there are still many things that human beings can do much more effectively than computers , such as moderating content , performing data deduplication , or research .
Traditionally , tasks like this have been accomplished by hiring a large temporary workforce , which is time consuming , expensive and difficult to scale , or have gone undone .
Crowdsourcing is a good way to break down a manual , time - consuming project into smaller , more manageable tasks to be completed by distributed workers over the Internet ( also known as ‘ microtasks ’ ) .

Brandeis Defunded by Rich Likudniks
Super - wealthy donors have retaliated against Brandeis University for inviting former president Jimmy Carter to speak on campus in connection with his book on Israeli Apartheid in the West Bank .
They said they will withold further donations to the school .
The president of Brandeis , Jehuda Reinharz , once commented on Middle East Centers at major American universities , saying , “ My problem is not the anti-Zionism or even that many of them are anti-American , but that they are third - rate . ”
Why exactly should he judge their scholarship by whether or not they are Zionists ?
Does everyone have to be a Zionist ?
As for the Red - baiting and vague , general put - down of the works of other academics , it is too despicable for words .
Reinharz notoriously thought well of the “ scholarship ” of Joan Peters , whose “ From Time Immemorial ” was dismissed by Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath as a forgery .
So I have to say it is delicious that Reinharz himself is now having the economic plug pulled on him by rich old bullies who think , by virtue of his invitation to Jimmy Carter , that he is anti-Zionist , anti-American and third rate .
Carter ’s book , by the way , is mostly just Christian Zionism .
It ignores 1400 years of Muslim history in Palestine and Jerusalem , accepts Peters ’s false thesis of significant in -migration of Arabs in the interwar period , and only dares raise some timid protests about the execrable treatment of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories by Israeli occupiers and colonists .
If even Carter ca n’t protest even this much without causing a whole university to be defunded , then there is something radically wrong with higher education in the United States .
And what is wrong with it has nothing to do with the ( quite high ) standard of scholarship in Middle Eastern studies .
It has to do with radical intolerance of any views that depart from a rightwing Zionist orthodoxy , and a willingness by upholders of that orthodoxy to deploy big money to punish anyone or any institution that departs from it .
By the way , I have several friends on the Brandeis faculty , and their academic scholarship is first - rate .
I hope they can go on enlightening us .
Scholarship , pace Reinharz , is not a zero sum game .
We are all enriched by the work of good scholars everywhere .
There are many benefits of disc harrows that we commonly know of , but sometime the extra usage of this can be harmful for your land and soil .
Farmer should consider it no doubt but they should get some ideas when they are changing the system .

This is just weird , not to mention sad and infuriating .
An Australian vet , Jilie Tilbrook , has been accused of starving her horses , although she blames the ongoing Aussie drought for the horses ’ condition .
Apparently she was trying to breed for the brindle pattern using progeny of the unusual Thoroughbred stallion Catch A Bird .
Although she will likely lose her vet credentials and may be facing jail time , her main worry is that the horses will be dispersed to rescue homes and the breeding program lost .

( Aside : what ’s weird genetically is that Catch A Bird ’s progeny look like true roans [ scroll down –not all the horses on that page are his , btw ] , a gene heretofore undetected in Thoroughbreds , and some have odd coat textures … )

A pundit , of course , is someone who others look to when they want opinions .
Here 's how to become one in four easy steps .
Post constantly .
Preferably daily .
Preferably put every inane little thought to come out of your head on a weblog , so the whole world can see you post constantly .
The first step to having a following is to reliably offer an opinion .
Always say the same things .
It does n't particularly matter if the things you say are right , or even if they make sense .
What 's important is that they sound good , and that they 're always the same .
Followers do n't want leaders saying confusing or ambiguous things .
Include what a great guru / authority / visionary / leader you are as part of your message .
Do n't worry if you are n't actually one , the important thing is that people think you are .
Arrange pre-packaged stories for journalists to print .
Journalists rarely have the resources to research a story properly , so if you give them a story they can just reword a bit and print , they 'll do that .
Do n't forget to include how great you are as an important point in the story .
RedHat 9
Since the free download of RedHat 9 wo n't be available for a week after it becomes available to subscribers , this is a great opportunity to demonstrate BitTorrent .

Travelling
I 'm going to be in Amsterdam from April 27th throug May 3rd , and New York City from May 18th till about June 1st .
I 'd like to meet some of the local open source hackers while I 'm there .
Anybody who would like to meet up mail me .
Bayesian filtering
I 'd like to remind everyone that I already posted about Bayesian filtering , and gave some ways of fixing some of Graham 's code 's deficiencies .
Highlight include
Whether a word occurs in a message should be yes or no , multiple occurences should be ignored .
Graham 's code does something very funky with multiple occurences which can cause lots of problems .
Everything should be changed to log scale so scores are simply added together .
This makes everything much clearer .
In particular , it makes it obvious that you might as well assume a default probability of spam of 1/2 , since it just trades off with the cutoff threshold .
It shows how thoroughly keeping things as probabilities obfuscates the process that many people , including Graham , did n't realize this .
Adding up the 16 most extreme scores in either the positive or negative direction is very crude .
For long messages it winds up throwing out all subtle details of exact values and just doing a vote count of the top 16 as to whether they 're positive or negative .
A much better approach is to add up the top 8 and bottom 8 .
Bruce Schneier and Joel Spolsky have recently complained about very long , easy to flag as non-spam messages of theirs getting rejected , and this is probably the cause and simplest fix .
Graham did n't specify what the behavior should be when you have 16 words which say 100 % spam and 16 words which say 100 % not spam , although it does n't really matter , because the top and bottom approach is clearly better .
I hope I do n't sound overly critical of Graham here .
I think his approach is a great one .
But it is a first version , and can be dramatically improved .
I wish someone had a backtracing setup for spam filtering algorithms , so we could get some real data about false positive and false negative values , instead of just having to guess .
Partial Busy - work Functions
ciphergoth :
There are a few other criteria :
The whole puzzle should require 2 k time to solve
If you have two nodes which are n't at opposite ends of the arc , then you still have to spend k time to solve the whole puzzle
Quick verification is n't a criterion I 'm looking for , although that would be an interesting add - on .
I 'm thinking about this because it 's related to circuit complexity , not because I 'm looking for an especially practical crypto primitive .
The two cases with two nodes are easy .
If the nodes are connected by an arc , then the puzzle is to compute the root of a binary hash tree , and each of the partial work functions is one of the two things pointed by the root .
For the disconnected case , the puzzle is to compute the output of a hash chain , and the two values are both the value of the halfway point of the chain .
For three nodes , I have n't figured out a solution to the case where all three nodes are connected and the case where only a single pair of nodes is connected .
Twisty Puzzles
I figured out some big improvements to my pentultimate design .
Possibly even more interesting than having a working pentultimate is the internal pieces which move at half the rate of the external pieces .
My basic ideas can be used in a much more robust design for an extension of the 2x2x2 rubik 's cube in which the outside is transparent and internally there are a bunch of extra pieces which move at half the rate of the outer ones .
This would be a very interesting and difficult new puzzle , and my design for it is extremely robust .
Now I just have to learn how to make precision plastic parts .
Good thing I do n't have lots of other projects to work on .
The Twisty Forum is great .
Certs against Spam
I 've given some more thought to stopping spam , and have come up with the following approach , which is still a bit sketchy but seems to be on the right track .
When receiving a piece of mail , determine if you 're willing to accept mail from the sender by the following process :
Determine each peer 's degree of spammerness .
This can be done using a variant of the random walk method , which is used to calculate advogato 's diary ratings .
Back propogate spammerness .
Oh , you wanted to know how to do that ?
For each spammer , calculate max flow from you to that spammer .
In the flow diagram , try to even out the flow as much as possible , so if there 's a possibility of offloading flow through one peer to other peers each of which are currently taking on less flow , do so .
Calculate this for every spammer , then calculate each peer 's degree of spammerness by adding up the flow through them for each spammer .
Throw out all peers whose degrees of spammerness is above some threshold .
If there 's a path from you along certification edges over remaining peers to the sender of the mail being evaluated , accept it .
Otherwise reject it .
The real innovation here is the second step , which does back propogation .
It ensures that sending spam from fake certified identities is just as damaging as sending spam from the directly compromised identities .
The database for this could be easily populated using a Friendster - style interface .
Unfortunately , to be maximally useful this database has to be global , meaning it 's huge , and the steps involved in evaluating it look to be at least quadratic .
Thankfully moore 's law will make this much more manageable in due time , although the database will still have to be widely replicated in order to distribute computational load .
In case you wondered what one could ever do with vastly greater than videophone bandwidth , it turns out you can utilize it nicely propogating global databases .
An interesting graph problem
Given a graph , and a specification of a ' red ' node and a ' blue ' node , which wish to know if it 's possible to remove k nodes , not including blue and red , so there 's no longer a path from blue to red along node edges over remaining nodes .
Is this problem NP - complete ?
Architecture
An architecture is a set of libraries which are so poorly encapsulated that if you want to use one of them you have to use all of them .
How to get Police attention
Round like a shot
Going to be the other night , I noticed people in my shed stealing things .
I phoned the police but was told no one was in the area to help .
They said they would send someone as soon as possible .
I hung up .
A minute later I rang again .
" Hello , " I said , I called you a minute ago because there were people in my shed .
You do n't have to hurry now , because I 've shot them . "
Within minutes there were half a dozen police cars in the area , plus helicopters and an armed response unit .
They caught the burglars red-handed .
One of the officers said : " I thought you said you 'd shot them . "
To which I replied : " I thought you said there was no one available . "

Mosques outside London were also attacked after the bombings
There were 269 religious hate crimes in the three weeks after 7 July , compared with 40 in the same period of 2004 .
Most were verbal abuse and minor assaults , but damage to mosques and property with a great " emotional impact " also occurred , police said .
Met Police Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur said he had never seen so much anger among young Muslims .
It [ religious hate crimes ] can lead to these communities completely retreating
Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur
Communities were particularly frustrated by the increased use of stop - and - search and the new " shoot - to - kill to protect " policy of dealing with suicide bombers , he said .
" There is no doubt that incidents impacting on the Muslim community have increased . "
However , Mr Ghaffur also pointed out that the rise was partly due to the fact that faith hate crimes were now recorded separately from other racial incidents .
And he warned : " It can lead to these communities completely retreating and not engaging at a time when we want their engagement and support . "
Mr Ghaffur revealed that in the first three days after suicide bombers killed 52 people and injured 700 more , there were 68 " faith hate " crimes in London alone .
Racial profiling
A spokesman for the Muslim Safety Forum , an umbrella group which works closely with the police , said the figures reflected the increase in calls to their members about abuse and attacks since the London bombings .
" It 's something we 've been saying for a few weeks now but it 's good to see senior police managers like Tariq Ghaffur have got up and actually said it , " spokesman Tahir Butt said .
" Although police are talking about a zero tolerance policy the test is how effective that is at ground level when you go in and report a crime , " Mr Butt added .
But chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority Len Duvall said that although any hate crime was not to be tolerated , many incidents previously defined as race crimes were now designated faith crimes , leading to a " large percentage increase from a very low base " .
Faith hate crimes are currently prosecuted under anti-racism legislation , but a bill to create a new offence of incitement to religious hatred is currently going through the Houses of Parliament .
The bill , which has attracted criticism from many quarters , has passed its Commons stages but is set to get a rocky ride in the Lords .
The alarming figures emerged as Home Office minister Hazel Blears held the first in a series of meetings on Tuesday with Muslim community groups across the country .
Those meetings come amid increasing concerns that young Muslims are being targeted by police in stop - and - search operations .
There may be longer term implications if this level of activity continues
Assistant Commissioner Ghaffur
Ahead of the meeting , Ms Blears pledged that Muslims would not be discriminated against by police trying to prevent potential terror attacks .
She insisted " counter - terrorism powers are not targeting any community in particular but are targeting terrorists " .
She also opposed police use of racial profiling , saying stop and searches should be based on good intelligence , not just skin colour .
Mr Ghaffur also revealed that the specialist unit dealing with serious and organised crime had lost 10 % of its staff to the bombings inquiry .
' Stretched '
Between 300 and 473 of Specialist Crime Directorate detectives have been seconded at any one time since 7 July .
As a result Mr Ghaffur said key leads would be followed up but proactive work on major murder inquiries had " slowed to a trickle " .
These include the 2004 murder of Amelie Delagrange , linked to five other attacks on women in south - west London , and the 1992 murder of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common .
" The Met is stretched , " he said .
" There may be longer term implications if this level of activity continues . "
Last week Met Commissioner Sir Ian Blair revealed the anti-terrorism investigations were costing £ 500,000 a day .

Speaking of your meth use , we can tell .
When it takes you 6 hours to install a pre fabricated screen door , we can tell .
When you have a 3 minutes conversation and say nothing at all , we can tell .
If you ring my doorbell one more time at 2 am to tell me that someone broke into the garage , I will kick you .
In the neck .
I dont have a car , I dont care .
Perhaps if you didnt give out keys to the " thugs " who hang around trying to get free drugs from you there wouldnt be a problem .
Creepy Staring Lady -

Super nice black guy next door -
You and your girlfriend are sweet and awesome neighbors , you dont complain when the baby makes noise , and you just say hi when its needed .
But when youre home alone we can hear you singing to your 80s whitney houston music .
Dont get me wrong its good .

We know your secret !
Bitchy lady -
When you order a package and you know it will be sent UPS which requires a signature , send it to your work .
The poor UPS guy shows up all the time and you arent home .
I made the mistake of signing for a package once for you .
I left you a nice note letting you know that when you get home ring the bell and I will give it to you .
It would have been nice for you to say " think you " instead of " wheres my package " next time I will .... nevermind there will be no next time .
Fuck you .
Emo Mexicans -
We can smell your weed and for some reason listening to stoned drunk guys sing Morrisey in a mexican accent isnt that appealing .
Please please please shut your door .
Im moving soon so I wont have to deal with you .

Next person .... the dishwasher doesnt work , neither does the heater .
Dont try and get it fixed .
You 'll just get the tweekers boyfriend in your house while you arent home " fixing " things .
If there 's one thing more satisfying than picking one 's nose , it 's shoving a finger or Q - tip deep into your ear canal and emerging with that big hunk of wax which has been muffling your hearing for the last few weeks .
Now ear cleaning is usually part of a multi- tasked routine -- you dig around in there while watching TV , taking a bath , or sitting in a meeting -- but if you 'd like to take your aural hygiene to the next level of fun and excitement , Japan 's Coden has just the tools to kick it up a notch .
Imagine if you can the wild and crazy times you could have with the company 's line of Ear Scopes , which combine a pick with a small video camera and allow you to actually watch what 's going on while you scrape around and try to avoid puncturing your eardrum .
The GXL model comes with a personal eyepiece which is employed in the manner pictured above , while the Ear Scope TV sports a separate LCD screen for a bigger view and possible screening sessions for your weirdo friends .
The ' Scopes start at about 16,800 yen ( $ 140 ) , but the hours of enjoyment you 'll get from viewing your own ear pr0n are priceless .
Also , if anyone owns one of these , please send us some screencaps of your favorite picking sessions : we 'll take the best action shots and post 'em up in a gallery .

Would you try nude swimming in Antarctica ?
The crew and guests aboard the 24 - day " Dive Antarctica " voyage had the opportunity .
The trip 's purpose was to explore the Antarctic undersea world and the above - ground landscape .
Calling this a ' vacation ' is not the right word .
The excursion seems more of a ' quest ' , an adventure into lands few have seen .
The intense and physically challenging Antarctic diving required that the guests be highly trained and experienced divers .
They were rewarded with incredible sights throughout the trip .
Between spectacular diving sessions , the travelers had a little downtime .
Some tried swimming in the cold waters .
After shedding clothing , a few on the excursion took the opportunity to swim naked - the ultimate nude Polar Bear swim .
Here 's footage of a man and woman from the Dive Antarctica excursion skinnydipping in the Antarctic Sea : ( YouTube ) During the trip , the team discovered some pollution in the waters , some from tourism and more at a research station .
In a noble effort to keep the environment pristine , Dive Antarctica is proposing to return in 2007 to do a clean - up mission .

パターンに関する情報は 、 The Patterns Home Pageを参照してください。 そこにはオンライン上のパターンへのリンク、 パターンに関する論文、パターンを扱った書籍の説明、 カンファレンスの一覧、 そしてパターンに関連したメーリングリストが含まれています。
「 パターン」という用語によい定義がないのはなぜでしょうか？
多くの技術用語によい定義がないのはなぜでしょうか？
「 パターン 」という用語は、 例えば 「 オブジェクト 」 と同じくらいの地歩は少なくとも築いていると思います。
「 あるコンテキストにおける問題に対する1つの解法 」
という短いスローガンを気にかける人は誰もいないようです。
しかし、このスローガンはあまりにも短いので、混乱を招く可能性があります。
このスローガンに登場する用語を次のように展開するといいかもしれません。 コンテキストとは、 繰り返し発生する一群の状況のことを指します。
その状況にパターンを適用することになります。
問題とは、 コンテキストで起きる一群のフォース ――目的と制約――のことを指します 。
解法とは、 これらのフォースを解決するために適用できる 正規化された設計の形、あるいは設計のルールのことを指します。 定義に関するもっと広い議論は 、
Patterns Home Pageと WikiWikiWebにあります。
こうしたものを記述するのに、「パターン」よりもいい言葉は使えないんですか？
あなたの好きなように呼んでかまいませんよ。
でも、他の多くの人たちの呼び方を変えるにはもう遅すぎるでしょうね。
パターンは他のどんなものに適用できますか？
ソフトウェア関連の既存の例としては、次のものがあります。
プログラミングのイディオム 例えば、C++での入れ子になったクラス、
Javaでのインターフェース、 Smalltalkでのカスケード呼出し(メッセージの流し込み)の特定の利用法です。
コーディングのイディオム 例えば、次のよう なCのイディオムです。 while ( * dst++ = * src++ ) ; データ構造 例えば、木構造やバッファなどです。 アルゴリズム 例えば、並列処理のためのアルゴリズムなどです。 プロトコル 例えば、並列オブジェクトシステムなどで使われるプロトコルなどです。 新しいフレームワーク開発 例えば、ユーザインタフェー ス( UI ) ツールキットのためのものです。 既存のフレームワークの利用 例えば 、OpenDoc , JavaBeans , …。 分析モデル 例えば、課金ルールをどう取り扱うかといったことです。 システムアーキテクチャ 例えば 、Blackboard やBrokerといったアーキテクチャです。 〔訳注：参 考
http://www.agcs.com/supportv2/techpapers/patterns/papers/tutnotes/〕 開発組織 例えば、開発チームの構造や力学といったものです。 開発プロセス 例えば、オブジェクト指向分析設計における工程や戦略といったものです。
さらにパターンは、ソフトウェア開発以外のいくつかの分野にも適用されています。
パターンとコーディングのイディオムとの違いは何ですか？
デザインとの違いは？ OMTやUML ダイアグラムとの違いは？ ユースケースとの違いは？ プロトコルとの違いは？ アルゴリズムとの違いは？ ヒューリスティック( 発見的手法) との違いは？ アーキテクチャとの違いは？ コーディング標準との違いは？ コーディングスタイルとの違いは？ 開発手法との違いは？ パターンは主にそのうちの 何
か1つに関連しているものではありますが、 そのひとつだけではパターンとは言えません。 パターンとは、 それらを実際の開発現場に適用する方法と理由を示すガイダンス を提供するものです 。
パターンとクラスの違いは何ですか？ 再利用可能なコンポーネントとの違いは？
パラメータつきの( テンプレート ) クラスとの違いは？ クラスライブラリやパッケージとの違いは？ フレームワークとの違いは？ ツールとの違いは？ コード生成器との違いは？ パターンは実装ではありません。 実装や他の技術的な製品を生み出す際の 「 いつ、なぜ、どうやって 」を示すものです。 実装( クラス、フレームワーク、ツールなど)を使った記述が適した解法もあります（多くはないです）。
その場合、実装を通して、 知るべきことや行うべきことが開発者に全部伝わってしまう、
ということになります。 たとえそうだとしても、コード自身はパターンではありません。
パターンとハウツーガイドとの違いは何ですか？
パターンに書かれる解法は、ハウツーガイドや料理のレシピなどと似て、
段階を追った一連の工程で表現されることがあります。
しかし、繰り返しますが、このような工程はパターンのひとつの側面だけを形作るものです。
パターンはまた、ハウツーガイドに見られるものよりも、
コンテキストに関してはより広い適用範囲と一般性を持ち、
フォースの同定と解決に関してはより信頼性の高いものとなることを目指しています。
パターンの研究と、 ドメイン固有のソフトウェアアーキテクチャ・ ソフトウェアの再利用・ ソフトウェアエンジニアリング・ その他の分野の研究とはどんな関連がありますか？ いくらか重なりあう部分があるようです 。
パターンを記述するのに最適なフォーマットは何ですか？ 自分で選んでください。 Alexanderのパターンのほとんどすべては、 次のような形式で記述されています。 [ もしも ] ある [ コンテキスト ] で ある [ 例 ] のような [ 問題 ] が [ フォース ] を伴って現れた [ ならば ] いくつか の [ 理由 ] で [ デザインのフォームやルール]を適用して [ 解法 ] を組み立て、 さらに [ 新たなコンテキスト ] や[ 別のパターン ] へ導く 様式上、多くのバリエーションがあります。 パターンについて書いている既存の本で、 完全に同じフォーマットを使用しているものは2つとありません。 フォーマットの中には、 純粋に物語のような形式になっている Portland Formもあります。 おそらく最も一般的なフォーマット（ デザインパターン本で使われている）は、これの逆で、 デザインのフォームやルールの記述から始まって、 問題や、コンテキストや、そのパターンを適用できる例題がその後に記述されています。 パターンの構造と内容を記述する際には、 形式の違いによらず以下の要素が必要になります。 最良のプラクティスの記述 あるいは、少なくとも一般に受け入れられているプラクティスの記述が必要です。 ある人たちは、パターンを、決定的なソフトウェア・エンジニアリングのハンドブックの作成に向けたステップだと見ています。 適切な一般性 そのパターンが繰り返して起こるという証拠が必要です。 たいていの場合、 よく知られている用例を何個か要約することが必要となります。 また、そのパターンを適用できない状況について言及することも必要かもしれません。 その場合には、替わりのパターンへのリファレンスも含める必要があるでしょう。 スコープ 誰かがそのパターンを適用したいと思うコンテキストを、詳しく記述します。 また、そのパターンが結果として別のパターンの応用例となることが多いなら、 そちらのパターンへのリファレンスも含めます。 建設性 パターンというものは、 人々がその解法の実 例
を1つ作り上げるような形で表現されます。
本質がどこにあるかを示す関係図が必要になるかもしれません。
また、パターンの利用者が従わなければならない一連の設計工程が必要となるかもしれません。
その場合には、解法のフォームの記述や例示も必要となるでしょう。 完全性 関連するすべてのフォースが記述されているということです。 有用性 その解法がうまくフォースを解決できるという証拠です。
もしフォースの一部分しか解決できない場合や、
その解法が新たなフォースを生み出す場合には、
適用できる関連パターンへのリファレンスが必要です。 実例 解法のステップを示した実例と、 既存のソフトウェアの文書化された使用法の両方です。
適切なレベルの抽象化 例えば、 「 他のレベルの間接的な手法を加えながら 」 というのは発見を促すのに有用な表現ですが、
一般的過ぎるし、複数の側面を持ち過ぎているので、
よいパターンとはいえません。 オリジナリティの欠如 新たな解法は、パターンではありません
（しかし、要約・統合・焼き直しをしてパターンとしての記述を導くことは
目新しいものかも知れません。 また、パターンは新たな用途を導き出すかも知れません）。 適切な名前 共有されるボキャブラリを開発者に提供する、
簡潔で対象をよく言い表わした名前です。 明確さ 人々は、 そのパターンを適用するどうか、 また適用するならどのように適用するかを、 パターンの表現方法とスタイルによって簡単に判断することができ、 パターンを自分 で 「 再発明 」する必要がありません。 〔訳注： パターン記述の例は、 デザインパターンのテンプレートを参考に 〕
「 フォースの解決」とは何ですか？ Alexanderのパターン記述は、 パターンはフォース同士の一種の「均衡」を表現しなければならない、
という考えを含んでいます ( Alexander自身ですら 、 いつもこのことを納得できるやり方で実行しているわけではない、 と批判されてきました( Alexanderは自分でもそう批判しています ) ) 。 均衡というのは、 例えばコンピュータサイエンスのアルゴリズムの解析に見られるような、 最適性と同じ概念です。 しかし、均衡は 、1つ前のFAQ に書かれている、 計測困難なフォースというものに対して適用されるものです。 ある解法がフォースを最適に解決するということを分析的に「 証明する」ことは たいていは不可能です （実際問題、ここ で
「証明」の概念を定義することは困難です。
またその証明にどんな利用法があるのか見ることすら困難です）。 その一方で 、 解法について誤った・怪しげな正当化を行うような
「 とにかくこうなんだ」というストーリーを思いつくのはとても簡単です。
最高に良心的なパターン作者であっても、
ある解法がどうしてそれほど有効に機能するのかを
完全に理解しているわけではありませんし、
応用の可能性を完全に理解しているわけではありません。 かつ てRalph Johnsonは次のような投稿をしました。 あるパターンが解く問題をはっきり理解するのは、困難なことが多いです。
しょっちゅう目にするので「これはパターンだ」ということはわかります。
それから、そのパターンを導入して外界がよりよくなれば、
「 これはよいパターンだ」ということもわかります。
しかし、外界の方を見た場合、 どうして物事がそのようになっているのかを理解するのは難しいものです。
あるパターンが解く問題をはっきり理解する方法というのは、
事物を設計するときに自分自身を見ることだ、と私は思います。
あるパターンを私たちが使うのに、 どんな条件がきっかけとなるのでしょうか。
パターンが解く問題についてAlexanderが記述しないことがあるのはなぜかというと、
実は彼自身も知らない場合があるからなのだ、と思います。
GoFの本が問題についてあまりよく書いていない理由も、
これと同じに違いありません。 〔パターン記述の〕フォーマットのせいで著者が問題を無視してしまった、
ということではありません。 問題に対する著者の理解の結果が、 彼らの採用しているフォーマットとなったということなのです。 こういった理由から、パターンのコミュニティは、 議論が以下のようなものでバックアップされて いることを期待しています 。
「 よい」ことの経験的な証拠 その解法は、適用可能な複数のコンテキストで使われたことがあるかという点。
判断基準として、3個ルールが使われることがあります。 3個ルールというのは、 互いに独立した利用法を3個見つけるまで「これはパターンだ」と主張するな、
というものです。 〔訳注： Rule Of Three ---
Wiki〕 比較 他の既知の解法やプラクティスとの関係。 適切な解法が適用されなかった場合の弱点や失敗を示す例も含むでしょう。 パターンを原作者から独立させる パターンというものは、最初に発案した人、 あるいは最初に実装した人だけによって書かれるべきではない。 レビュー その分野に密接に関わっている人々と、 そうではない人との両方を含んでいる、複数グループによる批評。 パターンをレビューするのによく使われるフォーマットの1つは、
Writer 's Workshopです ( これ は Pattern Languages of Programs ( PLoP ) カンファレンスで使われたものです ) 。 〔訳注： このWriter 's Workshopはリンクが切れています。 どなたか適切なリンクを探してほしいです。
PLoPで使われているパターン記述のフォーマットです〕 パターンであるという証拠が提供されるまで、 パターンはプロト・パターン( proto-pattern ) と呼ばれることもあります ―― パターン候補ということです 。
パターンは、何々をしては 「 いけない」と、 否定的な形式になることがありえるでしょうか？ たぶん、理想的には、そういうことはありえません ―― 良いパターンの集合があれば、 あなたが直面するであろう無数の悪いデザイン （アンチパターンといわれることがある） を避けることができるでしょうし、 さらに、与えられたパターンを適用するのに不適切なコンテキストも すべて避けることができるでしょう。 しかし、非常に悪いのに 広まり過ぎているアイディアについては、 はっきりと言及しておく価値があります。 そうするための一つの方法は、 パターンの記述 に
「
よくある罠と落とし穴」というセクションを含めることです。
悪い解法（不適格な方法）の記述は、 良い解法への動機付け、論理的根拠付け、フォースの一部になり得ます。
パターンは、悪い解法を良いものに変える方法を述べる場合もあるでしょう
（「修正前／修正後 」や「修理」というセクションなどで）。
パターンは、1つの解法だけではなく、いろんな他の解法群も提供してくれますか？
たぶん、理想的にはそうはできません ―― それぞれの解法は、 その解法を最もよく適用できるコンテキストに束縛されていなければならないのです。 しかし、常にそのようにするのは難しすぎます。 他の解法については、 述べないよりも、述べた方がいいでしょう。 なぜなら、 他の解法との違いの原因となっているフォースを発見することで、 さらなる改善を行う足場を築くことになるからです。 たとえ、他の解法が本質的には違っているとしても、 ほとんどのコンテキストとフォースを共有する一群のパターンを、
1つのプレゼンテーションの中にグルーピングすべきか、 というパターン記述の様式上の問題は残ります。
結局のところ、 うちのおばあちゃんに聞けば 教えてくれるようなアドバイスになるだけなのに、 手間ひまかけてパターンを書くのはどうしてですか？ パターンの中には、 あなたのおばあちゃんですら知っているくらい とても良くて役に立つものがあるからです。 パターンを書くことによって、 そのアドバイスのコンテキスト、価 値( value ) 、そしてその意 味( implications ) が おばあちゃんのアドバイスよりも明確になるのです。
すべてのパターンは、[ ○○パターン ]
と同じくらい[低レベル/高レベル/一般的/
特定的/抽象的/具象的]でなければなりませんか？
もちろん、そんなことはありません。
パターン を 「 ある特殊な形式や表記法」で表現することが出来ますか？
自由に試してください。 しかし、もしも、 コンテキストの記述、 解決する問題、 解法の妥当性を示す証拠、 構築や実装のためのガイドライン、 あるいは、他のパターンとの関連を書き落としていたら、 その 「 形式的な表記法によるデザインの表現やデザインルール 」は「 パターン 」 にはならないということは心に留めておいてください。
どうしてパターンを用いるべきなのでしょうか？
よくできたコードは再利用すべき、というのと同じような理由です。
すなわち、他の人の知識や経験から恩恵を受けようということです。
その人は、コンテキスト、フォース、そして解法を理解するために、
あなたがこれまで、あるいはこれから行う努力よりも
大きな努力をしてきたのです。 さらに、パターンはコードよりももっと再利用がしやすいのです。
というのは、パターンを適用することで、
既存のコンポーネントが再利用できないような特殊な状況を扱う
ソフトウェアを作ることができるのです。 さらに、パターンを使うと、 開発者たちは 共通の開発上の問題を取り扱う、 共通の名前と概念の集合を得ることができます。
要するに、コミュニケーションが強化されることになるのです。
もし、パターンベース のCASEツールがあったら素敵じゃないでしょうか？ いいかもしれません。 でも、パターンは人と人とのコミュニケーションのためのものです。
もしもそのツールが、他の人たちとのコミュニケーションを促進するならば、
それはよいものです。 でもそのツールが、 パターンがねらいとしていることを、
コンピュータで実行可能にするというだけなら、
それはよいものとはいえません。
パターン・ランゲージとパターンの集合との違いは何ですか？
パターン・ランゲージは、相互に関連したパターンの集合です。
個々のパターンはみな同じコンテキストの一部を共有し、
いくつかのカテゴリーに分類されているかもしれません。 この用語はAlexanderに拠ります。 Alexander の 「ランゲージ」という用語の使い方は一般的ではありませんが、
誤りというわけでもありません。 もしパターンの集合を見て、非常に形式的にとらえなおすなら、
個々のパターンは「生成規則」だといえます。
もし、あなたがオートマトン理論を覚えているならば、
生成規則のセットが帰納的可算言語を特徴付けるひとつの手段であることを思い出すでしょう。
〔オートマトン理論で「生成規則」の集合が「言語」を定めるように、
「 パターン」の集合が「パターン・ランゲージ」を定めることになるのです〕。
なぜもっ と 「なになに」に関するパターンがないのでしょうか？
なぜなら、あなたがそれを書いていないからです。
興味を持っているなら、あなたは何かを知る可能性が高くなります。
そして何かを知ったなら、あなたはパターンを書くことができるのです。
わたしが持ってる アイデア／デザイン／作ったもの が、パターンかどうか、どうすれば分かりますか？ それをパターンとして 書いてみてください 。
パターンは、何個あるのですか？ 誰もが知っていなくてはならないパターンのうち、
まだ発見されていないものはほとんどない、と考えている人もいれば、
各分野に固有の文書化すべきパターンは もっとずっと多いと考えている人もいます。
おそらくどちらも正しいのでしょう。 パターンを書いてみてください。 そうすれば、新しいパターンを発見できるでしょう。
あまりにパターンが多すぎて、 パターンの発見や分類、索引付け、利用、
それから保守などの際に問題を引き起こすことになりませんか？ なるかもしれません。
[ ある特定のオブジェクト指向分析/設計手法]の中で、パターンを利用できますか？
おそらく利用できるでしょう。 けれども、パターンを利用した場合、 その表記法の範囲を越え、 その手法にほとんど従わないことになるかもしれません。
パターンというのは、 必ず繰り返して使わなければならないんですか？ あなたが、とてもラッキーで、 直面している問題に対する完全なパターンのセットがすでにあって、 その問題に対しては次から次へと流れるようにパターンを応用することができ、 一度も後戻りせずに最終製品までたどり着く、 なんてことも原理的にはありえるでしょう。 でも、実際にはそんなにラッキーなことは決してありません。
パターンをうまく活用する、お勧めの開発プロセスはありますか？
おそらくあるでしょう。 しかし、この件についてたくさん議論しても、
パターンを活用した開発プロセスが何であるかは分からないでしょう。
まずは、実際にパターンを使ってみてください。
そうすれば、パターンを活用した開発プロセスが見つかります。
パターンを利用すれば、経営の実践や、 ソフトウェアの経済性に何か効果はありますか？
31の回答と同じ答えです （まずは、実際にパターンを使ってみてください。
そうすれば、効果があるかどうかが分かるでしょう）。
既存のパターン群を使うことを人に教えるよりも、
新規のパターンを書くことを教える方が役に立つのではないでしょうか？
その両方が必要です。 どちらか一方がより必要性が高いということはありません。
どうすれば、自分の職場で、 組織的にパターンを利用できるでしょうか？ 一般に、次のことがお勧めできます。 パターンについてあなたがもっている最善のコードを掘り出しなさい。
設計文書とレビューを拡張して、デザインパターンも扱うようにしなさい。
既存のデザインパターンの利用に関する講習会を開きなさい。
パターン作者のワークショップで、既存のパターンをレビューしなさい。
設計を文書化するときには、パターン指向のスタイルテンプレートを使いなさい。
そうすると設計がパターンへ発展する可能性があります。
研究グループを形成しなさい。そして週に一度パターンについて話し合うために集まりなさい。
ひとたび熱狂的な人の集まりができたら、
その人たちは組織的に行うことを自然と求めるようになります。
どうし てAlexanderのパターンは建築家の間で広く使われていないんですか？ 理由は一つだけではないようです。 人々は次のような要因を挙げています。
永いあいだに培われたプラクティスと建築家のプロフェショナルとしての文化との軋轢（あつれき）、 経済的な要因、 Alexanderが、人々に自分の独自の家を設計し建築させることに焦点を当てているという事実、
そして『パターン・ランゲージ』に書かれている特定のパターンが、
どれだけ良くどれだけ役に立つのか意見が分かれている点、 などです。
非常に大規模な開発でも、パターンは使えますか？
実際にそうしているという報告があります。
パターンは、騒がれすぎではありませんか？ もちろんそうです。これは避けられません。

Samsung concepts a wearable cellphone

This is Samsung ’s concept wearable cellphone , which I must admit looks pretty cool .
It uses intuitive input methods using your fingertip on segments of your fingers .

Your military bureaucracy , hard at work .
Nine months ago , Marine Corps Major General Richard Zilmer , the head of coalition forces in western Iraq , sent an " Priority 1 " request to the Pentagon , asking for new gear .
Today , according to Inside Defense , the Pentagon 's Joint Staff said they 'd start thinking about it .
Gen .
Zilmer 's plea was n't the usual one , for more guns or ammo or armored vehicles .
He asked for
renewable power stations , equipped with " solar panels and wind turbines , " instead .
Constantly resupplying out - of - the - way bases with fossil fuels was putting troops at risk of " serious and grave casualties " on Iraq 's roadways , Zilmer noted in his request .
Not to mention the expense : Factor in transportation and storage , and the price of a gallon of fuel in Iraq can be as high as $ 400 .
Green power had become a battlefield necessity .
“ Military officials have confirmed that the renewable energy [ joint urgent operational need ] made it to the Joint Staff from [ U.S. Central Command ] on March 28 , ” Joint Staff spokesman Army Lt. Col. Gary Tallman tells * Inside Defense *.
Now , granted , the Pentagon can't magically , instantly start fulfilling every request on a general 's wish list .
And Zilmer 's plea is n't the easiest to satisfy ; he asked for some pretty major power supplies .
But nine months – just to begin to respond to a battlefield commander 's " urgent " request ?
C'mon .
We 're at war here .
The bureaucrats have got to shuffle paper faster than that .
UPDATE : Meanwhile , the Army 's Rapid Equipping Force , seemingly sidestepping the Joint Staff , is sending prototype green - power generators to Iraq and Afghanistan .

＞温暖化対 策
全 長10万キロの軌道エレベーター構想に慣れている私としては、直径2000kmだろうが2フィートの粒子からなる雲だろうが大差ない印象ですけど(^^;。でもコアレスな「雲」構想のほうがモダンではありますね。
海面に発泡スチロールを浮かべるなどして地球のアルベドを上げたほうが安価だと思いますけど。この観点からは、ビルの屋上緑化は太陽光を吸収してしまうのでよろしくありません。
もっと安くいけそうなのは、『ベクフットの虜』に出てくるような海草かプランクトンを海一面に繁殖させることです。平均気温が上がると白化し、下がると黒化して太陽光の入力を自動調節してくれる。
もちろん、こんな荒っぽい方法を採れば気候激変は必至です。温暖化が進んで「もうダメだ」になるまでは選択肢に含まれないでしょうね。

どうでもいいことかもしれませんが、原文の " you may read more about the request at ChillingEffects.org . " と日本語の 「 必要に応じて 、ChillingEffects.org で削除が発生したことに至った苦情を確認できます。」ではかなり印象が違いますね。

tune 水星のもやも や
2006 年11月14日(火) 01時44分19 秒
もやもやが気になったのでちょっとあそんでみました
「 最大エントロピー法」という処理をかけると右下のもやもやに水星本体よりわずかに小さい
明瞭な輪郭が現れました、それと太陽の縁の部分は境界ははっきりしないが内側とは性質の
異なる像（もやもや状態）となっています。
これらから推測すると画像を処理した人は、水星よりほんのすこし小さな円と太陽の縁の内側に
ぼかした境目のアルファチャンネル（枠を決めるチャンネル）を作りコントラストをつければ
粒状班はハッキリ、太陽の縁はややぼけて水星の真っ黒の円形も強調されると思ったが・・・
残念ながらアルファチャンネルが右下にずれてしまい、水星の右から下にかけてコントラストが
つけられないもやもやが残り、太陽の縁のもやもやも予定より内側になってしまった。
「 まあいいか、やり直すの面倒だからこのままにしておこう」とかなんとかで、いかがでしょう。
水星の上の方のもやもやは、いろいろと処理を変えても周辺と変わりませんでしたので目の錯覚かな？

川尻 問い合わせぐらいはどうでしょう ？ 2006 年 11月13日(月)20時45分05 秒
悪マニの八分の際は抗議に対し機械的にかけていた様子でした（たまたま身近な出来事でした）。
田崎さんのあのページに関しては、訴えの真摯さ、誠実さに本気で感動していたので八分はがっかりです。
小中学生のみならず、大学生や大の大人にも広く読まれれば思っていたのに。というのも、同じ職場の女性で
本気で信じていた人がいたし、友人の娘が某大学（関東の偏差値が高くはないが低くもない私立大学）の
就職対策用セミナーに出た際に、講師がいきなり水伝を主張し始めて仰天した、というのもあって。
後者の話、大学が企業向け研修を行っている会社に委託しているセミナーで、受けた娘は工学部だった
もんで周りは失笑していただけのようですが、同じ講義を文系の学生も受けているという。その娘、カチンと
きたので仲のいい教授１名にチクッたところ、教授会が動いて内々にセミナー会社に抗議、会社からは
「 講師が勝手にしゃべったことで」との返答があり、だから二度とやらないように念を押し、当の娘にも教授から
「 また今度同じようなことを教え始めたら、こっそり教えてね」と内々に(^^ ) 。
そんな次第でその大学では今後は大丈夫だろうと思いますが、似たような講座を開いている大学も少なくないと
思うんですよ。この八分は深刻だと思いますが。
とりあえず、問い合わせぐらいはしたほうが良いように…。

BUNTEN さん、 ぼくも気づいていました。 一度は 「 水からの伝言」だけの検索で１ページ目まであがっていたのですが、二日くらい前からまったく出なくなりました。
URL をじかに検索するのが確実らしいので、やってみましたが、ページがみつからないと言われます。
つまり、Google が見ていないのは確実。 ちなみに
Yahoo とか goo とか、では見えます。 また 、Google でも、私の他のページはちゃんと引っかかります。 まあ、機械のトラブルはよくあることだから、静観していようと思っています。
Google が不都合だと判断したページを無視することは周知ですが（しょせん、一企業の無料サービスなのだから、それは当然でしょう）、科学の粋とも言える巨大コンピューターネットワークを舞台に活躍する企業が、科学者が科学とは何かについて冷静に書いた啓蒙ページを不都合と判断するとしたら、それは衝撃以上のものがありますね。

A source told Britain 's More magazine : " She gave the farmer a bit of a shock .

Manal Omar had used her five - piece ' Islamic - style ' swimsuit for years - in Rio , Washington and Kuala Lumpur - and it had never brought her more than a curious glance .
Then she went for a dip in Oxford ...
One Sunday last month I went for my afternoon swim at my local David Lloyd 's fitness club wearing the Islamic - style swimsuit I have been wearing for years .
The swimsuit has recently been celebrated by media outlets from Newsweek to National Geographic as an innovative way for Muslim women to become more active .
As an American - Muslim woman , I have always been determined to be active without compromising my faith .
I have been swimming in capital cities across the world from Rio de Janeiro to Washington DC to Kuala Lumpur , and now London .
Although I get curious stares , I have never had any awkward moments when I head out for a swim .
That is , until I came to Oxford .
As I was getting ready to head home from my Sunday swim , I heard a loud voice from a man stating that he needed to speak to the manager about dress code .
I picked up on it , but did n't really give it too much thought , until I heard him yelling about " that woman over there " who was wearing the " burkini " , the gist of what he was saying seemingly being that it was inappropriate .
What the hell is that ?
The burkini ?
I could feel a rising indignation at the man 's audacity in singling me out in this way .
Who had died and declared him the pool police ?
There were several lifeguards on duty who had seen me swimming there over the previous six months , and none had objected to the swimsuit .
It 's been nearly a year since I moved to Oxford , and frankly , I had had enough of the anti-Muslim rhetoric in British political life .
Now that I was in the middle of it , I refused to stand on the sidelines .
I walked up to the burly , middle - aged man who had been pointing at me a minute before and asked , " Are you guys talking about me ? "
He turned towards me , and waved a dismissive hand : " This has nothing to do with you . "
" Are you talking about me ?
Because if you are , this has everything to do with me . "
He then confirmed he was indeed talking about me , but not talking to me .
He was talking to the manager .
By this time I was irate , and the fact that he was using his dirty shoes as a pointer while he was yelling at me did n't help the situation .
" But you have just singled me out in front of everyone , and in a voice loud enough for me to hear .
How can this have nothing to do with me ? "
At this point he referred to me as a " silly little girl " , which I found amusing , considering that I am a 32 - year - old , 5ft 10in , professional senior manager for an international NGO .
This man was clearly a closed - minded bigot and a sexist to boot , and there was n't much I could do to change that .
This turned my focus of anger towards the manager .
His response should have been quick and succinct : " We have lifeguards who determine what is appropriate .
If you have a concern , please do not single out one of our members , but put it in writing and we will send you an explanation . "
But he did not .
Instead , he allowed this man to go on publicly challenging my choice of clothing , while publicly humiliating me .
Now , I realise that my swimsuit stands out a bit .
And I know it 's quite unusual : the week before last I lost my swimsuit and I did feel a bit awkward answering the receptionist 's question - one piece or two pieces ?
" Well , actually , it 's a five - piece , " I said .
The woman across the desk stared back at me in disbelief .
I described it as a long wetsuit with a very short mini -dress on top .
( It turned up a few days later . )
I admit , it 's different .
Some people might think it 's overkill .
But it 's my choice .
I choose to wear the hijab in my daily life , and it has never stopped me from being active , and this Muslim swimsuit was the perfect solution .
I was so excited when I saw it for sale online .
Previously , there had always been a sort of unspoken agreement between me and my fellow swimmers that my swimsuit did n't really matter - we were all there to swim and relax .
I was not forcing my swimsuit on them , and they were not forcing their choice on me .
In fact , my choice of swimwear has been quite a success globally - it's one of the bestselling items for PrimoModa.com , where I bought it .
It 's made of ordinary swimsuit material and the Boston Globe recently praised it , among many other papers , in an article headlined , " High - tech fabrics keep Muslim women in the swim . "
Yet that 's not how the journalist at the local newspaper in Oxford , the Oxford Mail , decided to approach the issue .
Her article was titled " Row over fully dressed woman in sauna " .
The main interview in the article was with Ian Caldwell , the man who verbally attacked me in the lobby .
There was no attempt to find out the full story .
A so - called " Muslim community leader " called Taj Hargey called it " political correctness gone crazy " .
At no point had the journalist contacted me .
She seemed to have decided to take a similar approach to the man in the swimming pool - talking about me , not to me .
As did David Lloyd's , which had backed up his story without consulting me .
At no point did they bother to inform me , a paying member , that such an article was being written .
I contacted the Oxford Mail , offering them my side of the story .
I never heard back .
Of course , that would have destroyed the theme of the article .
Nobody in Oxford would be interested in new swimming suits with hi-tech material , but a crazy Muslim woman jumping into a pool fully clothed and potentially suffocating in the sauna was much more interesting .
Since when have facts been important to journalists covering stories involving Muslims ?
Needless to say , I was shocked to find out a week later that my swimming habits had caused not only a " row " , but a huge online debate .
Perhaps the most daunting part of the experience was the strong reactions from those who read the article .
It was the website 's " most viewed article " even two weeks after the incident .
The comments ranged from attacks on me ( from both Muslims and non-Muslims ) to full xenophobic attacks on all immigrants in Europe .
At no point did any of the readers question Caldwell 's version of events ; nor did the majority of readers question his motivation for highlighting the issue .
There was a blind acceptance that some random Muslim woman had done something , as one commentator described it , " a bit stupid " .
British Muslims piped up in apologetic tones , and everyone else openly attacked .
My routine visit to the gym had suddenly sparked a crisis : it was all about immigration , asylum !
As one person commented , " This multicultural society is now becoming a multidirectional mess . "
Another commentator went as far as to write , " All the time people seem to be burying their heads in the sand and allowing our once great country to be taken over by others .
I hope you one day will wake up when all our beautiful churches are being demolished and mosques built in their place . "
A tad drastic for a woman taking a swim , do n't you think ?
( Mind you , it 's all relative .
I had one email from a woman in Sweden saying she found it disgusting that people in Britain went swimming wearing any clothing at all . )
Nobody saw how ridiculous the article itself was .
Nobody except for one man .
His nickname on the online board was Mr Town , but I would probably have nicknamed him Mr Angel .
He posted a comment explaining , " I saw this woman swimming at DL and it was not dangerous or offensive .
She wore a full - length suit , like the Aquablade they wear in the Olympics with a tabard type thing over it with a short hem bit that went into a skirt . . .
This man obviously has some other motive . "
The fact that only one person responded in such a way was more traumatic than the public humiliation Caldwell had subjected me to on the morning of March 4 .
It is at this point that I get a bit perplexed by what exactly the British public wants .
On the one hand , they are always complaining about Muslims refusing to integrate and be part of the " mainstream " community .
On the other hand , it 's become painfully clear that when we do come out into the mainstream , we make them uncomfortable .
Granted , my swimsuit may not blend in , but the refusal by people like Caldwell to allow Muslim women to create a middle ground of interaction in the UK forces them into the extremes .
The online debate has created in me a sense of fear , and as a result I have not been back to the gym in the past month , even after assurances from the general manager at David Lloyd 's Oxford branch that his management team would do their best to ensure I had safe access .
The general manager agreed with me that things had spiralled out of proportion , and after I showed him my swimsuit , not only stated that it met swimsuit standards , but that it was now being offered for purchase at all David Lloyd 's clubs throughout the UK .
But Caldwell 's actions had the desired effect : I stayed at home .
Having spent my entire life in the United States , as a veiled Muslim woman I am no stranger to discrimination .
In fact , as a child , I grew up in the hardcore territories of the south in the US , known as the Bible belt .
Although I faced comments and questions , my personal lifestyle and space never felt invaded .
In fact , the churchgoing community I lived in as a child welcomed me , and after my experience in the UK I want to go back to the local priest and kiss him on the forehead for not only preaching about respect but putting it into practice .
Looking back , what disturbed me the most about the debate was that my very identity was reduced to a cluster of cliches about Muslim women .
I was painted in broad strokes as an oppressed , unstable Muslim woman .
I was made invisible , an object of ridicule and debate , with no opinion or independent thoughts .
The fact that I had dedicated the past 10 years to working on women 's issues on a global level , led a delegation of American women into Afghanistan in 2003 , and put my life on the line in Iraq struggling for women 's constitutional rights were clearly beyond anyone 's imagination .
The part of my life where I had the opportunity of meeting leading women from Queen Rania of Jordan to Hillary Clinton was erased .
When I chose to wear the headscarf nearly 15 years ago , I promised myself it would never hold me back from my two passions : travel and sport .
Neither my mother nor my sister had worn the headscarf , and my family raised us with the gift of freedom of choice .
To this day my sister and I enjoy the outdoors , each never giving a second thought to our choice of dress - her bikini or my " burkini " .
It strongly disturbs me that I was disregarded as an individual , and demeaned to a one - dimensional stereotype .
For many of those involved in the debate , the fact that I covered my head and my body seemed to make them forget that I had a brain .
The truth of the matter is that as a Muslim woman living in the US - and I was in Washington DC on September 11 2001 - I never felt so isolated and discriminated against as I have these past few weeks in Oxford .
Given that this is supposed to be one of the great seats of western civilisation , that should give British citizens something to chat about .
Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .

Click Submit Only Once
I shudder when I see these words .
Everyone I ’ve asked has , at least once , gotten two orders of something online ( personally , I ’ve had the SonyEricsson store ship three duplicate orders ) ; “ Click Submit Only Once ” is intended to stop that .
The problem is , it puts me and every other shopper between a rock and a hard place .
That ’s because if there ’s any problem with my browser , my computer ’s network connection , the Internet itself or the server , I do n’t know the status of my order .
You know , that blank screen and eternal “ waiting ” cursor .
I do n’t have any way of seeing whether the order made it , except by backing out and waiting for some kind of confirmation e-mail ( and that sometimes takes days ) .
On the other hand , if I go ahead and resubmit , there ’s a real possibility that I ’ll get two ( or three ) of everything .
For the technical - minded , this is all because HTTP is n’t a “ reliable ” protocol ; in other words , there are situations where the server and the client have different ideas of what ’s happened , or do n’t know what ’s happened , with a particular request .
For the most common HTTP method , GET , this does n’t matter ; it ’s “ safe , ” which means that GETting does n’t affect state on the server , and “ idempotent , ” which means that you can repeat a GET if you ’re not sure what ’s happened , with no ill effect .
However , POST - the method used to submit orders , among other things - does affect state , and often it very much matters how many times you do it .
That said , this is a common problem that ’s pretty easy to fix ; it does n’t require any fancy server footwork , browser plug-ins or HTTP extensions .
You can avoid it with a very simple design pattern in your Web application .
Roughly , it looks like this :
The browser requests the Web page that contains the final order form ( with the ‘ Submit ’ button in it ) ,
The server sends back a page whose form has a unique ‘ action ’ link ; e.g. , “ http://shop.example.com/orders/1234”,
The user submits the form , which is POSTed to the ‘ action ’ link , in turn submitting the order .
The server sends back a page that says that the order has been successfully submitted .
Here ’s the good part : if the server receives more than one POST to any particular ‘ action ’ link , it should generate a message saying “ This order has already been submitted , ” perhaps along with a summary of the order and its status .
This way , if the user does , for whatever reason , click “ submit ” twice , it wo n’t cause a duplicate order .
To make it even better , the server can put a notice on the ‘ submit ’ page : “ If there is a problem with your order , click in the ‘ location ’ bar and press return . ”
In most browsers , this will cause the request to be resubmitted to the server , but as a GET , not a POST .
The server can then show the status of the order if it was successful , and an error page ( perhaps with a link back to the submit page ) if it was n’t .
As a bonus , this page can act as the order status page .
There are a few things that the server needs to do to make sure this technique works .
First of all , the page containing the ‘ submit ’ link ca n’t be cacheable ; otherwise , it ’ll be difficult to make a second order ( the server will think you ’re resubmitting the first ) .
This can be accomplished by using POST to get the ‘ submit ’ page itself , or by using cacheability controls on the response .
Secondly , the link to the order page really has to be unique for each logical order ; the server might ensure this by using UUIDs , sequential numbers , or orders for each customer ( e.g. “ /orders/user@email.address / 43 ” .
Finally , it needs to properly respond to GET and POST on the order URI .
Note that this is n’t “ real ” reliability , by some definitions ; it does n’t take care of message ordering , for example .
However , it is good enough for making sure your customers do n’t get two ( or three ! ) of everything .
I ’d really like to see this pattern or something like it baked into the software toolkits that people use , so we can get rid of “ Click Submit Only Once . ”
I ’ll leave “ Do n’t Use Your Browser ’s Back Button ” for another day ; that one really bugs me …
P.S. After writing this on a plane , I did a Google on “ Reliable POST , ” which got me Paul Prescod ’s thoughts on the subject .
I think we ’re singing the same tune …
UPDATE : See POE , a more formal proposal in this space .
In late January , the city turned over about 600 pages of intelligence digests to the civil liberties union and other lawyers suing the city on behalf of people who say they were wrongly arrested and detained during the convention .
The documents are under court seal , but Mr. Dunn and a lawyer for The Times have asked a federal court magistrate to make them public .
City lawyers have described the intelligence documents as central to the city ’s defense .
“ They detail what information the N.Y.P.D. relied on in formulating its policies , ” Gerald C. Smith , an assistant corporation counsel with the Law Department , wrote in a letter filed in federal court last month .
He said the intelligence helped the police forecast how many people were coming to New York for the convention and had spoken about breaking the law .
Moreover , Mr. Smith wrote , the intelligence showed the city was justified in applying intensive scrutiny to the 1,806 people arrested during the convention , including fingerprinting more than a thousand people who faced charges no more serious than traffic tickets .
Some were detained as long as two days for minor offenses .
“ The decisions to adopt those policies were based in large part upon intelligence that had been gathered regarding the number of individuals planning to attend the R.N.C. in some capacity and the number of groups and individuals intending to , or at least professing to intend to , engage in unlawful behavior , ” Mr. Smith wrote .
In ruling that some of that information could be used by the city for its defense , a federal magistrate judge said that a debate over security and First Amendment rights would come to a head in the litigation .
“ The questions posed by these cases have great public significance , ” the judge , James C. Francis IV of Federal District Court in Manhattan , wrote on March 12 .
“ At issue is the proper relationship between the free speech rights of protesters and the means used by law enforcement officials to maintain public order . ”
One group that learned it had been the subject of an intelligence report , Billionaires for Bush , offered a lighthearted response to the news .
The group , a satirical troupe , dresses in tuxedos and gowns to provide faux endorsements of the administration .
Marco Ceglie , a national co-chairman who performs as Monet Oliver DePlace , said a member of the group known as Meg A . Buck had issued a statement : “ We suspect they were looking for stock tips . ”
Jessica Livingston , a partner at Y Combinator , has just published a book of interviews with 32 high tech company founders called Founders at Work .
She posted a couple of chapters online , including the interview with me , which is probably the most complete story of the early days of Fog Creek Software in print .
“ There ’s a bunch of people out there doing certain types of things and they seem to be pretty incompetent , but they ’re getting huge valuations .
Surely if I did those same things , knowing that I am less incompetent — merely semi-incompetent as opposed to extremely incompetent — I should be able to achieve at least their level of success . ”
I have n’t read the book yet … still waiting for my copy to arrive from Amazon , which appears to be beyond semi-incompetent with regards to what “ overnight shipping ” might mean when you order something on Thursday .
Check out the list of interviews , though : virtually everyone starting a high tech company will be all over this book like senators on cake .
Well , sort of .
U.S. News raises this potential defense of Alberto Gonzales in the prosecutor purge , only to immediately shoot it down .
Turns out that Ashcroft 's chief of staff , David Ayres , began the process of looking at which USAs should be up for replacement .
Among other steps that he took , Ayres approached then Deputy Attorney General James Comey for his thoughts .
Comey gave
Ayres the same list of those whom he viewed as weak U.S. attorneys that he would give Gonzales 's Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson a year later .
In principle , the former Justice official says , Comey was not opposed to removing incompetent people .
However , Comey 's definition of incompetence turned out to be quite different from Sampson 's and had nothing to do with politics , says the former official .
And the only one of the fired group Comey had identified as weak was Kevin Ryan , the U.S. attorney in San Francisco .
But Sampson put Ryan on his list of top prosecutors .
Remember that Comey was the acting Attorney General ( Ashcroft was recovering from surgery at the time ) who refused to authorize the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping in 2004 .
No wonder both Ashcroft and Comey got the boot .
Obviously their definitions of " legal " and " competent " just did n't mesh with the White House's .
And you never thought John Ashcroft would look so good .

Using eight Sony Playstation 3 units , Dr. Frank Mueller built a supercomputing cluster capable of high - performance computing and running the latest in computer gaming .
Credit : NC State University
The Sony Playstation 3 , Xbox and Nintendo Wii have captivated a generation of computer gamers with bold graphics and rapid - fire animation .
But these high - tech toys can do a lot more than just play games .
At North Carolina State University , Dr. Frank Mueller imagined using the power of the new PS3 to create a high - powered computing environment for a fraction of the cost of the supercomputers on the market .
Mueller , an associate professor of computer science , has built a supercomputing cluster capable of both high - performance computing and running the latest in computer gaming .
His cluster of eight PS3 machines – the first such academic cluster in the world – packs the power of a small supercomputer , but at a total cost of about $ 5,000 , it costs less than some desktop computers that have only a fraction of the computing power .
“ Clusters are not new to the computing world , ” Mueller says .
“ Google , the stock market , automotive design companies and scientists use clusters , but this is the first academic computing cluster built from Playstation 3s .
“ Scientific computing is just number crunching , which the PS3s are very good at given the Cell processor and deploying them in a cluster , ” Mueller says .
“ Right now one limitation is the 512 megabyte RAM memory constraint , but it might be possible to retrofit more RAM .
We just have n’t cracked the case and explored that option yet . ”
Another problem lies in limited speed for double - precision calculations required by scientific applications , but announcements for the next - generation Cell processor address this issue .
“ In the computing world there is a list of the top 500 fastest computers , ” Mueller says .
Currently the fastest is BlueGene / L , a supercomputer with more than 130,000 processors at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
The PS3 cluster at NC State does not break into the top 500 , but Mueller estimates that with approximately 10,000 PS3 machines anyone could create the fastest computer in the world – albeit with limited single - precision capabilities and networking constraints .
The PS3 allows the Linux operating system to be installed , and IBM designed the programming environment for programming the Cell processor ( including eight vectorization units ) , which combined tremendous computing power within a single PS3 .
According to Mueller , each PS3 unit contains six operational special - purpose cores for number crunching and one general - purpose core that is two - way multithreaded in his configuration , so the eight machines clustered have 64 logical processors , providing plenty of number - crunching ability in addition to running the latest games .
“ Jan. 3 is the ‘ birthdate ’ of this cluster , ” Mueller says .
“ Of course , here at NC State we will use it for educational purposes and for research .
We are working with scientists to determine the needs and how our cluster can be used to their benefit , and our computer science faculty is already using the cluster to teach classes in operating systems , with parallel systems , compilers and gaming likely to follow . ”

For 2003 OSCON
I proposed to give nine five - minute talks in a 45 - minute slot .
To avoid confusing this with the real lightning talks sessions , Nat decided to call my talk ``Nine Views of Mark Jason Dominus ' ' .
At first I did n't like that title , which sounded too much like self - promotion .
But I warmed up to it after a while and included various pictures ( views ) of myself in between the nine talks .
Before I wrote the talk , I was invited to give it at YAPC :: Israel in a one - hour slot .
So I wrote twelve short talks , and then for OSCON I cut out talks 2 , 7 , and 11 .
This is the long version .
Table of Contents
The slide the audience members saw while they were waiting for the talk to start had nothing on it except the talk title and a panel from The Uncanny X - Men issue # 21 , in which the villain was named Dominus .
Slide 2 : Talk 1 : The Coolest Perl Project I Ever Did
Around 1994
I was dating a woman who was a quilter .
To make a quilt , you take a lot of small pieces of fabric and sew them into a ' patch ' , then you sew some patches into ' blocks ' , and then you sew the blocks together into a quilt top .
Then you sandwich the quilt top with a quilt back ( usually a single piece of fabric ) and cotton batting in between , and that 's a quilt .
There are a lot of traditional quilt blocks , with names like log cabin , courthouse steps , flying geese , corn and beans , broken dishes , and so on .
I got to wondering if the space of possible blocks had been mostly explored or not .
So I wrote some Perl programs to generate quilt blocks .
I decided to investigate arrangements of what are known as ``half - square triangles '' , where you have squares that are diagonally split into two triangles .
I enumerated all the ways to sew together four half - square triangles .
Then I took each of these and put together four copies of it into a rotationally - symmetric block .
It turns out that there are exactly 72 ways to do this .
My enumeration had a bug , so I came up with 73 .
A fun puzzle is to figure out which one is repeated .
Anyway , as I said , I did this project to impress my girlfriend , and she was indeed impressed .
So this was not only the coolest Perl project I ever did , but also the most successful .
When we got married , she actually made the quilt for me and give it to me as a wedding present --- you can see a bit of it in the background on that last picture .
There 's a long tradition of puzzle quilts , so she left in the duplicated block .
To make room ( because it 's very hard to make a quilt with 73 blocks , since 73 is a prime number ) she left out one of the other blocks --- it 's fourth from the left in the fifth row .
Source code and more outputs are here .
There 's been a puzzling trend in the Perl world in the last few years , away from use of the system function , which invokes an external shell command .
There are good reasons to avoid system in some circumstances , but people are becoming increasingly dogmatic about avoiding system at all costs .
I was particularly struck by something that happened to me a year or two ago .
The program that manufactures my conference slides takes a large text file , splits it into slides , and then runs Seth Golub 's txt2html program on each of the text files to convert them to HTML .
txt2html is rather slow , so I do n't want to run it on every slide every time ; instead , the wrapper keeps a backup of each text file , and compares the new version of each text file to the backup to determine which ones need to be run through txt2html .
To do the comparison between the old and the new versions of the text file , the program uses the standard Unix cmp program , which compares two files byte - by - byte and reports whether they are the same .
I mentioned this approach on the #perl IRC channel once , and I was immediately set upon by several people who said I was using the wrong approach , that I should not be shelling out for such a simple operation .
Some said I should use the Perl File : : Compare module ; most others said I should maintain a database of MD5 checksums of the text files , and regenerate HTML for files whose checksums did not match those in the database .
I think the greatest contribution of the Extreme Programming movement may be the saying ``Do the simplest thing that could possibly work . ''
Programmers are mostly very clever people , and they love to do clever things .
I think programmers need to try to be less clever , and to show more restraint .
Using system ( " cmp -s $ file1 $ file2 " ) is in fact the simplest thing that could possibly work .
It was trivial to write , it 's efficient , and it works .
MD5 checksums are not necessary .
I said as much on IRC .
People have trouble understanding the archaic language of ``sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof , '' so here 's a modern rendering , from the New American Standard Bible : ``Do not worry about tomorrow ; for tomorrow will care for itself .
Each day has enough trouble of its own . '' ( Matthew 6:34 )
People on IRC then argued that calling cmp on each file was wasteful , and the MD5 approach would be more efficient .
I said that I did n't care , because the typical class contains about 100 slides , and running cmp 100 times takes about four seconds .
The MD5 thing might be more efficient , but it can't possibly save me more than four seconds per run .
So who cares ?
So far I have no objection to the discussion ; it 's just a difference of opinion .
But at this point the discussion went awry .
The IRC folks just could n't hear me ; they could n't let go of the idea that cmp was Wrong .
They started arguing with me about the time taken up by fork and exec , after I had already pointed out that there was no performance problem to be solved .
A more thoughtful examination of the performance issue shows that even if we do consider it a problem , the MD5 thing may not solve it . system ( " cmp " ) does fork and exec , but once cmp is running , it 's extremely fast , since what it 's doing is extremely simple .
Moreover , if the files differ , it can usually quit early , without having to read past the first block of each file .
In contrast , MD5 needs to read an entire file and perform a lot of complicated calculations to come up with the checksum , and then it has to read the database for the old checksum .
A couple of years later I implemented the MD5 thing , just to see what would happen , and sure enough , the program became slower .
One of Perl 's big selling points has been that it 's useful as a ' glue language ' , for gluing other tools together .
It still excels as a glue language .
Why this desire to absorb all those other tools into Perl ?
One of Perl 's mottoes has been that Perl might not be as fast as C , but you can write a prototype program in Perl quickly , and then you might discover that there 's no need to replace the prototype because it 's already fast enough .
That 's exactly what I did with txt2slides .
When I wrote the cmp line , I thought ``Well , this might not be fast enough , but if it is n't , I 'll change it later . ''
Then it was fast enough , so I did n't bother to change it .
That 's what 's supposed to happen !
Why is n't this considered a tremendous success for the Perl Way ?
Let 's not forget the things that are good about Perl .
It 's good at interacting with other programs , and it 's good for rapid prototyping .
Let 's not hassle people when they use Perl the way it was designed to be used .
This is me at YAPC 19000 in Pittsburgh .
My wife made this hat for me for my first appearance at a conference " guru session " .
I released the Text :: Template module several years ago , and it was immediately very successful .
It 's small , simple , fast , and it does a lot of things well .
At the time , there were not yet 29 templating systems available on CPAN .
Anyway , the module quickly stabilized .
I would get bug reports , and they would turn out to be bugs in the module 's users , not in the module ; I would get feature requests , and usually it turned out that what the requester wanted was possible , or even easy , without any changes to the module .
Since the module was perfect , there was no need to upload new versions of it to CPAN .
But then I started to get disturbing emails .
`` Hi , I notice you have not updated Text : : Template for nine months .
Are you still maintaining it ? ''
`` Hi , I notice you seem to have stopped work on Text : : Template .
Have you decided to abandon this approach ? ''
`` Hi , I was thinking of using Text : : Template , but I saw it was n't being maintained any more , so I decided to use Junk : : CrappyTemplate , because I need wanted to be sure of getting support for it . ''
I started wondering if maybe the thing to do was to release a new version of Text : : Template every month , with no changes , but with an incremented version number .
Of course , that 's ridiculous .
But it seems that people assume that if you do n't update the module every month , it must be dead .
People seem to think that all software requires new features or frequent bug fixes .
Apparently , the idea of software that does n't get updated because it 's finished is inconceivable .
I blame Microsoft .
Here I am at YAPC 19100 again .
I had taught classes at LISA in San Diego on Tuesday , and then I flew overnight to Pittsburgh for YAPC on Wednesday .
When I arrived , Kevin Lenzo told me that Joe Hall had been snowed in at Chicago , and asked if I could do some impromptu talks to fill up his slots in the schedule .
I gave seven hours of talks that day .
Here 's another puzzle about Text : : Template .
People often write to me with new feature requests .
For example , people want the package to preprocess the code in the templates before evaluating it , or to infer the template syntax from the template file extension .
Often these things are very application specific , so I do n't want to bloat the module with them , and anyway , they can easily be accomplished by subclassing the module and overriding one or another of the methods .
Usually I 'll even write the subclass and send it with my reply .
However , this straightforward solution is usually rejected .
People want me to put the code into Text :: Template itself and release a new version .
I had originally concluded that this reluctance to subclass modules was just irrational behavior .
After all , one of the major promises of object - oriented programming is the opportunity for code reuse via inheritance .
This benefit is being thrown away .
A related data point is that very few CPAN modules subclass other CPAN modules .
Has - A relationships are common , but Is - A relationships are rare .
But after a little more thought , I decided this might not be entirely irrational .
Slide 15 shows an example :
We want Text :: Template to run all the code fragments through a preprocessor before evaluating them when it is filling out a template .
To do this is very easy .
You subclass the module and add a new method , which installs a preprocessor function into the Text : : Template object when it is called .
Then you override the Text :: Template : : compile method to invoke the preprocessor if there is one , and then call the real compile method .
This is all pretty easy .
But there are a couple of big problems here .
First , the subclass depends on the fact that the Text : : Template object is a blessed hash , which is not guaranteed anywhere .
It also depends on the fact that the object is not using the PREPROCESSOR key for anything else , and , moreover , that it wo n't ever use it for anything else .
It also depends on the presence of the compile method , which is undocumented and which therefore might go away in a future version of the module , breaking the subclass .
So you could do the subclass , but you would never be sure that it would n't break someday .
It depends on too many things that I did n't promise .
I 'm not sure what to do about this .
Larry said that the problem was Perl 's poor object model .
I disagreed .
A better model will help solve the hash key collision problem , but not the undocumented method problem .
I suggested that perhaps one solution would be for modules to start including an explicit SUBCLASSING INTERFACE section in their documentation , spelling out just what guarantees the author would make for subclasses .
Here I am at an early Usenix conference , probably around 1992 .
Slide 17 : Talk 5 : Getting Help From Strangers
I get a lot of mail from people I 've never met , asking for help .
Usually , I try to help , but some of the mail is so awful that all I can do is throw it away .
Here 's some advice on getting strangers to give you help .
Here we see the wrong way to go about it .
This person has no name , or at least none that they told me .
Maybe I 'm an old - fuddy - duddy , but I like to know who I 'm talking to .
If they want their homies to call them ``Stick - on Smooth ' ' , that 's fine , but when they write to me they should have a real name .
The Subject is uninformative .
It says Your article .
I write a lot of articles .
Is it a magazine article ?
A Usenet article ?
I have no idea .
Then comes the question : `` What does forkish mean ? ''
Apparently I must have used the word ``forkish '' in some article somewhere .
I have no idea any more what I meant by it .
So now I have to go use Google to figure out what I was talking about .
`` This is very important . ''
Not to me !
( Or , as someone said to me afterwards , ``Gosh , I 'll be sure to clear my schedule ! '')
I 'm not just being a grump here .
If this person would tell me why it was so important , I might agree .
But they do n't give me a chance to agree .
Having sent a letter that contains a question , you 're already implicitly asking for a response .
Adding Please respond makes it sound like you 're grovelling .
The only thing more annoying than Please respond is Please respond ASAP .
Here 's my rewrite of this letter into a form that I would have been more likely to answer .
What 's different ?
The sender has a name .
In the talk , I observed that it does n't even need to be their real name , as long as I can't tell the difference .
There 's an explanation of why the sender wants the answer .
It does n't have to be earth - shaking ; I make bets with my friends about trivia too , and I might be flattered that I 'm being cited as an authority .
There 's an explanation of how I came to be involved in this .
The sender cites the URL of my article , which makes it easy for me to find out what they 're talking about .
Better still would have been if they had quoted the relevant paragraph or sentence .
One thing I left out here was ' please ' .
On further reflection , I do n't think this is required if the rest of the note is polite and well - mannered .
Contrast this with the original note , which did say ' please ' but was neither polite nor well - mannered .
The corrected version may not say ' please ' , but the ' please ' is communicated nevertheless .
The original said ' please ' but managed to communicate the opposite .
Here 's a real example of a message that I did reply to , in some detail :

Subject : Big big stupid question - PLEASE HELP !!!
Content - Type : text / plain ; charset=us-ascii Content - Transfer - Encoding : 7bit
Hey there , I came upon your web page when I was looking for the answer to a stupid question which I 've started to become really curious about .
I really hope I do n't offend you by asking , but surely someone with computer knowledge , used to stupid questions , might know something ?
My friend 's at uni and she does n't have the first clue about computer programming .
So when her computer science tutorial left her with the homework question ``How much money is there in the world ? '' she was naturally a bit confused .
Not being too confident about my own answer ( we do n't know enough about the value of money to answer that one ... ) can you tell me what the hell this has to do with programming and computer science ?
Thanks in anticipation for any help you can give , Lo. xxxxx@keele.ac.uk
Here 's one of the more remarkable help requests I received .
The author is trying to get a Master 's degree in Armenia .
Apparently there is no library in Armenia , because they are asking me for information on ``Lexico - grammatical peculiarities of the language of constitution ' ' .
Why me ?
I have absolutely no idea .
I did n't bother to answer this one .
I feel sorry for the Armenian student , because I suppose there is not much money in Armenia , and the library might not be well - stocked .
But this is not a problem I can solve , or should be asked to solve .
If you 're a master 's student , and you find that there is a dearth of information on your chosen thesis topic , the correct response is to pick a different topic .
This picture was taken around 1991 at a party in Las Vegas , New Mexico .
This was the occasion on which I first met Nat Torkington , the OSCON program chair , and also the party at which Nat first met Jenine , who is now his wife .
When the picture came up on the screen at OSCON , some people whistled .
But I shamefacedly admitted that I had posted this picture on ratemyface.com , and it had received a rating of only 6 .
Slides 19 - 22 : Talk 6 : How to Progress
Someone asked on PerlMonks ``How to progress ' ' .
Here are my notes on how to become smarter , which is something I hope we 'd all like to do .
Read books other people are n't reading
The computer programming community tends to follow fads in which everyone reads the same books at the same time .
For example , books on extreme programming or design patterns .
I think this is unfortunate .
If you read books that other people are not reading , then you will know different things from the things they know , and when they come to you with a problem they can't solved , you might be able to solve it with your different equipment .
When everyone in the community reads the same books , you can an inward - looking , intellectually impoverished community that can only contemplate its own navel .
When we read all different books , we all have more to learn from each other .
In the talk , I was about to list some books I had read recently that I thought other people had n't , but then I stopped and said I would n't do it because I was afraid people would then go out and read those books .
Read original source materials .
It 's all very well to read what someone has said about what someone else said about some topic , but a lot of the time you get a clearer picture if you go to the original source , and find out for yourself what was said about the topic .
One of the reasons that subjects become important and their inventors become famous is because the inventors were able to describe the subject so clearly .
I tried reading books about design patterns a while ago , and I was underwhelmed .
But a lot of people are interested in design patterns ; why is that ?
I went back to the original Christopher Alexander books and found out why : pattern languages are a brilliant idea and Alexander 's books about them are works of genius .
Here are some other original sources that are excellent : Einstein 's book on special relativity is the thing to read if you want to learn about special relativity .
Galileo's book on mechanics , Discourses on Two New Sciences , may be the single best technical book I 've ever read on any subject .
Read actively .
Many people have the idea that you read a technical book the way you read a trashy novel , by just sitting back to let the ideas flow into your mind .
This does n't work well .
You will get a lot more out of it if you read actively : Read a sentence .
Then reflect for a long time .
Ask questions about it .
When you 're done , read the next sentence .
I think I explained this really well in my original PerlMonks article , so I 'll reproduce the relevant section here :
Do the same thing when you read the Perl manual .
Read a sentence .
I will pick a sentence from the Perl manual at random : Line 2000 of perlfunc , whatever that is : getpgrp Returns the current process group for the specified PID .
Great example .
What is a process group ?
What is it for ?
When would I want to use getpgrp ?
What is an actual application in which I would need getpgrp ?
What is another ?
What will getpgrp actually return ?
An integer , or what ?
What would be the best design here ?
( Then if the next sentence reveals that they did n't use the design you thought was best , try to figure out which one of you screwed up . )
Can this call ever fail ?
When ?
How ?
How will it report the error ?
What might the return value be in that case ?
( Then read on to see if you are correct . )
Are there permission or security problems here ?
Would it be dangerous to be able to get the process group ID for someone else 's process ?
And so on .
Then you go on to the next sentence .
If you read the whole manual like this , you will progress .
That 's what you wanted to know , right ?
How to progress .
Take notes .
This is not like in college , where you copy down everything the professor says because it might be on the exam .
As you read actively , note down the questions you have , things you find puzzling , places where you think you could have designed it better , relationships you notice with other things you 've read .
If you do n't have questions or puzzles , then you are reading the wrong thing and you should read something that you find more engaging .
Write down ideas you have .
Save them in a file .
A year later , you will be amazed at all the stuff you thought about that you have forgotten .
You will probably enjoy rereading these files , because most people find their own thoughts interesting .
The joke here is that the intermission for a 5 - minute talk is only 15 seconds long .
I thought people would laugh at this more than they did .
Some of the very biggest problems in computer science over the last 30 years have had to do with the idea of NP - completeness .
Here 's the short explanation .
There are a lot of problems that people would like to solve , but no good algorithms are known that work in general .
A typical example is the Travelling Salesman problem .
In the travelling salesman problem , you have a bunch of cities , a cost to travel between each pair of cities , and a budget .
The question is , is there a route that visits each city exactly once , returns to its starting point , and comes in under budget ?
NP - complete problems are characterized by the property that it 's easy to check proposed solutions to see if they 're correct .
If someone purports to have an under - budget itinerary for a particular example of the problem , it 's quick and trivial to add up the distances and check if they 're under budget .
But how do you come up with such an itinerary ?
Nobody knows .
The only known algorithm that always works is to examine every possible itinerary , looking for a route that is under budget .
There are hundreds of these NP - complete problems known , and the amazing thing is that an efficient solution to any of them could be turned mechanically into an efficient solution to all the others .
But nobody knows a solution to any of them !
Now here 's what the talk is about .
Sometimes someone will show up in a help forum with a problem they need to solve .
Someone else will observe ( correctly ) that the problem is NP - complete .
They will then say ``so you might as well give up . ''
This is the wrong conclusion .
Here 's an example .
Someone was writing a chat system .
When a new user logged into the chat system , the author wanted to examine their buddy list and report the largest group of their buddies who were ( a ) all online at the same time , and ( b ) all buddies of each other as well .
This is called the Clique problem , and it is NP - complete .
And sure enough , someone told them that they should give up on this feature .
Just knowing that a problem is NP - complete does not remove your need for it , and you should not be too quick to give up .
This is for several reasons .
First , there may be something about your particular application that renders the problem intractable .
In the case of the chat system person , it turns out that it 's not intractable at all .
This is because you do n't have to compute all the cliques at once .
If you assume that you have all the large cliques computed beforehand , then when a new user logs in , you do n't have to re-compute everything from scratch ; you just have to compute the cliques that involve this new user --- and you know that none of them will be more than one person larger than the onces you had before ; similarly you can easily compute the changes to the cliques when someone logs out .
The total amount of computation over the course of the day may be large , but it is amortized into small amounts whenever someone logs in or out .
NP - completeness is a statement about coming up with optimal solutions .
If sub -optimal solutions are acceptable , there may be easy ways to find them .
For example , consider the Bin Packing problem .
In this problem , you have a bunch of files , and you want to back them up onto floppy diskettes ; you want to use as few diskettes as possible .
This is NP - complete ; the only way to guarantee the minimal number of diskettes is essentially to try every possible way of distributing the files .
But there 's an easy algorithm that works quite well : sort the files from largest to smallest .
Put the largest file on the first diskette .
Put the next - largest file on the first diskette if it fits , and on a new diskette if not .
Put the third - largest file on the first diskette on which it fits , starting a new diskette if it does n't fit anywhere .
When you 're done , you may have used more than the minimum possible number of diskettes , but it turns out you never use more than 122 % of the minimum possible number , and in practice , you typically wo n't use more than about 105 % of the minimum possible number .
Travelling Salesman is similar .
If you want the least - cost itinerary , all you can do is enumerate every possible itinerary looking for the cheapest one .
But there are quick algorithms that are guaranteed to find an itinerary that costs no more than 50 % more than the cheapest one .
Lots of NP - complete problems can be solved optimally , and efficiently , in most cases ; NP - completeness is a statement about the hardest instances of a problem .
3 - Color is an example :
You have a bunch of people and their buddy lists , and you want to know if it 's possible to divide the people into three groups so that nobody is in the same group with one of their buddies .
There are heuristic techniques you can use to simplify the buddy lists until they 're trivial --- either you end up with four people who are all each other 's buddies , in which case the answer is obviously ``no ' ' , or you end up eliminating everything , in which case the answer is obviously ``yes ' ' .
On some really complicated arrangements of buddy lists , the heuristics do n't work , and they get stuck without simplifying the situation very much .
But those sorts of situations are pathological and do n't come up in practice very often .
In some NP - complete problems , there are efficient solutions for all the small examples , and nobody cares about the large ones .
In the Partition problem , you have a list of numbers , and you want to divide the numbers into two groups so that the sum of the numbers in each group is the same .
There 's a straightforward algorithm that 's quadratic in the size of the largest number .
Unless your numbers are really enormous , this algorithm works just fine .
In practical examples , the numbers typically represent costs or times , so you do n't have to worry about them getting really large .
So next time someone tells you to give up on your problem because it 's NP - complete , ignore them .
Here I am getting married .
Slide 31 : Talk 8 : Why I Hate strict
Actually I do n't hate strict ; I just hate the stupid way people think and talk about it .
strict is another dogma that has become increasingly prevalent in the community over the last few years .
Beginners are encouraged to use strict whether or not they know what it does .
What 's the point of that ?
Use of strict has somehow become identified as a necessary ingredient of ' good programming practice ' , and so beginners are encouraged to ' adopt good programming practices ' .
Sorry , but putting declarations into your program when you do n't know what they do is the worst possible programming practice , and this is what we are encouraging beginners to do .
As with the ' glue language ' discussion above , my complaint is n't so much about the position itself , whether people should use strict , as with the dogmatism and thoughtlessness with which it 's promulgated .
People have stopped thinking about strict , and that 's what I hate .
People come into the Usenet comp.lang.perl.misc group with some question , which they demonstrate with a four - line example program , and other folks there jump on them : `` Why did n't you use strict ?''
Well , because it's a four - line example program I concocted as an example in my Usenet article --- duh !
Here 's another example that 's not on the slide .
Some time ago there was a review on PerlMonks of the book Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web : Visual Quickstart Guide .
The reviewer was very unhappy that none of the examples used strict .
I said I could n't see any benefit that would accrue from the examples using strict .
strict does three things :
Here 's the problem : the reviewer of my book read my criticism , and instead of answering my objections , his response was that everyone should always use strict .
Using strict is outside of the bounds of rational discussion for some people .
The example linked from the slides demonstrates this .
A programmer posted to comp.lang.perl.misc with an example that manufactured a function name at run time , and then called the function .
Many people jumped in to say this was a mistake , some even saying it was a mistake because it caused a strict ' refs ' violation .
This is nonsense .
Violating strict ' refs ' is like setting off the fire alarm .
It is a warning that something dangerous may be occurring ; it is not a problem in itself .
The problem is the fire .
What is the fire , the real problem , in this case ?
I wrote a series of widely - read and often - cited articles about the problems that arise from using values as the names of variables and functions .
Before responding to this thread , I read over the articles , checking each problem I mentioned to see if it could occur in the original programmer 's code .
None of the real problems could actually arise .
I said that I was not able to see what the problem was , and asked people to explain it .
The explanations were astonishingly obtuse .
Some people reiterated that one should ' always use strict '.
Some suggested problems that obviously could not occur .
For example , one respondent said :
What if some random string was passed in from the outside and a bad sub was called ?
But the original author 's code was :
foreach my $x ( " email_zip " , " email_txt " , " cp_zip " , " cp_txt " ) { if ( $res = & {" _send_$ x " }( $ domain , $ file , $ date , $ location ) ) { push ( @results , $ res ) ; } ... }
The subroutine names are not ' passed in from the outside ' ; they are hardwired into the program .
It is completely impossible for a ' bad sub ' to be called here ; the four subroutines that are called are completely determined at compile time .
That respondent continued :
At least check the sub name against a hash for verification .
This shows that at least this one person was n't thinking about what he was saying .
The subroutine names are derived from a compile - time list of names embedded in the code .
If you do n't trust this list to be accurate , why would you expect the hash to be accurate ?
I suggested that maybe you should first check the hash against a second hash to make sure the hash is correct , before using it for verification .
Any time you hear anyone saying ``you should be using strict , '' you can be fairly sure they 're not thinking about what they 're saying , because strict has these three completely unrelated effects .
A more thoughtful remark is ``you should be using strict ' vars ' '' ( or whatever ) .
As an exercise in preventing strict zombie - ism , ask yourself ``Which of the three strict effects do I find most useful ?
Which do I find least useful ? ''
Here I am as a South Park character .
The #perl IRC channel has a big problem .
People come in asking questions , say , ``How do I remove the first character from a string ? ''
And the answer they get from the regulars on the channel is something like `` perldoc perlre '' .
This is n't particularly helpful , since perlre is a very large reference manual , and even I have trouble reading it .
It 's sort of like telling someone to read the Camel book when what they want to know is how to get the integer part of a number .
Sure , the answer is in there somewhere , but it might take you a year to find it .
The channel regulars have this idiotic saying about how if you give a man a fish he can eat for one day , but if you teach him to fish , he can eat for his whole life .
Apparently ``perldoc perlre '' is what passes for ``teaching a man to fish '' in this channel .
I 'm more likely to just answer the question ( you use $ string =~ s/.//s ) and someone once asked me why .
I had to think about that a while .
Two easy reasons are that it 's helpful and kind , and if you 're not in the channel to be helpful and kind , then what 's the point of answering questions at all ?
It 's also easy to give the answer , so why not ?
I 've seen people write long treatises on why the querent should be looking in the manual instead of asking on - channel , which it would have been a lot shorter to just answer the question .
That 's a puzzle all right .
The channel regulars say that answering people 's questions will make them dependent on you for assistance , which I think is bullshit .
Apparently they 're worried that the same people will come back and ask more and more and more questions .
They seem to have forgotten that if that did happen ( and I do n't think it does ) they could stop answering ; problem solved .
The channel regulars also have this fantasy that saying perldoc perlre is somehow more helpful than simply answering the question , which I also think is bullshit .
Something they apparently have n't figured out is that if you really want someone to look in the manual , saying perldoc perlre is not the way to do it .
A much more effective way to get them to look in the manual is to answer the question first , and then , after they thank you , say `` You could have found the answer to that in the such - and - so section of the manual . ''
People are a lot more willing to take your advice once you have established that you are a helpful person .
Saying perldoc perlre seems to me to be most effective as a way to get people to decide that Perl programmers are assholes and to quit Perl for some other language .
After I wrote the slides for this talk I found an old Usenet discussion in which I expressed many of the same views .
One of the Usenet regulars went so far as to say that he did n't answer people 's questions because he did n't want to insult their intelligence by suggesting that they would be unable to look in the documentation , and that if he came into a newsgroup with a question and received a straightforward answer to it , he would be offended .
I told him that I thought if he really believed that he needed a vacation , because it was totally warped .
I 'm told that I was cold sober when this picture was taken .
I do n't remember .
Slide 39 : Talk 10 : Why Lisp Will Never Win
There are a lot of things wrong with the Lisp user community .
comp.lang.lisp is one of the sickest newsgroups I 've ever seen .
This article conveniently demonstrates two serious problems at once .
At least two or three times a year , comp.lang.lisp has a long discussion about why it is that more people do n't use Lisp .
In one of those discussions , Peter da Silva suggested that if there were a ' lispscript ' utility , analogous to AWK , which allowed people to easily do the sorts of things that AWK , then people would begin using Lisp for casual scripting , and would go from there to longer projects .
His example was :
awk ' BEGIN { FS= " : " } ; $ 6== " / sbin/nologin " { print $ 1} '
/etc / passwd
The brilliantly obtuse response is in two parts .
First , `` You can do that already ' ' :
I already frequently use it for casual scripting ( well , Scheme , mostly ) .
With only a couple of new utility macros & functions , your example could be expressed in Common Lisp as : ( with - lines - from - file ( line " / etc / passwd " ) ( let ( ( fields ( string - split line : fs # \ : ) ) ) ( when ( string= ( aref fields 5 ) " / sbin/nologin " ) ( format t " ~ A ~ % " ( aref fields 0 ) ) ) ) ) )
This solution is a little over 2.5 times as long as the AWK version .
But at least it only requires ``a couple of new utility macros and functions ' '!
The only thing more amazing than the degree to which the author missed the point of the exercise here is the degree to which he seems unaware that he missed the point of the exercise .
So problem # 1 is a total cluelessness about what other people consider valuable and useful .
But the respondent goes on , and here 's a more serious problem :
But seriously , how many ``one - liners ' ' do you actually write anyway ?
Not many .
And by the time you 've done coded up something that 's complex enough to be useful , Perl 's tricky little code - compression notation usually expands to be about the same length as any other language , and six weeks or six months later I 'd much rather be reading Lisp than decoding a Perl puzzle .
How many ``one - liners '' do I actually write ?
I do n't know ; maybe a couple dozen a day .
But I guess I must be unusual , because as we all know , AWK was a complete failure and vanished into obscurity since it did n't address anyone 's real needs .
( That was sarcasm . )
So problem # 2 is that when faced with someone else 's problem which Lisp does n't solve effectively , the response is a mixture of ``that 's not a real problem ' ' and ``you 're an idiot for wanting to solve that . ''
Another thing to notice is the little slam against Perl .
How did Perl get involved in this ?
Da Silva was discussing Awk , not Perl .
But the comp.lang.lisp folks can't stop talking about Perl .
They are constantly talking about Perl .
I looked into comp.lang .
python to see if it was similar , and I found out that people in comp.lang .
python hardly ever discuss Perl .
I think that shows that comp.lang.lisp is sick and comp.lang .
python is healthy : the Lisp folks are interested in Perl , and the Python folks are interested in Python .
Here 's the real reason why Lisp wo n't win .
The Lisp programmers do n't want it to win .
They 're always complaining that not enough people are using Lisp , and that Lisp is n't popular .
But they humiliate and insult newcomers whenever they appear in the group .
( The group regulars would no doubt respond to this that the newcomers deserve this , because they 're so stupid and argumentative . )
If Lisp did become popular , it would be the worst nightmare of the comp.lang.lisp people .
Lisp is a really excellent language in a lot of ways , but the Lisp world has several huge social problems .
I 'd like to help , but I do n't think I can , because they do n't want to hear it from anyone , and least of all from me .
I 'd just come back from the ophthalmologist .
This talk was inspired by a thread in comp.lang.perl.misc , where someone said that Perl was a ' weakly typed ' language , and Randal Schwartz disagreed and said it was ' strongly typed ' .
That surprised me , because I would have used Perl as a perfect example of a ' weakly typed ' language , since any kind of data will be silently converted to any other kind at run time .
I wanted to dispute Randal , but first I needed to make sure that my understanding of ' strongly typed ' was correct .
So I did a little research and discovered that my understanding was not correct .
I read a lot of articles and class notes written by a lot of authorities , and discovered that there was no consensus about whether C was a ' strongly typed ' or a ' weakly typed ' language .
Slide 43 has some examples of each .
I found a lot of web pages that contrasted C and Pascal , and asserted that Pascal was a ' strongly typed ' language while C was ' weakly typed ' .
But the type systems of C and Pascal are almost exactly the same !
After reading a lot of articles , I discovered that different people had at least eight different notions of what ' strongly typed language ' meant .
Sometimes they were n't even sure themselves ; I found some articles which defined ' strongly typed language ' and then classified languages as strongly or weakly typed in explicit accord with some other definition that contradicted the one they had first given .
My conclusion is that ' strongly typed language ' does n't mean anything at all , and that if you hear someone say that some language is strongly typed , or some other language is weakly typed , you should assume that you do n't know what they meant .
Slide 47 : Talk 12 : A Message for the Aliens
Two researchers put together a message for the aliens and then used the Arecibo radio telescope to shoot it out into space ; I forget in what direction .
When I found this , I had a great time trying to decipher the message .
It 's fun to pretend you 're an alien , and also fun to see if you 're as smart as the researchers thought the aliens would be .
If you want to try this , I suggest you put away the rest of this talk and come back to it afterwards , because it contains spoilers .
The message is 23 pages long .
I left page 1 up on the screen for a couple of minutes so that people could try to figure it out .
You might want to try that now .
Anyway , the first page defines the symbols for the ten numerals .
Then there follows a list of prime numbers , from 2 up to 89 , and then 23021377 - 1 , which is the largest known prime .
I like to imagine the aliens ' reaction to this .
Either they 'll be astounded ( ``How could they figure out that such a big number is prime ? '' ) or unimpressed ( `` Pff , is that the best they can do ? ' ')
I wonder which it will be ?
Page 2 explains the definitions of the four basic arithmetic operators .
My favorite page is # 14 , which explains the basic structure of our planet .
There 's a picture of land , dipping into the ocean , and the chemical composition of land ( Mostly SiO 2 ) , sea ( Mostly H 2 O , plus Na and Cl ) , and air ( Mostly N 2 , O 2 , and Ar ) , with the height of the atmosphere and depth of the ocean shown .
A previous diagram showed pictures of people , and smaller cartoons of people are shown here , standing on the land part , to show what part of the planet we live on .
My favorite part of the picture is the parabola over on the right - hand edge .
What 's going on there ?
Well , we do n't want the aliens to decode the picture sideways or upside down , and the parabola is showing an object accelerating under the influence of gravity , implying a clear ' down ' to the picture .
Just to make it clearer , the parabola is annotated with the glyph for ' acceleration ' .
One interesting thing about the message is that it contains some errors .
For example , on page 7 , the 3rd glyph from the right in the third row is wrong .
That part of the message ( mistakenly ) asserts the existence of Uranium - 208 .
The glyph is a 1 and it should be a 4 .
I was rather confused when I got to this part , and wondered what I had done wrong .
( Someone in the audience asked ``Did you send a patch ? ''
I had sent the authors a message pointing out the error , but they did not seem to be very grateful . )
Another stumper appeared on page 16 .
This page is describing human sensory modalities .
For example , the graph at the bottom of the page is explaining the way our cone cells respond to red , green , and blue light .
The three peaks on the graph are labeled with the frequencies light that are best received by the three kinds of cone cells .
I was totally mystified by the diagram above this , with the waves .
Finally I had to read the paper that explained the message .
It turns out that this is supposed to be a picture of sound waves , with the minimum and maximum audible sonic frequencies .
I was really annoyed by this , because the picture is wrong .
The picture clearly shows transverse waves ( in which the medium is moving up and down , perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is travelling ) but sound waves are not transverse !
They are longitudinal waves , or pressure waves ; the particles of air move back and forth , parallel to the direction in which the waves are moving , creating regions of high and low pressure .
There 's no reason why the picture could n't have been drawn correctly .
Additionally , the illustration could have been annotated with the glyph for ' pressure ' , which was previously defined , but it was n't .
So not only are the aliens going to think we 're bad proofreaders , because of the Uranium - 208 mistake , but they 'll also think that we do n't understand pressure waves .
My conclusion was that the kind of people who like to send messages to the aliens are a little goofy .
Or , perhaps that I could have done it better .
People who know me wo n't find it at all surprising that I came to this conclusion .
Another illustration from The Uncanny X - Men # 21 .
It 's a fine , fine thing to be named ' Dominus ' , let me tell you .
Thanks for reading my talk notes .

The First Battle of the Civil War Is Difficult to Determine Civil War facts show that the first battle of the great American war is difficult to determine and remains a debate among historians to this very day .
The most common choices for the first battle of the Civil War are generally the First Battle of Bull Run ( known also as the First Manassas by the Confederate side ) or the Battle of Fort Sumter .
The Battle of Fort Sumter was actually the first battle chronologically , but it only involved bombarding , not an actual man - to - man battle .
The First Battle of Bull Run was indeed the first major battle of the four - year - long conflict , but it was preceded by more than a month by the Battle of Philippi , which is sometimes considered only a skirmish and not a real battle , although over 4,000 men were involved .
The Secession of the Southern States Was Determined Unconstitutional by the Supreme Court Prior to the actual start of the Civil War , 11 states seceded from the Union , starting with South Carolina in December 1860 , Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia and Louisiana in January 1861 , Texas in February 1861 and the last four states ( Virginia , Arkansas , North Carolina and Tennessee ) between April and June 1861 .
Although the Union eventually won the war and dispelled the new - founded Confederation , many Civil War facts deal with the question of whether the secession was legal in the first place .
The answer is no , although it was ruled illegal only after the war .
The United States Supreme Court , in Texas v. White , ruled that secession was unconstitutional in 1869 .
Chief Justice Salmon Chase explained , “ The ordinance of secession … and all the acts of legislature intended to give effect to that ordinance , were absolutely null .
They were utterly without operation in law . ”
The Battle of Gettysburg Was the Bloodiest Battle of the Civil War The Battle of Gettysburg is one of the most famous battles of the Civil War , but Civil War facts unfortunately reveal also that is was the bloodiest battle of them all ( when taking the total number of casualties into account ) .
After 3 days of battle between July 1 and July 3 , 1863 , 51,000 individuals of both sides were killed , wounded , captured or missing .
This battle is not only memorable by the number of its casualties , but also because it was the turning point in the war – the Confederate Army under the leadership of General Robert E. Lee suffered its first major loss in the war at Gettysburg , giving the Union a chance of winning the war .
Although the war lasted for an additional two years after the battle , it is considered by many to be the turning point of the war .
The second bloodiest battle was the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1963 , claiming over 34,000 casualties .
And the bloodiest one - day battle in the Civil War ?
The Battle of Sharpsburg in September 1862 with more than 22,000 casualties .

Slavery Was One of the Most Important Causes of the Civil War Civil War facts show that the causes for the war were many and complex , and also controversial during the war itself , further complicated by historical revisionists who always search for new answers and explanations .
The simple truth is that slavery was the central reason for tensions among the states and the Republican Party was determined to put an end to slavery .
When Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 Presidential election for the Republicans without winning in a single Southern state , the South felt alienated and saw secession as their only option .
Secession intensified the tensions and eventually led to the war .
There Were Nearly 10,500 Battles in the American Civil War Civil War facts demonstrate the almost unbelievable battle statistics of the Civil War – nearly 10,500 battles were fought in total , with nearly 50 major battles and approximately 100 others that were of major importance to the end result .
But that is only the fighting which is considered an actual battle ; there were many other skirmishes , naval engagements , sieges , bombardments and similar .
All in all , the war was fought in 23 different states ( most battles took place in Virginia ) and resulted in over 650,000 casualties .
The following battles are most often considered to be the most significant : the Battle of First Bull Run , the Battle of Shiloh , the Battle of Antietam ( also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg ) , the Battle of Vicksburg , the Seven Days Campaign , the Battle of Gettysburg , the Battle of Chattanooga and the Battle of Fort Sumter .
The Civil War Battles Were Usually Named after Geographical Features in the Area
The naming of battles in the Civil War is sometimes complicated by some battles having two names – one given by the Union and one given by the Confederacy .
The Union usually named their battles after bodies of water ( rivers , creeks and similar ) or other significant geographical features on or near the battlefield .
On the other hand , the Confederacy named their battles after nearby towns , settlements or other manmade landmarks .
Two of the most famous battles of the Civil War were the Battle of Antietam for Northerners ( the Battle of Sharpsburg for Southerners ) and the First Battle of Bull Run for Northerners ( the First Manassas for Southerners ) .
The Civil War Began in South Carolina and Ended in Virginia
The greatest conflict in history on American soil began in South Carolina on April 12 , 1861 when Confederate shore batteries under the leadership of General P.G.T. Beauregard started firing on the Union - held Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor .
The official end of the war is usually cited as being almost exactly four years later , on April 8 , 1865 when the Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered his army at the McLean House in the village of Appomattox Court House in Virginia .
Although there were some minor battles and skirmishes after this date , it is generally considered as the official end of war .
The Abolishment of Slavery Is One of the Most Important Results of the Civil War Slavery was one of the most important reasons why the war even started in the first place , so it seems reasonable to call the abolishment of slavery the most important result of the Civil War .
There were , however , many other consequences of the war too – both positive and negative : the reinforcement of the concept of “ One America ” with the Union and the Confederation dissolved , the preservation of territorial integrity , the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln ( just three days after General Lee ’s surrender ) , the beginning of the Reconstruction Era and the establishment of the Ku Klux Klan , the extremist group that advocates white supremacy , extreme nationalism and anti-immigration politics , whose third reincarnation ( the Third KKK ) is still active today .
The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln Was a Part of the Civil War Just three days after General Lee surrendered his forces to the Union in Virginia , on the evening of April 14 , 1865 , John Wilkes Booth , a pro-slavery Confederate sympathiser , shot President Lincoln in the head as the President was watching a play at the Ford ’s Theatre in Washington .
Lincoln died the next morning and Civil War facts reveal that he had premonitions about his death and expected something to happen .
Although the leader of the Union was assassinated , this could n’t change the fact that the Union had won the war .
Lincoln ’s efforts were continued by Andrew Johnson , his Vice President , who succeeded him in office after the assassination , and their collaborators who guided the USA through the demanding Reconstruction Era that followed the Civil War .

A Large Proportion of Civil War Deaths
Were as a Result of Disease Civil War facts statistics show that of the more than 650,000 people that died in the Civil War , two - thirds of them did n’t die directly as a result of battling , but died of various diseases .
Medicine of the time was far from what it is today , and there were no effective antiseptics , which could have greatly reduced the spread of disease .
George Worthington Adams , the author of the book “ Doctors in Blue : the Medical History of the Union Army in the Civil War ” has said , “ The Civil War was fought in the very last years of the medical middle ages . ”
Considering that doctors of the time used chloroform , ether or whisky as the main aesthetics , he must have been right in saying that .
Had medicine been more advanced then , there would have been far fewer casualties in the Civil War .
Women Had an Important Role in the American Civil War Women legally had no right to fight in the war , but many disguised themselves as men to be able to participate .
It is estimated that 400 - 800 women fought in the Civil War .
Their motivation ?
The same as the motivation of men : ardent patriotism , promise of reliable wages , desire for adventure or sharing the experience with their loved ones .
But women who did n’t fight in the war carried out many other important duties that supported the men who fought – a lot of women served as nurses or spies .
Some of the most famous women involved in or connected to the Civil War were Harriet Beecher Stowe , the author of Uncle Tom ’s Cabin – a book which exposed the harshness of slavery to the North – Harriet Tubman , an escaped slave who worked as a spy for the Union , and Clara Barton , a nurse who established the American Red Cross .
The Civil War Is Considered the First Modern War Civil War facts reveal that the American Civil War is considered to be the first modern war in human history , since many advanced warfare machinery and techniques were used for the first time .
This advanced warfare included the use of mines , rapid fire weapons , rifles , submarines , railroads , ironclad ships , aerial observation and also telegraphs and telecommunication for military intelligence .
The Civil War was also the first true industrial war – a war where industry was widely used for the war effort , with civilian factories , shipyards , banks and transportation companies all playing an important role in the war .
More Men Died during the American Civil War than in Any Other American Conflict Approximately 650,000 people died in the Civil War , making it the bloodiest conflict on American soil in the country ’s history .
More Americans died in the Civil War than in World War I , World War II , the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined .
All in all , 2 % of the population died – equivalent to 6 million men ( and women ) today .
Rifles were the deadliest weapons of the war , but the majority of men still died of disease such as malaria , mumps , chicken pox , measles and other epidemics that rapidly spread through unhygienic camps .
The Civil War Was Also Fought at Sea Many people are not aware of the fact that the Civil War was also fought at sea .
Civil
War facts show that the war was fought on the Atlantic Ocean , in the Gulf of Mexico and many rivers of the mainland .
Gunboats , shore batteries and ironclad ships had an important impact on the way the war was fought and also shaped the way many future wars were fought .
The U.S. Navy , under the control of the Union government , was small at the beginning of the war , but rapidly grew in the following years , reaching 6,000 officers , 45,000 men and nearly 700 vessels by 1865 .
Its main purpose was to block the Confederate ports and consequently weaken their economy and ability to provide soldiers with basic necessities .
The Union Army Was Surprisingly Multi-Cultural
It is estimated that the Union Army ’s strength surpassed 2,000,000 men over the total duration of the war , including many foreign soldiers that made the Union Army a true multi-cultural force .
By some estimates , 7.5 % of soldiers were Irish and 10 % German .
In addition , there were many immigrant soldiers from France , Italy , Poland , England and Scotland .
On average , foreigners were the majority in one in four regiments .
From 1863 , black soldiers were also permitted to join the Union army ( about 1 in 10 soldiers was African - American ) – a decision that might have won the war for the Union in the end …

Black Union Soldiers Were Paid a Lot Less than White Union Soldiers
Although the main purpose of the Union was to unite the USA and end slavery , black soldiers received much smaller wages than white Union soldiers .
In 1863 , when blacks were first allowed to join the Union army , they were paid $ 10 per month with a deducted fee of $ 3 for clothing .
White soldiers were paid at least $ 13 per month and were not required to pay any clothes fee .
But black Union soldiers were not ready to suffer this inequality any further ; they rebelled and protested by refusing their salaries for 18 months , and Congress , pressured by abolitionist congressmen , finally decided to improve the situation in September 1864 by paying fair wages to their black soldiers .
For many of them this meant that they were able to send some money home to their families for the first time in their lives …
Robert E. Lee Is Considered the Bloodiest General of the Civil War Although Mary Lincoln , the wife of President Abraham Lincoln , labeled the Union General Ulysses S. Grant a “ butcher ” ( for the big losses his army suffered in the Overland Campaign in 1864 ) , it is actually a general from the other side – the famous Robert E. Lee – who deserves the title of the bloodiest general of the Civil War .
Losses in the Confederate army , when counted proportionally , were far greater than losses in the Union army , making General Robert E. Lee the real “ butcher ” of the war .
Civil War Soldiers Were Often Buried on the Battlefield after They Fell
The sheer number of casualties made it impossible to give all the fallen men a proper burial , so soldiers were typically buried right where they had fallen on the battlefield .
Soldiers who died in hospitals were usually buried in the vicinity .
Some of the bodies were later exhumed and moved to National or Confederate cemeteries , but the sheer number of casualties again prevented burial of all the bodies in the proper way .
There are without a doubt still thousands and thousands of soldiers from the Civil War resting in unknown battlefield graves across the country .
The Civil War Is a War of Many Names Most people in the USA nowadays know the war under the name the Civil War , and people in other parts of the world most often refer to it as the American Civil War .
In addition , the war has also had many different names in the past .
Northerners have called it the War to Preserve the Union , the War of the Southern Rebellion ( or just the War of Rebellion ) or the War to Make Men Free .
Southerners have called it ( and sometimes still do ) the War Between the States or the War of Northern Aggression .
There were also two more neutral terms popular at the time ( for those who did n’t want to upset either side ) : the Late Unpleasantness and Mr. Lincoln ’s War .
Civil War Soldiers Often Used Books instead of Toilet Paper Civil War facts also reveal details of soldiers ’ lives on the battlefields that are not directly connected to fighting .
Did you know that Civil War soldiers used leaves , twigs , grass , corncobs and even books instead of toilet paper ?
Or that they mostly ate pork , beef , hardtack , cornmeal , molasses , rice and dried beans ?
Or that they spent the little free time that they had on fun activities such as gambling , smoking , chewing tobacco , singing , dancing , writing letters , playing cards and even baseball ?
Well , now you do …
Civil War Facts — Facts about the Civil War Summary The Civil War ( or the American Civil War as the outside world knows it ) was the greatest ever conflict on American soil .
It lasted from 1861 until 1865 and claimed more than 650,000 lives .
The Northern states ( known as the Union ) wished to abolish the slavery and fought the Southern states ( known as the Confederacy ) , which seceded from the USA just prior to the war .
The most important consequence of the Civil War was the abolishment of slavery – the first step on the road to racial equality in the USA .
President Abraham Lincoln , the leader of the Union during the war and one of the men responsible for the abolition of slavery in the USA , was assassinated only three days after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered his army to the Union and effectively ended the war .
In light of the series of laws passed in Congress and precedents set by the Bush administration , people have good reason to doubt the future of democracy and the rule of law in America .
Can it happen here ?
Is it happening here already ?
That depends , as a recent president might have said , on what the meaning of " it " is .
To Sinclair Lewis , who sardonically titled his 1935 dystopian novel " It Can't Happen Here , " " it " plainly meant an American version of the totalitarian dictatorships that had seized power in Germany and Italy .
Married at the time to the pioneering reporter Dorothy Thompson , who had been expelled from Berlin by the Nazis a year earlier and quickly became one of America 's most outspoken critics of fascism , Lewis was acutely aware of the domestic and foreign threats to American freedom .
So often did he and Thompson discuss the crisis in Europe and the implications of Europe 's fate for the Depression - wracked United States that , according to his biographer , Mark Schorer , Lewis referred to the entire topic somewhat contemptuously as " it . "
If " it " denotes the police state American - style as imagined and satirized by Lewis , complete with concentration camps , martial law , and mass executions of strikers and other dissidents , then " it " has n't happened here and is n't likely to happen anytime soon .
For contemporary Americans , however , " it " could signify our own more gradual and insidious turn toward authoritarian rule .
That is why Lewis 's darkly funny but grim fable of an authoritarian coup achieved through a democratic election still resonates today -- along with all the eerie parallels between what he imagined then and what we live with now .
For the first time since the resignation of Richard M. Nixon more than three decades ago , Americans have had reason to doubt the future of democracy and the rule of law in our own country .
Today we live in a state of tension between the enjoyment of traditional freedoms , including the protections afforded to speech and person by the Bill of Rights , and the disturbing realization that those freedoms have been undermined and may be abrogated at any moment .
Such foreboding , which would have been dismissed as paranoia not so long ago , has been intensified by the unfolding crisis of political legitimacy in the capital .
George W. Bush has repeatedly asserted and exercised authority that he does not possess under the Constitution he swore to uphold .
He has announced that he intends to continue exercising power according to his claim of a mandate that erases the separation and balancing of power among the branches of government , frees him from any real obligation to obey laws passed by Congress , and permits him to ignore any provisions of the Bill of Rights that may prove inconvenient .
Whether his fellow Americans understand exactly what Bush is doing or not , his six years in office have created intense public anxiety .
Much of that anxiety can be attributed to fear of terrorism , which Bush has exacerbated to suit his own purposes -- as well as to increasing concern that the world is threatened by global warming , pandemic diseases , economic insecurity , nuclear proliferation , and other perils with which this presidency cannot begin to cope .
As the midterm election showed , more and more Americans realize that something has gone far wrong at the highest levels of government and politics -- that Washington 's one - party regime had created a daily spectacle of stunning incompetence and dishonesty .
Pollsters have found large majorities of voters worrying that the country is on the wrong track .
At this writing , two of every three voters give that answer , and they are not just anxious but furious .
Almost half are willing to endorse the censure of the president .
Suspicion and alienation extend beyond the usual disgruntled Democrats to independents and even a significant minority of Republicans .
A surprisingly large segment of the electorate is willing to contemplate the possibility of impeaching the president , unappetizing though that prospect should be to anyone who can recall the destructive impeachment of Bush 's predecessor .
The reasons for popular disenchantment with the Republican regime are well known -- from the misbegotten , horrifically mismanaged war in Iraqto the heartless mishandling of the Hurricane Katrina disaster .
In both instances , growing anger over the damage done to the national interest and the loss of life and treasure has been exacerbated by evidence of bad faith -- by lies , cronyism , and corruption .
Everyone knows -- although not everyone necessarily wishes to acknowledge -- that the Bush administration misled the American people about the true purposes and likely costs of invading Iraq .
It invented a mortal threat to the nation in order to justify illegal aggression .
It has repeatedly sought , from the beginning , to exploit the state of war for partisan advantage and presidential image management .
It has wasted billions of dollars , and probably tens of billions , on Pentagon contractors with patronage connections to the Republican Party .
Everyone knows , too , that the administration dissembled about the events leading up to the destruction of New Orleans .
Its negligence and obliviousness in the wake of the storm were shocking , as was its attempt to conceal its errors .
It has yet to explain why a person with few discernible qualifications , other than his status as a crony and business associate of his predecessor , was directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
By elevating ethically dubious , inexperienced , and ineffectual management the administration compromised a critical agency that had functioned brilliantly during the Clinton administration .
To date , however , we do not know the full dimensions of the scandals behind Iraq and Katrina , because the Republican leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives abdicated the traditional congressional duties of oversight and investigation .
It is due to their dereliction that neither the president nor any of his associates have seemed even mildly chastened in the wake of catastrophe .
With a single party monopolizing power yet evading responsibility , there was nobody with the constitutional power to hold the White House accountable .
Bolstered by political impunity , especially in a time of war , perhaps any group of politicians would be tempted to abuse power .
But this party and these politicians , unchecked by normal democratic constraints , proved to be particularly dangerous .
The name for what is wrong with them -- the threat embedded within the Bush administration , the Republican congressional leadership , and the current leaders of the Republican Party -- is authoritarianism .
The most obvious symptoms can be observed in the regime 's style , which features an almost casual contempt for democratic and lawful norms ; an expanding appetite for executive control at the expense of constitutional balances ; a reckless impulse to corrupt national institutions with partisan ideology ; and an ugly tendency to smear dissent as disloyalty .
The most troubling effects are matters of substance , including the suspension of traditional legal rights for certain citizens ; the imposition of secrecy and the inhibition of the free flow of information ; the extension of domestic spying without legal sanction or warrant ; the promotion of torture and other barbaric practices , in defiance of American and international law ; and the collusion of government and party with corporate interests and religious fundamentalists .
What worries many Americans even more is that the authoritarians can excuse their excesses as the necessary response to an enemy that every American knows to be real .
For the past five years , the Republican leadership has argued that the attacks of September 11 , 2001 -- and the continuing threat from jihadist groups such as al Qaeda -- demand permanent changes in American government , society , and foreign policy .
Are those changes essential to preserve our survival -- or merely useful for unscrupulous politicians who still hope to achieve permanent domination by their own narrowly ideological party ?
Not only liberals and leftists , but centrists , libertarians , and conservatives , of every party and no party , have come to distrust the answers given by those in power .
The most salient dissent to be heard in recent years , and especially since Bush 's reelection in 2004 , has been voiced not by the liberals and moderates who never trusted the Republican leadership , but by conservatives who once did .
Former Republican congressman Bob Barr of Georgia , who served as one of the managers of the impeachment of Bill Clinton in the House of Representatives , has joined the American Civil Liberties Union he once detested .
In the measures taken by the Bush administration and approved by his former colleagues , Barr sees the potential for " a totalitarian type regime . "
Paul Craig Roberts , a longtime contributor to the Wall Street Journal and a former Treasury official under Reagan , perceives the " main components of a police state " in the Bush administration 's declaration of plenary powers to deny fundamental rights to suspected terrorists .
Bruce Fein , who served as associate attorney general in the Reagan Justice Department , believes that the Bush White House is " a clear and present danger to the rule of law , " and that the president " cannot be trusted to conduct the war against global terrorism with a decent respect for civil liberties and checks against executive abuses . "
Syndicated columnist George Will accuses the administration of pursuing a " monarchical doctrine " in its assertion of extraordinary war powers .
In the 2006 midterm election , disenchanted conservatives joined with liberals and centrists to deliver a stinging rebuke to the regime by overturning Republican domination in both houses of Congress .
For the first time since 1994 , Democrats control the Senate and the House of Representatives .
But the Democratic majority in the upper chamber is as narrow as possible , depending on the whims of Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut , a Republican - leaning Democrat elected on an independent ballot line , who has supported the White House on the occupation of Iraq , abuse of prisoners of war , domestic spying , the suspension of habeas corpus , military tribunals , far - right judicial nominations , and other critical constitutional issues .
Nor is Lieberman alone among the Senate Democrats in his supine acquiescence to the abuses of the White House .
Even if the Democrats had won a stronger majority in the Senate , it would be naive to expect that a single election victory could mend the damage inflicted on America 's constitutional fabric during the past six years .
While the Bush administration has enjoyed an extraordinary immunity from Congressional oversight until now , the deepest implication of its actions and statements , as explored in the pages that follow , is that neither legislators nor courts can thwart the will of the unitary executive .
When Congress challenges that presidential claim , as inevitably it will , then what seems almost certain to follow is not " bipartisanship " but confrontation .
The election of 2006 was not an end but another beginning .
The question that we face in the era of terror alerts , religious fundamentalism , and endless warfare is whether we are still the brave nation preserved and rebuilt by the generation of Sinclair Lewis -- or whether our courage , and our luck , have finally run out .
America is not yet on the verge of fascism , but democracy is again in danger .
The striking resemblance between Buzz Windrip [ the demagogic villain of Lewis 's novel ] and George W. Bush and the similarity of the political forces behind them is more than a literary curiosity .
It is a warning on yellowed pages from those to whom we owe everything .
The following was excerpted from Joe Conason 's new book , " It Can Happen Here " ( Thomas Dunne Books , 2007 ) .
Experian is one of the largest consumer credit bureaus .

BBC News , Khartoum
Khartoum 's low - rise skyline has already changed
A massive Libyan - financed five - star hotel , shaped like a boat 's sail , has already changed the city 's low - rise skyline and work is well underway to transform parts of the sleepy city centre into a bustling , gleaming 24 - hour metropolis .
The oil - fuelled construction boom may also lead to social changes , although the government shows less sign of loosening its grip here than the economy .
Under Islamic Sharia law , alcohol is banned and unlike most African cities , hardly any music can be heard on the streets , or even in the markets .
But businessmen are revelling in the new opportunities opening up , now that there is peace in the oilfields after the end of the 21 - year conflict between north and south .
Reforms
" This is the best situation we have had for 20 years , " one Sudanese businessman told the BBC News website .
Less than a decade after the oil came online , Sudan is already the third largest producer in Africa .
The Americans will miss a great opportunity in Sudan
Amir Diglal , al - Sunut
" I used to have to queue for ages to buy a packet of breakfast cereal , " a hotel owner says .
" Now I have a choice of 20 brands " .
The big question , however is whether ordinary Sudanese will benefit from the oil wealth , or whether it will be kept by a small elite , as in countries such as Nigeria and Angola .
Taxi - drivers like Omar , however , prefer home - grown beans and lentils to imported cornflakes .
" Oil , what oil ?
I have n't seen any oil , " he complains , as he drives his battered old yellow cab .
" Ask the government , they 've got the oil . "
Sanctions
Nevertheless , the International Monetary Fund has praised Sudan 's reforms and expects the economy to grow by 11 % this year - one of the highest rates in Africa .
Some are calling it Africa 's Dubai , as the al - Mogran development is hoping to mop up some of the billions of petrodollars being generated both domestically and across the Middle East .
It is still a vast building site but developers say $ 4bn will be invested over the next few years , generating 40,000 permanent jobs directly and many more indirectly .
The impressive plans show gleaming new shops , huge office blocks , 10 top- class hotels and a huge residential hinterland of 1,100 villas and 6,700 flats .
Amir Diglal , from the al - Sunut company behind the project , says the first of several international banks is due to open its doors later this year , with the entire project to be completed by 2014 .
The United States is threatening to impose sanctions on Sudan because it has blocked UN attempts to boost the numbers of peacekeepers in Darfur , where at least 200,000 people have died in four years of conflict .
But Mr Diglal is not concerned .
" The Americans will miss a great opportunity in Sudan , " he says .
AL - MOGRAN PROJECT
Hotels : 10 Jobs : 50,000 Cost : $ 4bn Residents : 61,000
Sudanese companies cannot use the US dollar - a huge obstacle to international trade .
One German businessman complained that his goods destined for Sudan from South America had been impounded when the ship carrying them made a brief stop in the US .
But this does not seem to have prevented the al - Mogran development .
Companies from China and Malaysia , which are closely involved in pumping Sudan 's oil , are among the biggest investors .
Cultural change
Mr Diglal hopes the project will do more than just provide an economic boost .
" The challenge is not money or engineering but changing the culture . "
Al - Mogran remains a vast building site
Sudan 's first 18 - hole golf course is also planned , along with at least two marinas , for yachts stopping off on their Nile tours .
Some go even further .
" One day , we might even have nightclubs , " says one of those involved in the project .
But that looks like being a distant dream - the man who suggested this insisted that his name was not used in case it led to problems with the authorities .
Khartoum residents believe that state security agents recently paid a warning visit to a cafe serving ice cream and patisseries , where young Sudanese men and women were mingling a bit too freely .
Signs have now been put up warning patrons to " observe respectable behaviour and appearance " .
Immaculate Backup was originally published on February 21 , 2007 .
Murphy 's Law 198§44 : the more complete a backup / recovery solution becomes , the less likely it is to ever be used .
With nearly half a century of experience using computers to run their business , Chris M's company knew that law all too well .
Ever since that fateful Wednesday -- still known throughout the company as The Crash of ‘ 68 -- they swore , Never Again .
And forty years later , they ’ve kept their promise .
Over the years , Chris ’s employer has come as close to a Perfect Technology Infrastructure as anyone .
They hire the best network administrators money can buy and give them whatever resources they need to ensure that the infrastructure remains solid .
And that they do .
The company ’s backup and retention plan is nothing short of immaculate .
Every system they ’ve ever purchased -- from that old payroll program on the System / 360 to that bizarre parts database for OS / 2 -- can be brought back to life , if not physically than through virtualization .
A walk through their “ software archive ” was a treat for many ; new technicians are often astonished to learn , not only of the existence of 8 - inch floppy disks , but that the company still has the 8 - inch install disks for CP / M .
And a drive to run them on .
Naturally , thanks to the aforementioned Murphy ’s Law , this elaborate backup and retention is rarely , if ever , called into use .
The only excitement the network technicians ever get is that occasional , frantic , “ Oh Crap !
I accidentally deleted that critical PowerPoint presentation ” call .
And even that is easily solved by walking the user through their self - service file restoration system .
But a little while back , the network technicians received a restoration request that actually sounded interesting .
A production manager needed a report of the “ old old ” part numbers for a long out - of - production assembly .
“ Old old ” referred an ancient mainframe system that had been replaced by the “ old ” system over ten years go and finally shut down in 2001 .
Restoring the “ old old ” system meant setting up a new emulation environment , mounting the old disk image , and praying that it boots up without a hitch .
This was the first time ever that an actual user had requested such a restoration , so the network technicians were naturally a bit nervous .
But thanks to their meticulous planning and procedures , everything went fine .
The system booted up without a hitch and the production manager was summoned to log in to the terminal they had set up for him .
He sat down at the chair , keyed in his username , and then paused for a moment .
“ Now , what was my password five years ago ? ”
Update :
The blogger that initially started this rumor has now openly stated that he made it up as a practical joke .
Blogger Kiyoshi Saruwatari claims that Nintendo's upcoming Wii console runs on the open source Linux operating system .
According to Saruwatari , who claims to be a Nintendo insider , the company reduced development costs by leveraging open source software and incorporating a Linux kernel into the Wii software platform .
A wide variety of additional features like web browsing , video playback , file management , and emulation all run on Nintendo 's custom Linux operating system , which uses a proprietary interface .
Unlike the other specialized software components , the actual games will not run under the Linux platform , and can be played without booting Linux if the user holds down the " A " button while the Wii is starting up .
According to Saruwatari , third - party software developers will be able to develop new Linux applications for the platform , but homebrew developers are out of luck because " the final system [ is ] closed and will allow only signed code " to run .
Given the console hacking community 's irrepressible desire and capacity to facilitate homebrew development , it 's probably just a matter of time before some clever individual finds a way to circumvent the restrictions .
A group of intrepid Linux enthusiasts already set up a web site last month dedicated to coordinating efforts to get homebrew Linux running on the Wii .
If Linux does in fact run on the Wii right out of the box as Saruwatari claims , the Wii-Linux.com group could find that their task is much easier than initially anticipated .
Saruwatari promises that , as a result of Linux support , we " can count on a lot of third - party add - ons , much like Opera . "
One wonders what sort of officially supported applications we can expect to see .
Without a keyboard , functionality will be relatively limited , but there is still a lot of potential for unique and compelling new software .
In a recent interview , Nintendo president Satoru Iwata revealed that the Wii is the first console for which Nintendo will provide " operating system updates , " potentially extending the functionality of the underlying Linux platform .
Given Nintendo's attitude regarding proprietary software , I 'm honestly surprised that the company would choose Linux as the basis for its new game console .
Although Linux provides an excellent balance of value , power , and versatility , it necessitates GPL compliance , which can create some challenges for companies like Nintendo that are fiercely protective of their intellectual property .
In general , BSD kernels ( which are available under a more permissive license ) are a more natural choice for embedded platforms where there could be a need to incorporate proprietary code .
Companies that use the Linux platform in embedded systems are required to make their modifications to the kernel available to the public .
DVR maker Tivo , for instance , provides the source code of its own unique Linux kernel modifications on the official Tivo web site .
Although Linux on the Wii is an exciting prospect , Saruwatari 's claims have not been verified by Nintendo , and may be little more than a rumor .
I keep hearing people say that they only hire the top 1 percent of job seekers .
At my company , Fog Creek Software , I want to hire the top 1 percent , too .
We 're doubling in size each year , and we 're always in the market for great software developers .
In our field , the top 1 percent of the work force can easily be 10 times as productive as the average developer .
The best developers invent new products , figure out shortcuts that save months of work , and , when there are no shortcuts , plow through coding tasks like a monster truck at a tea party .
From a recruiting perspective , the problem is that the people I consider to be in the top 1 percent in my field barely ever apply for jobs at all .
That 's because they already have jobs .
Stimulating jobs .
Jobs where their employers pay them lots of money and do whatever it takes to keep them happy .
If these pros switch jobs , chances are the offer came through networking , not because they submitted a resumé somewhere or trolled a job site like Monster ( NASDAQ : MNST ) .
Many of the best developers I know took a summer internship on a whim and then stayed on .
They have applied for only one or two jobs in their lives .
A lot of companies think they 're hiring the top 1 percent because they get 100 resumés for every open position .
They 're kidding themselves .
When you fill an opening , think about what happens to the 99 people you turn away .
They do n't give up and go into plumbing .
They apply for another job .
There 's a floating population of applicants in your industry that apply for nearly every opening posted online , even though many of them are qualified for virtually none of these positions .
So if the top 1 percent never apply for jobs , how can you recruit them ?
My theory is that the best way is to find them before they realize there is a job market -- back when they 're still in college .
Here 's where you start .
Ah , college .
Most kids wait until their last year to worry about finding their first job .
And they are not that inventive .
At more prestigious schools , the kids tend to feel that they are in such demand that they do n't bother reaching out to employers .
They simply go to on - campus recruiting events to see what 's there .
At Fog Creek , I 've had a lot of success recruiting college students .
In fact , I hired more than half of my developers as college interns , then recruited them for full - time work .
Before I go any further , I need to clarify that these are paid internships .
Although unpaid internships for school credit are common in other fields from fashion to music , we pay $ 750 a week , plus free housing , free lunch , free subway passes , relocation expenses , and various other benefits .
Every time I talk about internships , somebody inevitably gets confused and thinks I 'm taking advantage of slave labor .
You there , young whippersnapper :
Get me a frosty cold orange juice , hand - squeezed , and make it snappy !
That 's not how it goes .
The annual routine starts in September , when I begin tracking down the best future software developers in the country .
I send a personalized letter to every promising computer science major that I can find .
Last year I sent 300 letters to fill six intern positions .
Not e-mail .
My letters are printed on a real piece of Fog Creek letterhead , which I sign myself in actual ink .
Apparently this is rare enough that it gets kids ' attention .
I also call professors and former interns at schools such as Stanford , Duke , Dartmouth , and the University of Illinois to ask them for recommendations .
Finally , I write an article for my blog , which gets about a million unique visitors per month , that 's especially relevant to students .
At the end of the article , I solicit internship applications .
How to find the best talent in a stack of applications .
Eventually , we get hundreds of applications for these internships , and they 're good candidates because they represent the whole population , not just the job - seeking population .
We call the most promising candidates for a phone interview .
It 's a three - part conversation .
First , I ask the candidates to tell me about themselves and their classes .
Then I pose a software development challenge .
For example , how would you implement a Web - based clone of PowerPoint ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) ?
This gives me a feel for how smart they are , and if they know the basics of software development .
Finally , I ask the candidates to interview me for the last 15 minutes of the call .
They can ask about the company or living in New York City - - whatever they want .
If they pass the phone interview , Fog Creek flies them out to New York City to be interviewed in person .
By that time , there 's a pretty good probability that we 're going to want to hire them , so it 's time to launch into full - court - press recruitment .
Even though Fog Creek is a bootstrapped company where money is not spent lightly , we roll out the red carpet for our prospective interns .
A limousine meets them at the airport .
A uniformed driver grabs their luggage and whisks them to their hotel , probably the coolest hotel they 've ever seen -- ideally it 's right near the fashion district with models walking through the lobby at all hours and complicated bathroom fixtures that may be a part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art but good luck trying to figure out how to brush your teeth .
Waiting in the hotel room is a hospitality package with a T - shirt , a suggested walking tour of New York City written by Fog Creek staffers , and the DVD of Aardvark'd , a documentary about our 2005 interns made by Lerone Wilson , a filmmaker whose work has appeared on PBS .
After a long day of interviews , we invite candidates to stay in the hotel for two more nights at our expense , so that they can explore the city before the limo takes them back to the airport for their flight home .
Only one in three applicants who make it to this stage will be hired , but still we do n't skimp on them .
We want the kids who do n't make the grade to go back to campus thinking we 're a classy employer .
Our hope is that they tell all their friends how much fun they had and encourage them to apply for an internship the next summer , if only for the free trip .
Get the people you want to stick around .
During the summer of the internship itself , the students generally start out thinking , " Okay , it 's a nice summer job and some good experience . "
We 're a little bit ahead of them .
We use the summer to decide if we want them full - time .
So we give them real work .
Hard work .
Our interns always work on production code .
Sometimes they work on the coolest new stuff in the company , which can make the permanent employees a little jealous , but that 's life .
One summer we had a team of four interns build a whole new tech support product , Fog Creek Copilot , from the ground up .
That particular intern class paid for itself by the end of the year .
Even when they 're not building a new product , our interns work on real shipping code , with the helpful advice of experienced mentors , of course .
Our interns are totally , personally responsible for some major area of our software 's functionality .
And then we make sure these kids have a great time .
We host parties and open houses .
We get them free housing in a rather nice local dorm where they can make friends from other companies and schools .
We have some kind of extracurricular activity or field trip every week : Broadway shows , movie openings , museum tours , a boat ride around Manhattan , a Yankees game .
Believe it or not , one of last year 's favorite excursions was a trip to Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center .
It 's just a tall building with a nice view of the Manhattan skyline .
You would n't think it would be such an awe - inspiring experience .
But it was .
At the end of the summer , a few interns will have convinced us that they are truly great programmers and that we just have to hire them .
Not all of them , mind you -- some are merely great programmers who for some reason we are willing to pass on , and others would be great somewhere else but not at Fog Creek .
For the ones we really want , there 's no sense in waiting .
We make an early offer for a full - time job , conditional on their graduation .
And dollarwise , it 's a great offer : $ 75,000 .
We want them to be able to go back to school , compare notes with their friends , and realize that they 're getting a higher starting salary than their peers .
Does this mean we 're overpaying ?
I do n't think so .
You see , the typical first - year salary has to take into account a certain amount of risk that the person wo n't work out .
But we 've already auditioned these kids , so there 's almost no risk that they wo n't be great .
When we hire them , we have more information about them than any other employer who has only interviewed them .
Because there 's less inherent risk , we can pay them more money .
At this point , if we 've done our job right , the intern gives up and accepts our offer .
Sometimes it takes a little persuading .
Sometimes they want to leave their options open .
That 's fine with us .
An outstanding offer from Fog Creek ensures that the first time they have to wake up at 8 a.m. and put on a suit for a high - pressure interview with Oracle ( NASDAQ : ORCL ) -- well , when the alarm goes off , there 's a good chance they 'll say to themselves , why the heck am I getting up when I already have an excellent job waiting for me at Fog Creek ?
My hope is they wo n't even bother going to that interview .
The worm lives off whale bones
Enlarge Image
The creature was found on a minke carcass in relatively shallow water close to Tjarno Marine Laboratory on the Swedish coast .
Such " zombie worms " , as they are often called , are known from the deep waters of the Pacific but their presence in the North Sea is a major surprise .
A UK - Swedish team reports the find in Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
Adrian Glover and Thomas Dahlgren tell the journal the new species has been named Osedax mucofloris , which literally means " bone - eating snot - flower " .
" They look like flowers poking out of the whale bone .
The analogy goes a bit further because they have a root system that goes into the bone , " Dr Glover , a researcher at London 's Natural History Museum , told the BBC News website .
" The part of the animal that is exposed to the seawater is covered in a ball of mucus , so they are quite snotty .
That is probably a defence mechanism . "
Global distribution
Scientists have recently begun to recognise the importance of " whale fall " to ocean - floor ecosystems .
In October 2003 , Glover and Dahlgren sank the remains of a dead , stranded minke whale in 120 m of water and monitored what happened to the carcass over a period of months using remotely operated vehicles .
Osedax worms were first seen in deep water off California ( Image : Greg Rouse )
To their astonishment , it hosted a type of marine worm previously only thought to exist at great ocean depths - down to almost 3 km in the Pacific on the bones of gray whales .
Glover and Dahlgren say there are remarkable similarities between the worm species , despite being separated by two ocean basins and more than 2,500 m in the water column .
Hunting impact
Osedax worms are about 1 - 2 cm in length .
A scanning electron micrograph shows up remarkable detail in the North Sea worm
Their reproductive system is extraordinary - certainly in the case of the Pacific Osedax .
" The female Pacific worms keep males inside their tube as a sort of little harem that fertilises eggs as they are released into the water column , " explained Dr Glover .
" We 're not sure what 's happening with the reproductive biology of the Swedish worms yet .
We 've only got females ; we have n't found any males .
It 's a bit weird . "
Scientists have established that all of the Osedax species so far identified appear to be closely related to vestimentiferan tubeworms , which are found only at the volcanic cracks in the ocean floor called hydrothermal vents .
This has given rise to the theory that whale falls may act as " service stops " , or hopping points , that allow some lifeforms to move around the ocean floor .
Scientists want to learn more about the worms ' life processes

It may even have led to the extinction of some bottom - dwelling organisms that depended on this rare but concentrated nutrient supply .
Glover and Dahlgren , who is affiliated to Goteborg University , intend to study their North Sea worms further in the laboratory .
“ There are a dozen places , at best , that are becoming magnets for these people , ” Mr. Florida said .
That disparity was evident in a report released this week by the Metropolitan Atlanta Chamber of Commerce , which showed Atlanta leading the pack among big cities , while other metro areas , like Philadelphia , hemorrhaged young people from 1990 to 2000 .
( In this competition , surveys that make a city look good are a favorite opening salvo . )
In that decade , the Atlanta study said , the number of 25 - to - 34 - year - olds with four - year college degrees in the city increased by 46 percent , placing Atlanta in the top five metropolitan areas in terms of growth rate , and a close second to San Francisco in terms of overall numbers .
Charlotte , N.C. , also outperformed Atlanta , with a growth rate of 57 percent , the second highest in the country after Las Vegas .
( Demographers point out that Las Vegas started with very small numbers and still ranks last among major cities when it comes to the percentage of its 25 - to 34 - year - olds with a college degree . )
Atlanta did particularly well with young , educated blacks — a boon for employers seeking to diversify their ranks .
The city ’s report zeroed in on people like Tiffany Patterson , 27 , who on a recent Thursday night was hanging out at Verve , the sleek new Midtown bar and restaurant that is one of her marketing clients .
The place was thrumming with young African - Americans in leather jackets , stilettos or pinstripe suits — the kind of vibe , said Ms. Patterson , who is from Dallas , that made her stay in Atlanta after college .
“ If I go home , women my age are looking for a husband , ” she said .
“ They have a cubicle job . ”
In Atlanta , Ms. Patterson said , she can afford a new town house .
A few years ago , she decided to leave her financial sector job and start her own business as a marketing consultant .

“ I thought , I can break out and do it myself , ” she said .
“ It really is the city of the fearless . ”
The recent study , based on census figures and conducted by Joe Cortright of Impresa Consulting in Portland and Carol Coletta , president and chief executive of CEOs for Cities , a nonprofit organization in Chicago , showed that Atlanta won its net gain in educated young people by luring them from New York , Washington , Los Angeles , Chicago and Houston .
If you ’ve written a book and you ’d like to self - publish it , you should know that it ’s quite possible to create a thoroughly professional package which includes a great cover , excellent formatting and all of the usual bells and whistles ( such as a dedication , page numbers , chapter numbers , an introduction , footnotes and / or resource links ) .
These days , plenty of authors choose to self - publish .
When they do , they access more control over their work … as well as more of the profits from their work !
While self - publishing has its pros and cons , it is something that pays off for a lot of authors and you may be one of them .
In order to get things done , you ’ll need to consider whether you want to sell only an e-book or prefer to offer just a print book .
Most authors self - publish in both formats , but everyone is different .
Choosing the “ e- book only ” option is probably the quickest , simplest and cheapest way to self - publish .
Tips for Print Books
If you want to sell a print book , you ’ll need to create it in PDF format .
It ’s the typical format for print books .
Your print book will need to be formatted in a standard print book size and it will need to provide a PDF file which may be sent to a printer .
This file is something that a printing company will need when its team members are preparing to get your books printed out and ready for you to sell .
It ’s quite simple to create PDFs .
However , creating a really attractive and professional print book is tougher .
To get the job done right ( i.e. produce something that you ’re really proud of ) , we recommend investing in a design template for a print book .
Some people outsource book design .
This may be a good option for you , as long as you do n’t mind paying a pro to do the hard work for you .
There are also publishing tools that people use in order to create nice - looking print books .
You ’ll be pleased to know that it ’s possible to export to PDF formats from a range of programs , including Photoshop , Word , InDesign and PowerPoint .
What About E-book Formatting ?
There are two main forms of e-book formatting .
One is Standard EPUB .
It ’s something that every platform but Amazon publishes in .
When you choose Standard EPUB , you ’ll be able to sell your e-book at a lot of different places , without needing to worry about changing the format .
For example , you may sell it via the Adobe Digital Editions app or sell it via Apple or B & N Nook …or all three !
With Standard EPUB , you ’ll have access to a bigger market than the second option , which is a formatting system that is exclusive to Amazon .
The second option is Mobi .
It ’s just for the Amazon Kindle Store .
Amazon broke the rules by rejecting the industry standard for formatting ( EPUB ) and creating its own e-book formatting system ( Mobi ) .
Amazon is huge and lots of people look for e-books at the Amazon Kindle Store .
With all of these facts in mind , you ’ll need to decide which format is right for you .
If you choose EPUB , be aware that you ’ll need to get it validated before you upload it at a retailer .
There is tool for validation online which is free to access .
You ’ll find it at the official International Book Publishing Forum website .
It ’s a risk not to validate , so be sure to follow this step before you upload .
Once you choose an e-book format , you ’ll be able to learn how to use it online .
These formats are easy to access .
For example , if you wrote your book in Word , as a lot of authors do , and you want to convert it to EPUB , you ’ll find conversion tools online which allow you to take care of this important step quickly and easily .
For Mobi , Amazon will walk you through the process once you ’ve set up your Amazon Digital Platform account .
Authors who have already created EPUB files and want to convert them to MOBI should probably outsource this task to pros that do it for a living .
Otherwise , it may be a bit too challenging .
So , we ’ve covered the technical aspects of creating print books and e-books on your own .
Now , let ’s talk about another vital aspect of the whole enterprise .
This is marketing your ebook and / or print book .
How to Market Your E-book
The platforms that you publish on will take a cut of your sales .
This means that generating lots of sales is the key to self - publishing the profitable way .
You ’ll need to sell a decent volume of print and / or e-books in order to get back your investment of time and money .
This probably wo n’t be possible without a lot of promotion .
Some people are experts in their fields or have some level of notoriety which helps them to sell without promotion .
However , most people have to create self - publishing marketing plans from the ground up … and then implement them .
Promoting your own work ( i.e. tooting your own horn ) may be something that you ’re comfortable with or less comfortable with .
However you feel about it ,
It ’s really mandatory in terms of letting the public know that your e-book is out there .
There are tons of these books around and you ’ll need to let the public know that you have something new for them to check out .
With regard to marketing , your safest bet is to utilize social media in order to get the world out .
You may start by promoting to your own social circle and then encourage members of your circle to share information about your ebook with their social media fans and followers .
Another option is start your own website or blog .
The Blog Starter has a good free tutorial on creating a blog .
Paid advertising is also an option .
For example , paying for Facebook ads which are targeted at the types of readers that you want to find may be very helpful .
Another option is a pay - per - click campaign at one of the big search engines .
Google ’s pay - per- click campaign is called AdWords .
Your ads will show sometimes while people are looking for relevant things during Google searches .
If these people click on your ads , you ’ll pay a fee .
Hopefully , this guide has provided you with plenty of helpful facts .
Once you handle the technical details and put together a smart marketing plan , you ’ll be ready to get the most that you can from self - publishing .

Children become emotionally attached to cuddly toys , blankets and even smelly old scraps of material because they intuitively believe they possess a unique essence or life force , psychologists said yesterday .
In a study that will surprise few parents , it was found that children preferred their cherished comfort blankets or favourite raggedy bear over duplicates apparently identical in every way .
The results suggested that even very young children invest in such objects intangible qualities that cannot be replicated .
The study compared the reaction of the children to that of art enthusiasts who prefer an original to a copy that is identical in every way .
Previous studies have shown that up to 70 % of young children develop strong attachments to objects such as toys or blankets .
The phenomenon tends to be confined to the western world , where children usually sleep apart from their parents at an early age .
Bruce Hood , of the University of Bristol , and Paul Bloom of Yale University in the US , decided to try to find out why .
Parents were asked to bring children aged three to six into a laboratory with their " attachment object " or if they had no such object , a toy or doll that they liked .
To count as an attachment object , the child had to regularly sleep with it and have had it for at least a third of his or her life .
The children were shown what they were told was a " copying machine " - in reality a conjuror 's cabinet made up of two boxes .
The doors of the two boxes were open and a green block put into one of them .
Then the doors shut , an experimenter twiddled some knobs and the first box buzzed .
A few moments later a buzz came from the second box .
The doors of both boxes opened to reveal a green block in both of them - the experimenter had slipped an identical block into the second box .
Then the experimenter asked the children if they would let the objects they had brought in be copied .
They could choose if they wanted the new one or the old one back .
All of those with " non-attachment " objects allowed them to be copied and almost two - thirds decided to keep the " new " object - in fact , it was their own object .
Of the 22 children who did have attachment objects , four stubbornly refused to allow them to be copied at all .
Of the 18 who did let their precious items be copied , only five opted to have the " duplicate " .
At the end , all children were shown how the illusion worked so they knew they had their original item back .
Prof Hood said the experiment showed that children believe that in addition to the physical properties of their objects , there was some other quality to them that can not be copied .
He said : " If there was a machine which copied a favourite object in every way down to atomic level , we would still prefer the original .
It has an essence to it .
This experiment suggests this is an intuitive process .
" We anthropomorphise objects , look at them almost as if they have feelings .
The children know these objects are not alive but they believe in them as if they are . "
While the tendency to sleep with a comfort blanket is thought to be largely a western trait , Prof Hood said believing objects had an essence was not .
Some eastern beliefs centre on all things having a life force and some cultures find it difficult to live in other people 's homes because they feel there is something intangible left of the previous people in them .
THE HIGHJACKING OF A NATION
Part 1 : The Foreign Agent Factor
By Sibel Edmonds
Today , foreign influence , that most baneful foe of our republican government , has its tentacles entrenched in almost all major decision making and policy producing bodies of the U.S. government machine .
It does so not secretly , since its self - serving activities are advocated and legitimized by highly positioned parties …
( More )
Humans may have evolved altruistic traits as a result of a cultural “ tax ” we paid to each other early in our evolution , a new study suggests .
The research also changes what we knew about the genetic makeup of our hunter - gatherer ancestors .
The origin of human altruism has puzzled evolutionary biologists for many years ( see Survival of the nicest ) .
In every society , humans make personal sacrifices for others with no expectation that it will be reciprocated .
For example , we donate to charity , or care for the sick and disabled .
This trait is extremely rare in the natural world , unless there is a family relationship or later reciprocation .
Advertisement
One theory to explain how human altruism evolved involves the way we interacted as groups early in our evolution .
Towards the end of the Pleistocene period – about 12,000 years ago – humans foraged for food as hunter - gatherers .
These groups competed against each other for survival .
Group dynamics
Under these conditions , altruism towards other group - members would improve the overall fitness of the group .
If an individual defended the group but was killed , any genes that the individual shared with the overall group would still be passed on .
Many researchers reject this model , however .
One reason is that competition between individuals is likely to increase if a group becomes isolated , and any altruistic behaviour would then decrease an individual ’s level of fitness compared with other members .
Biologists also assume that hunter - gatherer groups around this time period would have been insufficiently genetically related to favour altruism .
In other words , die when defending the group and your genes die with you .
Ancient ways
Now a new study by Samuel Bowles at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico , US , breathes new life into the model .
Bowles conducted a genetic analysis of contemporary foraging groups , including Australian aboriginals , native Siberian Inuit populations and indigenous tribal groups in Africa .
The genetic variation found within these modern - day groups was analysed and then used to estimate the kind of genetic variation that would have existed in ancestral populations of hunter - gatherer from the Pleistocene and early Holocene ( 150,000 to 10,000 years ago , combined ) .
“ These modern groups live today as most scholars believe our distant ancestors did , ” Bowles explains .
He calculated that early human individuals were likely to be substantially more related to each other than previously thought .
But Bowles found bigger genetic differences than expected between discrete groups of ancient peoples .
These conditions would have favoured altruistic behaviour , says Bowles .
Challenging times
Bowles also worked out that early customs such as food sharing or monogamy could have levelled out the “ cost ” of altruistic behaviour , in the same way that income taxes redistribute income in society .
He assembled genetic , climactic , archaeological , ethnographic and experimental data to examine the cost - benefit relationship of human cooperation in ancient populations .
In his model , members of a group bearing genes for altruistic behaviour pay a “ tax ” by limiting their reproductive opportunities to benefit from sharing food and information , thereby increasing the average fitness of the group as well as their inter-relatedness .
Bands of altruistic humans would then act together to gain resources from other groups at this challenging time in history .
For example , an injury may be one of the costs of defending the group during an intergroup conflict : a broken leg could be fatal for an individual who may starve through being unable to obtain his own food .
But food sharing would make it less of a risk for individuals to participate in these conflicts , Bowles says .
One - woman men
The archaeological and ethnographic data he used showed that 13 % to 15 % of foragers died from wars , which were common between groups .
Bowles ’s mathematical models suggest that altruism must have been a significant factor in these populations .
Although Bowles admits that he has found no evidence for any gene for human altruism , he says that if such a genetic disposition were to exist , group conflict would have played an important role in its development .
Monogamy would also level the playing field within the group , he showed in his statistical analysis .
“ Monogamy limits the ability of the stronger or more aggressive males to monopolise copulation , ” says Bowles .
“ Humans are very unusual in this way . ”
Bowles ’s paper is original , says Robert Boyd at the University of California , Los Angeles , US , who wrote an accompanying paper .
A model of the evolution of altruism based on group selection is now more plausible , he says .
“ I am still not completely convinced , but I am much more willing to entertain the hypothesis , ” he says .

When Sun trumpeted its ' open source DRM ' last month , no one at first noticed an unusual name amongst the canned quotes .
Lending his support to the rights enforcement technology was Free Software Foundation , Electronic Frontier Foundation board member , and Software Freedom Law Center director , Professor Lawrence Lessig .
A name usually associated with the unrestricted exchange of digital media .
Debian activist and copyright campaigner Benjamin Mako Hill noticed , and thought this was odd .
" The fact that the software is ' open source ' is hardly good enough , " he wrote , " if the purpose of the software is to take away users ' freedom - in precisely the way that DRM does . "
Was DRM less bad because it was ' open source ' ?
Professor Lessig tells us that he should have reviewed the Sun Microsystems press release before it went out .
It does n't fully reflect his position , he says , and he 's emphatic that this blessing does n't constitute an endorsement .
" Rockstars and newspapers endorse things , " he told us by email .
" I do n't . "
Richard M Stallman , who founded the Free Software movement and devised the original GNU public license , diplomatically did n't dwell on the support Lessig gave Sun's DRM .
" Anyone can mis-speak , " he said .
" But I hope people can learn from this . "
He warns that , if DRM is open source , it might actually be worse than proprietary DRM , and he issued a rallying cry for free software campaigners that DRM is incompatible with freedom .
( How ' open source ' Sun 's DRM really is questionable , says Mako , since it allows proprietary implementations - that 's something Lessig may not have been aware of at the time of the Sun press release . )
What follows , then , is excerpted from interviews with all three over the past week .
Unprompted , both Stallman and Lessig spent considerable time with us discussing the wider context .
Take away the need for DRM , they both point out , and the discussion becomes moot .
Both have differing views on how this can be achieved , but it merits an article in itself , so we 'll follow up with a Part Two in the very near future .
Stallman on freedom
As he so often does , Stallman began by drawing a sharp distinction between " open source " and the free software movement .
This is more than mere semantics , as becomes apparent when he turns to DRM , because it 's a distinction that reflects very different philosophical and moral approaches to writing software .
" The values of the Free Software Movement are the freedom to cooperate , and the freedom to have control over your own life .
You should be free to control the software in your computer , and you should be free to share it , " he sums up .
" The weakness of the ' Open Source ' approach , is that it has been designed as another way to talk about the issues , one that cites only practical values .
It agrees with the conventional attitude that what matters about software is what job it does , and how much money it costs .
That 's exactly the same attitude Microsoft wants you to take . "
" Both ' open source ' and proprietary developers are saying that convenience matters - but we 're saying freedom and community matter more .
We 're not saying convenience does n't matter , but there 's more than just having a reliable and powerful program . "
" I 'm willing to undergo the tremendous inconvenience to create a free program that 's a replacement for a proprietary program .
That 's why we have the GNU / Linux system , because a lot of people were prepared to make practical sacrifices so we can have that freedom . "
Now here 's where this underpins the DRM discussion .
Stallman says that the if you accept the proposition that ' open source ' is good because it results in more powerful and reliable software , this makes ' open source DRM ' worse than proprietary DRM .
As he explains -
" If you think that the important thing is for the software to be powerful and reliable , you might think that applying the OS development model to DRM software is a way to make DRM powerful and reliable , " he explains .
" But as far as I 'm concerned , that makes it worse - because it 's job is restricting you .
And if it restricts you reliably , that means you 've been thoroughly shafted .

What 's your excuse ?
I hate to leap to conclusions about anyone , but I say , from what I know of you , that you 're an unsociable Scrooge , creeping away from the jolly throng singing carols around the tree , to check your e-mails , browse aimlessly , gorge on humbugs and skulk .
You 're probably not even wearing your paper crown .
Admittedly , you 're not alone .
Last year almost 1.3 million people found time out of their festivities to visit this website on Christmas Day .
That 's a fair few , but just a third of those who visit on a normal day .
It seems there are plenty of people for whom family fun and a stodgy pudding have more attraction than the internet .
Of course there are all kinds of reasons why you might be reading this on Christmas Day , other than unsocial behaviour .
Perhaps your job is so important you have to come in to work today .
Though if your job allows you to sit around reading this , what is so important about it ?
Go on , go home , where your delighted family will turn from the flickering fireside and offer you a roasted chestnut .
No - one will mind .
Online addict
More likely , you 're an addict .
You 're an internet user .
You mainline online , and simply can't make it through to Doctor Who without your daily fix .
Preparations in hand ...
Or perhaps you just wanted to touch base with the outside world , to check with the BBC whether anything important had happened .
Which is legitimate , in theory .
Except that you 're reading this , and if you believe it 's going to get useful and informative in the second half , you are only fooling yourself .
Addict it is , and the sooner you admit it the sooner you will be able to tear yourself away and go and have a drink .
That said , I should not overlook the possibility that you are spending the nativity season alone , without friends or family , through no choice of your own .
In which case , I apologise for my insensitivity , and belatedly acknowledge that Christmas must be a miserable time of the year for some people , and I 've probably made it worse , and I feel very bad about that .
There , now you 've spoilt my Christmas too .
Thanks .
Then again , global reader , you may live in a part of the world where Christmas simply does n't happen .
Last Christmas , 39 % of readers of the BBC news website were from outside the UK , compared to 31 % on a normal day .
That 's a pretty watertight excuse .
Reality bites
Another possibility is that a merry
Yule is going on all around you , but you refuse to let it happen to you .
You may , for example , be a non-Christian who can't see why the fact that Jesus was born on an unknown date should oblige you to cover a fake fir tree with tinsel , eat sprouts and watch The Vicar of Dibley in his name .
Tempted yet ?
And yet , after all that , perhaps the reason you 're surfing today is simply that it 's something to do .
We like to think that Christmas should be a day unlike any other , but once you 've opened your presents , eaten your dinner and played with your children 's toys , what you 've got left is pretty much a day like any other , except with better TV .
The image we carry around of friendly robins , wall - to - wall jollity and snow - covered windows through which Dickensian lantern - swinging urchins sing God Rest Ye Merry , Gentlemen rarely seems to materialise .
And when reality fails us , there 's always cyberspace .
So here we are .
Ah well , merry Monday , and a happy new week .

ABOUT ME
Without a doubt , my favorite art form is the short , sweet essay .
Yes , it is challenging to say a lot in just a few words , but that 's what makes it so magical .
It 's a journey that takes us places we never would have otherwise imagined .
I 've written everything from white papers to case studies to research reports to a book .
I 've founded , edited and published a well - respected trade journal and a popular newsletter .
I 'm a blogger , a jogger and like a good lager .
500 Words
“ Write a lot about a little , ” he said , his twinkly blue eyes twinkling , “ not a little about a lot . ”
What did he mean , exactly ?
It sounded nonsensical , or at the very least paradoxical .
I knew my Uncle Bill ’s intent , and yet conflicting interpretations lurked within .
Write a lot about a little : okay , that ’s not hard to understand .
Take a deep dive into a narrow space .
It ’s easy to appreciate the wisdom .
Knowing what you intend to say and taking that to full expression is good advice .
Not a little about a lot : sounds like just the opposite .
Is it , really ?
Writing a little about a lot could also mean taking a deep dive into a narrow space .
It all depends on whether “ a little ” is the narrow space and “ a lot ” is the deep dive .
Or not .
It ’s so funny how a few words , spoken a long time ago , can resonate so strongly , guide habits , and capture the imagination .
Maybe it ’s the tension between telegraphed authority and nuanced meaning .
His gentle brown eyes flashed intensity .
“ Brevity is better , ” he said .
I knew what my father was saying , and that it was more complicated than it sounded .
His point was basically a ruthlessly edited take on George Bernard Shaw ’s famous quote .
What it lacked in wit , it made up in , well , brevity .
To assert your voice , some of your lovely words must die .
Or as as Blaise Pascal , the French philosopher and mathematician said : “ Je n’ai fait celle - ci plus longue que parce que je n’ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte . ”
Translation : “ I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter . ”
This is the beauty of the essay , from the French verb essayer , meaning “ to try . ”
An essay can be long .
It should try to be short , as Shaw , Pascal , my father , and probably Uncle Bill would agree , because brevity is the soul of clarity .
The fewer the words , the more likely to be read , understood and remembered .
Is that a little about a lot or a lot about a little ?
Yes .
In that spirit , this essay is titled , “ 500 Words . ”
It measures 134 words short .
But archaeologists who have worked here have never turned up evidence to support the account in the Bible , and there is only one archaeological find that even suggests the Jews were ever in Egypt .
Books have been written on the topic , but the discussion has , for the most part , remained low - key as the empirically minded have tried not to incite the spiritually minded .
“ Sometimes as archaeologists we have to say that never happened because there is no historical evidence , ” Dr. Hawass said , as he led the journalists across a rutted field of stiff and rocky sand .
The site was a two - hour drive from Cairo , over the Mubarak Peace Bridge into the Northern Sinai area called Qantara East .
For nearly 10 years , Egyptian archaeologists have scratched away at the soil here , using day laborers from nearby towns to help unearth bits of history .
It is a vast expanse of nothingness , a flat desert moonscape .
Two human skeletons were recently uncovered , their bones positioned besides pottery and Egyptian scarabs .
As archaeological sites go , it is clearly a stepchild to the more sought - after digs in other parts of the country that have revealed treasures of pharaonic times .
A barefoot worker in a track suit tried to press through the crowd to get the officials leading the tour to give him his pay , and tramped off angrily when he was rebuffed .
Recently , diggers found evidence of lava from a volcano in the Mediterranean Sea that erupted in 1500 B.C. and is believed to have killed 35,000 people and wiped out villages in Egypt , Palestine and the Arabian Peninsula , officials here said .
The same diggers found evidence of a military fort with four rectangular towers , now considered the oldest fort on the Horus military road .
But nothing was showing up that might help prove the Old Testament story of Moses and the Israelites fleeing Egypt , or wandering in the desert .
Dr. Hawass said he was not surprised , given the lack of archaeological evidence to date .
But even scientists can find room to hold on to beliefs .
Google 's problem , first reported by the Googlified Web site and since patched by Google , resulted from the way Google software stored information in a JavaScript file on the company 's servers .
Prior to the patch , an attacker could overwrite the JavaScript Object Notation , or JSON , that Google used to send information from its servers to a user 's client device and gain access to all of the contact information stored in a user 's Gmail account , as long as that user was logged on to any Google application .
This is known as a " cross - site request forgery . "
JSON is what makes it possible for a Web mail application to , among other things , fill in the " To : " field in an e-mail from a user 's address book after the user has typed in just a few characters .
Google acknowledged that , over the New Year 's weekend , it was notified of a vulnerability related to the use of JSON objects that affected several of the company 's products .
" These objects , if abused , can expose information unintentionally , " Google information security manager Heather Adkins said in a statement .
The company claims that it corrected the problem within 24 hours of being notified .
" Google fixed the problem very quickly , which tells you how serious this was , " says Gary McGraw , chief technology officer of Cigital , a provider of Web application security services .
This latest Google vulnerability is " a bellwether of things to come as people get more serious about SOA and Web 2.0 capabilities , which are based on JavaScript and extensive client - side , browser - based functionality . "
While most security experts agree that guarding Web applications , a notorious security soft spot today , is crucial for the overall well - being of systems and data , they debate whether security vulnerabilities in consumer - focused Web apps such as Web mail , instant messaging , and social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook are a great threat to business IT systems .
Employees use Web mail and other Web - based services from their work computers , and IT managers have little control over how securely those Web applications are written .
Yankee Group senior analyst Andrew Jaquith says that it's what we do n't know about Web applications that make them so dangerous .
" Because they are n't fully understood , they 're going to attract a lot of attention from hackers , " he says , adding that this should concern IT managers because " consumer - grade applications are increasingly becoming de facto parts of corporate IT infrastructures . "
This means employees may be mixing IT work with pleasure in their cubicles , potentially adding work - related information to the vast repositories managed by Web mail systems .
For example , whenever a user can't remember a password for a given
Web site , they 'll typically have that password mailed to a Web mail account because they can access that account from any computer with an Internet connection .
If these passwords are for work - related sites , Web mail security becomes a problem .
" Web mail accounts give you access to everything , " says Jeremiah Grossman , founder and CTO of WhiteHat Security , a maker of Web application security assessment software .
Grossman , who also worked at Yahoo as its security officer , notes that cross - site request forgeries can be used for more than poaching information from Web mail accounts .
" An attacker can gain access to any account the user is logged on to , " he says .
" This includes Web mail address books and even bank accounts . "
Under another scenario , a Web mail user 's ID and password could be stolen and then used by the attacker to send bogus messages to the victim 's co-workers .
" All the attacker has to do is send a Web mail saying ' I 'm working from home today ; use my Web mail account ' , " McGraw says .
This trick could divert all sorts of business - related information to a Web mail account .
Yet other security experts see Web mail as more of a danger for users purposely or inadvertently leaking data out of their employers '
IT environments , rather than as an attack vector for malware .
" Applications that your employees are going to use that are not under the control of your IT department are definitely a security concern , " says 451 Group senior analyst Nick Selby .
But , " if an attacker is using malware , that 's already being addressed by checking endpoints and isolating infected end points , " he adds .
Google , Yahoo , and other Web companies that rely on the fancy Web 2.0 features enabled by JavaScript will most likely continue to respond quickly to security vulnerabilities , although it 's less comforting to know that a site known as Googlified was the first to point out the most recent problem .
While it 's unrealistic for IT managers to stop the use of Web applications , they should be aware of the potential threats to their IT systems and data .
Speaking in Washington after signing the veto , Mr Bush said setting a deadline for withdrawal would be " setting a date for failure " in Iraq .
He said the funding was needed to give time for the new strategy of a surge of reinforcements in Baghdad to succeed .
Mr Bush said he would seek a compromise with Congressional leaders .
It is only the second time since taking office that Mr Bush has used the presidential veto .
Earlier on Tuesday , leaders of the Democrat - controlled US Congress signed the controversial bill agreeing to $ 100bn ( £ 50 bn ) in further funding on condition US combat troops begin to withdraw this year .
The president wants a blank cheque ; the Congress is not going to give it to him
Nancy Pelosi
Democratic House Speaker
Mr Bush criticised the bill , saying it " substitutes the opinions of politicians for the judgement of our military commanders .
" I believe setting a deadline for a withdrawal would demoralise the Iraqi people , would encourage killers across the broader Middle East , and send a signal that America will not keep its commitments , " he said in a televised speech .
Compromise talks
The veto is the latest stage in Mr Bush 's clash with Congress over the conduct of the Iraq war .
Reacting to the veto , Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the bill reflected the wishes of Americans to have benchmarks for what is happening in Iraq .
" We had hoped that the president would have treated it with the respect that bipartisan legislation supported overwhelmingly by the American people deserved .
" The president wants a blank cheque ; the Congress is not going to give it to him , " she said .
President Bush has poured extra US troops into Baghdad
Mr Bush will now meet congressional leaders on Wednesday to try to reach a compromise on a revised funding bill for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Democrats acknowledge they will eventually have to soften their bill as they cannot risk being accused of undercutting the troops during wartime , says the BBC's James Westhead in Washington .
Revised legislation would have to be agreed by both the House and the Senate before being presented to him again .
' Publicity stunt '
Tuesday was the fourth anniversary of a speech in which Mr Bush declared major combat operations in Iraq over , standing beneath a banner proclaiming " mission accomplished " .
Speaking before the signing of the bill , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino accused the Democrats of cynically delaying the move so it would coincide with the anniversary for political gain .
" It 's very disturbing to think that they possibly held up this money for the troops and the troops ' families and the resources they need to try some PR stunt on this day , " Ms Perino said .
Mr Bush is committed to his " surge " strategy , under which thousands of extra US troops are being poured into Baghdad .
The top US general in Iraq , David Petraeus , has said reducing forces could lead to increased violence .
A group of Princeton computer scientists has published a study that examines flaws and vulnerabilities in Diebold 's AccuVote - TS voting machines .
Complete with a video that demonstrates the ease with which the electronic voting machine can be compromised , the study provides chilling insight into the serious risk of election tampering and fraud created by modern voting technology .
The vote - stealing demonstration software developed by the computer scientists " can modify all of the records , audit logs , and counters kept by the voting machine , so that even careful forensic examination of these records will find nothing amiss . "
The study reveals that " [ m ] alicious software running on a single voting machine can steal votes with little if any risk of detection , " and that the software can be installed on a voting machine in only a minute by anyone that has physical access .
The study also discovered that Diebold 's AccuVote - TS systems can be targeted by self - propagating viruses " that can spread malicious software automatically and invisibly from machine to machine during normal pre- and post- election activity . "
The computer scientists conclude that defects are present in the hardware of the AccuVote - TS as well as the software .
Although some issues can be mitigated by software updates , the machines themselves will have to be replaced in order to eliminate some of the problems identified by the study .
The AccuVote - TS machines are designed to automatically install code from a removable memory card during the boot process .
A virus embedded in a bootloader image file stored on a memory card will automatically infect any machine that is booted while the card is inserted .
The virus written by the Princeton experts will automatically install itself on every memory card inserted into the machine during subsequent boot processes .
So , when a technician tries to update an infected system , the memory card containing the update will be altered and the virus will be passed on to any other voting machine that the technician tries to update from that memory card .
The paper suggests several ways to mitigate potential voting machine problems .
Requiring that all updates be digitally signed could potentially prevent unauthorized software from infecting and manipulating voting machines .
Limiting physical access to memory cards and voting machines could also help prevent tampering .
The paper cites a study conducted in 2006 , in which researchers addressed issues like " lack of inventory control and gaps in the chain of custody , " pointing out the need for policies that establish secure handling and management practices for voting machines .
The paper also advocates parallel testing , system certification , and paper trails as other potential solutions .
Last month , we reported on election disruptions that occurred in Alaska as a result of Diebold machine defects .
Yesterday , Johns Hopkins University computer science professor Avi Rubin wrote a blog entry about a day at the polls with the Diebold AccuVote - TS .
Serving as an election judge in the Maryland primary , Rubin witnessed numerous Diebold machine voting failures and deficiencies firsthand .
From missing access cards to dysfunctional electronic poll books to ineffective anti-tamper mechanisms , the machines were nothing but trouble .
Machines crashed , refused to synchronize , and inaccurately reported whether or not a citizen had already voted .
One of the most disturbing revelations of the day related to Diebold 's business practices rather than the machines themselves .
The Diebold representative assigned to the precinct had been hired the day before , and had only received a brief six hours of training in a massive session with 80 other people .
The representative admitted to having virtually no familiarity with the hardware , and claimed that Diebold hired cheap contractors to do the job rather than well - trained technicians in order to save money .
The representative , who did n't even know how to set the machines up , gave up and left in frustration halfway through the day .
The state of California banned Diebold voting machines , and sued the company for machine - related fraud after flaws were found in the AccuVote - TSx machines used in a 2004 election .
The constant stream of discovered vulnerabilities and problems in real elections may finally compel other states to do the same .
Diebold has not yet responded to our requests for a comment , but sources say that the company is attempting to pressure the Princeton group into retracting the study .
In the past Diebold typically responds to criticisms of its voting machines by asserting that the systems operate securely when properly configured .

StarOffice is Sun 's suite of integrated word processing , spreadsheet , presentation , drawing and database software based on the OpenOffice open source project .
StarOffice or OpenOffice users can add their own browsers and e-mail applications , while Sun offers Sun Java Communications Suite for customers that want to add messaging , collaboration , calendaring and scheduling tools .
Google 's dip into OpenOffice began with its hiring of Joerg Heilig , former director of software engineering at Sun , according to Gary Edwards , a consultant and designated representative of the OpenOffice.org open source community .
" He was the project manager for StarOffice , a longtime employee of the Star division , and a very important person to StarOffice , " Edwards said .
" When he left , there were some real tears .
Also a great deal of apprehension . "
Community scuttlebutt was that Google was on a hunt for OpenOffice and StarOffice developers , and everyone in the company 's Hamburg division was a target , according to Edwards .
" No one knows what Google was going to do with Joerg , but they had the keys to the kingdom when they got him , " Edwards said .
It has long been rumored that Google is developing its own operating system or desktop , with an online calendaring application scheduled to be released in October .
The partnership with Sun seems to indicate that Google 's direction is to build out what is , in essence , an alternative to Microsoft Office .
Google already offers e-mail , photo managing and instant messaging applications .
Vendors of hosted business productivity tools did n't seem concerned about a threat from Google .
Satish Dharmaraj , CEO of Zimbra , which last week delivered a beta version of an open source browser - based system for e-mail , calendar and contacts , said that Google 's entry would validate Zimbra Collaboration Suite 's strategy .
I 'm tired of Sony 's bullshit .
You may know Sony most readily as the company that recently recalled something on the order of every laptop battery ever made because of a small glitch ( they explode ) .
Then there was the " rootkit " debacle , where Sony secretly installed hidden bullshit on your computer .
One of Sony BMG 's presidents handled the situation with the delicacy of a gang rape with this quote : " Most people , I think , do n't even know what a rootkit is , so why should they care about it ? "
Good point , shit - head !
And before that , Sony was known for its shitty optical drives in their PS2s , resulting in a class action lawsuit .
The word " shitty " in the previous sentence is a bit misleading , since I also use the word to describe Ren�e Zellweger 's life , and having to void your warranty by adjusting a cog to fix a misaligned laser inside your PS2 is slightly shittier .
Not content with the reaming they give consumers with their shoddy products and condescending attitude , Sony determined that it did n't have enough bad press , so they decided to wield their giant gnarled cock of corporate greed again , this time training it on a small - time import shop called " Lik Sang . "
Lik Sang was a haven for nerds who wanted to import games and systems from other countries .
It turns out that Lik Sang broke some major laws that not only earned them the scorn of Sony , but pissed Sony off to the point where they sued Lik Sang into oblivion .
So what was this grave infraction committed against Sony that not only threatened the very foundation of this giant multi-national corporation , but warranted destroying the lives and careers of a group of dorks running a gaming website ?
Simple : they committed the mortal sin of selling Japanese PSPs to European gamers .
Oh no !
Not that !
When I read the law suit , I did a double take to make sure I read it correctly .
Sony is suing to prevent people from selling PSPs ?
Great move , morons !
Because if there 's anything Sony needs right now , it 's fewer people buying PSPs .
In fact , PSP sales are part of the reason Sony expects to lose $ 1.7 billion dollars in their gaming division by March .
That means that I and anyone else who makes any money at all between now and March ( or at least manages not to lose more than $ 1,699,999,999.99 ) will officially make more money than Sony 's gaming division .
I rule .
This is n't the first time Sony bullied a gaming website for selling PSP imports .
In June of 2005 , Sony sued a website called ElectricBirdLand ( Sony literally hired men in dark sunglasses to deliver the papers to the defendant , because Sony is insecure about the size of its penis ) , stating that the sale of Japanese PSPs to the UK could hurt their ability to exploit the " excitement and anticipation of the market . "
Hey Sony , you know what else could help you exploit the excitement and anticipation of the market ?
The PSP not sucking :
Sony 's strategy towards portable gaming seems to be to take the same shitty first generation Playstation games that were n't great to begin with , and make them portable so now we can take an example of Sony 's utter - inability - to - stop - sucking with us everywhere we go .
Nobody wants to buy movies in your stupid proprietary format , assholes !
So why does a company that relies on consumer satisfaction and brand recognition treat its fans with such contempt ?
Because ...
Sony hates you .
Sony would love nothing more than to see you and your family suffer .
Sony is like that psycho-ex who you had a few good times with , but was too clingy and the sex got boring .
Now it 's over and Sony is still stewing about it by leaving you voice mail asking for another chance and promising it " can change . "
Tough shit Sony .
We 've moved on .
We 're dating your younger , hotter sister , Wii .
Even your fuglier step - sister , Xbox 360 , looks hotter than you do .
At least she 's been around the block a few times and knows how to turn tricks .
You 've got nothing , and it 's going to stay that way until you stop being a crabby old cunt .
2,888,889 people are tired of Sony 's bullshit .

Their efforts to get people to reenlist border on the bizarre .
For example , Gall interviewed a man who made headlines for being arrested for being part of the Taliban .
However , the real reason he was arrested was because he would n't reenlist in the Taliban .
In other words , Pakistan is doing one thing and telling the Western media another for their consumption .
The relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban fighters has been historic .
For instance , Pakistan has helped them fight the USSR when they were still in power in return rigging local elections in the favor of the religious factions there .
It is interesting that the Pakistani government trusts them more than they trust the Bush administration , whom they will not allow to operate along their borders or try to capture Bin Laden .
They are now sheltering Bin Laden , which should have been a capital offense in Bush 's book .
The ISI , the Pakistani intelligence service , has the capability to capture Bin Laden .
Nothing goes on in the northeastern part of that country along the border with Afghanistan without their knowledge .
People were so fearful of them that they would only speak to the reporter on the condition that they not be named .
The fact that they refuse to do so means that they are against us in Bush 's own book .
Musharraf pledged that his country would do anything it could to get rid of religious extremism in his country .
However , that was a bald - faced lie that he told to cover his own scalp .
It is really interesting that Bush got a dose of his own Neocon medicine here -- Musharraf told Bush the Straussian version of the Noble Lie -- telling him what he wanted to hear and then doing what he thought was best .
The JUI is the regional party and an important political ally for the Pakistani president .
They openly support the Taliban regime ; in their school , there were posters saying , " Long Live Mullah Omar ! "
Yet we have heard no word of condemnation from Bush , who supposedly was going to hold Pakistan and any other country that sheltered terrorists to account .
In their Massadras , they preach a violent brand of Islam where they equate Jihad with violence .
Many of the students who attend that school go off and fight for the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Many go on to commit suicide bombings , inspiring others to come to their school .
The vicious cycle goes on and on .
Members of the government are regular nighttime visitors to the school .
My question is , why would members of the government visit that place at night ?
It seems that contrary to their stated intentions , Pakistan is actively working to undermine the interests of the Bush administration in Afghanistan even as they pledge over and over again to fight terrorism and take billions of taxpayer dollars worth of modern weapons .
Pakistan , of course , lies about this on a regular basis .
They have mastered the art of lying from the Bush administration , and they lie to their would - be master on a regular basis .
The exact words of one of their spokesman , confronted by a NATO report documenting Taliban activity in the area , are , " You can count the numbers of the Taliban on one finger . "
Of course -- they are all in Southern Afghanistan fighting to establish a stronghold in that part of the country .
And the reach of the ISI is scary -- they have agents among the Afghan Army 's own generals .
That would be like 2 - 3 of our own generals secretly working for the Soviet Union by handing over maps and plans during the height of the Cold War .
The occupation of Afghanistan is every bit of a disaster as the one of Iraq .
No post - war planning , no clue on how to rebuild an Afghan army , no accounting for the massive tribalism , and outsourcing important tasks like the capture of Bin Laden to the Afghan warlords .
I wonder if the person in charge of the capture of Bin Laden was bought and paid for by the ISI .
The village of Karbala seems to be the one which is the heart of Taliban activity .
Unlike the surrounding countryside , it has all sorts of lavish mosques , houses , and massadrahs .
Yet nobody from the Bush administration seems to want to ask questions about any kind of activity in that village or any other kind of activity .
They look the other way .
For them , it is see no evil , hear no evil .
Bush was actually telling the truth when he said that he was not concerned about Bin Laden .
And then , there is the matter of people who are travelling the circuits , speaking at masaddrahs , and preaching the need for Jihad .
There are people like Hamid Gul , who does that sort of thing for a living .
And then , there are people like Azizullah , who was a religious scholar who became widely mourned after becoming a Taliban commander and who was killed in the fighting .
People like that are heroes in this area , not villians like we might think of them as .
Then , there are others who completely disappear from their families and go off and do n't tell anyone that they are going to go to Afghanistan to commit suicide bombings .
Nobody knows how they got in contact with the Taliban .
Nobody knows how they turned from family men to Jihadists whose only calling was to die and go to heaven .
Nobody would tell this family what happened to their son or where he was even when he was alive .
These groups teach that duty to their twisted version of Jihad is more important than any kind of duty to family whatsoever .
And , as one villager told the reporter , " You ca n't get into Afghanistan without the help of the ISI . "
One thing that was not talked about in the story , but which is important , is the rampant poverty that is in the area .
People make the kinds of choices that these people do because of the poverty and the hopelessness that they have to deal with on a daily basis .
When confronted with a choice between 50 years of poverty and wondering where their next food will come from and going to heaven right now , many people choose the latter .
This is no different than the millions of people who chose Christianity over Roman Paganism because of its promise of an eternal afterlife as compared to the rampant poverty of the Roman Empire and the emptiness of Bread and Circuses .
It is clear when looking at these sad stories that the best way to stop future terrorism on US soil is ending the vicious cycle of poverty and ending all types of religious fundamentalism that prey on these people .
This should not be construed as an attack on Islam as all ; most Muslims do not subscribe to the extreme orthodoxy written about here .
This should be read as an attack on religious fundamentalism and its dangerous forms of escapism that do not properly allow one to address the problems of this world .
The Ron Paul Effect Republican congressman keeps the Internet buzzing in White House bid .
May 7 , 2007  -- Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , who barely registers in public opinion polls of the Republican presidential field , won last Thursday night 's debate .
That was the unmistakable conclusion of the online poll posted by debate sponsor MSNBC , which registered Paul with higher positive ratings and lower negative numbers than any of the other nine candidates on the stage .
ABC 's post - debate Internet survey showed an even clearer victory for Paul , with the congressman taking more than 9,400 of 11,000 votes as of 12:30 p.m. Monday .
( Rudy Giuliani is the next ranked candidate , with barely 150 votes . )
So are the polls missing a Paul boomlet ?
Is the famously contrarian ob - gyn -- a libertarian nicknamed " Dr. No " because of his propensity to vote against anything he believes contradicts the Constitution 's original intent -- poised to surge into contention in the GOP field ?
Not likely .
What 's more likely , based on Web traffic over the past week , is that Paul supporters have mastered the art of " viral marketing , " using Internet savvy and blog postings to create at least the perception of momentum for his long - shot presidential bid .
The Ron Paul Effect
Since online polls are n't scientific -- people choose to take them , and many people vote multiple times -- doing well in them does n't necessarily mean a campaign is on the move .
But Internet buzz can have a carry - over effect , said Peter Greenberger , an online strategist at New Media Strategies and a former Democratic political operative .
" It 's evidence of something -- either passionate supporters , active supporters , or just one very savvy supporter who 's able to vote several thousand times , " Greenberger said .
" If it leads to one or two stories in the mainstream media , that could lead to a bounce online , and could lead to some fundraising successes . "
With strong support among libertarians who are unhappy with the top- tier Republican contenders , Paul has a robust online presence .
His MySpace profile boasts nearly 12,000 " friends . "
Today , his name ranks in the Top 10 among blog search terms at Technorati.com , behind Paris Hilton but ahead of Mario Lopez .
After Thursday night 's debate , the comment sections of several major news organizations -- including ABC's -- were inundated with pro-Paul messages .
Viewers raved about Paul 's commitment to abolishing the IRS , his steadfast opposition to a national ID card , and a forthright tone that bloggers said set him apart from the other candidates onstage .
The Paul campaign did not immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail message seeking comment .
What Makes Writing Unforgettable ?
When people tell me I write well , it ’s because I do something extra .
After I finish writing and revising a piece , I go back again to listen .
I listen to the rhythm and sounds of the words .
I listen and make small tweaks .
It ’s like being a technician at a sound board .
I ’m mixing the music of the language .
I say that seriously .
One guy who understood what I mean , who really had it down , was Abe Lincoln , the 16th U.S. President .
He understood that fewer words and more music would deliver more meaning .
To me , that ’s the reason his Gettysburg Address — less than 300 words — is considered the most remembered American speech in our history .
Listen to the Music of the Language
Read the first paragraph of The Gettysburg Address below .
Read to see what the words say .
Now read to hear the music , do n’t think about what the words mean .
Read them aloud slowly , evenly .
Listen to how they sound .
Read the paragraph aloud two or three times this way .
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent , a new nation , conceived in Liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal .
— Abraham Lincoln , The Gettysburg Address
Do you hear the rhythm , the rat - tat - tat of the syllables ?
It ’s kind of fun to say the words , especially liberty , .
dedicated , and proposition .
Those words seem to stand out at the right spots .
Can you hear the difference that occurs when you change that last word equal to the term the same .
The sounds change too .
The two syllables of equal have more stress on the first syllable — E-qual .
That difference in stress does n’t happen with the two words — the same .
It does n’t sound like an ending .
Without that ending , without the feeling of closure , the impact of the whole sentence is lost .
The final word does n’t ring and stay in our ears — or our minds if we ’re reading silently .
Unconsciously we ’re waiting for the next word , the way we wait for the next shoe to drop .
The sentence feels incomplete rhythmically .
Abe Lincoln understood how words make meaning and how they make music .
You could almost sing the Gettysburg Address .
It would n’t surprise me if folks already have .
It ’s not hard to do what Abe did .
Adding Music to What you Write
Just like playing a guitar , writing musically takes practice .
You can do that .
Here ’s how you tweak your writing to bring out the music of the language .
1. Write in your usual process .
Edit and revise as always .
2 . Be certain your message is clear and ready to publish .
3 . Read your work aloud saying every syllable slowly , evenly , and paying attention to the sounds only .
Listen for
a word or phrase that just does n’t sound right
a word or sentence that seems too short or too long
a word or phrase that makes you lose your reading rhythm
a sentence seems to stop abruptly
an unintentional rhyme
a place that feels like something is missing
4 . Edit to correct for those issues you found .
This is the fun part .
Choose more powerful and more precise words than those you replace .
The more you do it the better you ’ll be at adding the natural music of language to what you write .
Once you get used to listening for it , you ’ll write more musically too .
Putting meaning and musical language together is about as compelling as a writer can get .
It can move a whole nation to think , as Abe did .
But , in a larger sense , we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground .
— Abraham Lincoln , The Gettysburg Address
Go ahead , tell me that ’s not music .
I love the music of the language .

I could n't help but notice how different my media consumption has been surrounding the terrorist attacks in London from September 11th .
When my girlfriend came and hammered on my door on the morning of September 11th I turned on CNN and just watched .
When I heard about the bombings in London I looked it up on Flickr , Nowpublic , Wikipedia , Wikinews to mention a few .
It seems the editors / writers / journalists at the dinosaur blogs did the same .
In fact , not only did these old school media folks go online for their news gathering , but they took citizen 's media and ran front page stories with it .
You probably saw the image that Adam Stacey took on his cameraphone :
It was posted here with a Creative Commons license .
Then the image immediately appeared here , then here , then here and then onto the cover of many newspapers in London and abroad .
It has been viewed almost 70 000 times on Flickr , as well as millions of times on other more popular sites and newspapers .
This was just one of the examples ( among many ) where normal people became frontline media gatherers .
" On Thursday morning in London , only minutes after the fourth terrorist bomb blew the top off a red double - decker bus in Tavistock Square , editors at the Times of London on - line unit called for readers to e-mail photos of the disasters unfolding around the city .
The BBC website did the same .
Over at the Guardian Online , editors directed people to post digital pictures on the popular photo - sharing site Flickr.com .
One cellphone snapshot at Flickr , which captured the murky despair and chaos on a crippled Underground train , became an early icon of the attacks and was picked up by the websites of the Guardian , the Evening Standard and other papers . "
Globe and Mail
" A grainy cell phone video taken by a survivor gave viewers worldwide their first look at the London Underground bombing -- and shined a spotlight on a small but growing part of electronic newsgathering .
" Hollywood Reporter
" Among the more striking photos appearing online after Thursday 's coordinated London explosions was one of a double - decker bus , its front intact but its sides and top ripped open .
The image , on the BBC's Web site , came not from a staff photographer but from an amateur who happened on the scene with a digital camera . "
Forbes
" As journalists scrambled to cover the London bomb blasts , ordinary citizens went online to share pictures snapped by cameraphones and reports of what they saw .
At Technorati.com , a search engine for blogs , eight of the top 10 searches Thursday were related to the blasts . "
Wall Street Journal
" Some of the most intimate images of yesterday 's bomb blasts in London came from cell phones equipped with cameras and video recorders , demonstrating how a technology originally marketed as entertainment has come to play a significant role in up - to - the - minute news . "
Washington Post " The images that defined the media coverage of the July 7 London terrorist bombings , which claimed more than 50 lives , came not from professional news crews but from everyday people . "
National Geographic
All of this inspired me to want to capture the day I 'd like to remember not for the attacks ( although I 'll never forget ) but for the day citizen 's media officially went mainstream .
So I created this screencast ( ~40 MB .mov MIRROR 1 , MIRROR 2 thanks Michael , MIRROR 3 thanks Jared , MIRROR 4 thanks andrew , MIRROR 5 / CORAL ? ) of the Wikipedia entry for the attacks as animated by Dan Phiffer 's Wikipedia Animate Greasemonkey script .
The script was created as a result of Andy Baio 's contest .
The idea was inspired by Jon Udell 's screencasts .
It shows the first 923 edits to the Wikipedia entry .
You can also see the date and time of the edits flashing near the top .
I sped the video up to keep it short and the result is a time lapse in the development of a Wikipedia entry as events unfolded that day .
The entry itself now has over 2300 edits .
I think I created this as a response to how I feel about the events .
Terrorism represents the absolute worst in humanity whereas the response to these attacks , from the Wikipedia , to the blogs , to the international solidarity , to the overall resilience of the Brits represents the best !

I ’m not sure how young I was when I first doubted the existence of Santa Claus .
Maybe seven years old ?
Yes , the impossibility of Santa making all those deliveries in one night bothered me a bit , as did the whole , “ he wo n’t show up if you ’re not asleep ” thing , but it was probably some of the “ supporting evidence ” for Santa Claus that bothered me the most .
Like the letters I received that were supposed to be from Santa Claus , to me .
On the surface , these letters might seem to be proof of Santa ’s existence .
But the return address on the envelope read , “ North Pole , Alaska ” .
And even at seven years old , I was smart enough to know that the North Pole is n’t in Alaska !
That was the kind of dumb mistake , I thought , that a grown - up would make when trying to fake out a kid .
Either that , or there was a town called “ North Pole ” in Alaska , in which case the letter ’s return address could be legitimate … but the letter would still be a fake .
Santa was supposed to live at the North Pole , not in a town called “ North Pole ” , after all !
So I devised a clever plan – well , clever for a seven - year old , anyway – that would trap my mother ( who still insisted that Santa Claus was real ) into admitting the truth .
I guess , even at that age , I preferred facing painful truths to believing pleasant lies .
But I Wo n’t Tell You What It Was… Just Yet
Now , for a kid , Christmas is all about the anticipation .
You have that one toy that you want more than anything , and even if you know there ’s no Santa Claus , and you already sneaked into your parents ’ room and found where they hid the thing , you still have to wait until Christmas morning !
Heck , for me the anticipation was that much greater if I knew I was getting the thing I wanted .
If I did n’t find the hidden presents , then who knew what I might end up with ?
Maybe that box under the tree was n’t a toy at all , but was really some terribly useful gift such as underwear !
But once you actually get the thing you want , it ’s usually a disappointment .
Oh sure , you ’re incredibly happy on Christmas day , and you may even play with the toy for months afterward …
But it ’s just not the same as when you imagined it !
Before Christmas , the thing you want seems magical and perfect .
Surely it will transform your life from a realm of tedium , into daily celebration at the wondrous miracle of its toy - ous perfection !
But when the real thing appears , you discover it ’s just another toy .
It has its good points and its bad points , and there are only so many things you can do with it .
The real toy cannot compare to the imaginary one , and you quickly become accustomed to its existence .
Life goes back to normal , as it always does … until the next year , and the next must - have toy comes around .
And before I even reached the age of twelve , I had pretty much figured that cycle out .
Every year , by New Year ’s day , I would realize that I had fallen into that cycle again .
But even though I knew that no toy had ever made me happy for more than a short while , it never stopped me from wanting another toy the following year .
But this was not because I really believed that each new toy was different .
It ’s just that the part of a person that understands this cycle , and the part of a person that does the wanting and craving are …
Two Different Parts Of The Brain
You see , our brains evolved to give out the maximum pleasure reward , not for the pleasant things we already have , but for the pleasant things we anticipate getting .
Literally , it is the thrill of the chase !
Imagine an animal searching for food – perhaps a predator seeking prey .
The animal sees something that might be a footprint of its prey .
Should it investigate ?
At this point , the brain ’s “ seeking ” circuit kicks in , giving the predator a powerful reward for having looked for footprints in the first place .
Or for having come to this area looking for prey .
Or whatever else the animal is doing that led to this possible prey sighting .
The animal will now come back to the area more frequently to look .
Why ?
Because the pleasure produced by the “ seeking ” circuit is the most powerful the brain can produce .
In fact , early brain research mistook the seeking circuit for the brain ’s “ pleasure center ! ”
Do you remember those experiments where they gave lab rats a lever that would stimulate their brains ’ “ pleasure centers ” , and the rats would then just sit around pushing the lever until they starved ?
Well , that was really the seeker circuit .
So you could say that …
Those Rats Literally Killed Themselves with Anticipation !
As I explained almost a year ago , in Smelling The Fear , Feeling The Future ( which is also chapter 16 of You , Version 2.0 ) , our feelings are nature ’s crude way of predicting the future .
Bad feelings predict bad futures , and good feelings predict good ones .
This is important , because , as I said then :
It ’s better for an animal ’s survival to respond to the fear of something , than the actual pain of it .
In a sense , the function of pain is merely to provide you with something to later fear , because punishing you for something that has already happened is n’t much use .
This is also why animals can learn to fear things by observing others of their species behave fearfully : if monkeys had to get bitten by tigers in order to fear them , it would n’t be very good for their odds of survival .
And the same principle applies to pleasure as to pain .
If you did n’t get the pleasure of food until you ate it , you would never survive long enough to learn how to look for food !
So , just as fear is the most overpowering negative emotion , so is anticipation the most powerful positive emotion .
Depending on how it is used , it can either produce the most wonderful experiences ever , or …
Destroy Your Life Entirely !
Consider , for example , how many marriages are run aground by one partner ’s addiction to the “ thrill of the chase ” .
Or financial lives are ruined by the anticipation of another “ big win ” at the slot machines or the gaming tables .
Even minor addictions like perpetually checking email or reading blogs are driven by small hits of the “ anticipation ” drug , and it does n’t matter whether you intellectually understand this or not .
Because your behavior , like it or not , is not driven by what you think , but by what you feel .
And unfortunately , our feelings are actually lousy predictors of the future , because life is n’t much like it was 100,000 years ago .
We are hundreds of times safer , and have ridiculously easy access to abundant quantities of almost anything we could possibly want , but our feelings are still tuned for a life of scarcity !
Recently , Josh Kaufman ( one of my Seven Days To Live Your Dreams participants and the creator of The Personal MBA ) wrote me with a link to an interesting talk on the psychology of happiness .
He knew I ’d be interested , because the talk gives some scientific background for some of the principles I spoke about in the Seven Days workshops , such as “ Indecision is suffering . ”
The talk was given by Dan Gilbert , the author of Stumbling On Happiness , and it explains just how bad at predicting the future our brains really are .
As Malcom Gladwell ( the author of “ Blink ” ) wrote in his review of Stumbling on Happiness :
We spend a great deal of our waking life imagining what it would be like to be this way or that way , or to do this or that , or taste or buy or experience some state or feeling or thing .
We do that for good reasons : it is what allows us to shape our life .
And it is by trying to exert some control over our futures that we attempt to be happy .
But by any objective measure , we are really bad at that predictive function .
We ’re terrible at knowing how we will feel a day or a month or year from now , and even worse at knowing what will and will not bring us that cherished happiness .
Gilbert sets out to figure what that ’s so : why we are so terrible at something that would seem to be so extraordinarily important ?
The talk gives a great explanation of some of the reasons for this , but I think that one of the more important reasons is one that the talk does n’t address .
Specifically , the issue is that the only thing about your future happiness that evolution is interested in predicting is …
Whether You ’re Still Around to Have Any !
See , evolution does n’t care if you have a great life , from your point of view .
Evolution ’s definition of a great life is just that you stay alive long enough to have lots of kids , who then go on to do the same .
And evolution does n’t give a damn if you ’re happy while you ’re doing all that , unless the lack of happiness somehow inteferes with your job of surviving and reproducing !
So there ’s no need for evolution to make us happy after we get the food , or the mate , or avoid getting killed , or whatever else it is we ’re supposed to be doing .
We get a little pleasure for celebration , sure , but that ’s basically it .
Tomorrow is another day , and you ’ll have to eat again , so it ’s back to “ normal ” feelings for you !
That way , the carrot of anticipation and the stick of fear will have meaning for you at just the right times for it to matter , so that we keep doing the things that evolution “ wants ” us to .
We experience pleasure and pain in our lives , not because of some mystical balance or battle between good and evil , but because we are evolution ’s genetic puppets .
Our genes pull the strings , and we dance accordingly .
And thus , the lesson of the day after Christmas …
That is , the day when life goes back to normal .
We will always think we will be happy when we get what we want , because our brains do not have any natural circuits for predicting what happens after we get what we want !
Such circuits are counterproductive from evolution ’s point of view , because if you started thinking about consequences , you might start wondering what the meaning of life was , and whether you should really go on with all the surviving and reproducing .
And then you might commit suicide or decide not to have kids , thereby ensuring that whatever stray genes caused your foresight will be wiped out of the gene pool , or at least reduced in number .
And that ’s why we break up our marriages , gamble away our savings , become overweight , get addicted , steal , or even read blogs instead of working !
Not because we can’t intellectually anticipate the negative consequences of our actions , but because the part of the brain that anticipates those things is merely the thinking part , not the feeling part .
And when your thoughts and feelings are in conflict …
Your Feelings Always Win !
So as you contemplate what you want in the new year , I encourage you to think about what happens after you get what you want .
How will you actually live your life differently ?
Because if you do n’t think about this , you may discover that what you get , is n’t really what you wanted .
After all , if you try to lose weight in order to become popular , you might not discover until much later that it was n’t your weight that made you unpopular !
And although my Seven Days course teaches quite a lot about how to create “ mouth - watering goals ” to leverage the power of anticipation , in the long run it matters more that you choose the right goals , than it is whether you achieve them !
Fortunately , there is a technique you can use to “ sanity - check ” your goals , that will let you know whether pursuing ( and achieving ) the goal will actually bring you long - term happiness .
But for now , I ’m not going to tell you what it is .
That way , you can truly savor the anticipation of waiting for my next article .

Le béton prêt à l’emploi est un béton fabriqué sur mesure dans une usine ou dans une centrale à béton selon les spécifications standard requises .
Le mélange de béton préparé est ensuite transporté sur le site de travail dans des malaxeurs de transit montés sur un camion - toupie .
Ce type de béton offre une plus grande pérennité et durabilité .
Le mélange formé d’eau , de granulats et de ciment effectué par un expert est de meilleure qualité et précis .
Cette méthode de fabrication du béton permet également de réaliser efficacement des mélanges de béton spéciaux .
Pourquoi utiliser le béton prêt à l’emploi ?
La popularité du béton prêt à l’emploi continue de croître alors que le mélange sur place décline .
Pourquoi ?
Pour plusieurs raisons que voici :
Qualité contrôlée
Le béton prêt à l’emploi est fabriqué selon des spécifications et respecte des réglementations strictes dans une centrale à béton .
Vous pouvez donc être assuré que le béton qui vous est fourni par les entreprises listées sur https://amarillo-concrete.com
est de meilleure qualité et sa consistance n’est plus à prouver .
Des systèmes informatisés garantissent que les bons rapports de mélange sont respectés avec beaucoup plus de précision que si vous mélangez à la main .
Gain de temps
Mélanger le béton à la main demande beaucoup de temps et d’efforts .
C’est du temps que vous pourriez consacrer à d’autres tâches plus productives .
La livraison de béton prêt à l’emploi depuis le site de référence https://amarillo-concrete.com sur votre chantier par camion - toupie réduit les heures de travail .
Gain de temps pour les grands projets commerciaux et est souvent plus économique que de payer une main - d’œuvre pour mélanger le béton à la main .
L’utilisation de pompes à béton et d’une série de véhicules de livraison permet de livrer le béton prêt à l’emploi sur les sites de pose de manière efficace et sans perte de temps ni d’efforts .
Plus respectueux de l’environnement
Grâce à des méthodes de mélange plus efficaces , la production de ciment et de déchets est réduite au minimum .
Cela est bénéfique pour l’environnement , car la production de béton prêt à l’emploi dans une usine utilise moins de ressources et d’énergie .
Elle réduit également la pollution par la poussière , car le ciment est utilisé en vrac plutôt qu’en sac .

Les différentes désignations du béton prêt à l’emploi
Il existe diverses désignations pour le béton , dont 3 , principalement :
Le béton à propriétés spécifiques
C’est un béton qui requiert précisément certaines caractéristiques souhaitées .
Ce béton doit au préalable être conforme à la norme NF EN 206 - 1 , qui est une norme européenne avec des spécificités propres à la France .
De plus , pour prétendre à cette désignation , ce type de béton doit remplir 5 conditions qui sont :
La dimension maximale des granulats
Sa classe de consistance
Sa classe de résistance à la compression
Sa classe d’exposition
Sa classe de chlorure
Le béton à composition prescrite et à composition prescrite dans une norme
Le béton à composition prescrite est un mélange pour lequel l’acheteur prescrit la composition et les composants exacts du béton et est responsable de s’assurer que ces proportions produisent un béton avec les performances requises .
Par contre , même si le béton à composition prescrite dans une norme est identique au béton à composition prescrite , il se distingue par un document technique unifié .
IT WAS LATE JUNE in Sarajevo when Gavrilo Princip shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife .
After emptying his revolver , the young Serb nationalist jumped into the shallow river that runs through the city and was quickly seized .
But the events he set in motion could not be so easily restrained .
Two months later , Europe was at war .
The understanding that small but violent acts can spark global conflagration is etched into the world ’s consciousness .
The reverberations from Princip ’s shots in the summer of 1914 ultimately took the lives of more than 10 million people , shattered four empires and dragged more than two dozen countries into war .
This hot summer , as the world watches the violence in the Middle East , the awareness of peace ’s fragility is particularly acute .
The bloodshed in Lebanon appears to be part of a broader upsurge in unrest .
Iraq is suffering through one of its bloodiest months since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
Taliban militants are burning schools and attacking villages in southern Afghanistan as the United States and NATO struggle to defend that country ’s fragile government .
Nuclear - armed India is still cleaning up the wreckage from a large terrorist attack in which it suspects militants from rival Pakistan .
The world is awash in weapons , North Korea and Iran are developing nuclear capabilities , and long - range missile technology is spreading like a virus .
Some see the start of a global conflict .
“ We ’re in the early stages of what I would describe as the Third World War , ” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said last week .
Certain religious websites are abuzz with talk of Armageddon .
There may be as much hyperbole as prophecy in the forecasts for world war .
But it ’s not hard to conjure ways that today ’s hot spots could ignite .

Consider the following scenarios :
* Targeting Iran :
As Israeli troops seek out and destroy Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon , intelligence officials spot a shipment of longer - range Iranian missiles heading for Lebanon .
The Israeli government decides to strike the convoy and Iranian nuclear facilities simultaneously .
After Iran has recovered from the shock , Revolutionary Guards surging across the border into Iraq , bent on striking Israel ’s American allies .
Governments in Syria , Jordan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia face violent street protests demanding retribution against Israel -- and they eventually yield , triggering a major regional war .
* Missiles away : With the world ’s eyes on the Middle East , North Korea ’s Kim Jong
Il decides to continue the fireworks show he began earlier this month .
But this time his brinksmanship pushes events over the brink .
A missile designed to fall into the sea near Japan goes astray and hits Tokyo , killing a dozen civilians .
Incensed , the United States , Japan ’s treaty ally , bombs North Korean missile and nuclear sites .
North Korean artillery batteries fire on Seoul , and South Korean and U.S. troops respond .
Meanwhile , Chinese troops cross the border from the north to stem the flow of desperate refugees just as U.S. troops advance from the south .
Suddenly , the world ’s superpower and the newest great power are nose to nose .
* Loose nukes : Al Qaeda has had Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in its sights for years , and the organization finally gets its man .
Pakistan descends into chaos as militants roam the streets and the army struggles to restore order .
India decides to exploit the vacuum and punish the Kashmir - based militants it blames for the recent Mumbai railway bombings .
Meanwhile , U.S. special operations forces sent to secure Pakistani nuclear facilities face off against an angry mob .

* The empire strikes back : Pressure for democratic reform erupts in autocratic Belarus .
As protesters mass outside the parliament in Minsk , president Alexander Lukashenko requests Russian support .
After protesters are beaten and killed , they appeal for help , and neighboring Poland -- a NATO member with bitter memories of Soviet repression -- launches a humanitarian mission to shelter the regime ’s opponents .
Polish and Russian troops clash , and a confrontation with NATO looms .
As in the run-up to other wars , there is today more than enough tinder lying around to spark a great power conflict .
The critical question is how effective the major powers have become at managing regional conflicts and preventing them from escalating .
After two world wars and the decades - long Cold War , what has the world learned about managing conflict ?
The end of the Cold War had the salutary effect of dialing down many regional conflicts .
In the 1960s and 1970s , every crisis in the Middle East had the potential to draw in the superpowers in defense of their respective client states .
The rest of the world was also part of the Cold War chessboard .
Compare the almost invisible U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo today to the deeply controversial mission there in the early 1960s .
( The Soviets were convinced that the U.N. mission was supporting a U.S. puppet , and Russian diplomats stormed out of several Security Council meetings in protest . )
From Angola to Afghanistan , nearly every Cold War conflict was a proxy war .
Now , many local crises can be handed off to the humanitarians or simply ignored .
But the end of the bipolar world has a downside .
In the old days , the two competing superpowers sometimes reined in bellicose client states out of fear that regional conflicts would escalate .
Which of the major powers today can claim to have such influence over Tehran or Pyongyang ?

Today ’s world has one great advantage : None of the leading powers appears determined to reorder international affairs as Germany was before both world wars and as Japan was in the years before World War II .
True , China is a rapidly rising power -- an often destabilizing phenomenon in international relations -- but it appears inclined to focus on economic growth rather than military conquest ( with the possible exception of Taiwan ) .
Russia is resentful about its fall from superpower status , but it also seems reconciled to U.S. military dominance and more interested in tapping its massive oil and gas reserves than in rebuilding its decrepit military .
Indeed , U.S. military superiority seems to be a key to global stability .
Some theories of international relations predict that other major powers will eventually band together to challenge American might , but it ’s hard to find much evidence of such behavior .
The United States , after all , invaded Iraq without U.N. approval and yet there was not even a hint that France , Russia or China would respond militarily .
There is another factor working in favor of great - power caution : nuclear weapons .
Europe ’s leaders on the eve of World War I can perhaps be forgiven for not understanding the carnage they were about to unleash .
That generation grew up in a world of short wars that did limited damage .
Leaders today should have no such illusions .

The installation of emergency hot lines between national capitals was a recognition of the need for fast and clear communication in times of crisis .
Diplomatic tools have advanced too .
Sluggish though it may be , the U.N. Security Council regularly gathers the great powers ’ representatives in a room to hash out developing crises .
So there is reason to hope that the major powers have little interest in playing with fire and the tools to stamp it out .
But complacency is dangerous .
The British economist Norman Angell once argued persuasively that deep economic links made conflict between the great powers obsolete .
His book appeared in 1910 and was still in shops when Europe ’s armies poured across their borders in 1914 .
Chinese surgeons have performed the world 's first penis transplant on a man whose organ was damaged beyond repair in an accident this year .
The incident left the man with a 1 cm - long stump with which he was unable to urinate or have sexual intercourse .
" His quality of life was affected severely , " said Dr Weilie Hu , a surgeon at Guangzhou General Hospital .
Doctors spent 15 hours attaching a 10 cm penis to the 44 - year - old patient after the parents of a brain - dead man half his age agreed to donate their son's organ .
The procedure , described in a case study due to appear in the journal European Urology next month , represents a big leap forward in transplant surgery ; it required complex microsurgery to connect nerves and tiny blood vessels .
The surgical team claims the operation was a success .
After 10 days , tests revealed the organ had a rich blood supply and the man was able to urinate normally .
Doctors have previously succeeded in reuniting men with their sexual organs after traumatic accidents or attacks , but the Guangzhou operation is the first in which a donor penis has successfully been attached to another man .
Although the operation was a surgical success , surgeons said they had to remove the penis two weeks later .
" Because of a severe psychological problem of the recipient and his wife , the transplanted penis regretfully had to be cut off , " Dr Hu said .
An examination of the organ showed no signs of it being rejected by the body .
Jean - Michel Dubernard , the French surgeon who performed the world 's first face transplant on a woman who had been attacked by a dog this year , said psychological factors were a serious issue for many patients receiving certain " allografts " , or organs from donors .
" Psychological consequences of hand and face allografts show that it is not so easy to use and see permanently a dead person 's hands , nor is it easy to look in a mirror to see a dead person 's face , " he wrote in the journal .
" Clearly , in the Chinese case the failure at a very early stage was first psychological .
It involved the recipient 's wife and raised many questions . "
In 2001 , surgeons were forced to amputate the world 's first transplanted hand from Clint Hallam , a 50 - year - old New Zealander , who said he wanted the " hideous and withered " hand removed because he had become " mentally detached " from it .
The original transplant was conducted by Prof Dubernard 's team at the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons , who have since performed the world 's first double arm transplant .
Andrew George , a transplant expert at Imperial College , London , said : " Doing a penis transplant should be no more complex than anything else .
But it takes time for nerve sensations to kick in and it's not clear whether the patient would ever be able to have sex with it .
The question is whether it 's right to be doing a transplant for what may be seen as cosmetic reasons . "
Story Highlights • Escort - service operator describes man as a regular client
• Harlan K. Ullman says " allegations do not dignify a response "
• Ullman a leading theorist behind " shock and awe " strategy in Iraq war
• Name dropped during hearing on changing lawyers
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The alleged " D.C. madam " dropped a name in court documents filed Thursday , but the man named laughed at being accused of hiring the high - end escort service run by Deborah Jeane Palfrey .
Government prosecutors say Pamela Martin and Associates was actually a prostitution ring that Palfrey operated in the Washington area for 13 years .
Palfrey denies that her business provided sexual services to its customers .
In her motion to reconsider appointment of counsel , Palfrey named Harlan K. Ullman as " one of the regular customers " of the business .
Ullman is one of the leading theorists behind the " shock and awe " military strategy that was associated with the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
" The allegations do not dignify a response , " Ullman told CNN .
" I 'm a private , not a public , citizen .
Any further questions are referred to my attorneys . "
Ullman -- a former Navy commander and " a highly respected and widely recognized expert in national security whose advice is sought by governments and businesses , " according to his Web site -- also said he is considering " some sort of legal action . "
His attorney , Marc Mukasey of Bracewell & Giuliani in New York , declined to add to his client 's comment .
Palfrey 's civil defense attorney , Montgomery Blair Sibley , told CNN that it was his understanding that Ullman used the business ' services but did not engage in sexual activity with the escorts .
Palfrey is fighting a multiple - count racketeering and money - laundering indictment .
Her attorneys have been engaged in a battle with the court over documents that list the names and personal information of her clients .
U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler has restricted access to the documents , but Sibley argued that the order applies to the originals of the documents , not to copies .
Copies have already been given to a media outlet , he said .
The motion filed Thursday asks the judge to install Sibley in place of the public defender Palfrey has been assigned for the criminal case , and to order the government to continue to pay for her defense .
The government has seized her assets , and she cannot afford to pay on her own .
Sibley is Palfrey 's attorney in a civil case against one of her former employees .

' And if you go chasing rabbits , and you 're sure you 're going to fall , tell 'em a hookah smoking character has given you the fall . . . call Alice . . . when she was just small . . . .' ~ From ' White Rabbit ' by Jefferson Airplane ( Surrealistic Pillow , 1967 )
My first trip down the rabbit hole :
It was purple mescaline , as I recall .
I was 13 , maybe 14 , and in a friend 's cellar where his father ran a model train shop -- Lionel and all that .
As I let the small purple pill dissolve on my tongue to the point where I had to finally swallow it , my buddy told a group of us a story about a friend of his father 's who also ran a train shop elsewhere in Massachusetts .
Seems the cops were rather interested in the fact that this fellow had mail - ordered an enormous amount of brass screen material -- the kind dope smokers like to use for their pipes , bowls , and bongs .
Unaware , for whatever reason , that the suspect ran a model train shop and hosted a model train club once a month , the fuzz planned a raid .
With the suspect 's house now under constant surveillance , a bust was but a radio call away .
And as the cops oh - so cannily predicted , a night soon arrived when several cars showed up at the suspect 's residence .
This was it .
The word was passed and a surfeit of officers in unmarked vehicles swarmed to the scene .
Guns drawn , and armed with a search warrant , the boys in blue crashed through the door , certain they were about to shut down a huge pot smuggling ring .
Stunned , a group of seven or eight model train buffs greeted the pigs , and were indeed in possession of a huge amount of brass screening -- which they were in the process of fitting to the bottom of a train track so the electrical current would conduct more effectively over an unusually extensive length .
Around the time I stopped laughing , things started to get just a little different .
Spatial perception ; that was the first of my sensory faculties to become altered in this Brave New World of somatic exploration .
I looked down at my legs as I stood watching an electric choo - choo wend its way through a series of ersatz scale - model mountains , and they looked about a foot long .
At the same time , the gray cement floor looked as if it was some impossible distance away .
Miles , maybe .
Or light years .
I do n't remember what music was playing upstairs on the stereo as we talked , smoked cigarettes , and cracked up laughing by the cash register , but at some point I do remember we played Zinc with Eddie Jobson .
Everything seemed to have a slight greenish hue .
Everything was outrageously comical .
That was one hit , mind you .
Fun , a little freaky , and giddy as hell .
But my friends had told me about dropping 5 or 6 out at a place down the road known as Stickney 's Boulder a couple of weeks earlier where they 'd actually watched trees melt , blasted off into outer space riding on top of the boulder itself , and turned into werewolves .
This of course , I had to explore .
Over the next couple of years I took more purple mesc , DMT , orange sunshine , musical note , green dove , black Chinese , apple pie ( taken at a Grateful Dead concert in Maine , and no , Mom nor Old Glory were anywhere in the vicinity ) , blue microdot , and whatever other types or forms of pills or paper blotters Tim Leary 's ambrosia happened to come my way in than I could ever possibly recall - - along , of course , with bags and bags of grass .
But I have to say that of all the sensations and emotions I experienced while under the influence of those chemicals ( tasting sounds , hearing colors , closing your eyes only to see fantastic , geometrically impossible sculptures ) , never was there a loss of control or any entirely unpleasant episode .
A bummer , in other words .
At worst , the feelings and images flickering through me like shadows on some holographic plane lended suggestion to the idea of a darker realm .
Some Halloween world where the derangement was fathomless and inescapable .
A place where there was horror .
I never found that place , to my good fortune - - not entirely .
One of the first things dropping acid taught me ( your boy wo n't be a boy no more . . . young , but not a child ) was that LSD and mesc were no things to be fucking around with at all if your psyche was n't bolted together at least halfway solid .
I guess I must 've fit into that category somewhat ; I 'm still here to tell the tale .
However , I did have one episode that teetered on the brink .
Oh , yes .
And it 's funny -- almost surreal in itself -- to think that most of the real nasty stuff occurred in the living room of a kid whose last name was Rabbit .
I think I was 15 by this time , and hardcore into the bands I grew up with in the 70's and still listen to today .
I had a videocassette of the Led Zep movie The Song Remains the Same , and a buddy of mine had scored several hits of LSD - 100 .
The plan was to drop in the afternoon , then meet Mr. Rabbit ( I refrain from mentioning his real name in order to protect the innocent ) at his house before Mom and Dad Rabbit got home .
Mr. Rabbit had a VCR , and wanted to see the Led Zep flick , but minus the mind alterations .
Fair enough .
My buddy passed out the blotters to myself and one other dude along for the ride who shall remain nameless , and we dropped right in his station wagon .
The tabs were roughly double the size of postage stamps , plain white rough - milled paper with ' LSD - 100 ' actually stamped into the paper itself .
Just before laying that flavorless rectangle on my tongue , I had a premonition that this was going to be something heavy ; that some previously unimagined barrier was about to be crossed .
These were deeper waters , maybe .
Or darker ones .
I think we stopped and talked to a group of girls downtown before we ditched the car and set out on foot .
I still felt normal , and I 'd been down this road so many times before that I knew what to expect -- or thought I did , anyway .
We made it to Mr. Rabbit's .
He came to the door and gave us a sweaty , nervous once over .
We were all grinning like goblins , just starting to feel the first adrenalin rushes of the acid .
I do n't think Mr. Rabbit wanted us there at all - - he was far more paranoid of his parents coming home than we were , and we were the ones tripping -- but I think he did n't want us spreading his unhipness through the grapevine too much .
At 15 , for better or worse , that 's still a danger .
Clambering into the Rabbit living room , we turned on the tube and VCR , and popped in Zeppelin .
I was starting to feel lightheaded now , faint .
Then , as was also usual with the climb to the acid peak , I began to tremble .
But this time it was hard .
Real fucking hard .
It was n't until dropping blotter acid for the first time that I understood what Donovan meant by ' E - lec- trical banana ' or what the Dead and Ken Kesey meant by their ' Electric Kool - Aid Acid Test . '
The climb to the peak of Mt. LSD is truly like a high - voltage electrical charge straight through the carbon -arc of the brain .
The less potent the acid , the lower the voltage .
All the previous times I 'd dropped , the worst of it had felt like sticking your finger in a lamp socket .
LSD - 100 was like being struck by lightning , plain and simple .
I got down on the carpeted floor to see if I could ease the tremors .
Somehow , I managed to get a cigarette lit .
I took one drag , and already wanted another cigarette .
Mr. Rabbit tossed me a pillow .
On the TV , the movie was getting started .
In my head , the same thing was happening .
I turned to look at the television .
The entire floor I was laying on was rippling , like waves coming in towards a beach from a shallow lagoon , or the wake of a boat on a still lake .
To add to the nautical theme , the Rabbits had a wooden sculpture of a peg- legged pipe smoking sea captain on a shelf above the TV who started leering , jeering , grinning , and scowling at me .
Then , the pillow I was laying on became some fuzzy , furry animal with a heartbeat inside of it .
I threw it across the room .
An acid trip -- at least , any I 've ever been on -- is not like the climb in its entirety , or I 'd imagine only utter lunatics from the dark side of the moon and suicides would go on them .
Once one has achieved the peak , one is then rewarded with several hours of pleasant images and a relaxed mind -- at least , in most cases .
But to get there , you have got to hang on to that roller coaster when you 've taken a large enough dose .
There just is no other way .
Led Zeppelin were in full swing by now , and I tried focusing my attention on them .
It seemed to help subside the tension , along with the fact that I chain smoked roughly 5,000 cigarettes .
As the Zep went through their repertoire , things subsided - - a tad .
I was loosening up a bit , laughing .
Things had been just a shade rough there , but it was going to be all right .
I thought .
The concert was ending .
Mr. Rabbit announced , fearfully , that Mom and Dad Rabbit were due home any minute now .
I ejected the videocassette and asked if I could have a glass of water before myself and my two fellow trippers embarked into the patchy snows of mid-April to smoke grass , level off , and enjoy the rest of our visit to Wonderland .
He led us upstairs to the Rabbit kitchen , poured me a glass from the sink , and handed it over .
I downed that water in almost a single swallow .
The tripping and the physical trauma had left me parched .
I asked Mr. Rabbit for another .
He poured it , reminding me that we had to leave .
Now .
Yesterday .
Gotcha .
I drank off my second glass of H20 , handed the empty back to Mr. Rabbit , and was promptly sucked down onto the floor by an unbelievably powerful magnet .
I slumped against the Rabbit kitchen counters , sitting Indian style , unable to get up .
It was as if the earth 's gravity suddenly transcended its usual uniform boundaries and had intensified specifically around me .
I felt as though I weighed more than the world , yet was weightless as an astronaut at the same time .
Mr. Rabbit was by now almost in tears , begging us to be on our way .
My two buddies pulled me up off the floor with great effort ( I utterly did not want to move ) -- and I was fine .
Just like that .
It was as if the last few moments had never been .
Still most certainly looking through the doors of perception , we trudged out the front door , leaving Mr. Rabbit to his own devices , and headed for the woods .
Things got stranger still .
We made our way through a small park , abandoned by all but the melting snow .
A trail led into the trees , alongside a series of streams .
After a bit , we stopped to roll some joints .
I gazed up at the sky , and a cloud formation overhead looked like a whale 's ribcage .
A moment later , another one looked like an endless succession of Jimmy Pages playing guitar ( psychosuggestion , anyone ? ) , fanned out like a hand of playing cards .
We lit up and passed the first joint around .
There was some small talk , laughter , and general fuckery .
After three joints , which seemed , in conjunction with the cool air , to have a calming effect , we kept walking .
At one point we stopped to sit on one of the banks where the tree cover had kept the streams frozen over .
A father and daughter chanced by , cross-country skiing .
A shade loudly , I pointed and said : ' Look !
Do n't they look just like little German wind - up dolls ? '
My buddies decided it was time to move on after that .
I tended to agree , although I was laughing uncontrollably at the time .
Deeper into the woods , my impression was that we 'd walked straight into a fairy tale : Tolkien 's Middle Earth , or perhaps Oz .
The trees looked too perfect to be real , too unnaturally symmetrical .
One of my friends reported seeing a giant violin .
For my part , I saw a giant owl , who winked at me .
I also saw a gnome hiding behind a gnarled cedar .
One thing I did not see was Rod Serling -- though that would not have surprised me in the least .
I do n't remember how I got home .
But when I did , my own mom had a number of chores waiting for me which I did without the slightest complaining ( though I tried my best to disguise my good cheer ; it would 've been a dead giveaway that all was not right in Denmark ) .
I seemed to have boundless energy , even though I had come down quite a bit by then .
I felt almost immortal .
How I slept that night I do n't know .
At some point all the day 's events must 've caught up with me and I was sideswiped by the Sandman .
But upon waking I was met with the same sensation I 'd experienced on all my previous trips :
You are totally , 100 % straight , you are not at all high .
Yet , you feel as if you are still tripping with utter , total clarity of mind .
For someone who has never tripped , that may be incomprehensible , but I must insist on its accuracy .
There are many things regarding the psychedelic experience , kiddies , which can not be explained in words .
They must be experienced ( Are you experienced ? ) .
I 'm not saying you should try acid or mesc or DMT or any hallucinogen if you 've never done so .
I 'm also sure as hell no poster boy for the Nazi Drug Warriors who have never been within 10 miles of a fucking Excedrin tablet , yet feel somehow indefatigably qualified to talk about the subject in a negative light -- and throw people into prison for long years who do n't happen to agree with their over - zealous bias .
All I can do is relate my experiences to you , and present you with my unvarnished conclusions .
Acid is what it is .
Mesc is what it is .
So are psylocibin mushrooms . . . but that 's for another essay .
Bottom line ( if there is one ) :
If you go chasing rabbits , remember what you read here .
In other words , go ask Alex . . . when he 's ten feet tall .
A story receiving less press than the Texas teacher scandal is another in New York of an art Teacher who is currently suspended and may be fired after recommending to some of his advanced students that they take life drawing classes .
The image above is from one of the students involved .
PETE PANSE is a talented and popular high school art teacher in Middletown , NY who uses traditional techniques to to train his students .
In December 2005 Mr. Panse was suspended from his job for recommending that some of his advanced students consider taking figure drawing courses that included nude figure drawings .
Mr. Panse is suspended from his job pending hearings after which he may be permanently fired , ending a 25 - year teaching career .
In the meantime , his students are sitting in study hall learning nothing and failing to prepare the materials necessary for their receiving scholarships .
ARC ARTicles – The Case of Pete Panse – Brian Yoder – Page 1/1 :
Has the entire world gone mad ?
I did life drawing from my early teens and modeled for life drawing in my mid teens .
I do n’t see it as a big deal personally .
the most difficulty I had with it was my first male model when I was a little uncertain as to wether to draw the bits in or not .
I think they were very worthwhile experiences .
I certainly never had issue with the nudity and neither did my parents .
I think the problem a lot of people are having with this is not understanding the visual relationship between an artist and their model .
This is not a sexual thing !
no matter what relationship the artist and model may have outside the studio there is a magic that happens when the model adopts the pose that turns them into a breathing still life .
They become the sum of their angles , curves and shadows .
There is a lot of controversy being thrown up from these debates I think it is sad that teachers are being blamed for daring to encourage children ’s creativity .
maybe is it the fault of artists throughout history for being fascinated by the human body – how dare they ?

If my calculations are correct , this could prove to become ever the popular chant among those in the Islamic militant community .
AKARTA ( JP ) : Panel of judges in Central Jakarta District Court Wednesday sentenced Muslim militants between 14 and 20 years in prison for beheading Christian schoolgirls in Central Sulawesi 's town of Poso in 2005 .
Hasanuddin was found guilty for masterminding the beheading , buying the machetes and leaving a handwritten note at the scene vowing more killings to avenge the deaths of Muslims in an earlier conflict on Sulawesi island .
Judge Udar Siregar was quoted by Elshinta news radio as saying that Hasanuddin 's action can be categorized as terror crime , which could spark fresh religious violence in the Central Sulawesi towns .
Meanwhile , two other conspirators Lilik Purnomo and Irwanto Irano were handed 14 - year jail terms in a separated hearing .
Religious conflict in Poso had left at least 1,000 people dead from both Muslims and Christians from 1998 to 2002 .
This story is in our news feed , but I found it so absolutely insane that I had to post it directly to the main page .
The Jakarta Post reports that Islamic militants who were caught following the beheading of three Christian schoolgirls in 2005 have been sentenced to death ... just kidding !
They 're getting 14 to 20 years in prison .
You 've got to love Indonesia .
Islamic militants who behead schoolgirls , paving the way for even more inter-religious carnage , get maybe 20 years in prison .
Meanwhile , you may remember that an Australian women got the same sentence for trafficking drugs , though we can hardly know if they were planted on her person .
Six other Aussia men are getting the death penalty on similar charges , in which the debate over their sentences is not even whether or not they will receive capital punishment ( for they have been assured of that ) , but whether or not foreigners even are allowed to receive constitutional protection at all !
It makes you wonder .
Is there a bias here ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Vice President Dick Cheney accused U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday of “ bad behavior ” on her Middle East trip , saying she bungled a message for Syria ’s president that was later clarified by Israel .
U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney at the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington April 3 , 2007 .
Cheney accused U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday of " bad behavior " on her Middle East trip , saying she bungled a message for Syria 's president that was later clarified by Israel .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
Cheney harshly criticized Pelosi ’s visit to Syria this week and declared in an interview , “ The president is the one who conducts foreign policy , not the speaker of the House . ”
Pelosi ’s Syrian stopover was opposed from the start by the Bush administration , which accuses Damascus of sponsoring terrorism and says it should be isolated from the international community .
While in Damascus on Wednesday , Pelosi announced she had told Syrian President Bashar al - Assad that Israel was prepared to negotiate with Syria .
That prompted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s office to underline the Jewish state ’s preconditions for such talks -- including that Syria abandon its “ support for terrorist groups . ”
Cheney , pointing to the Israeli reaction , said it was obvious Olmert had not authorized the message Pelosi delivered .
“ It was a non-statement , nonsensical statement and did n’t make any sense at all that she would suggest that those talks could go forward as long as the Syrians conducted themselves as a prime state sponsor of terror , ” the vice president said on the Rush Limbaugh radio show .
“ I think it is , in fact bad behavior on her part .
I wish she had n’t done it , ” Cheney said .
“ Fortunately I think the various parties involved recognize she does n’t speak for the Untied States in those circumstances , she does n’t represent the administration . ”
Pelosi , the top House Democrat and next in line to the U.S. presidency after Cheney , is the most senior U.S. official to visit Syria in more than two years .
Pelosi ’s spokesman , Brendan Daly , asked to respond to Cheney ’s criticism , said the speaker accurately relayed the message from Olmert to Assad .
“ The tough and serious message the speaker relayed was that , in order for Israel to engage in talks with Syria , the Syrian government must eliminate its links with extremist elements , including Hamas and Hezbollah , ” Daly said , referring to the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas , and Lebanon ’s Hezbollah , which Israel fought in a war last year .
Pelosi ’s decision to defy the White House and meet Assad stepped up a tug of war between the Democratic - led Congress and Republican President George W. Bush over foreign policy .
The two sides are already doing battle over Iraq policy , with Democrats trying to force Bush to accept a date for withdrawing U.S. troops .
Pelosi was also slammed on Thursday by a Washington Post editorial that was headlined “ Pratfall in Damascus ” and called her Middle East shuttle diplomacy “ foolish . ”
Today 's statistical fallacy ( slightly redacted by editor ) comes from Joel on Software :
Everyone thinks they 're hiring the top 1 % .
Martin Fowler said , " We are still working hard to hire only the very top fraction of software developers ( the target is around the top 0.5 to 1 % ) . "
I hear this from almost every software company .
" We hire the top 1 % or less , " they all say .
Could they all be hiring the top 1 % ?
Where are all the other 99 % ?
General Motors ?
When you get 200 resumes , and hire the best person , does that mean you 're hiring the top 0.5 % ?
Think about what happens to the other 199 that you did n't hire .
They go look for another job .
The entire world could consist of 1,000,000 programmers , of whom the worst 199 keep applying for every job and never getting them , but the best 999,801 always get jobs as soon as they apply for one .
So every time a job is listed the 199 losers apply , as usual , and one guy from the pool of 999,801 applies , and he gets the job , of course , because he 's the best , and now , in this contrived example , every employer thinks they 're getting the top 0.5 % when they 're actually getting the top 99.9801 % .
I 'm exaggerating a lot , but the point is , when you select 1 out of 200 applicants , the other 199 do n't give up and go into plumbing ( although I wish they would ... plumbers are impossible to find ) .
They apply again somewhere else , and contribute to some other employer 's self - delusions about how selective they are .
This might explain some other phenomena I 've heard of , such as the " slush heap " of inconceivably awful stories received in the mail by every fiction publisher that accepts unsolicited manuscripts .
When a story is good enough to be published , it 's accepted and removed from the system .
Otherwise the hapless author sends it to another publisher !
Perhaps most novice writers are n't quite as dreadful ( on average ) as editors seem to believe ?
Editors will disproportionately encounter the work of novice writers who are not only awkward , but so incompetent as to be unaware of their own incompetence , and so proud that they can't take a hint .
PS : Two other areas where this might apply : Students who apply to your program / department for admission .
And , grant proposals .
PPS : Robert Scarth comments , " This might also explain why some women often think that ' all men are bastards ' - there are a few cads out there in continual circulation and with no intention to settle down , whereas men with honourable intentions have much fewer relationships , and settle down more quickly .

' Grammar Girl ' a quick and dirty success Story Highlights • Mignon Fogarty created the " Grammar Girl " podcast in July
• It has been as high as number 2 on iTunes
• The podcasts have had more than 1.3 million downloads Adjust font size : ( CNN ) -- Grammar lessons often are associated with high school drudgery -- diagramming sentences and memorizing obscure rules in between passing notes in English class -- but an Arizona technical writer has turned the seemingly dry subject into a popular podcast .
Mignon Fogarty , the woman behind " Grammar Girl 's Quick & Dirty Tips for Better Writing , " has been explaining the finer points of commas , colons and split infinitives since July .
She recently weighed in on a dispute over apostrophes that divided the U.S. Supreme Court .
Grammar was n't the issue in the 5 - 4 decision , but Justice Clarence Thomas referred to " Kansas ' statute " in the majority opinion , while Justice David Souter wrote about " Kansas 's statute " in the minority .
Fogarty said both men were correct , but that she preferred leaving off the extra s. " Justice Thomas ' name ends with an s , so you might guess that he is more familiar with the issue , " she told her audience .
Fogarty , 39 , said she got the idea for the podcast , sort of an Internet radio show , during a California vacation .
( Interactive : What is podcasting ? )
" I was sitting in a coffee shop one day in Santa Cruz , California , on vacation and editing technical documents , because I work on vacation , and found so many grammar errors and it just hit me that grammar was something that I had expertise in that would lend itself to a short tip - based podcast , " she said .
The show is currently the 47th most popular podcast on Apple 's iTunes service , right behind " Merriam - Webster 's Word of the Day . "
It has been as high as number two , Fogarty said .
She said the shows have been downloaded more than 1.3 million times .
Fogarty said she 's gotten some publicity , but that most of her audience comes from word of mouth .
" I get e-mails from people who say ' I just discovered your podcast and I 've told everyone I work with ' or ' I told every teacher at my school , ' " she said .
" I get a lot of e-mails like that , where people discover it and they just can't wait to tell everybody , which is really cool . "
Sara Kearns , a librarian at Kansas State University , has been listening to Grammar Girl since October , and recommended it on the library 's blog .
" I listen to Grammar Girl in chunks .
A couple of weeks may go by and then I 'll listen to 10 of them at a time , " Kearns said in an e-mail interview .
" The genius of Grammar Girl , apart from her ability to simplify grammar , is that she posts the transcripts so that I can stare at a gnarly piece of grammar until it clicks . "
Fogarty said her audience ranges from schoolchildren in China to CEOs in the United States .
" I try to make it fun .
I 've even had people say ' I 'm not that interested in grammar , I do n't know why I listen . '
But I 'm glad that they do , " Fogarty said .
" I think people like that it 's short .
It 's sort of a low - commitment podcast .
And yet they learn something that 's useful that they can put to use when they write their next e-mail . "
The success of the show prompted Fogarty to produce two more podcasts " Mr. Manners ' Quick and Dirty Tips for a More Polite Life " and " Money Girl 's Quick and Dirty Tips for a Richer Life . "
She said she 's started selling ads and is even getting some interest from book publishers .
One drawback of her work , she said , is that listeners are nervous about writing her .
" I feel bad about that , I do n't want people to be afraid to write to me , but about half of my e-mails start with some sort of pre-apology for errors they expect to make , " she said .
She said they should n't worry , and that she does n't send back e-mails with big , red correction marks .

TIPS FROM GRAMMAR GIRL 1 ) Affect vs. Effect : " Affect " is a verb , and " effect " is a noun .
The mnemonics " r aven " or " aven ue " can help you remember : a ffect v erb e ffect n oun .
2 ) Lay and Lie :
In the present tense , people lie down or lay something down .
You can remember that the Eric Clapton song " Lay Down Sally " is wrong .
To say " lay down Sally " would imply that someone should grab Sally and lay her down .
If he wanted Sally to rest in his arms on her own , the correct line would be " lie down Sally . "
Lay is the past tense of lie .
3 ) Who and whom : " Whom " refers to the object in a sentence , and " who " refers to a subject in a sentence .
It 's correct to say " Whom does Sarah love ? " ( " whom " is the object of Sarah 's love ) and " Who loves Sarah ? " ( " who " is the subject of the sentence ) .
It can help to remember that the song " Who do you love ? " is wrong .
1 ) " Affect " is a verb , and " effect " is a noun .
The mnemonics " r " or " ue " can help you remember:ffecterbffectoun .
2 )
In the present tense , people lie down or lay something down .
You can remember that the Eric Clapton song " Lay Down Sally " is wrong .
To say " lay down Sally " would imply that someone should grab Sally and lay her down .
If he wanted Sally to rest in his arms on her own , the correct line would be " lie down Sally . "
Lay is the past tense of lie .
3 ) " Whom " refers to the object in a sentence , and " who " refers to a subject in a sentence .
It 's correct to say " Whom does Sarah love ? " ( " whom " is the object of Sarah 's love ) and " Who loves Sarah ? " ( " who " is the subject of the sentence ) .
It can help to remember that the song " Who do you love ? " is wrong .
4 ) Can I split infinitives ?
Yes , it is now acceptable to split infinitives .
A " full infinitive " is a verb form that has two words , such as " to go , " and splitting an infinitive means placing another word between those two words .
The most famous split infinitive is " to boldly go where no one has gone before . "

' Paris Hilton Autopsy ' Educates New York City Teens , Offers Capla Kesting Fine Art Interactive Drunk Driving PSA Promotes Safe Prom
NEW YORK , April 26 / PRNewswire / -- Paris Hilton 's naked " corpse " could provide an invaluable service to students preparing for prom this season .
An interactive Public Service Announcement featuring the graphic display of a tiara - wearing , autopsied Paris Hilton with removable innards is designed to warn teenagers of the hazards of underage drinking .
The display also features Tinkerbell , Hilton 's forlorn pet Chihuahua with matching tiara , and debuts in the trendy Williamsburg , Brooklyn neighborhood where prom - goers frequently dine , courtesy of Capla Kesting Fine Art .
" Campaign to Rescue Women of Youth " featuring " The Paris Hilton Autopsy " offers a cadaveric nude Paris Hilton , laid out with twisted body and opened abdominal cavity on a coroner 's table , while her cell phone remains in her grip .
The ' unglamorous ' display which includes support material from anti-drunk driving organizations counters " the disturbingly glamorized trend of Hollywood 's ' girls gone wild ' , " according to gallery director , David Kesting .
Paris Hilton , arrested for a DUI last year , previously released a marginally effective PSA concerning drunk driving .
This latest PSA includes a website by Capla Kesting , which offers high school educators an icebreaker for discussing drunk driving 's consequences .
Students are encouraged to take the virtual field trip at http://www.ParisHiltonAutopsy.com to view the making of the " Paris Hilton Autopsy " and compete for prizes by writing Paris Hilton 's obituary .
The tableau , created by Daniel Edwards , reminds potential prom queens no one is impervious to the pitfalls of drinking .
Recalling Miss USA 's recent battle to keep her crown through alcohol rehab and Princess Diana 's untimely death due to drunk driving , a skewed hotel heiress 's tiara adorns the lifeless Paris Hilton head .
The PSA also observes the teen pregnancy crisis associated with alcohol impaired judgment .
The " Hilton Autopsy " tragically reveals drunk driving 's heartbreaking collateral damage .
Kesting , advocating teenagers to experience the Hilton display " hands - on , " said , " Paris ' internals , which include her small intestines , and other elements , are removable to assist teens with an empathetic view of drunk driving tragedy from the coroner 's perspective . "
UK's Daily Star recently reported Paris Hilton , whose last chilling portrayal came from 2005 's " House of Wax " in a well publicized death scene , had commissioned Daniel Edwards for a sculpture of her to be placed on Los Angeles ' Sunset Strip .
Reception for the PRESS , May 9th at 11:00 am .

#####
An aside : I went to the gallery opening with a friend who is a Daniel Edwards fan .
Remember his life - sized sculpture of a naked and very pregnant Britney Spears on all fours in the process of giving birth to her first - born .
I read the press release by the Capla Kesting Fine Art gallery in Brooklyn , which displayed the sculpture as describing the sculpture as showing Spears tugging on the ears of a bearskin rug " with water - retentive hands " .
The Capla Kesting Fine
Art gallery 's release went on to describe the sculpture " as a purportedly an idealised depiction of Britney in delivery .
Natural aspects of Spears 's pregnancy , like lactiferous breasts and protruding naval , complement a posterior view that depicts widened hips for birthing and reveals the crowning of baby Sean 's head " .
My friend said that it " celebrated the recent birth of Spears 's baby boy , Sean , and applauds her decision of placing family before career " .
I thought it was deliberately provocative to garner press .
I felt the same way about the Paris Hilton dead ?
sculpture not matter what the artist or the gallery articulate .
I do n't know whether the DUI awareness aspect is going to make any person pause in their drinking , although that would be nice .
As Edwards said in an interview , " His provocative use of empty celebrity , plus the shock factor , “ rings a bell , it brings it home .
Where as the gallery director David Kesting said the sculpture counters a disturbingly glamorized trend of Hollywood girls gone wild .
The work , no doubt , is also aimed at making money .
I suppose if even one person is saved , that ’s awesome . "
The opening was as I expected , a group of chic people drinking wine and exclaiming how provocative the work was .
Buyers were asked to call Capla Kesting for a price , which was not disclosed .
I was in the midst of putting on my glasses to read some fine print in the catalogue when an angry man flung out his arm as he vehemently disagreed with some comment his companion had made .
He knocked my glasses out of my hand and they went flying , only to land with a clatter as someone else stepped upon them .
The crunch was very audible .
My friend scooped up the crushed glasses and patted my arm .
Do n't worry , my dear , I know just the online site where you can get another pair .
She went on to explain the this e commerce site called Eyeglasses.com , not only has a plethora of womens eyeglasses brands , but they can also install prescription lens .
Apparently she gets all her replacement lenses done there .
I was skeptical , but agreed I would take a look at the site the next day .
Now that I could n't read a thing , I decided I would just observe the " opening scene " , drink the wine which seemed a bit out of place if the whole concept behind the artwork was to focus on the consequences of drinking and driving , and enjoy myself .
I would deal with the broken glasses later .

Here lies Paris Hilton
So hungry for fame
She showed everyone what can happen
when they think being drunk is a game
Restored to her beauty
By Daniel Edwards , himself
No one shall dare look
At what he put on the shelf
Her body all mangled
And torn into shreds
It was Edwards who gave her
Some dignity back
Let this be a reminder
For all children and teens
If you think drinking
And driving will help you gain fame
Remember Paris ’s last pose here
“ Oh what a shame ”

Here lies A DUI
A Fake , Wretched , Drinker
A person brought to fame by The lack of talent
To her head
To the ignition
She died at a young age
So much potential
Yet its all lost to One drink
And a few songs
The Harlot is gone
Never to be thought
Ever again .
Oh , Dear paris !
If only your could have opened your eyes !
Just like paris in Romeo and Juliet .
You Die by a sword - - of alcohol
To never see the light of day again .
You could learn from this !
you could learn ...
That you still have a breath
If only you would take the alcohol and leave it behind .
Why do people look up to you ?
Just because your rich ?
You will be a downfall of many Youth .
The blood is on your hands
The youth of a Nation --
Gone by the Fall of their " Idols " DUI .

Ode to Paris :
At the party , there where smiles and hollers ,
3 cocktails cost about 40 dollars .

her wrecked Mercedes SL65 , cost 200 K .
Too bad she thought she had to impress ,
Cost of a social wakeup call ?
Priceless .

Paris Hilton - 26 years old died suddenly in a car crash that involved driving while intoxicated .
The young beautiful heiress to the worldwide to the hotel chain was killed instantly when her luxury car skidded off the road and hit a tree head on .
Her famous pet “ Tinker bell ” was also killed instantly .
Such a beautiful woman , known for her wild lifestyle , was taken unnecessarily from those who loved her , adored her and looked to her as a role model .
Drinking and driving does not discriminate against the rich and famous or the ordinary person .
In the end , they all die needlessly to a bad choice and that ’s not “ hot ” .
We will miss you Paris !

Well Paris , now you 're dead ,
You should have phoned a cab instead .
In the Simple Life , you were a tool ,
But when you drove sloshed , you were a fool .
Now that you 're dead , that cab sounds so nice ,
Because six feet under , you 're as cold as ice .
Your disposable pets , you so easily forgot ,
Have now been replaced with maggots & rot .
Your blonde hair and glam that we used to admire ,
Are singed in flame , by a car engine fire .
What 's that you say ?
" Loves it " , " That 's Hot " ?
DUI , you now know , is not .
And for all of you who still drink and drive ,
Paris awaits you - and she 's not alive .

Paris Whitney Hilton was born on February 17 , 1981 .
She was raised in the wealthy hotel owning , Hilton family .
Her life recently ended due to a drunk driving crash .
It was not an accident -- she had a choice whether to drive drunk or have someone else drive her ; she made the wrong choice .
Accidents are things such as fenderbenders , but drunk driving is no accident .
Paris was known as a party girl .
She did not do anything note worthy , but she was famous for her frequent " crotch shots " and partying lifestyle .
She lived life in the fastlane and made decisions that affected her future .
Paris will be deeply missed by her best friend Nicole Richie , dog Tinkerbell , and parents Kathy and Rick .

Paris Hilton , 26 years old , died in a drinking and driving accident last night .
Hilton was driving on a suspended license ( shocker ! ) for a prior DUI in January , 2007 .
Hilton was the most famous woman known for doing nothing .
Hilton achieved a monumentous goal of earning her G.E.D. at the age of nineteen .
She starred along with Nicole Richie in a reality show , " The Simple Life " where she stated the very well known quote , " What 's at a Walmart ?
Do you buy stuff to put on your walls there ? "
Hilton was involved in many teen queen arguments .
She also co-authored a book about her life that hit the top 100 books , which resulted in another quote displaying her intelligence ; " What is the Wall Street Journal ? "
Although Paris did many stupid things in her life , she taught us all one good lesson ... all that shimmers will one day fade away !

Paris Hilton , heiress of Hilton Hotel , tragically died May 11th when her Bently crashed into a tree .
She was 26 and on her way home from a star - studded Hollywood party .
The autopsy showed she was highly intoxicated at the time .
Eventhough she was only 26 , Paris Hilton lived an interesting life .
She starred in a reality show " The Simple Life " with close friend , Nicole Richie .
Nicole had this to say , " Paris like has always been like a great friend , even like a sister to me .
I just like can't believe she is gone . "
Paris even released an album , " Paris " in 2006 and her own novel , Confessions of an Heiress .
Paris 's scandalous tactics always kept her in the tabloids where she felt most comfortable .
Paris will be remembered for an actress , singer , model , and just a famous so and so .

Paris Hilton , 26 died last night in a some - what tragic car accident .
The heiress got into her Bently late last night after partying her rich self into a completely intoxicated state .
Sources say , she was fixing her tiara
and did n't see the tree she was approaching as she made a turn .
Apparently , just before the accident , she tossed the beloved Tinkerbell out of the window .
That was the only thing she has ever done that actually made a difference .
Her life was anything but " simple " from the fights with people who actually did things with their lives to making " movies " and stealing songs .
Daddy 's money saved her from a lot of things , but daddy can't help her now .
By Theresa Fieo
Paris " heiress " Hilton , Age 26
Paris was important to our world .
Her so - called " simple life " was not so simple , after all .
She busted her pampered butt to provide us with consistent entertainment .
She published a book which hit the Wall Street Journals top list .
Hiring an author brought its rewards !
She gave her try at singing and loved seeing the reactions to her songs , whether they were bad or good .
Paris also enjoyed acting .
On the set , she always looked her best for the " viewers sake . "
Paris died in a tragic car crash .
She was coming home from a fashion show when her car crashed into a tree Police believed her manicured nails were too long and she could n't grasp the steering wheel .
Som say pain is beauty , but for Paris , beauty was fatal .
Paris will be remembered for being spoiled and pampered .
The entertainment world will never be the same ... it is back to reality .
By Ryan Magness
Paris Hilton , age 26 , died in a tragic car accident .
she ahd been drinking heavily that night ( and , every night prior ) .
she was the only person killed in the crash .
she had brought her dog into the clubs that evening , but fortunately forgot Tinkerbell at a party .
Her beloved dog is safe and sound .
It is debated if the dog purposely stayed out of the car that night , being the smarter of the two .
Hilton may have passed , but our memories and nightmares of her attempt at acting , modeling , singing , and being smarter than a three - year - old lives on in the tabloids .
