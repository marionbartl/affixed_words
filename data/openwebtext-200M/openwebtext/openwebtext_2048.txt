( Almost ) daily reviews of architecture books ; dDAB for short
Your blog postings are right on target , and you 've lead everyone up to the finale , but you just did n't finish .
Put the pieces together now , and you 'll see how this who CC thing can be used as a form of entrapment .
We are in a serious pickle , and we can't find any legal way out of it that does n't cost an arm and a leg ... other than paying the guy off .
Creative Commons licenses are non-revocable .
This means that you cannot stop someone , who has obtained your work under a Creative Commons license , from using the work according to that license .
Register images with the copyright office Assign CC licenses to them and post to Flickr Wait a sufficient amount of time for people to pick them up ( optional tactic : promote them like crazy under an alias )
Revoke the CC license
As the fish start jumping into the barrel , go get gun .... er , lawyer .
Start with companies that did n't use the attribution : bang Whoever 's left over , make them show when and how they got the image and that it was under CC - licensing at the time .
If they can't prove it , bang .
Well , the emails keep piling up regarding my last two postings about the Creative Commons here and here , as do the links people forward me to stories and whatnot .
Though you may be thinking , " enough already ! " , I only wish I 'd started with this one .
I begin with an eye - opening email I got from an in - house attorney for a large company that is currently in settlement talks with a photographer who is suing them for copyright infringement .
He did n't give me explicit details , and requested I keep his name withheld , but the shocker is just how bad the CC has become .
First , an excerpt from the lawyer 's email : To explain how this company got into its mess , let 's start with this common question :
What do you do when someone uses your CC - licensed image , but fails to give attribution ( or other CC provisions that you assigned to the photo ) ?
If you 're like most people , you complain - - bitterly -- and probably post a few things on forums and send email to your friends .
( And me . )
But , if you know something about copyright law , and you set things up just right beforehand , you can do more .
Amore .
And the reason you may not have thought of some of these things is due to a few common ( gross ) misunderstanding about what copyright is , and what the Creative Commons is , and where the cracks are in the system .
So , let 's start there : Some people think that CCcopyright .
It does n't .
Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States ( title 17 , U.S. Code ) to the " authors of original works of authorship . "
Creative Commons is a , which stipulates terms of use for your copyrighted work .
Or , as the FAQ from the creativecommons.org website says , " Creative Commons licenses give you the ability to dictate how others may exercise your copyright rights .
" Copyright and CC work together .
You can't assign a CC to a work that is n't yours ; it would be considered invalid ( and an act of fraud ) .
My previous posts on the subject focusedon this aspect , which was short - sighted on my part , not because it was n't true , but because it missed the much larger risk that licensees bear .
I suggested that CC puts licensees at risk because of thissequence of events by innocent bystanders who had no idea what was going on .
But something even more unscrupulous and sinister has already been thought of , at least by one person : entrapping a company into infringement by luring them in with the CC - licensing .
To explain how this would be done , I 'll ask my earlier question again : " Someone uses your CC - licensed photo without giving attribution .
What do you do ? "
But now , let me ask , " Whatyou do ?
" Well , you could sue them , but then you 'd have to have grounds for the suit ... so let 's look at that .
This part 's pretty easy :
If someone uses a photo inmanner inconsistent with the terms of its license ( including a CC license ) , they are subject to copyright infringement .
And the statutory damages for photos registered with the Copyright Office range from $ 750 to $ 30,000 ( including attorney costs ) .
What 's more , if you placed a visible watermark on your photos , such as your name or , better yet , your website ( if you have one ) , this gives you extra protection against copyright violation in this way :
If the illegal use was shown to have been , such as the removal of visible copyright text , then additional damages go up to $ 150,000 .
The fact that your photo was available for free is irrelevant .
Sounds good , right ?
Well , there 's a hook : itapplies to photos that have been registered with the copyright office .
If youregister your works with the copyright office , which is almost guaranteed to be the case for consumers who put their photos on Flickr at the blink of an eye , infringement claims are not statutory ; they are limited to how much yourwould have been for the alleged misuse .
And that licensee fee for CC - licensed images is ( That huge boom sound you just heard is that of thousands of palms slapping against the forehands of many Flickr users who thought they were sitting on gold mines . )
So , all you Flickr users that had your CC - licensed images used without attribution are stuck with no recourse whatsoever .
None .
You can't sue someone for zero dollars , unless you 're rich and stupid .
Not even the EFF will help you .
( Nor would the Creative Commons for that matter . )
By extension , publishers who use CC images have neither risk nor incentive to comply with the terms of the CC .
Essentially , CC has virtually no enforceability whatsoever ( in the photo realm , at least ) .
It is an empty shell .
Or , is it empty ?
Might it actually be that it has lots of teeth , but they can only be used by the bad guys ?
Excuse me ?
Remember that " hook " I mentioned , that your photos have to be registered with the copyright office to qualify for statutory damages ?
The thing is , people who choose CC - licensing do so for altruistic purposes and are unlikely to go through the time , effort and expense of registering photos with the copyright office .
But what about those - altruistic people ?
You know , those who wish to game the system and make big money ?
Yup , them .
( That bright light you see is the collective set of light bulbs that just lit up over many people 's heads . )
This technique is n't new -- I 've written about the incredibly lucrative business of suing for copyright infringement in this article and a follow - up in this article .
But it was n't till now that I was made aware that CC - licensing is the perfect bait to trap people .
I am aware of at least one microstock company that lures buyers by offering $ 1 photos , only to sue them later for infringement ... usually a minor one .
But using CC - licensing to meet the same ends is truly ingenious ( in an evil way , of course ) .
But wait , there 's one more piece to it that makes the entire scheme virtually guaranteed to work , even if the user of the image did nothing wrong .
And that is based on yet another aspect of the CC that is grossly misunderstood by .... well , everyone : the ability tothe CC - licensing on images .
The general ( erroneous ) belief is that once you assign a photo a CC - license , it is permanent -- that you cannot revoke the CC .
Well , that 's not precisely true .
To explain , let 's start with what 's on the FAQ on the Creative Commons website :
The source of the misunderstanding centers around what the CC is attached It's not the photo , butof the photo .
Or rather , the terms of use that were in place at the time they acquired the image .
The language says , " you cannot stop someone who has obtained your work under a CC license . "
It 's thethat you can't revoke the license from , not the photo .
As you may have seen later in the same FAQ , you can revoke the CC license and " redistribute " the photo , but most people skim over this and forget about it .
All but the unscrupulous photographer , that is .
He exploits it .
If he withdraws the CC license terms from the photo , then allusers of the image mayuse it under the terms of CC .
His exploitation of this little - known , misunderstood fact is the nail in the coffin for anyone who uses CC - licensed images at all , ever .
Why ?
The next critical piece to this that 's important to understand is that , in court cases involving copyright infringement , the burden of proof is on : they have to show where they got the image and provide evidence of it .
If a claim of infringement is made , the onus is entirely on the defense to establish innocence , not the photographer to prove guilt .
( After all , a photographer can't possibly know where someone got his image . )
And , as virtually all savvy photographers know , most people who get free images ( whether CC or not ) almost assuredly have no recollection where they got them , nor is there a paper trail for providing this .
It is only when a company pays for an image can they go back to accounting records and pull up receipts and provide proof .
So now , the company has the burden of proving that the image was available under the CC license at the time they got it .
How do they do this ?
Well , they could try looking at web archives ( such as www.archive.org/ ) , but archiving sites like this do n't ( can't ) archive sites like Flickr .
As you can see , it 'll be very , very tough to prove that the photo wasCC - licensed .
It should be noted here that Augustine Fou had created a site called FlickrCash.com , which did precisely this : the registrant received a formal registration for having obtained a CC - licensed image from Flickr at a particular time .
This would be precisely what the doctor ordered to protect against the scheme I 'm describing here .
However , because he charged $ 5 for the service , Flickr users got really upset , claimed that he was infringing on their copyrights ( he was n't ) , and succeeded in convincing Flickr to shut him down .
This ability to revoke is so powerful , and the requirement for the defense so onerous , that just about anyone can file an infringement claim against anyone using a CC - licensed image , simply by revoking the CC - license just before filing the claim .
The architecture of a plan to entrap is now compete :
The only fish that do n't get shot are those who honestly obtained the CC image , verified who owned it , complied with its terms , and kept records through all of this .
Gee , that 's a lot of work for a company that wanted to save a few bucks and use a photo for free instead of , say , $ 1 or even $ 10 .
So , what 's the net - net , as it were ?
The Creative Commons just does n't fit in the photo world .
It has no teeth for well - intentioned photographers that just wanted to make their photos available for free , but it has wonderfully sharp and dangerous teeth for those who want to abuse the system and entrap anyone into paying big settlements .
I think the discussion of whether CC is good or bad for photographers is simply a misguided distraction from the real issues .
I do believe that all of this bodes very well for professionals , because it supports the notion that people should get licenses from trusted sources ( where records of such transactions are made ) , even if those sources choose to provide them for free .

HAVANA , Cuba ( CNN ) --
Although the news that one of the longest - serving leaders in the world was officially stepping down sent ripples around the globe , Fidel Castro 's resignation announcement barely registered in Cuba .
Fidel Castro , shown in an undated file photo , took power in Cuba in 1959 and reigned with an iron hand .
Castro , 81 , revealed his plans in a letter published in the middle of the night in the online version of Cuba 's state - run newspaper , Granma .
" I will not aspire to , nor will I accept the position of president of the council of state and commander in chief , " Castro wrote .
" I wish only to fight as a soldier of ideas .
...
Perhaps my voice will be heard . "
President Bush said Castro 's decision ought to spark " a democratic transition " for Cuba .
" The international community should work with the Cuban people to begin to build institutions that are necessary for democracy and eventually this transition ought to lead to free and fair elections , " Bush said Tuesday in Rwanda .
" The United States will help the people of Cuba realize the blessings of liberty . "
Watch Bush 's reaction to Castro 's resignation »
But the streets of Cuba 's capital , Havana , reflected the normal comings and goings of residents .
No gatherings or rallies erupted at Castro 's news .
Despite the story later consuming the entire front page of the print version of Granma , complete with a banner headline , many Cubans said they had n't heard the news when asked by CNN .
Those who had were wary of offering their opinions .
" He 's leaving the position because his age and illness do n't let him work , " one man said .
" Let 's see what comes . "
" He 's aware of his place in history , and he 's going to keep on occupying that place in one way or another , " a retiree said .
Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte said the U.S. embargo on Cuba will not be lifted in the near term .
Cuba 's leaders plan to elect a president within days .
Castro 's brother Raúl , 76 , the country 's defense minister , has been named publicly as his successor .
" There 's a lot of difficulty in day - to - day living , " said CNN senior international correspondent Christiane Amanpour , who has visited Cuba several times .
" The question is : Will there be enough change ? " she said .
" If it is Raúl [ as president ] , will he show there 's a progress towards the kind of thing that the Cuban people want , which is openness , freedom , the ability to have enough wherewithal [ to find jobs ] , the same kind of bread - and - butter issues that everybody all around the world wants ? "
Oswaldo Paya , a Cuban dissident , said that no matter who the next leader of the country will be , the Cuban people " have more hope . "
" Not because we trust his successor more than we trusted Fidel Castro but because there 's a buzz among the people , and we want everything to go smoothly , peacefully , but the government cannot keep denying the people their space , " Paya said .
Castro received treatment for intestinal problems two years ago and cited his " critical health condition " in the letter published Tuesday .
He said " it would be a betrayal to my conscience to accept a responsibility requiring more mobility and dedication than I am physically able to offer . "
He also said he realized that he had a duty to prepare Cubans for his absence .
" My wishes have always been to discharge my duties to my last breath , " he said .
" That 's all I can offer . "
At age 32 , Castro led a band of guerrillas who overthrew a corrupt dictatorship in 1959 .
He went on to become a thorn in Washington 's side by embracing communism and cozying up to the Soviet Union .
Castro reigned in Havana with an iron hand , defying a U.S. economic embargo intended to dislodge him .
Watch what Castro 's resignation means for Cuba »
In Miami , Florida , the news came as no surprise to Janisset Rivero , the executive director of the Cuban Democratic Directorate , a group that works with dissidents in Cuba .
" I think there have been preparations taking place for quite a while to assure the crowning of Raúl Castro , " she said Tuesday morning .
" It does n't mean any change to the system .
It does n't mean there will be freedom for the Cubans .
One big dictator is replacing the other .
" It will be a big deal when political prisoners are released , when political parties are allowed to organize , when the country stops being ruled by a single party . "
Polarizing figure
To leftist revolutionaries around the world , Castro , with his ubiquitous military fatigues and fiery oratory , became a hero and patron .
But for hundreds of thousands of his countrymen who fled into exile , he became an object of intense hatred .
Castro clung to a socialist economic model and one - party Communist rule , even after the Soviet Union disintegrated and most of the rest of the world concluded that state socialism was a bankrupt idea whose time had come and gone .
" The most vulnerable part of his persona as a politician is precisely his continued defense of a totalitarian model that is the main cause of the hardships , the misery and the unhappiness of the Cuban people , " said Elizardo Sanchez , a human rights advocate and critic of the Castro regime .
And yet , his defenders in Cuba point to what they see as social progress made under Castro 's revolution , including racial integration and universal education and health care .
They blame the U.S. embargo for the country 's economic woes .
" What Fidel achieved in the social order of this country has not been achieved by any poor nation , and even by many rich countries , despite being submitted to enormous pressures , " said Jose Ramon Fernandez , a Cuban vice president .
Castro 's staying power was a source of irritation to Cuban exiles .
The center of the exile community is Miami , where the Cuban American National Foundation became a powerful lobbying group courted by U.S. politicians .
Road to revolution
Castro was born August 13 , 1926 , in Oriente Province in eastern Cuba .
His father , Angel , was a wealthy landowner originally from Spain ; his mother , Lina , had been a maid to Angel 's first wife .
Educated in Jesuit schools , Castro earned a law degree and offered free legal services to the poor .
In 1952 , at the age of 25 , he ran for the Cuban parliament .
But just before the election , the government was overthrown by Fulgencio Batista , whose dictatorship put Castro on the road to revolution .
In 1953 , Castro took part in an unsuccessful coup attempt that made him famous but sent him to prison .
He was released in 1955 and lived in exile in the United States and Mexico , where he organized a guerrilla group with Raúl Castro and Ernesto " Che " Guevara , an Argentine doctor - turned - revolutionary .
The next year , 81 fighters landed in Cuba .
Most were killed ; the Castros , Guevara and other survivors fled into the Sierra Maestra Mountains along the southeastern coast , where they waged a guerrilla campaign against the Batista government that finally brought it down in 1959 .
Although the United States quickly recognized the new Cuban government , tensions arose after Castro began nationalizing American - owned factories and plantations .
In January 1961 , Washington broke off diplomatic ties .
Less than four months later , a group of CIA - trained Cuban exiles , armed with U.S. weapons , landed at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba in a disastrous attempt to overthrow Castro .
Two weeks after the Bay of Pigs , Castro formally declared Cuba a socialist state .
In October 1962 , Cuba became the focus of a tense world crisis after the Soviet Union installed nuclear weapons in the country .
President Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove them and quarantined the island , bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war .
The Soviet Union backed down and removed the weapons .
Castro is believed to have fathered eight children with four women .
His longtime companion , Dalia Soto del Valle , is the mother of five of his sons .

All About Fidel Castro • Cuba
In late October the beloved BitTorrent bazaar formally known as Oink 's Pink Palace was shut down , accused of facilitating the illegal distribution of copyrighted music .
British police arrested the site 's creator , 24 - year - old Alan Ellis , later releasing him without charge , and in Amsterdam authorities confiscated the servers that hosted the site .
I can't say I grieved — I 'd only been a member briefly , acquiring a few albums of major - label hip - hop and out - of - print British glam rock , before I got booted for failing to maintain the ratio of uploads to downloads that the site required .
Oink 's forums felt snobby to me , and I was n't comfortable contributing to a network where people traded copies of current independent releases .
My experience with the site was n't necessarily the norm , though .
Because it was accessible by invitation only and its content was heavily curated by the dyed - in - the - wool music obsessives who made up the bulk of its membership , Oink acquired the aura of a secret society — and plenty of people found the feeling of being in on something irresistible .
Other members I knew would get a dreamy , faraway look in their eyes when they talked about Oink , and they were dilettantes like me — the site 's power users traded files by the gigabyte , and after the takedown , in blog posts and comments on tech and music sites around the Web , those guys described Oink in almost religious terms .
The consensus among hard - core Oink members seems to be that they 're entitled to skirt copyright law because they 're more than just typical listeners — they 're an elite group of tastemakers who publicize everything they listen to , whether in print , online , or by word of mouth , and as such they 're hardly ripping anybody off when they get hold of music for free .
Whether you buy that line or not , Oink was in fact something special .
With about 180,000 registered members , almost half of whom fell into the " power user " category , it was a thriving community , and it had grown up organically , entirely by word of mouth — there was no marketing campaign , no corporate backer , no profit motive at all .
No money ever changed hands on Oink unless someone felt like donating to the site .
Contrary to many mainstream media reports ,
Oink did n't actually provide any music for download — all it hosted were BitTorrent files , which members uploaded to let the rest of the network know they had a certain song or album available for sharing on their computer .
Users were responsible for every bit of Oink 's vast virtual music library : they hosted it , organized it , annotated it , vetted it for errors and malware , and policed the sound quality of the files ( the minimum bit rate was 192 kbps ) .
For harnessing the obsessive energy of tens of thousands of music nerds , site founder Alan Ellis was named to Blender magazine 's Powergeek 25 list in July .
If Oink had n't depended on the illicit swapping of copyrighted music , I 'm certain that record labels big and small would 've been scrambling to figure out how to buy access to its user base .
It 's a shame file sharing has been so stigmatized by industry hacks , because legitimate online music distributors have a lot to learn from pirates .
Oink 's main asset was its members ' strong sense of community , and that 's incredibly hard to manufacture .
Each
Oink user was held responsible for everyone he invited to join , and could even be kicked out if a recruit misbehaved — pretty much the opposite of the incentive - based model that for - profit online communities tend to use , but guaranteed to foster solidarity .
It 's this feeling of personal involvement that made the Oink community willing to work to maintain the site 's library .
Even members who did n't do any work were helping speed up the network 's traffic just by making their personal music collections available — a BitTorrent download pieces together the file from multiple sources , and the more sources there are for it to draw on , the faster it goes .
In terms of efficiency , it whips ass all over a centralized server .
Oink 's peak population of 180,000 was nothing compared to the millions of shoppers clicking through the iTunes store , but the site had personality to spare .
Sure , iTunes has a decent selection and tries really hard to be user friendly , but it still feels like an online Sam's Club .
I visit pretty regularly , but I 've never once browsed around just to see what 's there — and it 's impossible to see who 's there .
Oink , on the other hand , rewarded casual hangouts .
Instead of automated suggestions , it had thriving forums full of actual people who seemed physically incapable of restraining themselves from recommending records once they learned what you liked .
And whatever they mentioned , it was always available through Oink .
As long as you did n't care whether it was legal , it was yours .
Currently digital music retailers do n't seem to have figured out the value of giving their customers the opportunity to interact and form communities .
Amazon users can submit reviews to its MP3 store or rattle off their favorite songs with its " Listmania ! " function , but neither lets them talk to one another .
There 's no way for them to feel like their music expertise is making a difference — and it goes without saying that customers can't meaningfully influence the store 's inventory or how it 's organized .
No one on Oink would 've stood for finding Pink Floyd 's The Wall filed under " Dance & DJ , " but it 's the number two album in that category at Amazon .
Microsoft has recently started hiring experts to help round out the Zune Marketplace 's low - traffic departments , like folk music .
It would 've been more cost - effective for the company to take a hint from Oink — if it could connect a bunch of brilliant music freaks with an appreciative audience for their comprehensive knowledge of vintage Turkish psychedelia or obscure Japanese noise or insane Bollywood soundtracks , the Zune Marketplace might start looking more like Amoeba Music and less like Borders .
Such a strategy could even pull in some of the hard - core nonmainstream listeners Microsoft has been fruitlessly pursuing since the Zune 's launch .
The thousands of Oink fiends who kept the site up and running did n't exactly do it for free , of course ; they did it with the understanding that other members would provide them with all the music their broadband could handle .
A retail operation looking to take advantage of their expertise would have to offer a similar deal — unfettered access to its entire inventory , for instance , might serve just as well as a paycheck .
Winning over some of the listeners who'd otherwise be pirating their music would certainly be worth the outlay .
I 'm sure Oink 's successor is already up and running somewhere , pulling in file traders by the thousands .

Undaunted by recent turbulence in the financial markets , Visa Inc. , the nation ’s biggest credit card network , said Monday that it would forge ahead with what would be the largest initial public stock offering in United States history .
Visa plans to sell as much as $ 17.1 billion of stock in late March , following in the footsteps of its smaller rival , MasterCard , which went public in May 2006 .
Visa and MasterCard are prospering as Americans increasingly flex plastic , rather than use cash , to pay for just about everything .
The companies have not been hurt by the credit squeeze , because they do not actually make credit card loans ; they merely process transactions for banks that do .
If all goes as planned , Visa ’s offering would generate a windfall for thousands of its so - called member banks , which own the company .
The largest gains would go to many of the nation ’s biggest banks , which have been stung by losses stemming from mortgage - linked investments .
How does this sound : a battery capable of recharging to 90 % in under 5 minutes while remaining useful ( i.e. , 5,000 + recharges ) for 10 years or more ?
Sounds like the stuff of jetpacks and food replicators right ?
Nope ... March , 2008 .
It was a long , long time ago when we first brought you news of these so - called " Super Li-ion " batteries .
In March of 2005 to be exact .
Now they 're here , courtesy of Toshiba who just announced their Super Charge ion Batteries , or SCiBs .
The wee 2.4V version measures 62 x 95 x 13 - mm / 150 - grams while the big , bad 24V version measures in at 100 x 300 x 45 - mm and 2000 - grams .
Oh , and they wo n't short - circuit and explode .
The problem ?
The first production run is for industrial - use ( non -CE ) class devices like hybrid cars and the like .
Oh pretty please Toshiba , with sugar , wo n't you make a laptop version ?

Welcome back to day 2 of the S&R Year in Review .
Today we tackle some of 2007 ’s big moments in news and current events .
The Invasion and Occupation of Iraq Surpasses the American Civil War in Duration : The United States ’ involvement in World War I lasted only 19 months and World War II lasted 44 months for the United States , even though the war itself was nearly six years long .
The occupation of Iraq ( aka the Iraq War ) outlasted World War II in November of 2006 , making the duration of U.S. involvement in Iraq the third longest foreign occupation in U.S. history .
The American Civil War lasted 48 months , and the Iraq occupation surpassed that duration on March 20 , 2007 .
This makes the Iraq occupation the third longest running period of continuous conflict in U.S. history , behind only the Vietnam War and its sister conflict in post - Taliban Afghanistan .
The United States invaded Iraq on March 18 , 2003 .
By the end of 2007 , the United States will have been involved in Iraq for 4 years , 9 months , and 14 days .

Al Gore Takes the Heck Over :
The big deal here is n’t the movie , the Oscar , or even the Nobel .
No , the real reason
Al is one of the citizens of the year is because he , more than anyone , has pushed concern for the environment close to , and perhaps over , the tipping point from “ librul treehugger ” issue to common sense bipartisan issue .
You may have noticed recently that a lot more people seem to have accepted that Green is Good .
Gore does n’t deserve all the credit , of course , but he merits a lot .
The question now is whether he ’s done more good as non-President than he could have had he not lost the 2000 election 5 - 4 .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Releases its Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) : This year saw the release of the United Nations ’ Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) of the state of the global climate since the inception of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in 1988 .
Composed of the governments who make up the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) and the United Nations Environmental Programme ( UNEP ) and chartered “ to provide the decision - makers and others interested in climate change with an objective source of information about climate change , ” the IPCC has independently assessed the best available climate science for the fourth time and concluded that there is over a 90 % chance that human - created greenhouse gas emissions are driving up global mean temperature .
Starting in February , the IPCC released three massive reports , Working Group I ’s “ The Physical Science Basis ” , Working Group II ’s “ Impacts , Adaptation and Vulnerability ” , and Working Group III ’s “ Mitigation of Climate Change ” throughout the year .
Two weeks before the start of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali , the IPCC released the AR4 Synthesis Report , the final AR4 document that distills all the detailed scientific an socio-economic conclusions and analyses to create a single document that is supposed to guide the entire world ’s policy planning from now until the IPCC next addresses global heating .
The net result of the four reports was a softening of the U.S. position that global heating was n’t occurring , although the Bush Administration continues to pursue a policy of voluntary reductions in CO 2 emissions in opposition to the centralized government regulations favored by most of the rest of the U.N .
In addition , the IPCC reports triggered a sudden explosion of interest by mainstream and alternative media in the United States , the world ’s largest CO 2 producer .
As a result , the bulk of the U.S. Presidential candidates have detailed their positions on what the U.S. should do to combat global heating , many are on record supporting or co-sponsoring anti-global heating legislation of some form , and energy and global heating policies have been taken up by the U.S. federal government repeatedly , albeit without significant action .
And in lieu of federal action on global heating , multiple states have formulated their own approaches to mitigating the effects of global heating .
The scientists and policymakers involved in crafting the various IPCC reports had their work validated with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in December .

A Bridge Over In Troubled Waters :
Thank goodness America is committed to rebuilding infrastructure in Iraq .
Tragedy , sure , but your politicians are on it .
The First Nuclear Power Plant Construction Permit Since 1978 is Requested :
In the late 1970s , public outcry against nuclear power , plant safety concerns , and high construction costs combined to make new nuclear power plants cost ineffective when compared to other sources of electricity , especially coal and natural gas .
These concerns were proven in the public mind by the accident at Three Mile Island and then later reinforced by the Chernobyl accident .
As a result , there were no new requests to the U.S. Department of Energy for new nuclear power plants since 1978 until NRG Energy of Princeton , New Jersey requested one on September 25 , 2007 .
Significant changes in two factors in opposition to new nuclear plant construction since the late 1970s have enabled NRG Energy to take the risk of adding two new reactors at an existing Texas plant .
The first is a president friendly to nuclear power and a nuclear - friendly Republican Congress for President Bush ’s first term .
This resulted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which had significant government incentives designed to spur the development and construction of new nuclear power plants , mitigating much of the economic risk of constructing new nuclear reactors .
The second is a rising number of scientists and environmentalists who have concluded that nuclear power is the lesser of evils when it comes to environmental damage vs. carbon dioxide - intensive fossil fuels like natural gas and coal .
A third factor also plays a minor role in the timing of the new permit request – it ’s been nearly 30 years since the last request and the public has lost some of its fear ( for good or ill ) of nuclear power and its risks .

Tragedy at Virginia Tech : Horrible , unspeakable – there just are n’t words to describe it .
Worst of all , I remain convinced that the toll could have been less than it was .

The Minot to Barksdale Nuclear Express :
At the end of August , the security blunder of this young century occurred when six nuclear warheads were flown from one US Air Force base in Minot , North Dakota to another in Barksdale , Louisiana .
But Philip Coyle , a think tanker and former assistant secretary of defense , said , “ This was n’t just a mistake .
I ’ve counted , and at least 20 things had to have gone wrong for this to have occurred . ”
Since Barksdale is an embarkation point for Middle East military operations , speculation inevitably arose that the nukes were intended for use in Iran .
But a base commander lacks the authority to order the transport of nuclear weapons .
Was the order issued by an alternate Cheney chain of command ?
It ’s been stated that the US military would never release data this sensitive to the public without authority from the White House .
According to this line of thinking , the intent was n’t to bomb , but , instead , to put the fear of God -Allah in Iran .
The disturbing nature of the story has only been compounded by a related Cheney chain of events .
Immediately preceding and following the event , six personnel at the two bases died in apparent accidents or by suicide .
Especially unsettling was the unlikely death of a member of the Special Forces in the wild .
( Dave Lindorff has been all over this . )
Besides the ultimate destination of the nukes , one can’t help but wonder if the dead were whistleblowers .
Even though the US has become blanketed in secrecy , it ’s still not PC to compare Bush & Co. to Nazi Germany .
How about , with its all - pervasive Stasi , East Germany ?

Sioux Sue for Sovereignty : In December , a Lakota ( Sioux ) delegation delivered a statement of “ unilateral withdrawal ” to the State Department .
In other words , it plans to secede .
Not all Lakota , just the delegation , which was led by Russell Means .
He , of course , is famous for surviving the siege at Wounded Knee in 1973 and founding the American Indian Movement ( AIM ) , as well as for his movie roles .
One can imagine the federal government ’s response : “ Go ahead , enjoy your little secession .
Of course , we wo n’t be subsidizing your reservations anymore .
Plus you have no chance whatsoever to change your mind about the $ 122 million in compensation the Supreme Court awarded you a couple of decades ago and which you refused . ”
Means , however , also announced that his group planned to file liens on property in parts of South Dakota , Nebraska , North Dakota , Montana and Wyoming .
“ The Missouri River is ours , and so are the Black Hills , ” he said .
But while Means taketh away with one hand , he giveth with the other .
He invites one and all to live in the Lakota Nation , tax - free , as long as they renounce their U.S. citizenship .
Do n’t worry :
It will issue drivers ’ licenses and passports .
Once Americans get it through their heads that this is n’t a reprise of the Confederacy , many might find the idea of a nation free of taxes , as well as war , appealing .
After all , like Ron Paul , Means is a libertarian , under which guise , he too has run for president .
Still , the first person with whom I shared the Lakotas ’ plans for secession said , “ Oh great , it ’s bad enough we have to worry about the terrorists .
Now , this too . ”
Primal frontier fears resurface :
Will the redskins return to their renegade roots and take revenge — not to mention scalps ?
Not likely .
But Bolivia ’s president Evo Morales , as well as Venezuela are following events closely .
Those Americans bent out of shape about the “ NAFTA Superhighway ” from Mexico to Canada may as well start worrying now about One Indigenous Continent for All .

I occasionally get emails from people asking how to prepare for a career in software development .
Some are students wondering what classes they should take ; others have been bitten by the programming bug and are considering their next steps .
I always answer with the same advice .
There 's no substitute for learning on the battlefield .
It appears to me that software development is happening in industry , not in the universities .
Universities are great for problems that can be solved by sitting alone and thinking or experimenting for months on end .
Universities were great for giving us automata theory , complexity analysis , compilers and the like .
But universities are not at all well suited to understanding what is happening during software development .
Software development at the moment is much more like the early manufacture of samurai swords , shields , and battlefield tactics .
You make a pile of swords or war tactics , send them onto the battlefield , and see which ones worked better .
Then you make different swords and tactics , and so on .
You have to be on the battlefield .
I can't imagine learning the things I 've learned while sitting peacefully in my office reflecting .
Most of my original reflections and predictions were just wrong .
So any one of you who is interested in this topic probably has to work as a developer or consultant , so you can see the moment - to - moment action and get raw data .
Of course , software development only teaches you how to talk to your computer .
Higher education is still worthwhile because it teaches you how to talk to people .
With a good educational background , you 'll learn how to read effectively , how to write coherently , and how to think critically amongst your peers .
If I were founding a university I would found first a smoking room ; then when I had a little more money in hand I would found a dormitory ; then after that , or more probably with it , a decent reading room and a library .
After that , if I still had more money that I could n't use , I would hire a professor and get some textbooks .

For a fast - moving field like computer science , the work you 're doing is far more relevant than any classes you 're taking .
If you must choose between formal schooling and work experience , always choose work .
If you 're in school , aggressively pursue real - world experience that compliments your schoolwork .
Fortunately , this is a battle you can fight on multiple fronts :
If you 're a student , seek out internships like your life depends on it .
Some of the best programmers I 've ever met have been college interns .
Intern somewhere that you can absorb and learn as much as possible .
You wo n't make much money , but the experience will be priceless .
Participate in local user groups .
User groups are an unbeatable resource for people just starting out in their careers ; they 're an excellent source of advice and mentorship .
Contribute to an open - source project .
There are thousands , so pick whatever strikes your fancy .
But pick one and really dig in , become an active contributor .
Absolutely nothing is more practical than working collaboratively with software developers all over the globe , from all walks of life .
Publish articles .
The cleverest code in the world wo n't help you if you can't clearly communicate how that code works , or what it 's for .
Try your hand at writing .
CodeProject is an excellent sandbox to practice in .
Publish an article and the large , active CodeProject community will let you know how you 're doing with ratings and comments .
Start a blog .
Pick a writing schedule and stick with it ; I recommend once a week at minimum .
Select a general theme for your blog and write on topics related ( at least tangentially ) to that theme .
And do n't be an echo chamber .
You do n't have to do all these things , but if you 're serious about your career , pick at least two and follow through .
For more detailed advice , I highly recommend Rob 's advice on how to become a programmer .
In software development , you learn by doing .
As long as you 're out on the battlefield fighting the good fight , you 're bound to improve .
Subscribers of HBO's
On Demand services will soon be able to get video downloads of their favorite shows and movies online , free of charge .
That is , if they run Windows , live in Wisconsin , and use Time Warner Cable .
HBO announced today that the service would launch this week — initially in Wisconsin and eventually expanding out — to an increasingly crowded video download market .
With HBO on Broadband , the content provider hopes to keep the customers it might have previously lost to other services ( such as Netflix ) by offering them a wide selection of content with a decent level of flexibility .
But HBO could be getting ahead of itself by launching this now , because its parent company , Time Warner , has other plans for customers ' bandwidth .
First the nitty gritty : HBO on Broadband will offer over 600 of HBO 's shows and movies for unlimited download to HBO On Demand subscribers .
Users can download and watch videos as often as they like for no additional charge , a representative from parent company Time Warner wrote on DVD Dossier this morning .
Using a proprietary media player from HBO , users can also authorize up to five computers on a single account , but they must be using Windows Vista or XP SP2 in order to make use of the service .
( Predictably , the company says that a Mac version is in the works , " but no release date has yet been announced . " )
Content will constantly be rotated in and out so that there are new selections to watch , and users will even be able to watch a live stream of the east coast HBO feed at the same time it 's being broadcast on TV .
There will , however , be some level of DRM .
While users will be able to take files with them on a laptop , they can't be transferred to other portable devices ( like iPods and Zunes ) , and wo n't remain watchable forever .
" Individual titles will be available on the service for 4 - 12 weeks , with episodes of HBO original series generally available for longer periods than theatrical films , " reads the DVD Dossier post .
" When a title reaches its ' expiration date , ' it will automatically be deleted from your computer . "
Despite its limitations , HBO on Broadband does n't sound too shabby .
But it seems a little odd that HBO is introducing this service now .
Why ?
Time Warner is planning to start rolling out bandwidth caps on its broadband services this year .
This means that some of Time Warner 's own customers wo n't be able to make full use of HBO on Broadband — at least not without paying for a higher tier of service .
It seems that one of two things is happening here : either the right hand does n't know what the left hand is doing , or this is all part of Time Warner 's plan to milk more money out of subscribers .
For now , Time Warner only plans to test the bandwidth caps in Texas , while HBO plans to introduce HBO on Broadband in Wisconsin , so the services wo n't cross paths just yet .
But when they do , customers are n't likely to be happy to find out that their " free " online services from HBO are eating up their bandwidth quotas elsewhere .

Via The Baltimore Sun :
Earlier today , the Swamp noted that Mark McKinnon , a senior campaign adviser to both President Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona , had said some time ago that he could not serve McCain if Sen. Barack Obama became the Democratic presidential nominee .
And now this evening , the Republican consultant is reaffirming his stance that he will have to step out of his advisor 's role for the campaign if Obama wins the Democratic nomination .
He explained his aversion to campaigning against Obama in an interview aired by National Public Radio , where Michele Norris interviewed him for All Things Considered :
" I met Barack Obama , I read his book , I like him a great deal , '' McKinnon said .
" I disagree with him on very fundamental issues .
But I think , as I said , I think it would a great race for the country , and I would simply be uncomfortable being in a campaign that would be inevitably attacking Barack Obama .
I think it would be uncomfortable for me , and I think it would be bad for the McCain campaign . ''
Read on ...
Can you even fathom the notion that any senior adviser for either the Obama or Clinton campaigns would drop out to avoid confronting Senator McCain ?
It does n't bode well for him that one of his closest campaign advisers is a FAN of an opposing candidate , but if Obama does eventually get the nod and he follows through on his pledge , he has our thanks for doing his part to help put a Democrat in the White House ...
Let ’s work through a few hypothetical “ what if ” scenarios to illustrate some common engineering themes related to quality control and the inherent stresses between those who build , those who test , and those who sell .
Every engineer is deeply familiar with these patterns , but I believe even the general reader will understand the dynamics better by reading these scenarios .
Let us start by imagining that a new bridge is being built in your area .
The company that is building the bridge is very eager to have it open by a particular date .
In fact , their contract calls for monetary penalties for every day the opening is delayed beyond that date .
However , before it can be opened to traffic , it must be inspected to ensure that the welds conform to the applicable standard .
For sake of argument let ’s say the standard is the AASHTO / AWS D1.5M / D1.5:2002 Bridge Welding Code .
The inspectors may inspect all of the welds and find that they are all acceptable .
What do you you think of this , as someone who will soon ride over that bridge ?
Is this good news ?
Yes , if you trust the expertise and independence of the inspectors , and their testing process and equipment .
If the inspectors do their job properly , and they find no defects , then this indeed is cause for celebration .
But what if the inspectors found a handful of defects , perhaps some welds that failed fatigue testing ?
If indeed the defects are few , and are localized , then they can be fixed and retested and we can still open the bridge on time .
But it is critical that the changes are localized , that there are no far reaching changes .
A bridge is not just a collection of independent pieces of metal .
They all work together , and as a whole have static and dynamic mechanical properties and relate to load capacity , stresses , thermal characteristics , resonance , etc .
Although some fixes may be only localized in their impact , meaning only the area changed needs to be retested , other fixes may have a larger impact and require that everything be retested .
In any complex system , some defects are expected .
A sign of good of engineering process is that larger , structural defects are detected or prevented at the earliest possible moment , when they are easiest and least expensive to fix .
Where this is not accomplished , large design defects may be first detected at final inspection time , and costly and pervasive rework and retesting may be required , or in the extreme , the bridge may need to be torn down .
The engineering maxim is “ fail early ” .
Now this may seem like an odd thing to say .
Should n’t we always try to prevent failure or at least delay it as long as possible ?
Certainly , if you can prevent failure , then do so .
But it is rarely the case where all defects can be prevented .
But as engineers , we can design systems , and testing procedures so that flaws become evident as early in the process as possible , when they can be fixed in architecture and design documents rather than in built structures , or at least be found as early in the construction process as possible .
This is a frequent source of stress between those who build and those who sell .
The important thing for all to understand is that failing early is actually a form of risk reduction .
The sooner you fail , the sooner you can fix the defect and start again .
Back to the analogy .
Let ’s build another bridge .
Along comes MegaCorp , who wants to build a bigger bridge , a much bigger bridge than any attempted previously , a MegaBridge .
There is nothing wrong with that per se .
The history of engineering is the history of making bigger pyramids , wider vaulted ceilings , taller skyscrapers and longer bridges .
Of course , the fact that MegaBridge is right down the street from the new bridge that just opened last week is a bit odd .
But MegaCorp tells us that is OK .
We ’re not required to use their bridge if we do n’t want to .
Further suppose MegaCorp also wants to construct this MegaBridge in record time , faster than others have constructed bridges even a fraction of their size .
This is certainly ambitious , but there is no law against ambition .
Progress is made by those who are ambitious .
We learn from their successes as well as their failures .
The important thing is that an ambitious MegaBridge , like any other bridge , is held to the same standards as any other bridge , that proper inspections are carried out and that quality criteria are satisfied .
Months later and the construction of MegaBridge is complete .
Time for inspection .
But one problem — the MegaBridge is so large that it is impossible to carry out an inspection in the scheduled time .
There are simply not enough inspectors available to carry out the task and complete it by the targeted opening time .
What should we do ?
It is useful at this time to consider another engineering maxim , “ fail safe “ .
If a system is overloaded , or detects an error condition , it should fail to a safe state , a state least likely to cause damage .
We see this applied in many of the systems we use every day .
Traffic lights fail safe to flashing red , GFCI circuits fail safe by switching off current if a ground fault is detected , and train air brakes fail safe by applying the breaks if air pressure is lost .
The concept of a “ fail safe ” applies to processes as well as mechanical systems .
A committee , by having a quorum requirement , ensures that it fails to a harmless , inactive state if a snowstorm prevents a representative portion of the committee from attending a meeting .
A criminal trial , by presuming innocence and requiring a unanimous verdict to convict , ensures that in case of deadlock , the defendant is let free .
Similarly , a bridge quality inspection protocol should include a fail safe provision , that if the inspection cannot be completed , the bridge should not be certified as fit for use .
The inspection process should fail safe to non-certification .
Ordinarily , engineering practice would be to take whatever time is necessary to inspect the bridge fully , or fail the inspection .
( Here our tale diverges from standard engineering practice and starts to relay , by analogy , the increasingly bizarre tale of OOXML ’s exploits in and of ISO . )
But MegaCorp wants the MegaBridge to open on time .
They force the inspection to continue , even though the inspectors claim there is not enough time .
In order to “ help ” the inspection and despite the obvious conflict of interest , MegaCorp instructs a large number of its own employees , qualified or unqualified , to volunteer as bridge inspectors .
They further recruit employees from subsidiaries and suppliers to become inspectors as well .
In at least one case , MegaCorp tells a supplier , newly - minted as an inspector , “ Do n’t worry if you know nothing about bridges .
We ’ll tell you what to say .
All you need to do is say that the bridge is safe .
You ’ll be rewarded later for helping us here . ”
So the bridge inspectors go out , old and new , qualified and unqualified and come back with their individual preliminary reports .
The older , more experienced inspectors are critical in their evaluation :
The bridge is full of defects .
Although , as we mentioned earlier , the mandated schedule did not permit us to test all of the critical welds , of the ones we did test , we found numerous defects .
In fact , the number of defects we report is artificially low , since it was limited by our available inspection time .
If we had been able to complete a full inspection , we would have detected and reported many more problems .
We further found pervasive structural problems .
This bridge is unsound .
We can not certify it .
We further question why it is necessary to open up a new toll bridge at all , when we just opened up a new free bridge down the street .
The newly - minted inspectors , who for the most part are economically dependent on MegaCorp , were more supportive :
Although some minor problems were indicated , we believe these can all be fixed during routine maintenance .
We are not concerned about the time permitted for inspection .
We did what the process required .
And when you count all the new inspectors that MegaCorp has brought to the process , no bridge has been more inspected .
Considering the number of defects reported , this is the most - inspected bridge in history .
We recommend that MegaBridge be certified and opened as scheduled .
Of course , from an quality control perspective , this is seriously flawed .
The checks and balances between those who build , those who test and those who sell have been eliminated .
Although it would not be unusual for some MegaCorp inspectors to be involved in the inspection process , the late arrival of so many unqualified , newly - minted inspectors , and the shift of balance to MegaCorp ’s hand - picked inspectors , calls into question the independence and technical sufficiency of the entire inspection process .
The inspectors are polled to see whether the bridge can be certified .
The vote is close , but the answer is no , the MegaBridge cannot be certified in its current condition .
The inspectors , mainly the older , more experienced ones , record a report of 3,522 specific defects in the MegaBridge , far more defects than have ever been found in any other bridge .
MegaCorp is irate .
They blast the experienced inspectors in the press , while simultaneously reassuring their stockholders that this setback is just the next step forward to success .
They give their engineers the inspection report and demand a quick response .
“ We must open the bridge on time ! ” they yell .
The MegaCorp engineers work day and night , over weekends , over the holidays even , in order to develop written proposals to address each of the reported flaws in the bridge .
The inspectors are given the proposals and asked whether they believe the proposals are sufficient to allow the MegaBridge to be certified .
Although the newly - minted inspectors are quick to affirm the adequacy of the proposal , the old - timers just shake their heads in disbelief , with one stating to the press :
You could fix every last defect in that report and the MegaBridge would still not be sound .
Since we never inspected all of the critical welds in the first place , fixing only the defects we reported is insufficient .
It is not enough for us to merely retest the ones we reported as defective .
We need to test all of them .
Also , the fact that you are making pervasive changes to the road surface , the suspension materials and the pillar diameters , far - reaching design changes which were clearly rushed and have not gone through normal review procedures , I ’m afraid that all of our previous tests are now invalidated as well .
Additionally , many of your proposals either avoid addressing the flaws , paper around the flaws , or even introduce new flaws .
We need to re-certify the new design before we can even think about retesting the bridge .
However considering the huge number of defects reported , the even larger number of defects undetected because of lack of inspection time , the questionable competency of the newly - minted inspectors , and overt corruption of the process by MegaCorp , my recommendation would be to tear this thing down before it falls over and hurts someone .
Thus ends the tale of what every engineer knows .
( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton said she " misspoke " last week when she gave a dramatic description of her arrival in Bosnia 12 years ago , recounting a landing under sniper fire .
Clinton was responding to a question Monday from the Philadelphia Daily News ' editorial board about video footage of the event that contradicted her assertion that her group " ran with our heads down " from the plane to avoid sniper fire at the Tuzla Air Base .
Tommy Vietor , a spokesman for rival Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign , said the Bosnia claim was part of " a growing list of instances in which Sen.
Clinton has exaggerated her role in foreign and domestic policymaking . "
Clinton told the paper 's editorial board it was a " minor blip . "
Watch how Clinton described her trip »
" I say a lot of things -- millions of words a day -- so if I misspoke , that was just a misstatement , " she said .
In a radio interview that aired Tuesday , Clinton said she was n't worried about the incident hurting her credibility .
" I have been in the public eye for many , many years , and this is something that I think happens to anybody , " she told radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
In a foreign policy speech last week at George Washington University , Clinton used the description of a dangerous arrival to bolster her argument that she has the foreign policy experience needed to be commander in chief .
She said when she arrived in Bosnia on March 25 , 1996 , " I remember landing under sniper fire .
There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base . "
But news video footage of her arrival at Tuzla shows Clinton , then the first lady , calmly walking from the rear ramp of a U.S. Air Force plane with her daughter , Chelsea , then 16 , at her side .
Both Clintons held their heads up and did not appear rushed .
The video shows Clinton spending several minutes talking with the group , including an 8 - year - old Bosnian girl who presented her with a poem , and later greeting U.S. troops .
Clinton has mentioned the sniper fire at least twice earlier in the campaign , including in December in Dubuque , Iowa , before the caucuses in that state .
Clinton 's campaign has made foreign policy experience a centerpiece of her effort to come back against Obama , whom she is trailing in delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Watch a report on the Bosnia story and other political news »
During Monday 's editorial meeting -- in which Clinton was seeking the Daily News ' endorsement ahead of Pennsylvania 's April 22 primary -- she was asked about the apparent discrepancy .
The newspaper reported her response :
" Now let me tell you what I can remember , OK -- because what I was told was that we had to land a certain way and move quickly because of the threat of sniper fire .
So I misspoke -- I did n't say that in my book or other times but if I said something that made it seem as though there was actual fire -- that 's not what I was told , " she told the newspaper .
" I was told we had to land a certain way , we had to have our bulletproof stuff on because of the threat of sniper fire .
I was also told that the greeting ceremony had been moved away from the tarmac but that there was this 8 - year - old girl and , I can't , I can't rush by her , I 've got to at least greet her -- so I greeted her , I took her stuff and then I left .
Now that 's my memory of it . "
Meanwhile , as Clinton backpedaled from the description of her Bosnia trip , the senator from New York was keeping her focus on the economy with a town hall - style meeting Tuesday in Greensburg , Pennsylvania .
Clinton also pushed back against recent speculation by pundits and Democratic insiders that her chances of securing the nomination are quickly diminishing .
" I know there are some in Washington , and some in the media , who want this race to be over , " she said to a loud chorus of boos .
" There are some who think we do n't need to hear the voices of people in Pennsylvania or Indiana or North Carolina or Montana or any of the other states that have n't had their chance to vote .
Well , I disagree . "
Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , focused on the economy and the housing situation Tuesday , participating in a roundtable discussion in Santa Ana , California .
McCain blamed " rampant " speculation and " complacent " lenders for the mortgage crisis .
Vowing not to " play election - year politics , " he called for more transparency in lending and higher capital reserves for lenders .
Obama had no public events scheduled Tuesday .
The senator from Illinois was wrapping up a brief vacation to the U.S. Virgin Islands .
He resumes campaigning Wednesday , with stops scheduled in North Carolina .
He said he planned to spend a lot of time talking about the economy when he returns .

NASA has selected a proposal by an MIT - led team to develop plans for an array of radio telescopes on the far side of the moon that would probe the earliest formation of the basic structures of the universe .
The agency announced the selection and 18 others related to future observatories on Friday , Feb.15 .
The new MIT telescopes would explore one of the greatest unknown realms of astronomy , the so - called " Dark Ages " near the beginning of the universe when stars , star clusters and galaxies first came into existence .
This period of roughly a billion years , beginning shortly after the Big Bang , closely followed the time when cosmic background radiation , which has been mapped using satellites , filled all of space .
Learning about this unobserved era is considered essential to filling in our understanding of how the earliest structures in the universe came into being .
The Lunar Array for Radio Cosmology ( LARC ) project is headed by Jacqueline Hewitt , a professor of physics and director of MIT 's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Science .
LARC includes nine other MIT scientists as well as several from other institutions .
It is planned as a huge array of hundreds of telescope modules designed to pick up very - low - frequency radio emissions .
The array will cover an area of up to two square kilometers ; the modules would be moved into place on the lunar surface by automated vehicles .
Observations of the cosmic Dark Ages are impossible to make from Earth , Hewitt explains , because of two major sources of interference that obscure these faint low - frequency radio emissions .
One is the Earth 's ionosphere , a high - altitude layer of electrically charged gas .
The other is all of Earth 's radio and television transmissions , which produce background interference everywhere on the Earth 's surface .
The only place that is totally shielded from both kinds of interference is the far side of the moon , which always faces away from the Earth and therefore is never exposed to terrestrial radio transmissions .
Besides being the top priority scientifically for a telescope on the moon , this low - frequency radio telescope array will also be one of the easiest to build , Hewitt says .
That 's because the long wavelengths of the radio waves it will detect do n't require particularly accurate placement and alignment of the individual components .
In addition , it does n't matter if a few of the hundreds of antennas fail , and their performance would not be affected by the ever - present lunar dust .
The new lunar telescopes would add greatly to the capabilities of a low - frequency radio telescope array now under construction in Western Australia , one of the most radio - quiet areas on Earth .
This array , which also involves MIT researchers , will be limited to the upper reaches of the low - frequency radio spectrum , and thus will only be able to penetrate into a portion of the cosmic Dark Ages .
According to prevailing theory , this unobserved span of time in the universe 's infancy includes a period when dark matter -- an unknown component of the universe that accounts for a majority of all matter -- collapsed from a uniform soup of particles into clumps that formed the scaffolding for all the structures that emerged later , from stars and black holes to entire galaxies .
All astronomical observations made so far only reveal the results of that whole formation process -- except the cosmic background radiation , which only shows the raw material before the process began .
The whole gestation and birth of all the kinds of objects seen in space today , which all took place in the Dark Ages , has so far been hidden from view .
The new observations could test current theories about how the universe formed and evolved into its present state , including the theory of cosmic inflation first proposed by MIT Professor Alan Guth .
In addition to their primary mission , the new telescopes would also be useful for studying huge eruptions from the sun , called coronal mass ejections , which can sometimes disrupt communications and electrical grids on Earth .
They could also study space weather , the radio emissions from other planets and emissions from collisions between galaxies .
The present plan is for a one - year study to develop a detailed plan for the telescope array , whose construction would probably not begin until sometime after the year 2025 , and is expected to cost more than $ 1 billion .
The project to develop the plan is led by MIT 's Hewitt , with a team that includes MIT professors Jeffrey Hoffman of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Maria Zuber , chair of the Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences , as well as others from MIT and scientists from Harvard , the National Radio Astronomy Observatory , the University of California at Berkeley , University of Washington and NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
To develop this detailed plan , NASA is awarding a grant of $ 500,000 , to be divided between the MIT - led team and a second team that is independently developing a similar proposal , headed by scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) -
At least 30 members of a Russian doomsday cult have barricaded themselves in a remote cave to await the end of the world and are threatening to commit suicide if police intervene , officials and media said Thursday .
“ They have covered the entrance and refuse to come out and are threatening to blow themselves up , ” an official in the local prosecutor ’s office told Reuters by telephone .
“ They threaten to detonate a gas tank and blow themselves up . ”
The cult members , who include 29 adults and four children , are hidden inside a snow - covered hillside in the Penza region of central Russia .
A Penza police spokeswoman said they had moved into the dug - out on November 7 .
“ No one wants to take on the responsibility of provoking them ... because our information is that there are children among them , ” said the official .
They are thought to have taken food and fuel supplies in with them and Russian television pictures from the scene showed smoke or steam coming out of a hole in the snow - covered ravine where it was built .
A police patrol was guarding the area to prevent anyone provoking them .
“ They are simple Christians , ” a local priest , Father Georgy , told NTV television station .
“ They say : ‘ The church is doing a bad job , the end of the world is coming soon and we are all saving ourselves ’ . ”
Media reports said the cult members believed the world would end sometime in May next year .
Police expected them to emerge when their supplies ran out .
After decades of state - enforced atheism under Soviet rule , many Russians and other ex-Soviet nationals have come under the influence of homegrown and foreign sects .
Many Russians have refused new passports and taxpayers ’ personal identification numbers , saying the figures contained “ satanic ” combinations of numbers .
Izvestia newspaper said the leader of the cult , Pyotr Kuznetsov , had been detained by police .
It said he was a 43 - year - old who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and that in the last few months he had been sleeping in a coffin .
Police took Kuznetsov to the cave to persuade his followers to come out but without success , said the newspaper .
Existence of FBI Case Number , Described in Anonymous Letter Obtained by The BRAD BLOG , Corroborated by Paper
Letter Describes Senior State Dept. Official Marc Grossman as Tipping off Turkish Embassy to Valerie Plame Wilson's ' Brewster Jennings ' Counter - Proliferation Operation ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/19/2008 , 9:13 pm PT
By Brad Friedman from on the road ...
London 's Sunday Times has just published a follow - up to their explosive front - pager from two weeks ago which described allegations by former FBI translator turned whistleblower Sibel Edmonds .
Though there has been worldwide coverage of the recent blockbuster in the Rupert Murdoch - owned British paper , the U.S. media have remained entirely mum , a point which has drawn great consternation from both Edmonds and the 70's - era " Pentagon Papers " Daniel Ellsberg , whom The BRAD BLOG has spoken to this evening , following the release of tonight 's extraordinary new Times piece .
The paper now reports that they are able to corroborate an apparent FBI cover - up of documents detailing an investigation of the theft and sale of nuclear secrets to agents working for Turkey and Israel , who in turn shared the secrets with Pakistan , who in turn may have shared those secrets with Iran , North Korea , Libya , and possibly even al - Qaeda .
As The BRAD BLOG reported along with the Times two weeks ago , the operation also includes allegations that high - ranking U.S. officials --- such as Marc Grossman , a former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey , who served as the # 3 official in the State Department under Colin Powell and Richard Armitage from 2001 to 2005 --- were involved in the sale of those secrets and may have accepted pay - offs from agents in the black market network in the bargain .
The Times article tonight was originally published under the headline " FBI ' covers up ' file exposing theft of nuclear secrets , " according to Google News .
Though that header has already been changed to " FBI denies file exposing nuclear secrets theft . "
The Times ' article refers to an FBI case number ( 203A - WF - 210023 ) referenced in an anonymous letter sent to The Liberty Coalition , a DC - based transpartisan civil and human rights watchdog organization .
A subsequent Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request , asking for information referring to that case number , resulted in a denial from the FBI that such a case exists .
The letter describes , among other things , allegations that Grossman had warned officials at the Turkish embassy in DC of the existence of a CIA counter - proliferation operation using a " CIA cover company " by the name of " Brewster Jennings . "
That company was a front used by covert CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson , who was later outed by White House officials in the now - infamous CIA Leak case .
The BRAD BLOG had obtained a copy of the anonymous letter some weeks ago , along with the FBI 's denial of the existence of related information via the FOIA request .
We 've been in touch with the Sunday Times over the past week , as this story has been developing .
We have yet to publish the letter in full , however , as we have been unable to independently corroborate a number of allegations made in the letter .
The Times , however , reports that they 've " obtained a document signed by an FBI official showing the existence of the file " referred to in the anonymous letter .
We 've also just spoken to Edmonds , who has been under an unprecedented 5 - year - long gag order by the U.S. Department of Justice .
The DoJ has threatened Edmonds with prosecution under the so - called " State Secrets Privilege . "
The threat of prison has kept her from speaking publicly about details related to the case , which she claims to have heard while translating wiretaps for the FBI in 2001 and 2002 .
She has spent many years encouraging members of Congress to hold hearings and a public investigation into the case .
Despite public support from senators such as Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Chuck Grassley ( R- IA ) , and a promise for investigations from members of Rep. Henry Waxman 's ( D - CA ) office , who have been briefed on the details , no such investigation has been carried out to date .
Edmonds denied being the source for the anonymous letter , telling The BRAD BLOG " absolutely not , " when we asked her directly if she was its author ...
In addition to references in the letter to " Recorded wiretaps pertaining to conversations between Mr. Marc Grossman ... and a Turkish official at the Turkish Embassy in Washington , DC , between August 2001 and December 2001 , " there are references to " Internal communication within the Department of Justice between December 2005 and march [ sic ] 2007 . "
Edmonds points out she has no information on such internal communications at any period after 2002 , when she was fired by the FBI after whistleblower complaints to her superiors about infiltration within the translations department .
Those allegations were later described by the DoJ Inspector General as " credible , " " serious , " and " warrant[ing ] a thorough and careful review by the FBI . "
When we asked whether she could confirm the case number referenced in the anonymous letter , Edmonds told us , " I can confirm outright that the FBI lied in their denial of the existence of the file .
100 % .
It was an outright lie . "
The case in question , she told The BRAD BLOG , careful to avoid categorical defiance of her gag order , " concerns 1996 to 2002 information , targeting Turkish counter - intelligence , and it involves U.S. officials both appointed and elected . "
The Times ' report tonight offers similar information from Edmonds on the FBI case number in question ...
One of the documents relating to the case was marked 203A - WF - 210023 .
Last week , however , the FBI responded to a freedom of information request for a file of exactly the same number by claiming that it did not exist .
But The Sunday Times has obtained a document signed by an FBI official showing the existence of the file .
Edmonds believes the crucial file is being deliberately covered up by the FBI because its contents are explosive .
She accuses the agency of an “ outright lie . ”
“ I can tell you that that file and the operations it refers to did exist from 1996 to February 2002 .
The file refers to the counterintelligence programme that the Department of Justice has declared to be a state secret to protect sensitive diplomatic relations , ” she said .
After the initial story in the Times two weeks ago , Edmonds posted a number of photographs of high - ranking U.S. officials and members of think tanks , on her website , without names or comment .
The photos are believed to be those she alleges are involved in the criminal activities described in the various coverage of her explosive allegations .
She would not comment to The BRAD BLOG concerning the photographs on that page , titled only : " Sibel Edmonds ' State Secrets Privilege Gallery . "
Luke Ryland , assuredly the world 's foremost expert on the Edmonds case , writes tonight , on the FBI denial that any documents exist in reference to the specifically named case number :
The FBI 's comments demonstrate conclusively that either :
a) They are lying , or
b ) They have destroyed the evidence of this multi-year investigation concerning the corruption of high - level US officials , the nuclear black market , money laundering and narcotics trafficking .
" It 's ironic , " Edmonds told us , " here is the FBI and DoJ in charge of investigating the CIA Torture Tape case and the missing White House emails .
So who is going to investigate the FBI and DoJ if they have destroyed evidence , if that 's what they 've done , because it looks like that 's what they have done . "
Without naming Grossman --- as they also failed to do in their previous report two weeks ago --- the Times reports on some of the letter 's specific allegations ...
It claims the government official warned a Turkish member of the network that they should not deal with a company called Brewster Jennings because it was a CIA front company investigating the nuclear black market .
The official ’s warning came two years before Brewster Jennings was publicly outed when one of its staff , Valerie Plame , was revealed to be a CIA agent in a case that became a cause célèbre in the US .
The letter also makes reference to wiretaps of Turkish “ targets ” talking to [ Pakistan 's ] ISI intelligence agents at the Pakistani embassy in Washington and recordings of “ operatives ” at the [ American Turkish Council ] .
" We are all familiar with the cliche that ' the cover - up is worse than the crime , ' but that is often nonsense , " Ryland writes tonight .
" Just as in the CIA tape destruction case , here we have rational people making ' rational ' decisions , not in the heat of the moment , to commit felonies by destroying evidence of treason amongst other crimes .
The original crimes are much worse than the cover - up , and the guilty parties know it , that 's why they decided to destroy and cover up all of the evidence . "
He concludes by adding , " We have the crimes , we have the cover-ups , where are the consequences ? "
American Media - ( Still ) Missing in Action
Last October , in a BRAD BLOG Exclusive , Edmonds had announced she was willing to defy her gag order , in order to give the entire story to any American mainstream broadcast outlet who would allow her to do so .
Not a single media operation in this country took her up on the offer .
In November , we followed up that report with comments from the legendary Pentagon Papers whistleblower , Daniel Ellsberg , who described Edmonds ' story to us as " far more explosive than the Pentagon Papers , " while excoriating the American mainstream media for their failure to cover the story .
Even then , while foreign media requested interviews with Edmonds , the American media refused to touch the story .
London 's Sunday Times then contacted The BRAD BLOG after our series of reports , hoping to get in touch with Edmonds .
They claimed they had some corroboration for elements of her story that had leaked out previously , and wanted to touch base with her .
After putting them in touch with her , the result was the blockbuster story two weeks ago detailing allegations of a wide network of " moles " in place at U.S. nuclear installations , who were stealing and selling information on the foreign nuclear black market , as U.S. officials either looked the other way or were complicit in the criminal activities .
In response to that story , the top newspapers from Turkey to Pakistan to India to Israel picked up on the report .
But in the United States , incredibly enough , absolutely nothing .
Not a single major American media outlet covered the explosive and disturbing allegations .
We asked Edmonds tonight whether she had concerns that the British media outlet leading the way on coverage was , in fact , the Rupert Murdoch - owned Sunday Times , as some in the blogosphere had noted , with some concern , after the initial report two weeks ago .
" Murdoch is not doing it , " she replied .
" It 's the difference between the UK's reporters and the U.S. reporters and the way they go after stories .
It shows that they have far more leeway .
I think a lot of it is the self - censorship [ of the U.S. media ] and the reliance 100 % on only government sources . "
" I have had [ American ] reporters call me and tell me that I have ' stumbled on some big time national security , covert operation ' , " she continued , explaining that as the reason given by some for staying away from the story .
" Well , Iran -Contra was a goddamn covert operation too !
Even if that 's what they 're telling reporters in the U.S. , it does n't make the operation any less illegal .
And the cover - up of that is outrageous , " she told us tonight .
In an op - ed response being prepared by Daniel Ellsberg for publishing tomorrow by The BRAD BLOG , the Vietnam - era whistleblower offers these thoughts , in the wake of tonight 's Times story , and the shameful failure of the American media to cover this important story to date ...
For the second time in two weeks , the entire U.S. press has let itself be scooped by Rupert Murdoch 's London Sunday Times on a dynamite story of criminal activities by corrupt U.S. officials promoting nuclear proliferation .
But there is a worse journalistic sin than being scooped , and that is participating in a cover - up of information that demands urgent attention from the public , the U.S. Congress and the courts .
For the last two weeks --- one could say , for years --- the major American media have been guilty of ignoring entirely the allegations of the courageous and highly credible source Sibel Edmonds , quoted in the London Times on January 6 , 2008 in a front - page story that was front - page news in much of the rest of the world but was not reported in a single American newspaper or network .
Ellsberg goes on to write , " It is up to readers to demand that this culpable silent treatment end . "
The BRAD BLOG will publish Ellsberg 's comments in full tomorrow .
[ UPDATE : Ellsberg 's complete op - ed now posted in full here . ]
In addition to the Sunday Times story , we heartily recommend Luke Ryland 's coverage which , as usual , connects all of the most important dots for us .

In an attempt to clear up questions about how an Alabama television station lost its signal at the start of Sunday ’s edition of “ 60 Minutes ” on CBS , the management of the station , WHNT - TV , issued a statement Thursday citing equipment failure .
The station , in Huntsville , said that after a review , it had concluded that the blackout was related to a similar interruption during a basketball game the day before .
The break in the signal , which lasted about eight minutes , came as the CBS News program was beginning a report of special interest to Alabama residents : an investigation into whether the trial and conviction of a former governor , Don Siegelman , was politically motivated .
The report included charges that Republican and Bush administration officials , including Karl Rove , had sought to discredit Mr. Siegelman , a Democrat .
The station initially suggested that some failure at CBS was to blame but quickly reversed that , saying the problem involved a “ receiver ” at the station .
The general manager , Stan Pylant , said Thursday in an interview that there was no intention to keep the Siegelman story from viewers , citing the fact that the report was replayed on two newscasts and posted on the station ’s Web site .

Yesterday I spotted my first freegan , standing in front of the Dumpster in the parking lot of a Chicago Trader Joe's .
The encounter made me think long and hard about what I would feed my children and how I should procure it .
I 've been fascinated by freeganism since reading about it and hearing about it on the radio .
So when I saw the young man by the Dumpster , I turned my head to look closely .
He gave me a shrug and a smile .
I rolled down my window and asked , " Freegan ? "
Yup .
" There is some amazing stuff in here ! " he said .
Indeed , " amazing " was the very adjective used to describe this particular Dumpster on a freegan Web site I 'd seen .
On the ground were a few grocery items that looked similar to the stuff I had just paid over $ 200 for inside the store .
A loaf of whole wheat bread , in a bread bag .
A container of mini red and yellow peppers which had spilled open .
A plastic - wrapped wedge of brie .
" Did all that come out of the Dumpster ? " I asked .
In response , he held up a large backpack that was so full he could barely lift it with one hand .
" All this came out of there , " he told me .
" Want some bread ? "
I chuckled , and he glanced at the backseat and said , " You probably do n't want to feed your kids out of the garbage . "
Do I ? Reading about freeganism , I have thought that it 's something I would n't mind trying .
People routinely find wrapped or packaged food , before the expiration date , from premium stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's .
But now the freegan himself suggested that his spoils might not be fit for children .
I thought it over on my drive home .
Suddenly I could think of all kinds of reasons that feeding my family out of Dumpsters might make me nervous :
-- I do n't know why the store discarded the food .
A lot of it , freegans say , is thrown out because of a small blemish or other reasons that would not affect the safety .
But how am I to know that it 's not being pitched because a cooler broke and the food was n't kept cool enough overnight ?
Or because it was sitting under a leak from an upstairs toilet ?
Or because a customer returned it complaining that it tasted moldy ?
-- Much of the food is wrapped , but it is not exactly being stored in a clean place .
Would I mind if a cockroach or a rat walked across that breadbag before I brought it home and set it on my counter ?
OK , that could happen in the food warehouse , the truck or in the store as well , I know .
But it seems almost guaranteed to happen in a Dumpster , do n't you think ?
And what if the store puts rat poison in the Dumpster to keep vermin away ?
--
What about that other garbage it 's sitting next to or under ?
Suppose my wedge of cheese has been lightly bathed in the last drops from a bottle of Draino that was also thrown out ?
Of course , I can think of counterarguments to my squeamishness .
The store always looks clean and shiny , but I know my food has not always been in pristine places throughout the production chain .
And even with these risks to food purity , my kids would probably be better off eating organic food from the garbage than the conventional low - quality produce I usually buy from the grocery store nearest to me .
And the waste of resources involved in all that food ending up in a landfill is probably a bigger threat to my kids ' long - term health than the possibility of getting a dirty banana today .
Alas , as much as I long to be a radical mommy raising a couple of little Abbie Hoffmans , I guess I 'm more Donna Reed in this respect :
Say rat , and I 'm outta here .
Even hypothetical rat .
Anyway , if we shopped outside the Trader Joe 's instead of inside , my 3 - year - old would not get a balloon , and , let me tell you -- there would be serious repercussions .
So -- any freegans reading out there ?
Tell me , do you feed your kids this way ?
Am I underestimating the hygenic standards of the modern Dumpster ?
CINCINNATI , Ohio— A conservative radio talk show host who helped introduce Senator John McCain before a rally here Tuesday used Senator Barack Obama ’s middle name , Hussein , three times , while disparaging him , prompting Mr. McCain to apologize and repudiate the comments afterward .
Bill Cunningham , who hosts “ The Big Show ” with Bill Cunningham , a local program here that is also syndicated nationally , was part of a line of people lauding Mr. McCain and revving up the crowd before his appearance here before several hundred people at a theater here .
He lambasted the national media , drawing cheers from the audience , for being soft in their coverage of Mr. Obama compared to the Republican candidates , declaring they should “ peel the bark off Barack Hussein Obama . ”
He went on to rail , “ at one point , the media will quit taking sides in this thing and start covering Barack Hussein Obama . ”
After Mr. Cunningham spoke , Congressman Rob Portman , an Ohio Republican , took the stage and introduced Mr. McCain , who spoke for about a half hour .
Neither commented about Mr. Cunningham ’s remarks .
Mr. Portman said : “ Willie , you ’re out of control again .
So , what else is new ?
But we love him .
But I ’ve got to tell you , Bill Cunningham lending his voice to this campaign is extremely important .
He did it in 2000 , he did it in 2004 , it was crucial to victory then and it ’s even more important this year with his bigger radio audience .
So Bill Cunningham thank you for lending your voice . ”
Afterward , however , Mr. McCain held a scheduled news conference and immediately addressed the comments , evidently informed by his aides about what had happened .
“ It ’s my understanding that before I came in here a person who was on the program before I spoke made some disparaging remarks about my two colleagues in the Senate , Senator Obama and Senator Clinton , ” he said .
“ I have repeatedly stated my respect for Senator Obama and Senator Clinton , that I will treat them with respect .
I will call them ‘ Senator . ’
We will have a respectful debate , as I have said on hundreds of occasions .
I regret any comments that may have been made about these two individuals who are honorable Americans . ”
Responding to questions from reporters , Mr. McCain said he did not hear what Mr. Cunningham said , saying that when he arrived , Mr. Portman was on stage .
“ Whatever suggestion that was made that was any way disparaging to the integrity , character , honesty of either Senator Obama or Senator Clinton was wrong , ” he said , “ I condemn it , and if I have any responsibility , I will take the responsibility , and I apologize for it . ”
He called Mr. Obama a “ man of integrity ” and said he was someone he had come to know “ pretty well and I admire . ”
He also said that it was not appropriate to invoke Mr. Obama ’s middle name in the course of the campaign .
“ I absolutely repudiate such comments , ” he said .
“ It will never happen again . ”
Mr. Obama ’s middle name , which is Muslim in origin , comes from his late father , Barack Hussein Obama , Sr. , a Kenyan .
Mr. Obama ’s campaign has been dogged by whispered rumors that he is a Muslim — he is actually a practicing Christian .
Periodically , his full name has been bandied about by conservatives critics , drawing indignation from Mr. Obama ’s campaign and others .
“ We appreciate Senator McCain ’s remarks .
It is a sign that if there is a McCain - Obama general election , it can be intensely competitive but the candidates will attempt to keep it respectful and focused on issues , ” said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton .
Updated Mr. Cunningham later posted video on his 700WLW blog of his remarks at the McCain event , as well as his reaction to Senator McCain ’s criticism .
Sitting at a microphone in an office , Mr. Cunningham said :
Only Democrats , Air America , New York Times , talk - show hosts and newspaper reporters have freedom of speech .
I have the right to speak my mind any way that I would like .
If I consider Obama to be a hack Chicago politician from the Daley political machine , taking money from this Tony Rezko dude under threat of federal indictment , ca n’t I speak truth to power ?
Mr. Cunningham said the media often say “ nasty , negative things ” about President Bush and Vice President Cheney , and that The Times had “ smeared ” John McCain on its front page .
Treat all the politicians the same .
We ’re not dealing with the messiah here .
Obama cannot heal the sick and make the blind see .
He ’s a hack Democratic politician from Chicago , that ’s all he is .
Let ’s treat him like every other hack Democratic or Republican politician .
Then he continued :
I ’m angry at McCain .
Why would John McCain repudiate me ?
I ’ve been able to unite McCain and Obama against me .
I might become a supporter of Ralph Nader .

Sure , iTunes has millions of tracks , but do n't go looking there for obscure or out - of - print treasures like , say , the seminal stoner - rock stylings of Sir Lord Baltimore .
Fortunately for music geeks , help is on the way .
Keith Abrahamsson , an A&R rep for New York - based indie label Kemado Records , recently launched the first all - digital reissues label .
At prices similar to those of Apple 's square mass - market store , Anthology Recordings offers high - fidelity ( 320 Kbps ) , DRM - free rips of supercool , ultrarare titles — from late - '60s Swedish psych - rock to British postpunk and early - '80s dub .
Most online music sites give the bands short shrift when slicing up the revenue pie .
Not Anthology .
Its catalog consists mainly of recordings for which the copyrights have reverted to the artists ( or which were never released in the first place ) , so Abrahamsson is able to strike deals directly with musicians and secure exclusive distribution arrangements .
" Some artists still have their original tapes , but sometimes we have to take an old vinyl record , copy it into Pro Tools , and clean it up with audio - mastering software , " Abrahamsson says .
" We do whatever it takes to get this stuff back in circulation . "
With Anthology 's minimal production costs , long - forgotten acts can finally make some dough .
" I 've been making music for 30 years , " says John Garner of the pioneering heavy metal band Sir Lord Baltimore .
" And I recently got my first royalty check ever — it was from Anthology . "
Seven lost ( and awesome ) albums found only on Anthology
Space Art : Onyx Groovy French synth music from the ' 70s — long before those two Daft Punks ever touched a keyboard .
Moody : The Gentle Rain Early instrumental funk from composer Nick Ingman , who has since worked with Radiohead , David Bowie , and Björk .
Soft Machine : Spaced Abrahamsson unearthed these previously unknown recordings by the influential English prog band .
Lots of tripped - out tape - loop weirdness .
Tim Rice : That 's My Story
The very best of the famed lyricist 's early endeavors as a producer of sunny ' 60s pop — never before released .
The Suicide Commandos : The Commandos Commit Suicide Dance Concert Originally issued in 1979 , a raucous , raw recording of several live sets by this seminal — and tragically overlooked — punk rock trio from Minneapolis .
Sir Lord Baltimore : Kingdom Come Slow , fuzzy , anvil - heavy metal circa 1970 from the New York band cited as the inventors of " stoner rock . "
Anonymous : Inside the Shadow Beautiful melodic rock dosed with country and psychedelia from a mid-'70s Indianapolis studio project .

Before the US House of Representatives , Jan. 30 , 2008
Madame Speaker , I rise in opposition to the extension of the Protect America Act of 2007 because the underlying legislation violates the US Constitution .
The misnamed Protect America
Act allows the US government to monitor telephone calls and other electronic communications of American citizens without a warrant .
This clearly violates the Fourth Amendment , which states :
“ The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . ”
The Protect America
Act sidelines the FISA Court system and places authority over foreign surveillance in the director of national intelligence and the attorney general with little if any oversight .
While proponents of this legislation have argued that the monitoring of American citizens would still require a court - issued warrant , the bill only requires that subjects be “ reasonably believed to be outside the United States . ”
Further , it does not provide for the Fourth Amendment protection of American citizens if they happen to be on the other end of the electronic communication where the subject of surveillance is a non-citizen overseas .
We must remember that the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed in 1978 as a result of the U.S. Senate investigations into the federal government ’s illegal spying on American citizens .
Its purpose was to prevent the abuse of power from occurring in the future by establishing guidelines and prescribing oversight to the process .
It was designed to protect citizens , not the government .
The effect seems to have been opposite of what was intended .
These recent attempts to “ upgrade ” FISA do not appear to be designed to enhance protection of our civil liberties , but to make it easier for the government to spy on us !
The only legitimate “ upgrade ” to the original FISA legislation would be to allow surveillance of conversations that begin and end outside the United States between non-US citizens where the telephone call is routed through the United States .
Technology and the global communications market have led to more foreign to foreign calls being routed through the United States .
This adjustment would solve the problems outlined by the administration without violating the rights of US citizens .
While I would not oppose technical changes in FISA that the intelligence community has indicated are necessary , Congress should not use this opportunity to chip away at even more of our constitutional protections and civil liberties .
I urge my colleagues to oppose this and any legislation that violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution .
Following up on my transcript / review of the UCW “ Hello World ” screencast , here is my review of Marco Barringer ’s SLIME movie .
( Description , 150 MB .mov , Torrent , watch online ) .
This screencast was more difficult to annotate because :
It was almost 3 x as long ( 55 min vs. 20 )
It covered more topics ( Linux , Emacs , Lisp , SLIME )
I did find it much more interesting though because it showed off a lot of the cool features in those topics , whereas the UCW screencast was mostly just instructional .
Also , I do n’t know if I ’ll ever use UCW for an app , but I ’m already using the LELS stack and plan on using it for a long time to come .
( See what other people have said about it )
Looking back at my UCW reference , I think the format worked for that screencast because it was mostly just straight Lisp code .
In the SLIME movie , the Lisp code is the least useful part – it ’s just the vehicle for showing off the tools .
So there ’s a mix of Linux commands ( unfortunately omitted because WordPress or Apache or somebody thinks they ’re a security problem ) , Emacs key chords , Emacs Lisp code , and Common Lisp code .
I ’m leaving out most of the Common Lisp code for the morse code translator to focus on what ’s more relevant .
Also , I added links to documentation for the features shown .
Hopefully this will make it easier to watch the movie and get straight to work on your own projects !

SETTING UP SLIME , EMACS
0:15 Architecture : SLIME is two parts .
An Emacs mode to handle commands , the debugger , all IDE modes , etc , and Swank , a server program that runs in the Lisp environment .
Emacs connects with Swank over a typical IP / port protocol , so it can connect to a local or remote Lisp instance .
This demo will show connection to a remote Lisp instance ( SBCL , in this demo ) .
NOTE : Robert Goldman points out that this setup is a little dated , and the current setup is simpler .
See the links in this comment .
0:25 Recommendation to always work with the latest build of SLIME from CVS .
NOTE : This movie was made several years ago – is this still a valid recommendation or is SLIME stable enough to just use the released version without any worries ?

( asdf:oos ' asdf:load - op : swank ) ; oos = operate on system
3:23 Use a secure shell to create a communication link for Slime and the remote Swank process
3:56 Swank will attempt to use second stream for output .
This makes things faster and helps avoid odd hangups .
It is off for the demo to avoid having an extra port open .
To disable it , enter the following in the SBCL prompt :
( setf swank:*use- dedicated-output - stream * nil )
4:37 To start the Swank server , enter this at the SBCL prompt :
( swank : create - swank - server ) EDIT : this command was deprecated in 2006 .
The new command is : ( swank : create - server )
4:48 Configure your local emacs by creating a slime.el file .
This should go in the directory below your .emacs file .
For Marco , it was :
~/.emacs.d/mb:slime.el
4:59 Selected contents of Marco ’s slime.el file , with comments related to each setting .

15:15 Pressing ‘ ‘ ( space ) after a typing a function shows the parameter list in the minibuffer .
16:25 Marco does a cool demonstration of Emacs keyboard macros .
I have no idea how he did it and I ’m not ready to dive into Emacs documentation just yet .
Enjoy the link !
EDIT : Reader jeep says :
With standard keybindings , the macro at 16:25 could be :
C-x (
(#\ C-f M-SPC ‘ C-e ‘)
C-n C-a
C-x ) i.e .
Start the keyboard macro with C-x ( Then insert the characters (# \
Go forward one character
Get rid of all but one space ( M - SPC )
Insert the character ‘
Go to the end of the line
Insert the characters ‘)
Go to the next line and then back to the beginning of the line .
Then close the macro with C-x )
Then C-x e to execute it and e to repeat .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Retailer Sharper Image Corp has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , citing declining sales , three straight years of losses and litigation involving its Ionic Breeze air purifiers .
The San Francisco - based company filed for protection late Tuesday in U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington , Delaware .
Sharper Image said it had $ 251.5 million in assets and $ 199 million in debt as of January 31 , according to the filing .
Cash on hand totaled about $ 700,000 .
Its shares plunged 92 cents , or 64 percent , to 52 cents on Nasdaq .
“ Sharper Image is in a severe liquidity crisis , ” Chief Financial Officer Rebecca Roedell said in a separate filing .
She said the company has suffered from increased competition , narrowing margins , litigation , lower consumer and market confidence , tighter credit from suppliers , and poorly performing stores .
“ The foregoing has been compounded by the ever - tightening and volatile credit and financing markets , ” she added .
Sharper Image has seen its sales decline steadily since 2004 , and has posted net losses in fiscal 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 .
According to court papers , the electronics retailer also cited “ negative publicity ” from the litigation involving its Ionic Breeze air purifiers for its falling revenues .
In October , a federal court denied approval of a settlement of class - action suits related to the efficacy of the air purifiers .
The product was sold to 3 million consumers , according to a previous filing .
Following the ruling , Sharper Image ’s stock fell 18 percent , weakening support from suppliers and choking working capital as creditors tightened or withdrew credit terms , according to court documents .
The company deals with about 650 vendors and suppliers on a credit basis , many of whom began to request cash upon delivery , according to court papers .
Sharper Image is seeking a $ 60 million loan arranged by Wells Fargo Retail Finance LLC to keep operating , according to the court papers .
The company said in a separate filing it replaced Chief Executive Steven Lightman with Robert Conway on February 14 .
Two decades ago , Sun Microsystems prophesied : " The network is the computer . "
Today , BitTorrent video and 3D graphics flood the Internet , Apple iPhones tap the Net 's computing power , and PC - king Microsoft pursues Net-centric Yahoo .
Sun 's mantra has become reality .
But as the Internet booms and moves to the center of the global economic sphere , it draws proportional attention from politicians and regulators .
In Congress and at the FCC , legislators and lawyers think they can manage overflowing Net traffic and commerce better ...
The bad news for Rudolph W. Giuliani Tuesday night in Michigan was that Representative Ron Paul of Texas appears to have beaten him handily again , just as he did in Iowa .
With 89 percent of the precincts reporting at 11:20 p.m. , Mr. Giuliani was in a distant sixth - place , behind Fred D. Thompson , who was in fifth place , and Mr. Paul , who was in fourth place and who received more than twice as many votes as Mr. Giuliani .
The good news for Mr. Giuliani is that Mitt Romney ’s victory leaves the Republican field unsettled – which is what he needs if his unconventional strategy of waiting until Florida on Jan. 29 to try to eke out his first victory is to work .
“ It ’s clear after tonight that while the race remains fluid and competitive , our strategy remains on track , ” Tony Carbonetti , a senior adviser to Mr. Giuiani , said in a statement .
Countrywide Financial heads towards bankruptcy

, on the subprime credit crisis :
The government has brought on the housing problem , partly by these very low interest rates , which encouraged many people to go way out on a limb .
They ’ve brought it on by highly restrictive building policies , which have caused housing prices to skyrocket artificially .
And they ’ve brought it on by the Community Reinvestment Act , which presumes that politicians are better able to tell investors where to put their money than the investors themselves are .
When you put all that together , you get something like what you have .

:
Perhaps the greatest scandal of the mort gage crisis is that it is a direct result of an intentional loosening of underwriting standards - done in the name of ending discrimination , despite warnings that it could lead to wide - scale defaults .
From the current hand - wringing , you 'd think that the banks came up with the idea of looser underwriting standards on their own , with regulators just asleep on the job .
In fact , it was the regulators who relaxed these standards - at the behest of community groups and " progressive " political forces .
A 1995 strengthening of the Community Reinvestment Act required banks to find ways to provide mortgages to their poorer communities .
It also let community activists intervene at yearly bank reviews , shaking the banks down for large pots of money .
Ironically , an enthusiastic Fannie Mae Foundation report singled out one paragon of nondiscriminatory lending , which worked with community activists and followed " the most flexible underwriting criteria permitted . "
That lender 's $ 1 billion commitment to low - income loans in 1992 had grown to $ 80 billion by 1999 and $ 600 billion by early 2003 .
Who was that virtuous lender ?
Why - Countrywide , the nation 's largest mortgage lender , recently in the headlines as it hurtled toward bankruptcy ( see chart above of Countrywide 's 90 % stock decline ) .
A twit of a journalist called Melanie Phillips , writing in the Daily Mail , thinks that science is the enemy or reason .
Why ?
Well , she seems to be saying that abandonment of religion has led to people believing in new age nonsense , alternative medicine etc .
Quite why this is science ’s fault is unclear , but I think this “ journalist ’s ” reasoning is that Richard Dawkins is somehow arrogant in deriding Intelligent Design , and that this is as illogical as religion .
Or something .
It is a little hard to make any sense of what passes for a reasoned argument in this woman ’s mind .
See if you can make sense of this :
But where Dawkins goes wrong is to assume this is all as irrational as believing in God .
The truth is that it is the collapse of religious faith that has prompted the rise of such irrationality .
No .
Irrationality was there already – people just believe in other irrational things too – as irrational as religion in many cases .
We are living in a scientific , largely post - religious age in which faith is presented as unscientific superstition .
Yet paradoxically , we have replaced such faith by belief in demonstrable nonsense .
It was GK Chesterton who famously quipped that " when people stop believing in God , they do n't believe in nothing - they believe in anything . "
Yes .
That is why this blog is about critical thinking and skepticism , not just anti-religion .
Pity this “ journalist ” did n’t apply some – maybe explain to her readers how to be a critical thinker .
You know – write something useful .
The big mistake is to see religion and reason as polar opposites .
They are not .
In fact , reason is intrinsic to the Judeo - Christian tradition .
The Bible provides a picture of a rational Creator and an orderly universe - which , accordingly , provided the template for the exercise of reason and the development of science .
A rational creator ?
No , a petulant creator who demands obedience , worship and sometimes human sacrifice .
Whose only son has to die so that he ( God – who made the rules , remember ? ) , can forgive us for our sins .
Because he could n’t just forgive us our sins unless his only son dies .
Although he is God.
Very rational .
And the most irrational thing about all this – believing in this pile of nonsense in the first place .
Oh but wait :
Dawkins pours particular scorn on the Biblical miracles which do n't correspond to scientific reality .
But religious believers have different ways of regarding those events , with many seeing them as either metaphors or as natural occurrences which were invested with a greater significance .
So which is it ?
Is there a rational creator , or is it all a metaphor ?
Surely it ca n’t be both ?
The heart of the Judeo - Christian tradition is the belief in the concept of truth , which gives rise to reason .
But our postreligious age has proclaimed that there is no such thing as objective truth , only what is " true for me " .
Which is the opposite of what science teaches .
How is this science ’s fault , again ?
That is because our society wo n't put up with anything which gets in the way of ' what I want ' .
How we feel about things has become all - important .
So reason has been knocked off its perch by emotion , and thinking has been replaced by feelings .
Agreed .
But why is science to blame ?
This has meant our society can no longer distinguish between truth and lies by using evidence and logic .
How else do you distinguish between truth and lies ?
In modern times , however , science has given rise to ' scientism ' , the belief that science can answer all the questions of human existence .
This is not so .
Science cannot explain the origin of the universe .
Yet it now presumes to do so and as a result it has descended into irrationality .
Count the straw men .
Science does n’t even pretend to know the answers to “ all the questions of human existence ” , nor does it suggest it has explained “ the origin of the universe ” .
Although it is the best method we have of knowing those things , if they are knowable .
The most conspicuous example of this is provided by Dawkins himself , who breaks the rules of scientific evidence by seeking to claim that Darwin 's theory of evolution - which sought to explain how complex organisms evolved through random natural selection - also accounts for the origin of life itself .
Well , I do n’t know if Dawkins actually says that .
But no scientific theory states that as yet .
But at least science tries to answer those questions .
What is Phillips ’ better way ?
See what the Bible says ?
There is no evidence for this whatever and no logic to it .
After all , if people say God could not have created the universe because this gives rise to the question " Who created God ? " , it follows that if scientists say the universe started with a big bang , this prompts the further question " What created the bang ? "
The argument is that saying “ God created the universe ” is not an answer – it just raises the question “ who created God .
So “ Goddidit ” tells us nothing .
The Big Bang , however , tells us a lot .
And makes predictions .
Indeed , if the origin of life were truly spontaneous , this would constitute what religious people would call a miracle .
Accordingly , this claim in itself resembles not so much science as the superstition that Dawkins derides .
If he claimed it true without evidence , then that might be correct .
Of course , what scientists are trying to do is find the evidence for the origins of life .
Again , what is the alternative ?
“ Magic man did it ” ?
Moreover , since science essentially takes us wherever the evidence leads , the findings of more than 50 years of DNA research - which have revealed the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce life - have thrown into doubt the theory that life emerged spontaneously in a random universe .
Er , no it has n’t .
These findings have given rise to a school of scientists promoting the theory of Intelligent Design , which suggests that some force embodying purpose and foresight lay behind the origin of the universe .
Some of them may be scientists ( not many , but some of them may be ) , but they ’re not practicing science .
And the findings did n’t “ give rise ” to the school .
The school existed before – it was religion that “ gave rise ” to it .
They then tried to shoe - horn the evidence to fit the religious beliefs they already had .
While this theory is , of course , open to vigorous counter - argument , people such as Prof Dawkins and others have gone to great lengths to stop it being advanced at all , on the grounds that it denies scientific evidence such as the fossil record and is therefore worthless .
No , they go to lengths to prevent it being taught as science , because it is not .
And being taught ID as though it were science would jeopardize future scientific progress .
Yet distinguished scientists have been hounded and their careers jeopardised for arguing that the fossil record has got a giant hole in it .
Some 570 million years ago , in a period known as the Cambrian Explosion , most forms of complex animal life emerged seemingly without any evolutionary trail .
Again , nonsense .
The Cambrian explosion is not a problem for evolution .
These scientists argue that only ' rational agents ' could have possessed the ability to design and organise such complex systems .
Yes , but only because they can’t imagine how it could have come about without God .
Whether or not they are right ( and I do n't know ) , their scientific argument about the absence of evidence to support the claim that life spontaneously created itself is being stifled - on the totally perverse grounds that this argument does not conform to the rules of science which require evidence to support a theory .
No , IDists do not have a “ scientific argument about the absence of evidence ” .
They ignore the evidence for evolution , and they have no evidence for their lame idea .
So yes , that is n’t science .
As a result of such arrogance , the West - the crucible of reason - is turning the clock back to a pre-modern age of obscurantism , dogma and secular witch - hunts .
Far from upholding reason , science itself has become unreasonable .
So when Prof Dawkins fulminates against ' new age ' irrationality , it is the image of pots and kettles that comes irresistibly to mind .
Science is unreasonable because it ca n’t yet explain how life started ?
And what is your explanation then Ms. Phillips ?
And what is your solution , if you do n’t like science ?
Because you do n’t provide any solutions in this long whine at Richard Dawkins .
And if you have no solutions , what is the point ?
Pots and kettles indeed .

Even though I have the room to rent in my house I do n't desperately need the extra rent money to make ends meet .
Because of this I think I can be somewhat selective when choosing someone to share my place .
Unfortunately , I have n't found a decent ad worth contacting for some time now .
For it seems that the Las Vegas " Housing Wanted " ads are very unrealistic and more disheartening than ever .
I 'd like to point out a few gripes that I , as your potential roommate and landlord , would like to bring up about the ads you 've placed .
This is my biggest beef .
Yes , we all love a bargain but this is ridiculous .
I understand that your basis for what rent and utilities might cost is still based on your hometown of Buttfuck , KY 's cost - of - living chart .
This is not Buttfuck , KY .
It 's Las Vegas , NV and it costs a nice sum to live here comfortably without having to live in the ghetto or with 10 other roommates .
Did you know that the cost of electricity has risen over 60 % since 2000 ?
60 %!
It 's not uncommon for a summertime power bill to be well over $ 250 or more no matter how hard you try to conserve .
On top of that , you also have to worry about water ( a scarce commodity here ) , gas , cable , trash , sewer , etc .
That shit adds up .
Welcome to Las Vegas .
Taking this gripe down a different avenue , I 'd like to pimp slap you cheap , $ 400 - and - under schmoes who think nothing of being overly picky .
You want to live in Summerlin or , better yet , a penthouse on The Strip .
You demand access to a heated pool , gym , free wi-fi , once a week maid service , will not accept anything less than a whole hog HBO / Showtime digital package , and will not live anywhere that does n't have a water softening system because you tend to suffer from dry skin .
Yet , you are only willing to pay $ 400 and not one penny more !
Oh yeah , you also MUST have a place on a busline because you do n't have a car .
It sucks that Mom and Dad kicked you out of the basement , but this is real life .
Let me be the first to tell you that you will never have it as good again .
I love animals dearly .
I even have a dog myself .
But you , potential roommate , have a flippin ' farm .
I see you post over and over with more pleading intensity with every post looking for something " pet friendly " .
Did you know that most city ordinances have limits on the number of animals allowed per household ?
For the City of Las Vegas , it 's 3 .
Not 3 of each species , 3 total combined number of animals .
Hey , I do n't make the rules here but they are a good guideline for us all .
Next time , you should think twice before you adopt another passenger for your ark .
Noah had an excuse for all his beasts but at least he owned the damn ship , he did n't rent it .
For those that only have a cat or two , I 've considered emailing you about my vacant room .
Then I envision my dog eating your cat(s ) - OOPS ! , remember how much I hate the smell of cat piss and I stop typing .
I believe in honesty and thanks for being open about your lifestyle choices .
I appreciate it .
But frankly , the thought of someone running around the house naked , save for my out - of - town boyfriend or Hugh Jackman , makes me cringe .
Besides , I have a light colored couch and the thought of a nudist 's butthole and / or ballsac rubbing on the cushions makes me gag .
Hugh Jackman 's butthole / ballsac is perfectly ok though .
Hell no to all of the above .
I also refuse to take food stamps or trade for used merchandise in lieu of rent .
Either save up for that stuff and / or tell yourself " Now 's not a good time to move " .
I 'm a pretty easy going person and I do n't condemn those who choose to puff the herb but I certainly do n't call myself " 420 friendly " .
I 'm more of an acquaintance of 420 .
I 'd recognize it at a party or something but we do n't go grab dinner together or know each other 's last names .
With that said , I do n't feel comfortable inviting 420 to my house .
Yeah , I know you two will just hole up in your room and not bother anyone all night .
Fact is , 420 smells funny and I like that my house smells like Pier 1 candles and a eucalyptus Christmas wreath .
You 're welcome to go to my neighbor 's house when 420 is a welcomed and esteemed guest .
If you do bring 420 over , it will disappear and suddenly I will have Christmas gifts for all of my stoner friends .
Giving feels good .
I donate to Opportunity Village when I can , shop at charity stores by choice , I even have part of my weekly paycheck syphoned off for United Way .
While I feel deeply saddened that you 've fallen on hard times , I can only give you advice .
When it comes to CL , hard luck stories are a red flag unless you 're a fat girl looking for a fuck buddy .
Your requests become downright cringe - worthy when you throw the prayers to varying religious icons in there .
Since you have access to a computer ( maybe even own the damn computer itself ! )
AND have a cell phone where you can be contacted I can safely assume that you 're not doing as bad off as you think .
Be thankful and think " Hey !
Things could be worse " and then stop posting or get a little better at faking near - poverty .
Your ad is this short .
You might put a phone number .
You might not .
I might respond .
Or I might not .
Bottom line is I guess I really can't complain since CL is free and you really do get what you pay for .
CNNU campus correspondent Joshua Molina is a senior at Brigham Young University .
CNNU is a feature that provides student perspectives on news and trends from colleges across the United States .
The views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of CNN , its affiliates or the schools where the campus correspondents are based .
University of Utah senior Nick shows how he keeps his gun concealed .
SALT LAKE CITY , Utah ( CNN ) --
The senior at the University of Utah gets dressed and then decides which gun is easiest to conceal under his clothes .
If he 's wearing a T - shirt , he 'll take a smaller , low - profile gun to class .
If he 's wearing a coat , he may carry a different weapon , he said .
He started carrying a gun to class after the massacre at Virginia Tech , but the student says he's not part of the problem of campus shootings and could instead be part of a solution .
Nick , who asked not to be fully identified so his fellow students would n't know he carried a gun , says he has had a concealed weapons permit for more than three years .
But it was Seung - Hui Cho 's murderous campus rampage that made him take a gun to class .
" Last year , after Virginia Tech , I thought ' I 'm not going to be a victim , ' " Nick said .
" My first thought was ' how tragic . '
But then I could n't help but think it could 've been different if they 'd allowed the students the right to protect themselves . "
Days after another campus shooting -- in which five students and the gunman died at Northern Illinois University -- students at colleges in Utah , the only state to allow weapons at all public universities , are attending classes .
See which states have laws about hidden weapons on campus »
Nick says his gun does n't make him feel immune from attack .
" But I feel that I will be able to protect myself , and I 'm confident in my training and my ability , " he said .
His confidence is not shared by fellow student Griselda Espinoza , who recently transferred to the university .
Some 28,000 students attend the school , as of the latest enrollment figures .
" I feel less safe knowing that a stranger sitting beside me in class may have a gun in his or her backpack , " she said .
" The only people that should carry guns are trained officials . "
University of Utah spokeswoman Coralie Alder stressed that although the school has become a poster child in the media regarding guns on campus , the debate is really a statewide issue .
" The university is following the law as determined by the Utah Legislature during last year 's session , which allows concealed weapon permit holders to carry guns on university and colleges campuses , as well as other locations , " she said .
Amanda Covington , Utah State Board of Regents spokeswoman , would not comment on the current gun laws on school campuses .
However , she said the regents are opposing a legislative proposal to allow people with concealed weapons permits to have the weapons visible in public .
" We are worried that it may affect their [ students ' and teachers ' ] willingness or desire to go to or teach a class on campus , " she said .
The University of Utah , based in Salt Lake City , had prohibited firearms on its campus until that ban was struck down by the state 's Supreme Court in late 2006 .
The institution , backed by all other universities in the state , is still fighting through federal courts to reinstate the ban .
But state legislators could be moving in the opposite direction , considering a bill to modify current law to allow people in Utah -- including students -- to carry loaded weapons openly .
Utah State Representative Curtis Oda said the bill , which he is sponsoring , is merely to clarify that people with weapons permits may carry a gun openly or -- with a concealed permit -- they may hide it for the sake of surprise .
He stressed that people with permits have gone through rigorous checks .
" When you see someone with a gun , you are looking at some of the most law - abiding people in the state , " he said .
The issue goes beyond campus .
Last year , a few miles from the University of Utah , a man walked into Trolley Square , a Salt Lake City shopping mall , and opened fire .
Police were there in only three minutes , but the shooter had already killed five people and wounded four others .
" And not just shootings , but [ serial killer ]
Ted Bundy did some of his crimes at the University of Utah campus , " said David Seelly , a recent University of Utah graduate who says he carried a concealed gun on campus .
" If one of those ladies was a concealed - weapon holder , she could 've stopped him before he did as much as he did . "
To get a permit to carry a concealed weapon , people in Utah must , among other things :
Be 21 years old
Have no criminal record of violent , immoral or substance - related crime
Be mentally competent .
Student Kevin Rechtenbach of the University of Utah said he was open to carrying a gun , but not certain that would solve problems .
" If acts of terrorism continue on campus , then I will have no choice but to carry a concealed weapon , " he said .
" But you see , that is where the problem lies : Everybody will end up carrying concealed weapons , and everyday problems will be solved with guns rather than words or even fists . "
The only places on campus that have restrictions are the dormitories .
Students can request a roommate who does n't carry a gun .
Private colleges in Utah , like the Mormon Church - owned Brigham Young University in Provo , do have more power to ban weapons on campus , but that , too , causes disagreement among students .
" I own some guns , and I wish I was allowed to have them at school , " said Collin Barker , a BYU student .
" I would just keep [ them ] in my car for target shooting . "
Casey Matheny , from Plano , Texas , now studying at BYU , appeared indifferent to the debate over students carrying guns .
" I do n't mind if they have one , I just do n't want to know about it , " he said .
Rob Morrison , a BYU student from Ontario , Canada , does n't think that having guns on campus would necessarily stop a potential killer .
" The people that do it want to commit suicide anyway , " Morrison said .
" But it would give students a chance to defend themselves , and at Virginia Tech , it could have ended sooner than it did . "

The 's character has gone through some significant changes in interpretation over the years .
He began as a homicidal foil toin the 1940s , then transformed into a goofy and mischievous prankster in the 1950s and ' 60s , before finally reverting back to his original murderous and maniacal form in the 1970s .
Throughout his years as one of the most iconic and recognizable villains in pop culture , Batman 's greatest nemesis has also underwent some significant changes in appearance , a visual evolution that includes a variety of different artistic interpretations of the character .
Sure , the basics have always been there :
The Joker 's maniacal grin , his green hair , red lips and purple suit .
With that said , like any character that 's been around for so long , the Joker 's look and feel has changed with each writer , artist and director that has handled him .
With The Dark Knight arriving on DVD Decemeber 9 , IGN Stars updates our popular Many Looks feature with more of the razor - scarred Mr. J .
Golden / Silver Age Joker Batman # 1 ( 1940 ) While the Joker 's overall facial and body structures have changed since his first appearance in the debut issue of Batman ( the Dark Knight had appeared exclusively in the pages of Detective Comics until then ) , his specific facial features – white skin , ruby red lips and green hair – have remained a trademark of the character , as has his signature purple suit .
Although writer Bill Finger remains officially un-credited for his role in creating Batman ( as well as the Joker and a variety of other iconic Batman villains ) , the story goes that he gave artist Bob Kane a picture of actor Conrad Veidt in the silent film The Man Who Laughs , based on Victor Hugo 's novel , and Kane combined the actor 's pale face and eerie grin with the basic look of a joker playing card .
Thus , the most iconic villain in all of comic book history was born .
It would take years , however , until the Clown Prince of Crime would take on the lankier , awkward body structure that has become standard .
1960 's Television JokerBatman – Episode 5 , Season 1 ( 1966 ) When the Dark Knight was brought to life on ABC 's campy and ridiculously zany Batman television show , starring Adam West ( flabby physique and all ) in the title role , alongside Burt Ward as Robin , it did n't take long for this popular villain to get the small screen treatment .
In the fifth episode of the first season , entitled " The Joker Is Wild , " actor Cesar Romero stepped into the role of the Clown Prince of Crime .
Romero's appearance as the Joker did not differ much from his comic book incarnation at the time , with one strange and rather baffling exception : Romero refused to shave his mustache for the role .
So in each of his eighteen featured episodes , the Joker 's white face paint was applied directly over Romero 's ridiculous facial hair .
I was wondering what Fred meant when he said this on CNN :
Thompson :
We ’re going to be getting in , if we get in , and of course we ’re testing the waters phase , legality .
We ’re going to make a statement shortly that ’ll cure all of that , but yes , we ’ll be in traditionally when people get in .
Lane Hudson files a complaint with the FEC .
Fred Thompson is breaking the law and it's time somebody did something about it .
So , this morning , I filed an FEC Complaint against him .
For far too long , he has been ignoring the letter and spirit of Federal Election Law for his own political benefit .
It reeks of the same disregard for the law that we have seen from the Bush Administration , Bob Ney , Duke Cunningham , Tom Delay , and Mark Foley .
It is my contention that he has violated the ' testing the waters ' exemption of election law .
He has been presenting himself as a candidate for President , he has been raising large sums of money beyond what would be required to explore a possible candidacy , and he has signed a long term lease on a headquarters for his campaign .
He has even spent advertising dollars , which are specifically prohibited by the law ... read on
Jake Tapper does a good job on his post at the Political Punch giving more background on why the complaint is valid .

_ 犬が自分を掻く→寝て るZinniaさんに近づく→ヒゲが接触した瞬間に静電気がスパーク→驚いて離れる→自分を掻く→以下ループ
_
なんでこんな子がいいと思ったんだろうねえ(笑)
あるとしたら同情だね(笑)
こんな汚ならしい髪の毛して(笑)
ちゃんと貯金しとかないと嫌われるわよ!(笑)
_ 羽生さんがすごいなと最初に思ったのは 、TV番組で海外までチェスの大会に出ていると知ったときだったか。チェスの腕前も相当らしく、強豪たちとの対決や交流の中で、将棋に限らず勝負事の視野を広げてゆこうとする態度がすごいと思った。
その後、羽生さんの発言等を注意して見るようになって、表現の的確性と、結果に裏打ちされた迫力というのを感じてなおさらすごいと思うようになった。
_ ここに書かれていることも、文章だけ拾ってしまえば、サンプル数１の、私はこう考えていますといった意見の集まりにすぎないわけだけど、
やはりその結果に裏打ちされた、という部分が大きいと思う。
まったく逆の、本当にサンプル数１かよ、というような本を同時進行で読んでいるので、そっちは別の機会に
_ ３人との対談をまとめたものだが、前置きなしでいきなり対談に入ってしまうので、
３人のインタビュアーが羽生さんの魅力を引き出すというものなのか、それともその逆なのか、あとがきを見るまでわからないままだったというのが残念だった。
前者だとすれば羽生さんをエサにして自説をふりかざしているだけの人がいたり、前置きなしで「羽生くん」と、くん付けで呼ぶ人がいたりでインタビューの形になってないので最悪だと思う。まあ正解は後者だったみたいなので濡れ衣だけど
_ 「決断力」で書かれていたところはほぼ余すところなく本書で羽生さんの発言として出ているし、この本でのやりとりも「決断力」のほうに拾われているので、
読みやすいと思うほうを読めばいいと思う。
それにしても見れば見るほど羽生さんはitojunさんに似ているなあと思った
_ 面白かったけど 。
_ 小説的な表現が随所に挿入されていて、残念ながらそれが興味をそそるというよりは、テンポを乱す邪魔な文章に感じられてしまった。 直後に出てくる問題への比喩だったり、導入部分であったりということは読み進めればすぐにわかるんだが、なんというか、一本の道筋に沿ってすんなりと入ってくるという風に受け取ることができなかった。
_ 作者のことを知らなくて、また作者自身にさほど興味を抱いていないまま読み進めてきたというハンデもあったと思う。 科学系の読み物として以前立花隆を読み漁ったことがあって、あの人と似ている部分があるような気もするんだけど、立花隆の場合は、 事実と、それに対する推論や感想、願望などというのはきちんと区別されていて自明だった。実際に研究にあたっている当人じゃないから当然なんだけど、まさにその「実際に研究にあたっている当人」という点が、本書の場合はかえって読みづらくする原因だったと思う。
もちろん立花隆が描いている事実が正確性を謙虚に追求した結果であるものなのかはわからないけど、それは読み手の努力が足りなければ誰が書いたものであっても同じと言えるが
_ 表題のテーマに対して示してきたものについては大変興味深かった。ので、全体としては面白かったと思っている。
_ ここ数冊読んできた本では「直感」の重要性について書かれていたのだが、本書では否定的に直感を扱っていた。まあ、対象としている世界があまりに未知のものが多すぎて、感じ取ったり想像することすら不可能という場合には直感は邪魔でしかない、ということなのだと思う
_ 蛇足だが、帯に推薦文を書いている4人（よしもとばなな、最相葉月、茂木健一郎、内田樹）が、この本のどこを読んでそういう感想を持ったのかまったく想像できなかった
_ そろそろ帰還しようと思ったら母がついてって部屋の掃除すると言い出した。
「 券持ってるから」って残り1500円分くらいのパスネットを見せられて 先行きが不安になる。
_ 衣笠からグリーン車に乗りこんだ。手持ちのイオ ンSUICA を使ってもらうことにした。 ほんとは本人以 外NGなのかもしれない
_
母 「最近の電車はもう乗れないわ、複雑すぎて...」
Ｚ「 SUICAにすればいいじゃん、バスも電車もタッチするだけだし」
母 「嫌だよ、年に何回も乗るわけじゃないのに」
_ 鎌倉でグリーン車にもけっこう人が乗りこんできた。日頃の見苦しい振舞いを 初詣の一瞬でリセットできると都合よく思っているに違いない屑虫のような 人達はせめて自宅で一生ひきこもってほしいなあ、なんて年始早々屑思考を発揮 しながら移 動
_ 錦糸町で乗り換えてひきつづきイオ ンSUICA 返却攻撃をかわしつつ押上まで移動。
_
母 「 これ、いるの？ 」
Ｚ「『いるの？』って言いながらゴミ袋に入れてるよね...人の物勝手に捨てないでよ」
母 「じゃあ拾えばいいじゃない 」
Ｚ 「…… 」
母 「 なあにこれ 」
Ｚ 「ああそれはｘｘｘ( 説明してる ) 」
母 「( 聞いてない ) 」
母 「 ( 1分後 ) なあにこれ 」
Ｚ 「ああそれはｘｘｘ( 説明してる ) 」
母 「( 聞いてない ) 」
母 「 ( 1分後 ) なあにこれ 」
Ｚ 「…… 」
_ 外食をさんざん渋った末( 持ってきたからいい、お前だけ行け、等々 ) 、
やっと連れて出た。スカイラークで夕食。
母 「ええと ...『ご飯味噌汁セット』...っていうの？」
Ｚ 「 メインなしかよ ...『とんかつのご飯味噌汁セット』だよね...」
_
母 「 なあにあれ 」
Ｚ 「(またか ) ああ、あれはエアコンのフィルタの掃除が必要だっていうランプだよ」
母 「さっき掃除してたじゃない 」
Ｚ「掃除したあとなんか操作しないとだめなんだけど操作忘れちゃった」
母 「ちゃんとしなさいよ 、( 電気代が ) もったいない 」
Ｚ 「( LED1つじゃん ) ……」
_
Ｚ 「朝飯喰いに行かない？ 」
母 「 いいよ、持ってきたから 」
Ｚ 「レトルトのお粥 ...ね...じゃあおかず買ってくるわ 」
母 「いいのに ...あ、ついでにバケツ買ってきて 」
Ｚ 「…… 」
Ｚ「買ってきたよ 」
母 「 ありがと 」
Ｚ 「…… 」
母 「…… 」
Ｚ 「 ……食べないの？ 」
母 「 うん、いらない 」
Ｚ 「…… 」
_ その後も昨日と似たようなやりとりで物を沢山捨てられたりしたが、 マヨマグロの例を引くまでもなく、通じない相手に腹を立てるのは損だということに 気付いて何も思わなくなった 。
_ じゃあ自分で掃除すればいいじゃないか、32のエロオヤジにもなって情けない、
という非常にもっともな意見もあると思うのだが、その意見には大きな穴があって、 それは
本人が認める綺麗さでなければ綺麗になったことにならない
本人が認める綺麗さは実際に本人が目で見なければ分からない
_ 母は14時前に帰還。部屋に戻って広さに驚いた。あんなに散らかっていた
モノたちはいったい何処へ行ったのだろうと不思議になるくらいスペースがある
( ヒント : ゴミ袋 ) 。水まわりもピカピカになった。
以前試みに買ってみたお酢成分入りのスプレーの効果がすごくて気に入っていた。 みなさんもぜひ

(' A` ) : カーチャン、部屋が綺麗になった よ
(' A` ) : ………
(' A` ) : カーチャン、必要なものがどこにあるのか全然分からないよ...
_ そのほか :
母 「最近はまわりの子たちもみんな『できてから結婚』ばっかりでね」
Ｚ 「『できちゃった結婚』でしょ ...」
母 「最近そういうの流行りなのかしらねー。お前はどうなのよ」
Ｚ「できればそういうのはしたくないと思うけど...母さんはどう思うの」
母 「そんなこと気にしてたらお嫁さん来ないんじゃない？あんた考えかた古いねー」
Ｚ 「…… 」
_ まーたこいつらは使ってもいないくせに口論ばっかりして...と読みもしないのに 決めつけてスルーする屑人間ぶりを発揮していたのだが...
_ TortoiseHG !?!?!?!
知らなかった。。。。あとはVisual Studioから使えればすてきですね
_ たのしいおしごとがまたはじまります よ
_ それはそれとして、なんか先日の記述が初詣批判チックになっていることに 気付き今になっておののいているところだ。たまたまグリ〜ン車に乗り込んだ 客の傍若無人な振舞いに憤ったというだけなのだが、覆水盆に帰らず。
Zinniaさんもお盆にあんまり実家帰ったことないね...( 古いネタだ )
_ そういえばせっかくいいモニタ買ったのにゲームといったら beatmaniaくらいで勿体ないなあと思った。シュ〜ティングとかどうだろう？ と思って、せっかくワイドスクリーンなので横スクロ〜ルがいいかなと検索してみたところ、
グラディウスV
ファンタジーゾー ン
超兄貴
サンダークロ ス
ラビオレプ ス
SDI ( USB マウス使うんだってさ! すげー )
R-TYPE FINAL
_ シュ〜ティングは下手なので( シュ〜ティングに限らないけど ) 、
そんなに難しくないモ〜ドがありつつ、段階を追ってうまくなってゆけるようなのが
いいなと思う。おすすめを教えてください(語りかけ)
_ 「 演算子の種類」あたりを読んでいると嫌がらせとしか思えないんだが
合理的な理由があるんだろうな...
ペダルを逆に回さないといけない自転車とか
_ そういえ ばZinniaさんはいい大人なのでゲーム機とか自分で買ってもいいんだった。 最近のはすごいね !
PSP とかDS とか! ( 時代遅れの反応 )
_ DSのほうがおもしろそうなゲームは多いけ どPSP はなんといっても あの海腹川背が出るというのが見逃せないわけだが 旬ベースというのはちょっとな 、SFC 版でよかったのに
_ そうそう、せっか くFOMA の携帯電話があるんだからiアプリくらい かじってみたいね、と思ってamazonで見てみたら古い本ばっかりで、、 もう廃れてしまったのかしら。と思った 。
_ 土曜 : 体調崩して寝て過ごした。頭痛若干と吐き気と寒気とダルさがあった。
_ 抱負とか書いてなかったのでひねり出そうと思う
_ まずなんだろう、本を出したい。と実現するあてもないけど思った。 自分で書いて自分で発行、未来型の出版スタイル( 同人誌)という手もあるが そもそ もPDFで終わりという気もする。そもそも何を書くんだろう
_ ここ数年口ばっかり度が増える一方なのでそれに歯止めをかけるためにも 仕事以外のことをいろいろ頑張りたいところだねえ。そのくせ執筆とか 現実味のないこと書いてるんだから世話ないけど
_ うーん筆が乗らないので機会を改めてまた書くかも
_ adasさんちから。 先月も書いたけど銀河一うまい豆腐かけご飯のレシピもあるよ!
_ たのしい1週間がはじまりました。zrysmしてやろうと思って アラームセットしないで寝て目が覚めたらいつもアラームで無理矢理起きている
時刻だったのでうんざりして出社
_ iPodのちょうしもわるくなった 。Bluetoothで音楽聞けない。 端子が悪いのか？それかドングルのほうかもしれない。 どっちが悪いのかを調べるには両方買いなおしてみるという手もありますね。 ない か
_ 購入当初からしばらく使ってみたり、 昨日になっていろいろ試してみて判明したことなどをまとめてみる :
起動にえらい時間がかかる→曲数多いと遅くなるみたい。少なくしたら 一瞬で起動した。
メールが来たりアラームが鳴ったりすると 再生が止まるんだが、復帰するまでにかかる時間も↑と同じみたいだ。
毎回スキャンしてるってことか。なんかへぼい気がするなあ
曲リスト間の移動とかにかかる時間は曲数にはあまり関係ない気がする
iアプリと同時には動かないらしい。メール読みながらとかなら 問題ないんだけど
そのくせメール送信するときは演奏が途切れないので謎
トラック情報なくなっちゃう →AACへの変換のときになくなっちゃうみたいだ
同じアルバムなのにエントリがたくさんできちゃう→原因不明だけどSD Jukeboxのリストを見る限りでは普通なのでこれもAACの変換のときにこまったことになっている気がする
SD Jukebox で転送したいファイルをチェックするとあほみたいに 待たされるが、これは曲数とは関係ないみたい
_ 一方SD Jukebox の方はまともな精神状態の技術者が作ったとは思えないような、 理解に苦しむ動作が多い気がする。 AAC への変換が自力でできれば( できるのか知らないけど ... iTunesでできたかも ) 、
SD Jukebox は転送用と割切って使えるし、それかなんか特定のR/W使えば 転送できるらしいので、それを使うという手もあるか
_ と思ったらiTunesのm4aファイルでは だめらしい。 WMP 経由というのを試してみるか？でも連続再生時間が減るらしい。
_ ホットサンド焼くや つ( 直火のやつ ) 欲しいなあと思っていたところだったので 興味深い 。
_ 直火のやつって、う ちIHじゃねえか
_ 家帰ってから寝るまでの少ない時間 でVistaマシンいじっているんだが なにしろあのファイル操作が終わらない件が残っていて非常にストレスが溜まる
残り時間を計算しています ... の窓が閉じない
削除とかの操作そのものは完了している。ただExplorerが↑の状態のまま
ファイルやフォルダ作ったり、名前変えたり、消したりすると100%発生
iTunesで曲を消すときに 「ゴミ箱に入れる」をするとiTunesが固まる
インデックスのオプションの画面で情報がいつまでたっても出てこない
_
254 ：名無し~3.EXE：2007/10/05(金) 13:46:33 ID :OlO2 puwp ファイルをコピーや移動しようとすると
「 残り時間を計算しています」から動かなくなる時があるんだけど対処法ないですか？
あと右クリできなくなったりとか…これは起動中のjaneとか切ると治るんだけど
255 ：名無し~3.EXE：2007/10/05(金)
14:12:35 ID :Nf9Iyp3c >>254 メモリ増設 CPUをデュアルコア に 256 ：名無し~3.EXE：2007/10/05(金)
15:26:56 ID:OlO2 puwp >>255 メモリ3GでCPUもデュアルなんですよ〜
_ IRCのログを使うのがいいんだろうけど、そうなると著作権的にどうなのかなあ
という別のむずかしい問題が生まれるような気がする。
全員に同意をとるのは大変だし、 Zinniaさんみたいに血圧の数値をハンドルにしてるような阿呆だと同一人物の特定も大変だ
_ コメントにあるように無脳を鍛えるためのチャンネルとかで鍛えるのがいいのかしら。
_ IRC のログで教育した無脳に教育させることでクリアできるかと 思ったがまあ無理か
_ コーチングの記事等で推薦されることが多い本。
_ この本では、自分自身の中にあるものをセル
フ1、セルフ2と分けていて、 セルフ1と呼ばれているものはセルフ2と呼ばれているものの能力を
阻害する方向に働くので、セルフ1の動きを抑制することで本来のすばらしい
パフォーマンスが発揮できる、という立場をとっている。
_ セルフ1とセルフ2の中身はネタバレ？になるので明記は控えるが、
冒頭にこの立場の表明をされてから注目したのは、じゃあそのセルフ1と 呼ばれているものの役割(役に立つような)って何なんだ？という点なのだが、
結局のところ、最後までセルフ1については害の部分しか指摘されていなかった。
_ この本で扱っているのはテニスに関することなのだが、普段の生活に あてはまるか？と考えたところ ...うーんとても難しいような気がする。 スポーツのパフォーマンスを発揮するための集中力というものと、 普段の生活に関するものとはなんか違う気がする。んだけど。
_ ただ、ここに書かれていることを実践するためにスポーツやってみたいな、 という気にはなった 。
_ なんで買ったのかを覚えてないくらいなのだが、思ったより 面白かった 。
_ 読み始めは、論理にひっかかりを覚えたり、 段落ごと に [ 要出典 ] とか補って読むような ( 途中「ニュースソースにあたる癖をつけよう」といったことが書かれている
あたりで噴き出したり)不遜な態度だったが、
提示されていることはけっこう合理的だったと思う。
他のライフハック(笑) 本たちよりはよっぽどよかった。
_ 寝る前にアラーム2つがセットされていることを確認したのは覚えているんだが、
アラームを止めた記憶がまったくないまま遅刻した
_ 荷物が2つ来る予定だったのだが宅配ボックスに入れずに持ち帰ってくれたので
入手できなかった。憤概する。が、さきほど電話がかかってきて
でかすぎて宅配ボックスに入らなかったらしいと知った。
_ 寝る前にiアプリの本 を3冊流し読みした。読む前からiアプリって ゲーム多いけどゲームくらいしか作れないんじゃないのかという気がしていたんだが、 そう間違ってもいないような。。 。GPS の情報とれないのは残念極まりない
_ 口内炎がベストポジションを占めているので何喰っても飲んでも痛い
_ 臼井に来て何度目か知らないがまたグループ分けの話。 毎度そうなんだ がZinniaさんはいかなるグループにも属さないらしい。
_ 臼井にいなくていいんじゃね？お れ
_ と、毎回思うんだがどうか 。
_ 高校の修学旅行のとき、旅館の大広間で晩飯を喰うことになっていたのだが、 一人分の食事が乗るくらいの大きさのお膳があるじゃないですか、 あれが人数分並んでいて、一番端に座ったところ、後から来た友人が
Zinniaさんのお膳の向かいに座って、それを見た友達が次々と
1お膳2人ペアで座りだして、結局お膳が半分余ったという ハプニングがあった。グループ分けの話とは一切関係ないが
_ できるたびに鏡見 て 「 うわーできてるー」などというようなアクションを
起こすような生き方は20年くらい前に卒業してしまったので、
なかなか直らない口内炎だと思って見てみたらものすごく巨大だったことに驚いた。
_ 東京事務所のメンバーと久しぶりに飲んだ。東京事務所を去って1年半、 別々の道を歩んできたねえということを改めて確認させられる。見てきたもの、 見ているもの、今見えていること、が、全部ずれているのが興味深い。 どっちが正しいとかではなく、こういう情報はとても新鮮に感じられるので、 今後もたまに実施できたらいいなと思った 。
_ ペルノー初めて飲んだ。これ、香草の匂いに似てると思うんだけど...おいしいが他の 食べ物の味がまったく分からなくなった。 あと、ラフロイグとかボウモアとか普段飲まないようなものを たくさん飲んだけど全部おいしかった 。
_ 副題がピンと来なかった。内容は面白かったんだけど、
「 思考実験」の内容がいまひとつボリューム不足だと思った。
小学校の教科書とかにある(あったと思う ) 「
考えてみましょう」などと書かれつつ 枠つきになっている文章とか、そういった雰囲気を感じる程度だった。
どうせなら徹底的に自分が猫だった場合の思考実験をするとかの方が よかったように思う。
_ あと、説明がこれで十分なのかとか、分かりやすいのかといった疑問は残る。 大抵のことは知ってたか聞きかじっていたかしたので、自分自身は さほど戸惑うことはなかったけど、この辺の話に明るくない人が読んで 理解できる説明ではないように見え る
_ そういえばたねき ちBBS ( どこだよ ) で 局長さんの結婚報告があってびっくりした。11月の報告に今になって びっくりするところが二度目のびっくりだが...おめでとう
_ 関西オフやりますよー ＼( ＾o＾ ) ／
_ 「銀河」なくなっちゃうし乗っておきたい気もするねえ
_ 会社に泊まってめし喰いに外出たら奇声を上げている子供が...と思ったら 若者だった。 その後、めしを喰ってたらジャスコのエスカレータから突飛な服装をした 若者が断続的に降りてきたのでどうも成人式らしいと知った
_ 壮大な映像の連続と、どうやって音合わせてんだ？コレ、といったあたりが 萌えポイントなんだと思うけど。劇場で見ればでかいスクリーンと音量で 楽しめるし、テレビだとだらだらおしゃべりながら見られるという 甲乙つけがたいメリットがあると思 う
_ メッセージ性が強い点が、壮大さを小道具にしている風が感じられて鼻についたか。
WATARIDORI とか見たくなった。 「 野生の王国」とか恋しくなるね...
ディスカバリーチャンネルの映像も使ってたとは知らなかった。
ああいうお金のかかるドキュメンタリーはもう無理なのかな。
_ カウンターに出した尿ならびに便につい
て1分ほど放置されるプレイを受けた。
_ 検査終わってからそれではうんこみるくを排出しようかと思い、 でりゅううううんこみるくでりゅのおおぉぉぉと思いながら しかし表情はクールなま まSimon and Garfunkel等を歌いつつトイレに 入ってみた ら
_ ドアを開きっぱなしにして用(大 ) を足している人を発見し度肝を抜かれた。
即退散。驚愕のあまりそのままうんこみるく漏らしてしまえば素敵だったのかも
しれないが驚きすぎてそれどころではなかった
_ 変態と思われそうなので念の為に書くとバリウムのつもりだよ!
書いても変態なのは変わらないか。
_ 主張や見解が羽生さんと重なる部分がかなりあると思うが
「 ライバルとしての羽生さん」という部分について書ける数少ない人だ。
こればっかりは羽生さんにも書けない。はっきりと「嫉妬」の感情について 書かれている点がすごい。
_ プロとしての将棋という点について羽生さんよりもシビアに捕えている( のか、 強調なのか ) を感じた 。
= 「 お金は銀行に預けるな 金融リテラシーの基本と実践 」勝間 和代
_ 投資についての本であり銀行の経営状況とか体質とかの話ではない。 勘違いしてた。サブタイトル見てなかったのかもしれない。 先日読んだ本にもある程度書かれていた内容だが、 預金以外の金融商品について興味を持って実践しましょうというもの
_ 今まで興味を持ったことがなく、結果として正確とはとても言えない( けど、 興味がないから修正の必要性も感じない ) 知識しか持っていない分野の話だったのだが、 とても面白かった。さらっと読んだ限りでは理屈は通っているし、と思うので しばらくこの方面の本を読み続けてみる予定 だ
_ 寝るの遅くなって眠 い
_ いろいろ出たようなのでひととおり眺めてみ た
= MacBook Air
_ ちんぽみるく出しながら待ってたので出た瞬間に買う!と
昨日までは思っていたのだが、情報眺めてみてうーん見送りかな...と思うように
_ MacBookはキーボードが打っていて楽しく感じられないタッチだった、というのが
とても大きな不満の1つなのだが、それとよく似たキーボードに見える点が1つ、 それからSSDはオプションでデフォルトはあいかわらずHDDだったり、 パラレルATA 4200rpmだったり、バッテリは外から取り出せなかったり...
_ 他のマシンのドライブを間借りでき るRemote Discという機能があるらしい。 rendezvous とは違うのかしら？今は名前違うんだっけ。どういう 仕組なんだろう 。OS のインストールには使えない ...んだよね？
_ あと、スピーカはモノラルらしい 。DVD ドライブついてないから その手の視聴用としては考えてないということかもしれない
_ そもそも薄すぎて不安、とか、ちょっと高いかなーと思うあたりはさすがに バチあたりすぎる気もする。けどやっぱり頼りない気がするし
SSD とかつけたいと思うと40万近い金額になってしまうので手が出ないよねえ...
= Time Capsule
_ これはいいかも。安いし、楽にバックアップとれるというの はMacらしくて すばらしいと思 う
_ AirMac Extremeベースステーションの役割も持たせてる部分はちょっと複雑な
気分だけど。。個人的には余計かなーと思ったんだけど、
Mac1〜2台とこの機械でネットワークはOKというコンセプトだろうから しょうがないのか。
_ Apple TVはいいかな ... Mac Miniが出なかったよう だ( T^T )
_ 海外から原稿を送っていた新聞の連載のひとつはこれなのかな。 少しずつ読んでいたので時間がかかった。帰りの電車では読めない。 同じ理由で空腹時にも読めな い
_ 役に立って、面白い、楽しくなるよい本だ。奥さんが旦那を驚かせる云々的な 記述は今では書けないだろうなーと思ったりもしたが、そういうことを 書きつつ料理している著者自身が男というのが不思議なバランスだと思う。
_ 大抵のものはこだわらず、あるもので間に合わせるという感じだが、 ものによっては譲れないというのもあるみたいで、その辺の区別が なかなかわかりにくい。これは、当時の食材の流通事情がよくわからないとか、 そもそも読み手が料理にあまり明るくない、というあたりも影響しているとは思う。
_ 時代としては麻婆豆腐が珍しい料理として紹介されている頃だ。 でもそれが昭 和40 年代というのはちょっとした驚きだった。
_ 新しいのが来た。今のやつは今月有効期限切れちゃうことに気付いた。 ずいぶんギリギリになって送ってくるんだね...
_ 次の有効期限切れは6年後らしい。当時5万だか10万だかの与信枠も気付けば 80万に...
_ 臼井に来たら雪だった 。
= 無理なく続けられる 年 収10 倍 アップ時間投資 法
_ 役に立ったし合理的という点は前著と変わらない。 時間が最も希少な資源なのでシビアに評価、という点も実にもっともだと思った。
_ その上で、自分で消化できる範囲で実践すればいい( というニュアンスの ことを著者も書いていたが ) と思う。という前提で、 どうもこの生き方は人としての魅力に欠けるんじゃないかなーという 気がしてならないんだな。 それは著者のように子育てしながら学校行きながら という人に比べて、自由にできるはずの時間が本当はいっぱいある 人間の傲りなのかもしれないが 。
_ あと、子供のことは書いてあるけど夫のことはまったく書いてないな、 と思っていたが離婚2回で現在結婚はしていないらしいと後で知った。
不健全な思考かもしれないが、その辺のことを語っている部分があって
バランスがとれるんじゃないかなーという気がした。
_ 周囲の反応見てみると自分も含めてだいたいこんなところかなあという気がする。
Airじゃなく てMacBook Proが欲しかったんだと。
_ NEXS に言われてもねえ ...と冷やかし半分で読んでみたが：

レビ番組「プロジェクトX」の世界が普通にあったのだ。 ( 引用終わり )
_ 同じように土建業界と比較しての感覚として、といいつつもぜんぜんそちらの 業界に明るくないんだが、あちらの業界ではたとえば予算や期間の超過なんかが 発生すればそれはけっこう大きな事件になるのではないかと理解しているし、 ひるがえってソフトウエア業界は遅れや超過どころか完成しないなんていう 話もあるし、罰符だの訴訟だのという話は周囲にゴロゴロしている印象がある。
_ うーん、でも巨大建造物が予算足りなくて中止になった、という話もあるみたいだな。 あれの要素が費用使いすぎなのかどうかは分からないけど。。。
_ で、個人的にはそういった理解を元 に
ＩＴ業界(笑) は土建業界よりもプロジェクト遂行の能力が未熟
ＩＴ業界が生まれてからまだ半世紀くらいだし、 内容( 質・量)もどんどん変わっているので手法が確立していない
キャリアのスタートから定年までをＩＴ業界で終えた人はまだいないような 気がする。

_ そうそうファイル操作が終わらない問題だが、 インデックスのサービスを止めたところ解決した。 ちゃんとした止めかたを理解できていなかったので、止めたつもりで 止まっていなかったらしい。結局のところ 、Windows Searchという サービスを止める( 無効にする ) ことで解決した。 iTunesとかゴミ箱とか

_ パスネットが出たの は2000 年らしいので、その頃米沢にい たZinniaさんは 存在自体を知らなかった 。Suicaはニュースでさんざん見てたから知ってたけど。
初めて見たときはなんじゃこのカードは、という感じだったし、
パスネット=地下鉄というイメージだったので京成乗るときは知らずに切符買ってたし、
そもそも地下鉄をほとんど利用したことがなかったので...。
山手線が止まると途方に暮れるタイプだった。
あと、どこの駅だか忘れたが都営と営団の乗換のときにいろんな改札を通った結果
切符が手元に残らなかった(けどまだホームにいる)という状態になって 以来トラウマがあった。
_ 今朝は東京事務所出勤で、丸の内線使ったんだが 、

_ 臼井に移動した。別に東京でも仕事はできるんだがあまりに眠かったので 電車で移動しながら寝るパターンを採用。アホ社員。長く仕事するとなると 東京のマシンのキーボードだと効率悪いし( ナイスフォロー)
_ 寝て移動したかったのでエアポ〜ト快特に乗り換えた。 たぶん新宿線の急行を使ったほうが早いんだろうけど、 京成の快速に乗り継ぐには全力疾走に近い状態で走らないと間に合わないんだよな
_ 実際に対応に当たる際の苦労には同情するが、 何年何十年も稼働してきたプログラム をCOBOL で書かれているからという 理由だけで負の遺産と呼ぶなんて正気とは思えない。
_ テム・レイが書くようなプログラムこそ負の遺産にふさわしい
_ で、原文を見てみると 「 Application Modernization ?
What are we going to do with 200 billion Lines of Cobol ? 」なので 負の遺産などとはどこにも書かれていないね。
ざっと眺めた限りでは、本文のほうにもそういう記述は ないように見える( もちろん歓迎しているわけではないだろうが )

ビジネスでも日常生活でも、ある人の発言を聞いて、感情的に「何かおかしいゾ」と思
うときがあれば、その発言は論理的ではないと思って間違いありません。このときの「ど
こかヘンだぞ」という人間の直感は意外に正しいのです。
_ で、この本を読んで 「 何か変じゃないか、これ 」と思ったのは 一度や二度ではなかった。この理屈( 発言じゃなくて記述だけどさ ) を 利用すればこの本は論理的ではないということになる。
まあ、誰かの発言は論理的ではないということを思うのは自由だけど、
それを表現する以上は「何かヘンだと思ったから」というわけにはいかないだろうし、

_ 流し〜現職で最初に関わった案件、つまりこの会社に入る決心をした大きな理由となる 案件があっ た( 今はもうない ) んだけど、そこで使われているデータベースが、 社内独自開発のものだった。社内独自と言えば聞こえはいいけど、 要は( これま たZHT でよく登場する ) テム・レイがリハビリと称して作った ガラクタだった 。
_
「 現在主流のRDBが限界に近付いているから 」 「 RDBを使えばデータを効率よく管理できるが、大量のデータを自由かつ高速検索
できるようにするには、膨大なコストと手間がかかるといった短所もある」
_ この記事の製品は、結果として顧客の満足につながったようなので、それはそれで よかったのかもしれない。ファイル名を使うというのはネタとしてなら 面白いし。以下は記事とは無関係の話になるので注意。 面白くないし長いので真面目に読まなくていいです
_ 私が関わったその独自データベースは、 でかいファイ ル を1つ作ります→それを区分けして連番をつけます→区分けした中に データを入れます、という思想( と呼べるのか？ ) と、それにアクセスするための
XMLデータで構成されていて、連番でのアクセスは一瞬でできるなどと
喜んで負荷テスト等を行っていたが、そりゃあ区分けのサイズがわかれば
位置が算出できるんだから当たり前すぎて涙が出てくるという話だが
_ 区分けした領域 に1件ずつデータを入れて、中身はオフセットで管理する。 中身のフィールドサイズを少しでも大きくしようなどと思ったら大騒ぎだった。 さすがにキーでひっぱってくるだけでは業務が書けないと思ったのか、 おもちゃみたいな問い合わせ機能があって、 それを記述するにはいちい ちXML を起こさなければいけなかった。 私が引き継いだ直後はそん なXML が大量に散らばっていて収拾がつかない状態だった。
_ 結果として1000 件のデータから必要な条件に合うデータをひっぱってくるだけで
1 分以上かかり絶句した。
_ そんな境遇でシステムを組まなきゃいけなかった人達への感情と、 ガラクタとしか言いようがないものを押しつけている人間への感情を抑えきれずに 問題解決のために正社員としての入社を決意した。今にして思えば あの独自開 発DBとやらがなければこの会社に入ることもなかったのかもしれないし、 この会社やばくね？／可哀想な人達だなーと思って去る方を選んでいれば 私の人生もいろいろ変わっていたように思うんだが
_ どう考え て も1から作り直したほうが早そうだったのだが、 残念ながら納期までの期間がとっくにマイナスだった。 私がするべき仕事は、まず現状の作りで業務を書きあげることと、 水面下 でRDB への置き換えをすることだった。 XML の数も爆発していたので、ライブラリ側で都度生成するように修正した。
RDB化の際も、そのライブラリでXMLを作ってる部分をSQLに変更することで 解決させたりした。本当ならちゃんとデザインしたかったんだけど
_ そんなふうにRDB 化した結果、少しはメンテも楽になって、 スピードももちろん上がって( もしよかったら独 自DBの開発の動機を思い出して ほしいのだが ) 、客先の要望にも多少は余裕を持ってあたることができるように なった( 文字数増やしたいと言われただけでパニックになるのと比べれば当然だが ) 。
そんな状況も含めて、その独 自DBを作った当人が成功プロジェクトのように 自他に語り出しているのを見て本当に憤懣が溜まった。 これがその当時の記述 ね
_ 現在はこの独 自DBは跡形もない( 引き継いだソースも捨てた ) が、 製作者本人は未だに自分の作ったシステムが優れていて、 利用者( つまり私や私の前任 ) がそれを正しく使っていなかったから
RDB 化をするような選択になってしまったと思っている節がある。
_ ガンダムに出てきたテム・レイのガラクタは実際には役に立たないからこそ、 コミカルで、空しくて、物哀しいのだと思う。似ているようでその点が 全く違う 。
_ 昨日もテム・レイが作りかけた別のシステムがトラブルを起こしていたらしい。 私自身も今いじっているのはそういうガラクタなので、 次は自分に来るのかもしれないと思うとやりきれない思いだ。
_ 作りかけの状態で部下にひきついで、次のガラクタ製作を始めるため、 現在起きている問題は次のようなものがある ：
最後まで作り上げないため、実装/設計上の問題に気付かない。そのため、
同じ問題を繰返し生産する。問題を修正するのはいつも他人なので、 フィードバックされない
ある程度の形になるまでは作り上げるため、受ける側としては
全部捨てるか、そのまま使うかの二択を迫られる。前者は
時間的にムリだったり、バレて問題になったりする。
新しいものを作る/作らなきゃいけない時に先に手をつけられてしまうので、
技術の現場の人間は結局テム・レイをメインとした他人のコードの
面倒を見るための部署としてしか役割がなくなっている
そのように提供された物の品質は悪質で、プログラムのメンテのみならず
実運用での負荷も増大している
設計や品質についてのフォローは他人が行っているため、
本人は品質がよいものを量産していると錯覚している
_ 実際、システム部に物を作る能力が欠けているというのは事実だし、 様々な要因でしたくてもできない状態になるのは確かなんだけど、 システム作ってる会社のシステム部の人間がシステム作れないというのは つまり何なんだろうという気が最近とてもしている。老人連中やテム・レイは こんな会社が作りたくて人員の半分をシステム部に配属させて、 毎年何千万もコストかけて飼ってるのかなーと思うととても非効率な 気がする。どっかからソフト買ってきて売ったほうがいいんじゃないのかと 思う 。
_ といったところが最近の戦線です。書いてて情けなくなるくらいレベル低いですね。 人との問題だけでも持て余しているのに、構造的な欠陥まで 全部を見事に解決させるには一体どうしたらいいんだろうと思うと夜もぐっすり眠れてしまう。
_ まあ、そういった問題を見ぬふりして生きて行くのは嫌なので、 今年は価値を問う年になるのかなーという気がしている。
_ 当時の記述を読み返してみた。 書いた内容、照会した内容をいちいち疑わなければいけなかった苦しみを 他人に負わせてはいけないと強く思った 。
_ うちのirclogは当日と前日分をtoday.log , yesterday.logというリンクで 見られるようになっていて、それはAM
0:00にcronで張り直すようになっているんだが、 ここ数ヶ月それがうまく動いていなかった。
_ スクリプトを手で動かすとちゃんと張り直されるので、なんでうまく 動かないんだろうなあと思いつつ、毎日いちいち手で動かしていたんだが、 なんのことはない、cronが落ちていただけだったらしい。 そんなことに数ヶ月も気付かないでいるとは異常だなと思った。
_ な、なんだって ...絶句。

_ ASSA の電気がつかなくなってしまい、 もう電球切れか よFUCK と思い電球を買ってきたんだが回復しなかった。 試しにその電球を別のスタンドに挿してみたら問題なくついた( 先に試せ)

と思いその電球を別のスタンドに持っていったらちゃんとついた。

今の能力でできることをすぐにやる、ということに熱心な例は意外と少ないような 気がしている。
_ 成長してよりよい仕事をしてゆくことを繰返して行って、 能力の資産みたいなやつが増えてゆかないと、 早い時期に頑張るメリットがないということになってしまうのではないかなと思うので、 経験を無駄にしないためには、起こっていること( 主に失敗 ) を漏らさないようにする ことが大事だと思う。しっかり記録に残すとか。 少なくとも、同じ失敗を繰返している人間に向けられる視線は確実に1ランク落ちるし、 元のランクを取り戻すのは、もともとのランクを維持するよりもずっと難しい。

Forums are a great resource , and there seems to exist at least one for every subject imaginable ( yes , really ) .
This being the web , there are of course bound to be a lot of forums that focus on webmasters and web hosting .
It is n’t always easy to keep a forum running smoothly .
Forum software is notoriously resource heavy , and as forums grow , they can take a significant toll on the server they are hosted on .
Since few people are as concerned with uptime and website performance as webmasters , we figured we would monitor the forums where the webmasters themselves hang out .
Why care about uptime , you ask ?
The short answer is :
If a website is down it is invisible , both to visitors and search engines .
Ok , enough talking .
Here they are , 20 of the top webmaster and hosting forums and their uptime , response time , and as a bonus , an link to an uptime report page that is being continuously updated .
The table is sorted by uptime .
Entries with the same uptime were sorted by response time .
The response times we are showing here include the load time of the HTML page ( but no images or other resources ) , so perhaps we should have called it load time instead of response time .
On the other hand , loading the HTML is only a small part of the page , so that would also have been a misnomer .
Whatever you call it , it does n’t tell the whole picture of how fast the entire site loads , BUT it does gives you a general idea of how responsive the site and the server is .
A note on response time
The response time numbers shown here are average values over many days ( in this case just over 15 days ) .
What that does n’t show you is the great variation that can be seen over the course of an entire day , or over the course of a week or a month .
There are also bound to be occasional spikes depending on usage ( and possibly other factors , for example backups ) .
Here is a good example , taken from our monitoring of Web Host Chat :
Again , note that this includes the loading of the HTML page .
Check out your favorite forum
As we stated earlier , these forums are a great resource , and we set up this monitoring because we were curious to see how they are performing .
Pingdom is an uptime monitoring service , so we are always curious about these kinds of things .
We only have a few weeks of data so far , but we will let the server uptime monitoring continue , at least for a while , and see what happens .
The public report pages will be up and running , so you can easily follow the uptime of your favorite forum (s ) .
The pages are updated every 5 minutes .
BlueProximity Leave it - it 's locked , come back - it 's back too ...
( not really ) breaking news ...
Active Release : 1.2 - now with Ubuntu package and multilanguage support .
See Download for details .
Nightly Builds are now available too .
See the future coming there , incl . tarball and Ubuntu package ( now includes new functionality ! )
What is it ...
This software helps you add a little more security to your desktop .
It does so by detecting one of your bluetooth devices , most likely your mobile phone , and keeping track of its distance .
If you move away from your computer and the distance is above a certain level ( no measurement in meters is possible ) for a given time , it automatically locks your desktop ( or starts any other shell command you want ) .
Once away your computer awaits its master back - if you are nearer than a given level for a set time your computer unlocks magically without any interaction ( or starts any other shell command you want ) .
You find a selection of links on the left where Installation is the one you should start with .
Screenshots will be included soon .
Help always appreciated ...
I decided to make this a public project as I am a believer in the Open Source Movement and also believe that security software has to be Open Source to a ) be taken serious and b ) being even close to secure .
You are welcome to help me develop further features , mark bugs , fix bugs , ... I make use of sourceforge 's infrastructure for that so you might want to take a look at the sourceforge project site .

GodTube against ' gays ' yet loves ' fags '
by Jeremy Hooper
Wanna see something disgusting ?
Well look at this .
Last night we were tipped off that the GodTube Christian video site was allowing a video that used the word " fag " :
We were surprised , as we thought their technology would automatically edit this word , since we'e tried to use the word " gay " before and have seen it banned .
So as a test , we proceeded to make this comment at the bottom of the above video :
And guess which words got automatically edited and which did not :
Yes , that 's right -- " gay " gets banned as is it a curse word ; " fag " and " dyke " are totally fine !
Clearly SOMEONE had to have inputted the code and made the choice of which words to ban and which to allow .
It 's quite telling what their mind deemed offensive , and what it found kosher ( in the figurative if not the gefilte fish sense ) .
But then again , these are the same folks who listen to queer condemnations with open ears , yet close themselves off to just about anything that comes out of the mouth of an actual gay person .
Perhaps we should be glad they deem us worthy enough to speak at all .
RETURNING TO SODOM [ GodTube ]
** UPDATE : GodTube has deleted all of our comments on this video .
We 've posted this one ; we 're sure it 'll be deleted within minutes :
Technorati Tags : GodTube
Your thoughts
I have run into the same problem with GodTube .
I posted a comment to a video on a street preacher bleating his heart out at a LGBT film festival .
I was n’t vulgar ( at least I thought I was ) but the originator of the video has felt it necessary to remove every one of my posts because I had the nerve to question / confront them on their ( the kindest thing I can say is ) flawed logic .
Posted by : gordon_freeman42 | Dec 14 , 2007 1:09:34 PM
It 's interesting that since I went back yesterday I ’ve found a lot of my comments also removed , not from this video in question but a number of other anti-gay related videos .
Its nothing new but it had seemed for a while that god tube had moved beyond that childish need to control every thought that was added to there site .
I flagged the video as inappropriate but I doubt anything will be done about it .
I remember last year e-mailing god tube about the ridiculous nature of censoring the word gay while so many other derogatory terms were allowed .
The e-mail I got back said they blocked the word gay out in order to avoid " conflict " and hate full commenting .
Because heaven knows fag is a much more appropriate way of having a respectful conversation .
While the tag and video description are disturbing what takes the cake is the users profile .
http://www.godtube.com/uprofile.php?UID=216045
No wonder he thinks fag is an appropriate choice of words .
" The RETURNING TO SODOM & Shiite Muslims Enjoy Satanic Ritual Abuse were BOTH banned by YouTube !!
Strangely , the Sodom one is still up on the original channel on YouTube ( randyvild ) , but when I added it to my channel with his approval it was immediately attacked , fagged ( or is that flagged ? - LOL : ) ) and DELETED by YouTube fag admins . "

Thanks for tipping us off to this , Patrick .
It 's extremely telling the way the far - right detests conversation and dissenting opinions .
' One News Now ' is another one who will often delete your comments simply because they are pro-gay .
And of course few of the opposition 's sites and blogs even allow for commenting at all .

China 's .cn domain is becomingly increasingly popular
Governments and companies can now register interest in specific domain names , such as www.namehere.asia.
Companies will be able to register domains for which they own a trademark and governments will get a chance to earmark those on a reserved list .
The general public will get a chance to snap up their own .asia domain when the landrush starts in February 2008 .
Wide reach
Work to create the .asia domain began in 2000 .
The DotAsia Organisation won official approval to set up the domain in mid-October 2006 and the first .asia domains should go live on the internet in March 2008 .
Unlike other administrators of net domains , the DotAsia Registry plans to use an auction to determine who gets domains wanted by more than one organisation .
The highest bidder will win the right to the contested name .
The geographical reach of the .asia domain extends from Australia to the Middle East .
In all , 20 organisations that run country code domains have signed up to back the .asia registry .
The .asia domain is the second regional domain to go live following the European .eu suffix which started selling in April 2006 .
Other regional domains for Africa and Latin America are expected to follow .
Lesley Cowley , chief executive of .uk registry Nominet , said regional domains could prove to be a good option because many nations imposed stringent conditions on anyone wanting to register and use country code addresses .
Ms Cowley expected many of the initial requests for .asia domains to come from companies that need to defend the trademarks they own in the region .
" There is going to be an ever - increasing number of suffixes , " she said .
" Companies need to decide whether they are going to protect their registered marks in each and every one . "
Despite the diversity of languages spoken in Asia , all the domains offered initially will be written using the Latin alphabet which is already used in established generic domains such as .com and country codes such as .uk .
Eventually though domains will be offered in character sets used in Asian nations but the DotAsia Organisation has given no hint about when this will begin .
At the same time that the sunrise period for .asia begins , net address overseer Icann ( The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ) is starting trials of a system that will let net addresses be written in local alphabets .
Icann will trial addresses written in Arabic , Persian , simplified Chinese , traditional Chinese , Russian , Hindi , Greek , Korean , Hebrew , Japanese and Tamil .
There has been a sharp decline in the number of tigers in India
The increasingly endangered animals ' numbers have fallen to 1,411 , down from 3,642 in the last major survey in 2002 .
Wildlife activists blame poaching and urbanisation for the decline and say the authorities must do more .
Last year , federal authorities announced the creation of a special force to protect tigers .
But it is unclear whether it has worked .
The latest census , released on Tuesday , said that there had been a decline in tiger population all over India .
The only exception was the southern state of Tamil Nadu where the animals ' numbers had gone up to 76 from 60 five years ago .
' Time to act '
Counting could not be carried out in the states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand due to law and order problems , the report said .
And the exercise was still going on in Sundarbans in the eastern state of West Bengal , the report added .
Rajesh Gopal of India 's Project Tiger said the census showed that " though the tiger has suffered due to direct poaching , loss of quality habitat and loss of its prey , there is still hope " .
Wildlife experts say urgent efforts should be made to save the animals .
" It is now time to act and save tigers from human beings .
We have to create inviolate areas for tigers and provide modern weapons to forest guards , " conservationist Valmik Thapar told Hindustan Times newspaper .
Experts blame the government for failing to crack down on poachers and the illegal trade in tiger skins .
Tigers are poached for their body parts - skins are prized for fashion and tiger bones are used for oriental medicines .
Tiger pelts can fetch up to $ 12,500 in China .
According to reports , there were 40,000 tigers in India a century ago .
The country is home to 40 % of the world 's tigers , with 23 tiger reserves in 17 states .
Since I first considered doing a blog , I 've envisioned a recurring feature called " Vulgar Libertarianism Watch , " or some such .
At one point , I toyed with the idea of making that the name of the blog , and devoting most of my effort to reporting on the kind of faux " free market " analysis that consists of an apologetic for big business .
But although there would be more than enough such material to keep me blogging indefinitely , I decided such an exclusive focus would be too much of a one - trick pony .
So I 've decided to go with the original impulse , and regularly feature " Vulgar Libertarianism Watch " without making it the main focus of the blog .
And what better way to kick things off than with the first installment of this feature ?
First , a note on what vulgar libertarianism is .
The term , coined as far as I know by yours truly , alludes both to the " vulgar Marxism " of twentieth century Marxoids , and to what Marx called the " vulgar political economy " of the generation after Ricardo and Mill .
The defining feature of vulgar political economy , as Marx described it , was that it had ceased to be an attempt at the scientific explication of the laws of economics , and had become a hired prize - fighter on behalf of plutocratic interests .
Classical political economy was a revolutionary creed that threatened the interests of the landed oligarchy and the mercantilists .
And it was amenable to even more revolutionary uses , as evidenced by the Ricardian socialists .
The most famous socialist treatment of Ricardo , of course , is that of Marx .
But the socialist development of classical political economy also included free marketers like Thomas Hodgskin ( the most preeminent of Ricardian socialists ) , the mutualist and individualist anarchists from Warren to Tucker and Spooner , and many Georgists .
My own work falls within this latter array of petty bourgeois deviationationists .
But with the triumph of the industrial owning classes in 1830s Britain , the focus of political economy shifted from scientific investigation and a radical challenge to the power of the Old Regime , to an apology for the status quo .
I described vulgar libertarianism as an ideology in the opening section of I described vulgar libertarianism as an ideology in the opening section of Chapter Four of my Studies in Mutualist Political Economy .
Since that passage is as coherent a description as I am likely to write , rather than reinvent the wheel I 'll just take the lazy man 's way out and paste in the relevant paragraphs :
This school of libertarianism has inscribed on its banner the reactionary watchword : " Them pore ole bosses need all the help they can get . "
For every imaginable policy issue , the good guys and bad guys can be predicted with ease , by simply inverting the slogan of Animal Farm : " Two legs good , four legs baaaad . "
In every case , the good guys , the sacrificial victims of the Progressive State , are the rich and powerful .
The bad guys are the consumer and the worker , acting to enrich themselves from the public treasury .
As one of the most egregious examples of this tendency , consider Ayn Rand 's characterization of big business as an " oppressed minority , " and of the Military - Industrial Complex as a " myth or worse . "
The ideal " free market " society of such people , it seems , is simply actually existing capitalism , minus the regulatory and welfare state : a hyper - thyroidal version of nineteenth century robber baron capitalism , perhaps ; or better yet , a society " reformed " by the likes of Pinochet , the Dionysius to whom Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys played Aristotle .
Vulgar libertarian apologists for capitalism use the term " free market " in an equivocal sense : they seem to have trouble remembering , from one moment to the next , whether they ’re defending actually existing capitalism or free market principles .
So we get the standard boilerplate article arguing that the rich ca n’t get rich at the expense of the poor , because " that ’s not how the free market works " -- implicitly assuming that this is a free market .
When prodded , they ’ll grudgingly admit that the present system is not a free market , and that it includes a lot of state intervention on behalf of the rich .
But as soon as they think they can get away with it , they go right back to defending the wealth of existing corporations on the basis of " free market principles . "
So , without further ado , we proceed to dissect the first specimen of libertarianus vulgaris .
It would have been too much of a coincidence for me to stumble across such an egregious example by chance at the same time I was planning to kick off my blog .
In fact , what happened was just the opposite : I stumbled across this article and decided that it was too good a target to pass up .
If I can't get into gear and start blogging when something this good falls into my lap , I might as well just give up .
In In " That Taco Bell Brouhaha , " Art Carden addresses the boycott ( by the Wobblies , various student anti-sweatshop coalitions , and others ) of Taco Bell on behalf of the Immolakee Indians who pick its tomatoes .
In response to charges that Taco Bell 's wages are exploitative , Carden responds :
This is precisely wrong .
Taco Bell 's wage policy alleviates the " continued misery of farmworkers and their families " rather than contributing to it .
Wages are not foisted upon workers ; they agree to pick tomatoes for " sub - poverty wages " for a reason .
In a market economy , they do so because the ' sub - poverty wages " paid by Taco Bell suppliers are a better deal than anyone else is offering .
It 's the same reason people line up for " sweatshop " jobs in developing countries .
Far from contributing to " continued misery , " Taco Bell is making workers ' lives a little bit better by offering something better than their next - best option .
Before we rush to condemn free markets and market forces , we have to ask where the workers are coming from .
In many cases , Taco Bell suppliers employ migrant workers who are making their own " run for the border . "
Migrant workers in Immokalee come from places like Haiti , Mexico , and Central America — areas where markets have been crippled by state intervention for generations .
The end result is a veritable army of workers who have not been allowed to build a skill set through free market employment and who are now suited to do nothing better than pick tomatoes for pennies .
Far from being the enemies of labor , American markets are offering migrant workers an opportunity to substantially improve their standards of living and the prospects of their children .
There are so many features of vulgar libertarianism here , it 's hard to decide where to begin .
The defense of the behavior of big business under " actually existing capitalism " in terms of " how the free market works " is , as I already pointed out in the passage above from Mutualist Political Economy , an immediate tipoff that we 've encountered a vulgar libertarian .
It 's quite jarring , though , to encounter such writing at the website of an institution so closely associated with the memory of Murray Rothbard .
A central theme of Rothbard 's work , and that of left - Rothbardians like Joseph Stromberg , has been the essentially statist ( and exploitative ) nature of corporate capitalism in its existing form .
As Rothbard put it in " The Student Revolution " ( The Libertarian , May 1 , 1969 ) , " our corporate state uses the coercive taxing power either to accumulate corporate capital or to lower corporate costs . "
So to pass from reading an excellent piece of free market analysis like

So to pass from reading an excellent piece of free market analysis like this or this , to reading an apology for the status quo like the piece under consideration here , is positively obscene .
Especially typical of the vulgar libertarian style is the argument that Taco Bell offers a " better deal " than the " next - best option . "
This argument can be found , phrased in slightly different words , in pseudo - " free market " boilerplate in just about any issue of The Freeman : Ideas on Liberty or any daily installment of the Adam Smith Institute blog .
Here are several almost identical examples culled from The Freeman :
But are the “ low - wage , non-union ” Ecuadorian laborers better off working now for some foreign corporation ?
Apparently they think so , or else they would have stayed with what they were doing previously .

What the Industrial Revolution made possible , then , was for these people , who had nothing else to offer to the market , to be able to sell their labor to capitalists in exchange for wages .
That is why they were able to survive at all ....
As Mises argues , the very fact that people took factory jobs in the first place indicates that these jobs , however distasteful to us , represented the best opportunity they had .

In nineteenth - century America , anti-sweatshop activism was focused on domestic manufacturing facilities that employed poor immigrant men , women , and children .
Although conditions were horrendous , they provided a means for many of the country 's least - skilled people to earn livings .
Typically , those who worked there did so because it was their best opportunity , given the choices available ....
It is true that the wages earned by workers in developing nations are outrageously low compared to American wages , and their working conditions go counter to sensibilities in the rich , industrialized West .
However , I have seen how the foreign - based opportunities are normally better than the local alternatives in case after case , from Central America to Southeast Asia .

More recently , the argument was reincarnated by More recently , the argument was reincarnated by Radley Balko , who referred to Third World sweatshops as " the best of a series of bad employment options available " to laborers there .
Within a couple of days , this piece was recirculated over the " free market " [ sic ] blogosphere , along with numerous comments that " sweatshops are far superior to third - world workers ' next best options ... , " or to similar effect ( the last phrase comes from another article by Carden posted on the Mises blog last May , by the way ) .
For more examples of the same argument , just Google " sweatshops " + " next - best alternative "
But the grand - daddy of this argument was Ludwig von Mises , writing in Human Action :
The factory owners did not have the power to compel anybody to take a factory job .
They could only hire people who were ready to work for the wages offered to them .
Low as these wage rates were , they were nonetheless much more than these paupers could earn in any other field open to them .

A great alternative to brewing up an enormous 5 gallon jug of honey wine mead ( which makes around 25 bottles of wine ) you can just brew up a single gallon .
It is less expensive , much easier to do and it will give you about 4 bottles of wine .
An important note about making mead .
Sanitation is very important because you are making a batch of liquid that is primed and ready to grow yeast !
And it would be easy for unwanted yeast to grow in your jug so you want to sanitize everything .
At the bottom of this tutorial are tips and guidelines on sanitizing so read the whole tutorial before you start !
Want to see some videos of how to make mead ?
I have a youtube channel playlist that currently has 21 Mead making videos here
If you are looking for a really simple way to make your first batch of mead but not ready to buy an airlock and glass jug I have a tutorial that shows you the real cheap , and real easy , way to make a gallon with just the ingredients you see in the picture .
One quick trip to the grocery store and you are brewing some mead .
Here are three batches of wine that I have brewed .
You can see the difference in the color because they are from left to right ) a dry mead , a medium mead and a sweet mead .
The most important difference in the three is the amount of honey used .
The darker the must the more honey that has been added .
Here are the ingredients and materials you need to brew up your first one gallon batch of mead .
If this is your first time brewing honey wine it will take you less than two hours to complete .
Materials and Ingredients list : glass 1 - gallon jug
1 gallon of spring water
3 pounds of honey
1 package of yeast ( Lalvin D47 recommended )
1 air lock
1 rubber stopper ( solid )
1 rubber stopper with a hole in it so you can place the airlock
a mixing bowl
Yeast energizer ( white container with brown label ) ( 1 teaspoon )
Yeast nutrient ( white container with blue label ) ( 1 teaspoon ) Some Notes about the materials About the honey Clover honey works very well but you can use almost any type of unprocessed honey and the amount of honey you use will determine the sweetness of the mead .
If you want to make a dry mead you would use 2 pounds of honey and if you want to make a sweet mead you would use about 3.8 pounds of honey .
For simplicity sake we are using 3 pounds of honey which will make us a medium to sweet mead .
About the airlock
The airlock and stopper is a very important part of the process of mead making .
You can not just make a gallon of mead and put a stopper on the top .
The mead will ferment and this means that it will create a lot of gases .
These gases will quickly build up and if you have your container stopped the pressure will either blow off the stopper or explode the jug outright .
Literally you can end up with a mead grenade here .
There will be glass and honey water everywhere .
So , use an airlock .
It allows the gases to escape and keeps impurities out of your mead .
The picture shown here is of an airlock , solid stopper and bored stopper .
This picture shows the airlock in place on top of the bottle of mead .
The rubber stopper that is solid you will use when you are mixing the must .
You mix honey and water together , put the solid stopper on it then shake it up .
About the Nutrient and Energizer I recommend you buy professional nutrient and energizer and they only cost around five bucks per container and each container will last for many many batches of mead .
This use of energizer will insure your ferment goes well , healthy and fast .
You can use other materials such as orange peels or tea leaves and I will talk a bit about this in future articles .
The Yeast I recently made three batches of 1 gallon mead .
( shown in the pic ) ranging from dry to sweet and I used two different yeasts .
For the dry yeast I used a yeast called Premier Cuvee and for the medium and sweet batches I used Lalvin D - 47 .
I recommend you make a medium to medium sweet mead and use Lalvin D - 47 .
It is very hardy and almost foolproof .
Where to order these materials ?
You can get everything you need from Amazon.com - I have a page of equipment and supplies right here : Mead Making Supplies and Equipment available on Amazon.com Let 's Get Started and Make our Honey Wine
Put about 1/3 to 1/2 gallon of spring water into your 1 gallon glass carboy and then add your three pounds of honey .
Now add the Energizer and Nutrient Pour two cups of spring water into your glass mixing bowl and add 1 teaspoon of energizer and 1 teaspoon of nutrient to it .
Stir it up well and add it to the honey and water mix .
Put the solid rubber stopper on the bottle and shake the mead mix gently to get it homogenous .
Now Let 's Activate our D - 47 Lalvin Yeast
Heat two cups of spring water on the stove to between 104 and 109 degrees fahrenheit .
This is warm and not hot .
If this water gets too hot you will kill the yeast .
Clean your mixing bowl while you are waiting for the water to heat .
Then when the temp of the water is right pour it in your mixing bowl then pour 1 / 2 of a package of yeast into the water .
Do not stir it yet .
Just pour it in and wait 15 minutes .
When the 15 minutes is up give it a gentle stir so everything is homogenous then pour it right into your jug of honey water .
Now add more spring water to the jug until it is full .
You will have left over spring water because the honey has taken up some space in the jug of course .
It should be 1 gallon when it looks about like this picture here .
To make sure of where the one gallon full mark was I had originally poured a full gallon of spring water in the jug and made a mark with a marker .
Just so I could be sure of what the one gallon mark was .
Now I just filled to that mark .
Put the rubber stopper on your bottle and shake it vigorously for five full minutes .
And at intervals take the cork off to let it breathe then continue shaking .
It is important to shake it well for five full minutes because this aerates the must .
This aeration is important for the growth of the yeast .
Fill the airlock about half full of water , put it through the rubber stopper then put it firmly on the bottle .
That 's It !
You are done Check on it tomorrow and the day after .
It should start bubbling nicely as the yeast comes alive and starts processing the honey into wine .
Caring for your Jug of soon to be Mead Now set the bottle aside in a cool and dark place and check on it every day or two .
Within a day the airlock should start bubbling and in a few days it should be bubbling briskly .
After around 2 to 3 weeks the bubbling will slow down to less than one bubble every five seconds and there should be a thick sediment on the bottom .
This sediment is dead yeast husks and totally normal .
But you should get the mead off of that sediment to prevent off flavors .
This process is called Racking .
Racking The Mead
You siphon the liquid into a new jug that has been sterilized and leave all the junk behind .
Put the airlock on your new jug and set it in a cool dry and dark place for another 5 to six months when it should be ready to drink .
Mead takes a long time to age so the longer you wait the better .
If you can hold off for a year you will be surprised at how good it can get .
Want to see some videos of how to make mead ?
I have a youtube channel playlist that currently has 21 Mead making videos here Note and update : I have written a guide to the absolute easiest and cheapest way to make 1 gallon of Mead .
All it takes is a trip to the grocery store and there is no need to buy a specialized item like an airlock .
You can have a batch of mead brewing today !
Make a gallon of mead the fast , cheap and easy way Addendum to this tutorial on mead making :
The importance of Sanitation One of the most important aspects of mead making is sanitization .
It is very important that you sanitize everything when you are making mead .
Let me explain why !
When mixing up your honey , water and other things you are making a food environment .
It is a place loaded with nutrients for yeast and that means it can be easy for other types of unwanted yeast or bacteria to quickly grow !
It 's almost like a little incubator :)
What you want is to make sure no outside yeast or cells develop other than the yeast you pitch .
This means you should sanitize everything that comes in contact with your new batch of mead including the jug , spoons and measuring cups .
Doing this sanitizing will add a litte extra work but it is well worth it .
It greatly improves your chances of making a wonderful tasting mead .
The Nuts and Bolts of Sanitizing Mead : I have a video you can watch that will help you understand sanitation here : Sanitization of Mead I use store bought wine making chemical for sanitizing and you can easily get around this by using Chlorine Bleach and here is an article that will help you : Using Bleach for sanitizing food equipment
In summary : " about one tablespoon ( 1/2 fluid ounce , 15
ml ) of typical chlorine bleach per gallon of water is the maximum
that should be used for sanitizing food contact surfaces , according
to federal regulation " .
( CNN ) -- Some Democrats say they fear their party 's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic as neither presidential candidate is likely to gather the delegates needed for the nomination .
Sens .
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running neck and neck toward the party 's August convention in Denver , Colorado .
Most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then .
Party rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers , elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance .
The party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention .
But even some superdelegates are questioning the system , as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome .
" It 's not the most democratic way of doing things , " said Maine superdelegate Sam Spencer .
Watch the scenario for a " civil war " in the Democratic Party »
At least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses .
MoveOn.org , which has endorsed Obama , is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in USA Today .
And Democracy for America , headed by Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean 's brother Jim , said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates .
While pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they 'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus , superdelegates are free to vote however they want .
And even if they pledge their support to a candidate , they 're free to change at any time .
Clinton already has 234 superdelegates and Obama has 157 .
But Obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates , 1,096 to 977 , and is on a roll , having won all eight nominating contests since Super Tuesday .
See which states pledged delegates come from »
' Larry King Live '
How will the presumptive GOP presidential nominee take on Sens. Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama ?
Sen . John McCain goes one - on - one with Larry King .
Tonight , 9 ET see full schedule »
If the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote , the turmoil would last long beyond the convention , longtime Democratic Party strategist Tad Devine said .
" If a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses , but by politicians in some mythical backroom , I think that the public could react strongly against that , " Devine said .
" The problem is [ if ] people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead , insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process , particularly the young people who are voting for the first time , will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated , " he said .
Superdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate Democrats back to conventions , where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s , and to relect the party 's mainstream more accurately .

Five questions on superdelegates
Why delegates matter
Why delegates matter In Depth : Election Center 2008
" [ Superdelegates ] are the keepers of the faith , " said former San Francisco , California , Mayor Willie Brown .
" You have superdelegates because this is the Democratic Party .
You do n't want the bleed - over from the Green Party , the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be . "
Devine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984 .
Mondale 's 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former Sen. Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson .
Mondale had received more votes , but Hart had won more states .
Mondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor .
Each campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side .
Jason Rae , a 21 - year - old Wisconsin superdelegate , said he 's gotten calls from former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from Hillary Clinton 's camp , and Obama 's wife , Michelle , visited with him during a campaign stop Tuesday in Wisconsin .
Rae said he has n't yet decided how he 'll vote in Wisconsin 's primary on Tuesday .
Crystal Strait , a party activist from California , said she 's received calls from Clinton herself and daughter Chelsea but she remains uncommitted .
Massachusetts superdelegate John Walsh said he 'll stay loyal to Obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in Walsh 's state .
So will fellow Massachusetts superdelegates Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry .
Among Clinton 's committed superdelegates are Harold Ickes Jr. , her husband 's former deputy chief of staff ; Terry McAuliffe , who led her husband 's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign ; and her husband .
Whether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates , even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote , could split the party .
" It 's in a total contradiction of the way the Democrats have set up their primary process , with all this proportional representation , " said CNN political analyst Amy Holmes .
" The whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites .
And if this is decided by superdelegates , I think the Democratic Party morally is going to be looking at each other and say , ' What did we just do ? ' "
Devine said it could hurt the party in the general election .
" I think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we 're saying we will pursue in government as Democrats are based on fairness , whether it 's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance , there 's a fairness component in all of that , " he said .
" People need to believe , I think , that our process is fair as well , if they want to believe that our policies will be fair . "

A BBC radio presenter has been jailed for four years in Dubai after he was caught with marijuana worth £ 10 .
Radio 1 DJ
Grooverider , whose real name is Raymond Bingham , was caught with the drug shortly after landing in the United Arab Emirates last November .
Bingham has a fortnight to appeal or can apply to the royal family for a pardon .
His BBC bosses said he had paid a " very high price " while his lawyers insisted he had simply forgotten he was carrying a tiny amount of the drug for personal use .

Jailed for four years : Raymond Bingham , aka Grooverider , had travelled to Dubai to spin some discs ... but has ended up with a criminal record
Customs officials who searched the 40 - year - old found less than a tenth of an ounce of marijuana in his pocket .
He has been in an airport cell ever since .
Bingham was handed the jail term by the Dubai Court of First Instance and was found guilty of illegally bringing in and possessing marijuana .
He was arrested at Dubai Airport on November 23 last year after travelling to Dubai to play a set .
He allegedly also had some pornographic DVDs in his possession .
The DJ had previously told the court that he did not know he had the drugs on him and that he had no intention of bringing them to Dubai .
At an earlier court appearance , he said : " The drugs were in my possession and I forgot I had them in my trousers . "
Bingham , who is recognised as a " godfather " of drum and bass and co-hosts a weekly Radio One show , is likely to be deported after serving his sentence .
In a published interview from jail before he was sentenced , he said : " I just want this to end and to never come back .
It was a small amount .
Back home I would not even get prosecuted . "
The DJ began his career at illegal raves and warehouse parties in the late 80s before rising to fame with his DJ partner Fabio .
The pair performed influential sets at club nights such as Rage and Speed , where they championed the emerging " breakbeat " culture .
This would eventually split from house and techno to become hardcore and then jungle music which in turn became known as drum and bass .
" Fabio and Grooverider " are credited with shaping the sound of drum ' n ' bass and helping establish house and techno in the UK .
They first started DJing together in the 80s on Phase One , a pirate radio station .
The pair have played extensively on the rave and house circuits for years , both together and separately .
Four years is the minimum sentence for drug possession in the United Arab Emirates , which has very conservative laws .
It recently installed new drug - sensitive detecting equipment in its airports .
Drugs are strictly banned and recently there have been several high - profile cases of foreigners being jailed for smuggling small amounts into the country .
Earlier this month , another Briton was jailed to the same term after a tiny amount of cannabis was found in his shoe .
Youth development officer Keith Brown , 43 , from the West Midlands " was found with 0.003g of the drug - an amount invisible to the naked eye .
A Canadian UN official was also jailed last year for carrying 0.5g of hashish and two poppy seeds into the country .
Bert Tatham , who was on his way back from advising the Afghan government , was later issued a rare pardon and deported back home .
British tourists have increasingly headed for Dubai instead of more downmarket European party resorts like Ayia Napa and Faliraki .
The city , with its luxury hotels and relatively cheap weekend package deals , is a convenient and comfortable choice .
But many visitors are apparently unaware of its strict anti-drug policy .
Labour peer Lord Ahmed is reportedly currently helping the families of eight men under the age of 30 who have been arrested for alleged drug offences there .
Writing in the Eastern Eye newspaper this month , the peer warned tourists not to treat a holiday in Dubai with the same sort of hedonism as a trip to Ibiza .
He said : " My plea to parents is to ensure firstly that young children are not taking drugs ...
And do n't go to the Middle East countries as there is a zero tolerance towards drugs .
" The men [ detained ] are mainly from Lancashire and Yorkshire .
They were caught by a drug - scanning machine with the drugs in their pockets or in their socks .
They are from decent families , some in business , who have done really well .
" They can be in a cell for months as a conviction does n't happen overnight .
In one particular case , the prosecution is asking every month for extra time , resulting in longer delays in the case . "
NEW DELHI : Former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated because she was planning to expose an ISI plot to rig the elections , her husband Asif Zardari claimed on Tuesday .
" Yes , I am confirming that , " Zardari told CNN - IBN when asked about a media report that Bhutto was killed as she was planning to expose an ISI plot to rig the elections .
He said Bhutto " has been exposing and talking about the rigging mechanism which is part of this cartel government .
And the cartel league is part and parcel of the conspiracy . "
Zardari said Bhutto has already named some people in a letter to President Pervez Musharraf who she felt threatened from and has left another letter that the party was considering .
Bhutto had written a letter to Musharraf on October 16 in which she had named three members of his government who should be investigated in the event of any attack on her .
On the government 's U - turn over the cause of Bhutto 's death , Zardari welcomed that it had finally admitted that she had not died because her head hit the roof - top lever of the car .
" I am grateful to Channel 4 which aired this footage and I am sure that it ( the U - turn ) is because of that .
" They were trying to hide behind various positions .
First , they came up with the concept that she got a fracture in her skull and then they came up with this lever excuse .
Now , they have admitted .
That is encouraging , " Zardari said .
Zardari rejected the Pakistan government 's argument that more time was needed for the elections to be held as poll offices have been targeted in rioting and the ballot paper printing process has been interrupted .
" I do n't agree with you because the printing system today is improvised and therefore it 's not a reason .
When there was a war in Afghanistan , they called an election .
Sri Lanka is always in the state of war and they have elections .
This is not war , this is rioting , " Zardari said .
He said the Pakistan People 's Party will take all routes possible to go to the people during the campaigning .
Zardari , however , made it clear his son , 19 - year - old Bilawal , who has been made chairman of the PPP following his mother 's death , will not take to the streets to campaign for the party .
Of the British and German soldiers who faced each other across the muddy fields of Flanders on Christmas Eve in 1914 , even those who no longer believed the optimistic predictions of a short war would have been shocked to learn that it would drag on for another four years — and that it would ultimately see the staggering totals of 8 ½ million dead and 21 million wounded .
Nonetheless , by December 1914 the European War — being fought by men who were weary , frustrated , and dispirited , bogged down in the glue - like muck , waterlogged trenches , and barbed - wire entanglements of Belgium , with little sense of national purpose other than to defeat the enemy — had already claimed hundreds of thousands of casualties since the beginning of hostilities in early August .
Despite the constant machine gun fire and artillery bombardments of the western front , and even though in some places front - line troops were a mere 60 yards away from the enemy ’s lines , soldiers on both sides received gift boxes containing food and tobacco prepared by their governments that Christmas :
During World War I , in the winter of 1914 , on the battlefields of Flanders , one of the most unusual events in all of human history took place .
The Germans had been in a fierce battle with the British and French .
Both sides were dug in , safe in muddy , man -made trenches six to eight feet deep that seemed to stretch forever .
All of a sudden , German troops began to put small Christmas trees , lit with candles , outside of their trenches .
Then , they began to sing songs .
Across the way , in the “ no man ’s land ” between them , came songs from the British and French troops .
Incredibly , many of the Germans , who had worked in England before the war , were able to speak good enough English to propose a “ Christmas ” truce .
The British and French troops , all along the miles of trenches , accepted .
In a few places , allied troops fired at the Germans as they climbed out of their trenches .
But the Germans were persistent and Christmas would be celebrated even under the threat of impending death .
According to Stanley Weintraub , who wrote about this event in his book , Silent Night , “ signboards arose up and down the trenches in a variety of shapes .
They were usually in English , or – from the Germans – in fractured English .
Rightly , the Germans assumed that the other side could not read traditional gothic lettering , and that few English understood spoken German .
‘ YOU NO FIGHT , WE NO FIGHT ’ was the most frequently employed German message .
Some British units improvised ‘ MERRY CHRISTMAS ’ banners and waited for a response .
More placards on both sides popped up . ” A spontaneous truce resulted .
Soldiers left their trenches , meeting in the middle to shake hands .
The first order of business was to bury the dead who had been previously unreachable because of the conflict .
Then , they exchanged gifts .
Chocolate cake , cognac , postcards , newspapers , tobacco .
In a few places , along the trenches , soldiers exchanged rifles for soccer balls and began to play games .
It did n’t last forever .
In fact , some of the generals did n’t like it at all and commanded their troops to resume shooting at each other .
After all , they were in a war .
Soldiers eventually did resume shooting at each other .
But only after , in a number of cases , a few days of wasting rounds of ammunition shooting at stars in the sky instead of soldiers in the opposing army across the field .
For a few precious moments there was peace on earth good will toward men .
All because the focus was on Christmas .
Happens every time .
There ’s something about Christmas that changes people .
It happened over 2000 years ago in a little town called Bethlehem .
It ’s been happening over and over again down through the years of time .
This year , Lord willing , it will happen again .
The Germans , who had a direct land link to their home country ( British soldiers in Belgium were separated from London by sixty miles and the English Channel ) , also managed to send small Christmas trees and candles to troops at the front .
And , notwithstanding the fact that a Christmas cease - fire proposed by Pope Benedict XV had already been rejected by both sides as “ impossible , ” on Christmas Eve the “ law of unanticipated consequences went to work , ” as Stanley Weintraub , author of Silent Night : The Story of the World War I Christmas Truce , described it :
[ T ]he Germans set trees on trench parapets and lit the candles .
Then , they began singing carols , and though their language was unfamiliar to their enemies , the tunes were not .
After a few trees were shot at , the British became more curious than belligerent and crawled forward to watch and listen .
And after a while , they began to sing .
By Christmas morning , the “ no man ’s land ” between the trenches was filled with fraternizing soldiers , sharing rations and gifts , singing and ( more solemnly ) burying their dead between the lines .
Soon they were even playing soccer , mostly with improvised balls .
According to the official war diary of the 133rd Saxon Regiment , “ Tommy and Fritz ” kicked about a real football supplied by a Scot .
“ This developed into a regulation football match with caps casually laid out as goals .
The frozen ground was no great matter …
The game ended 3 - 2 for Fritz . ”
The spontaneous truce ( which included French and Belgian troops in some sectors ) was largely over by New Year ’s Day , however .
Commanders on both sides ordered their troops to restart hostilities under penalty of court martial , and German and British soldiers reluctantly parted , in the words of Pvt. Percy Jones of the Westminster Brigade , “ with much hand - shaking and mutual goodwill . ”
The Great War stretched on through another three Christmases and beyond , but all subsequent attempts to organize similiar truces failed , and millions more died before the armistice of 11 November 1918 finally ended the shooting for good .
As Stanley Weintraub noted at the close of his book on the 1914 Christmas truce :
However much the momentary peace of 1914 evidenced the desire of the combatants to live in amity with one another , it was doomed from the start by the realities beyond the trenches .
As the English rock band The Farm , decades later , summed up the results after the enemies “ joined together and decided not to fight , ” but failed , there was “ nothing learned and nothing gained . ”
A celebration of the human spirit , the Christmas Truce remains a moving manifestation of the absurdities of war .
A very minor Scottish poet of Great War vintage , Frederick Niven , may have got it right in his “ A Carol from Flanders , ” which closed : O ye who read this truthful rime
From Flanders , kneel and say :
God speed the time when every day
Shall be as Christmas Day .
Although the Christmas Truce of 1914 may seem like a distant myth to those now at arms in parts of the world where vast cultural differences between combatants make such an occurrence impossible , it remains a symbol of hope to those who believe that a recognition of our common humanity may someday reverse the maxim that “ Peace is harder to make than war . ”
Raul Castro now has to grapple with Cuba 's economic problems
Fidel Castro stepped down last week after nearly half a century in charge .
Raul has in effect been president since Fidel had major surgery in July 2006 .
It is understood that he was the only nominee in a vote seen as a formality .
The US said Raul Castro 's appointment offered potential for change but said its embargo would remain until there was a transition to democracy .
" There is a possibility and potential for change in Cuba , but those changes will have to be born inside Cuba , " said Assistant Secretary of State Tom Shannon .
The commander in chief of the Cuban revolution is unique , Fidel is Fidel , as we all know well , he is irreplaceable
Raul Castro
Key government figures Raul set for pragmatic course
There had been speculation that Raul Castro , aged 76 , would name one of Cuba 's younger generation of communist leaders as his number two .
But he instead opted for one of the original leaders of Cuba 's communist revolution , 78 - year - old Politburo hardliner Machado Ventura as first vice - president .
What this means for the prospects for change remains unclear , the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana says .
Economic challenge
In an address to the nation , following the behind - closed - doors vote , Raul Castro said the Cuban government would continue to consult Fidel Castro , 81 , on major decisions of state - a move backed by the National Assembly deputies .

Raul Castro paid tribute to his older brother as he accepted the presidency and said that he was accepting the job on the understanding that Fidel Castro would remain as the " commander in chief of the revolution " , a title he was given during the 1959 uprising .
" The commander in chief of the Cuban revolution is unique , Fidel is Fidel , as we all know well , he is irreplaceable , " Raul Castro said .
Our correspondent says Raul Castro now has to steer the Caribbean island through un-charted waters in an unpredictable period of economic and political renewal .
Before Sunday 's session , Raul Castro had suggested implementing major economic reforms and " structural changes " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The Cuban people need international assistance to uplift the standards of life in all fields .
Only a young blood will think in these terms , otherwise the older will continue to act wickedly and selfishly Sailani , Karachi , Pakistan
He has also had the advantage of continued economic support from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in the form of millions of barrels of cheap oil , our correspondent adds .
Mr Chavez was quick to congratulate Raul Castro on his appointment , leading a standing ovation to the new Cuban president on his weekly television programme in Caracas .
" Let 's applaud Raul , who is a comrade , a companion , more than the brother of Fidel , " Mr Chavez said .
Mr Castro said that Venezuela would continue to support the communist state .
Letter announcement
Fidel Castro , who has ruled Cuba since leading a revolution in 1959 , announced his retirement in a letter published on the website of the Cuban Communist Party 's newspaper Granma last week .
He said he had not stepped down after undergoing emergency intestinal surgery in 2006 because he had had a duty to the Cuban people to prepare them for his absence .
But retirement , he added , would not stop him from carrying " on fighting like a soldier of ideas " , and he promised to continue writing essays entitled Reflections of Comrade Fidel .
Though he has not been seen in public for 19 months , the government occasionally releases photographs and pre-edited video of him meeting visiting leaders from around the world .
Just as many scientists had given up the search , researchers have discovered that the pancreas does indeed harbor stem cells with the capacity to generate new insulin - producing beta cells .
If the finding made in adult mice holds for humans , the newfound progenitor cells will represent an obvious target for therapeutic regeneration of beta cells in diabetes , the researchers report in the Jan. 25 issue of Cell , a publication of Cell Press .
One of the most interesting characteristics of these [ adult ] progenitor cells is that they are almost indistinguishable from embryonic progenitors , said Harry Heimberg of the JDRF Center at Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium and the Beta Cell Biology Consortium .
� In terms of their structure and gene expression , there are no major differences .
They look and behave just like embryonic beta cell progenitors . ”
Insulin is required for cells to take up blood sugar , the body�s primary energy source .
In people with certain types of diabetes , blood sugar rises due to an inability of pancreatic beta cells to produce insulin in sufficient quantities .
Previous studies had failed to demonstrate the existence of bona fide beta cell progenitors in the pancreas after birth .
The elusiveness of this cell type reached a summit when genetic lineage tracing provided evidence that pre-existing beta cells , rather than stem / progenitor cells , are the major source of new beta cells in adult mice , the researchers said .
� Most people gave up looking because they are so few and so hard to activate , � Heimberg said .
In the new study , Heimberg�s team tied off a duct that drains digestive enzymes from the pancreas .
That injury led to a doubling of beta cells in the pancreas within two weeks , they showed .
The animals� pancreases also began producing more insulin , evidence that the new beta cells were fully functional , Heimberg said .
He suspects the regenerative process is sparked by an inflammatory response in the enzyme - flooded pancreas .
They further found that the production of new beta cells depends on a gene called Neurogenin 3 ( Ngn3 ) , which is known to play a role in the pancreas during embryonic development .
� The most important challenge now is to extrapolate our findings to patients with diabetes , � Heimberg said .
Although he cautioned that any potential diabetes treatment remains far into the future , �our findings reveal the significance of investigating the feasibility of ( 1 ) isolating facultative beta cell progenitors and newly formed beta cells from human pancreas in order to expand and differentiate them in vitro and transplant them in diabetic patients and ( 2 ) composing a mix of factors able to activate beta cell progenitors to expand and differentiate in situ in patients with an absolute or relative deficiency in insulin , � the researchers wrote .

Saudi women are subject to strict sex segregation laws
The victim was initially punished for violating laws on segregation of the sexes - she was in an unrelated man 's car at the time of the attack .
When she appealed , the judges said she had been attempting to use the media to influence them .
The attackers ' sentences - originally of up to five years - were doubled .
Extra penalties
According to the Arab News newspaper , the 19 - year - old woman was gang - raped 14 times in an attack in the eastern province a year - and - a - half ago .
The victim and attackers are from Saudi Arabia 's Shia minority .
Seven men from the majority Sunni community were found guilty of the rape and sentenced to prison terms ranging from just under a year to five years .
But the victim was also punished for violating Saudi Arabia 's laws on segregation that forbid unrelated men and women from associating with each other .
She was initially sentenced to 90 lashes for being in the car of a strange man .
On appeal , the Arab News reported that the punishment was not reduced but increased to 200 lashes and a six - month prison sentence .
The rapists also had their prison terms doubled .
But the sentences are still low considering they could have faced the death penalty .
The Arab News quoted an official as saying the judges had decided to punish the girl for trying to aggravate and influence the judiciary through the media .
The victim 's lawyer was suspended from the case , has had his licence to work confiscated , and faces a disciplinary session .
Although HD DVD appears to be in dire straits , the format battle between it and Blu-ray has had at least one positive ramification : pricing on players has fallen at a rapid rate , and sales are eclipsing those seen in the early years of DVD .
The market seems to have spoken on HD DVD .
In the week after Warner 's defection to the Blu-ray camp , weekly HD DVD player sales according to NDP sank from a healthy 14,558 the week previous to a paltry 1,758 .
Blu-ray saw a reverse trend , climbing from 15,257 to 21,770 .
Blu-ray captured approximately 93 percent of the market that week .
Paul Erickson , DisplaySearch director of DVD and HD Market Research , told Video Business that the competition has resulted in price drops coming at previously unseen speeds .
The result has been an explosion of sales that puts the next - gen players ahead of DVD , if you compare their first couple of years .
" There is a much larger spike at the end of the year for next - generation DVD due to strong performances by both formats for November and December , as well as heavy competition - driven promotions for both Black Friday and the December holiday season , " Erickson said .
Be that as it may , $ 300 for a Blu-ray player is still too rich for many .
Depending on which models you focus on , Blu-ray players dropped an average of 40 percent in price over the year .
Now that Blu-ray has a commanding lead among the studios , you might think that a decline in player pricing will slow .
The Blu-ray Disc Association has every reason to keep the momentum going , however , even if HD DVD were vanquished tomorrow .
Blu -ray still need to compete with both standard DVD and download services .
Indeed , Blu-ray may have lost a challenger only to gain one , two , or three .
Apple 's new movie rental service is a challenger , if you ask Steve Jobs .
The turtlenecked Jobs told CNBC after Macworld that Blu-ray may have beaten HD DVD , but that it will lose the HD content war to download services like that offered by Apple .
Truth be told , it 's a game plenty of players are in , including Amazon , Netflix , and BitTorrent .
Jobs may be right : all of these companies have a real shot at making Blu-ray sweat .
Still , we wo n't predict the demise of Blu-ray on account of download services .
While there will be healthy competition , download speeds , storage , and the much - discussed PC - to - TV problem will conspire against a total victory for downloads anytime soon .
I am not one of those people who worships at the altar of Google .
Their green bar of power has not had any impact on my life before now .
Unfortunately I am forced to kneel before the mighty G and ask for forgiveness .
You see , on one of my blogs I sold text link advertising .
My DSLR Photography
Blog had a PR of 6 so I thought I would make some cash off the fact .
Google does n’t like that .
Messes with their heads .
You can guess what happened next …
So Google did what Google does .
What Google giveth they can take away .
Bye bye green pixels .
Of course the idea is if they devalue your commodity then you will likely stop selling it .
Good plan .
Strange thing though , my text link customers did not go away .
Stick that in your pipe and smoke it Mr Cutts !
If their downgrade of green did n’t impact my bottom line , why am I doing the mea culpa shuffle ?
It turns out I have had another offer to buy the site , but at a much lower price than when it was PR6 .
This customer is not bothered at all about PageRank , but they are concerned that this drop is a sign of a hand penalty .
It ’s the whiff that I might have been flagged that has reduced the asking price .
My traffic and subscribers are up but no buyer will take the risk that Google is going to handjob you out of the search results at any moment .
This leaves me cap in hand , calling for forgiveness , asking for mercy , for something that was n’t a sin in the first place .

How To : Cheap or Free Solar Panels
February 7th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
My cousin mentioned to me that her family wanted to install solar panels on their roof .
She said it was a huge disappointment because it was far too expensive .
It would take twenty years for them to regain the cost in energy savings , even with state solar initiatives !
I decided to do some digging and came up with a handy solution to help reduce the cost :
Find used or discounted solar panels .
Maybe you can even get them for free .
It may be the next - best option for installing solar power after joining a solar panel group discount program ( if one ’s available in your area ) .
And it ’s a little simpler than going all out and building your own homemade solar panels .
Solar panels are ideal for electric equipment when one does n’t have access to the power grid and are widely used for such purposes ( i.e. by the U.S. military ) .
But being “ in the field ” can be rough on rigid silicon wafers .
Any time a solar panel gets chipped or cracked , it becomes “ unsafe ” and must be replaced .
Fortunately for us , “ unsafe ” is relative to rough road - side or wilderness conditions , not a cozy rooftop .
Those panels have to go somewhere and they can be expensive to dispose of .
Some companies would rather give them away to greenies .
Sound too good to be true ?
Well , consider that some of that damage , cracks or chips , also degrade the efficiency of the panels — anywhere from 10 % - 60 % .
It ’s not going to generate as much energy as a swanky new panel .
But if you buy it for a song , or even convince them to give it to you for free , who ’s complaining ?
Subtract 10 % off a 22 - watt panel and you still get 19 watts .
That panel will still reduce your electricity bill .
So , where do you find used solar panels ?
Step 1 : Collect Contact Info .
Next time you spot a panel “ in the field , ” there should be a sign on or near it with a contractor ’s name and contact information .
These are the people who provide solar panels for “ in - field ” use .
Just be careful : it is dangerous and sometimes illegal to stop on the side of a highway just to jot down a name and number .
Instead , look for weather sensors or portable electric signs on local roads .
If that fails , try scouring your local phone book for contractors who provide equipment for road construction .
Make a list of these names , phone numbers , and their addresses .
Step 2 : Go see them .
Convincing someone to sell / give you an expensive piece of hardware is less likely to happen over the phone .
You ’ll want to talk to the mechanics or the maintenance department : gentlemen who are probably very busy .
Be friendly and always offer to pay for the damaged panels — they ’ll appreciate the offer even if they do n’t intend to charge you .
If they do want cash , bargain .
Keep in mind that they are doing you a favor by selling / giving something to you .
Forging a good relationship will help in the long run .
They wear out panels regularly — if they give to you once , they ’re more likely to do it again .
Remember to call back every few weeks to check if they ’ve “ received ” ( i.e. broken ) any more panels .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama surged to a big lead over Hillary Clinton in California hours before “ Super Tuesday ” voting began in 24 states , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Tuesday .
In the Republican race , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney held a 7 - point advantage on Arizona Sen .
John McCain in California , while McCain added to commanding double - digit leads in New York and New Jersey .
On a sprawling day of coast - to - coast voting , the biggest ever in a U.S. primary race , the U.S. presidential contenders in both parties were fighting to win a huge cache of delegates to this summer ’s nominating conventions .
In California , which alone provides more than one - fifth of the Democratic delegates needed for the nomination , Obama led Clinton by 49 percent to 36 percent , the poll found .
The margin of error was 3.3 percentage points .
Clinton pulled into a 5 - point lead in New Jersey , 46 percent to 41 percent , after being tied on Monday .
Obama held a 45 percent to 42 percent edge on Clinton in Missouri .
Both polls had a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points .
Obama had a 20 - point edge in Georgia , aided by a more than 3 - to - 1 lead among black voters .
Obama , an Illinois senator , and Clinton , a New York senator , are in a hard - fought battle for the Democratic presidential nomination and split the first four significant contests .

“ There is clear Obama momentum in California , ” pollster John Zogby said .
“ But in New Jersey , things seemed to swing in favor of Clinton , and Missouri was very mixed . ”
In the Republican race , Romney maintained a stable 40 percent to 33 percent lead on McCain in California , fueled by heavy support in the southern part of the state and among self - described conservatives .
The margin of error was 3.4 percentage points .
DASH TO CALIFORNIA
Both Romney and McCain made last - minute changes to their campaign schedules to fly to California for late appearances .
A Romney win there could be his last hope of blunting McCain ’s growing momentum in other states .
McCain held a 26 - point edge on Romney in New York and a 29 - point advantage in New Jersey as he pushed for a convincing triumph that could knock Romney out of the race to be the Republican candidate in November ’s presidential election .
McCain held a narrow 34 percent to 27 percent lead over former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in Missouri , with Romney running third at 25 percent .
The margin of error was 3.4 percentage points .
Slideshow ( 19 images )
“ It looks like a big day for McCain with Romney making a last stand in California , ” Zogby said .
The two launched hard - hitting attack ads on Monday questioning each other ’s conservative credentials before the vote .
McCain won the last two contests , in South Carolina and Florida , to seize the front - runner ’s slot in a hard - fought Republican race despite qualms among some conservatives about his views on taxes , immigration and campaign finance .
More than half of the total Democratic delegates and about 40 percent of the Republican delegates are up for grabs on Tuesday .
The Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby rolling tracking poll surveyed presidential races in both parties in California , New Jersey and Missouri .
The polls also looked at the Republican race in New York and the Democratic race in Georgia .
The rolling polls were taken Saturday through Monday , except for the California survey , which was a two - day poll on Sunday and Monday .
In a rolling poll , the most recent day ’s results are added while the oldest day ’s results are dropped in order to track changing momentum .

Mortgage companies have helped more than one million cash - strapped borrowers stay in their homes since the summer , new industry data show .
Even so , the number of homes subject to foreclosure is rising , and the percentage of borrowers who had good credit when they took out their loan and are now seeking help is growing .
In a report released yesterday , the Hope Now Alliance , the group coordinating the mortgage industry 's response to the nation 's mounting wave of foreclosures , said its members helped work out 1.04 million mortgage loans between July 1 and Jan. 31 .
The methods ranged from rescheduling borrowers ' payments to easing the terms of their loans .
Most of those workouts -- 73 % -- involved repayment plans that allow borrowers to catch up on missed payments or have those missed payments applied to the balance of their loan .
About 27 % were loan modifications , in which the original terms of the loan contract were changed , usually by reducing the interest rate , forgiving a portion of the principal or extending the maturity of the loan .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson greeted the report as evidence that " looking at the big picture , we 're making progress . "
He also praised the industry for speeding the pace at which it is modifying troubled mortgages .

Light pollution is not just a waste of money , argues astronomer Darren Baskill in this week 's Green Room .
He says badly designed lighting is also having an impact on the environment and our health , as well as denying millions of people the right to enjoy the beauty of the night sky .
Our desire for night - time lighting in a 24 - hour society seemingly justifies any amount of wasted light

While the orange smog of night - time light pollution is the most graphic demonstration of wasted light obliterating our view of the stars , it is the financial , environmental and human cost of light pollution that is truly astronomical .
Light pollution is wasted artificial light ; light that shines where it is neither needed nor wanted .
Most light fittings waste a large fraction of the light they produce .
More than 300 megawatts worth of light is wasted skywards from UK streetlights alone , at an annual cost of about £ 100 m ( $ 190 m ) .
Even the most modern streetlights divert light away from the street , and shine light directly into the sky .
This makes the night sky brighter and our streets dimmer , a " double whammy " for a cycling astronomer like me , suffering the evening challenge of avoiding yet another puncture caused by debris hidden in the gutter .
One medium - sized coal - fired power station is required to solely generate that wasted energy , which results in a million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution being pumped into the atmosphere each year .
Include inefficient lighting from homes , businesses , churches and sports facilities , and you begin to comprehend that the wastage is on a massive scale .
And light pollution is getting rapidly worse ; according to the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England ( CPRE ) , light pollution in the UK increased by a staggering 24 % between 1993 and 2000 , making Britain the third most light - polluted country in Europe .
False security
Now you see it : the Cygnus constellation seen from southern Spain

Our desire for night - time lighting in a 24 - hour society seemingly justifies any amount of wasted light - which has had tragic consequences .
In Oxfordshire a man was killed when a pub floodlight blinded a car driver .
In Australia , ill - directed lighting surrounding an airport caused a fatal air crash .
Intrusive nuisance lighting can cause stress , leading to deterioration in health , heart attacks , and even thoughts of suicide .
Exposure to light at night may also increase the risk of cancer .
Dr Chris Idzikowski , director of the Sleep Assessment and Advisory Service , says : " [ It ] could lead to a disruption of sleeping patterns , hyper-activity and may have a negative impact on a child 's health . "
Inefficient lighting has a detrimental impact on wildlife too , disrupting natural feeding and breeding cycles .
A survey in Toronto found more than 2,000 migrating birds of 89 different species dead beneath brightly lit skyscrapers .
Bats , moths and other insects such as glow - worms are also adversely affected .
The most common justification for lighting , however inefficient , is security , and the naive belief that " the brighter the light , the better " prevails .
Visit any DIY store , and the shelves are brimming with 150W , 300W and even 500W floodlights .
However , the government 's home security website states that such lighting " ... is unfortunate , as in many locations this is the most inappropriate form of lighting available " .
... now you do n't :

When you consider that the Smalls lighthouse ( situated more than 20 miles off the coast of Wales ) has a 35 - watt bulb that produces a beam of light that is visible for 21 miles , you can understand why .
Ironically , such blindingly bright so - called " security " floodlights can hide criminal activity in their glare , and because the lights are frequently triggered by cats on a night - time prowl , neighbours soon learn to try to ignore them .
Research into street lighting by the UK Home Office showed that " better lighting by itself has very little effect on crime " , suggesting that lighting can help everyone see their surroundings - including criminals .
Dimming down
The Government has introduced the Clean Neighbourhoods Act ( 2005 ) , which aims to make light nuisance subject to criminal law .
Unfortunately , the Act includes a long list of inexplicable exceptions .
While a home owner can now be fined for installing obtrusive lighting , a bus station cannot .
An increasing number of inefficiently floodlit buildings , especially churches , may also escape control .
While some local councils understand the problems of light pollution , others exacerbate the problem .
Stockport City Council recently installed new street lighting that shines light into homes at five times the recommended levels .
Things are different in other countries .
Light pollution laws exist in the Czech Republic , Italy , Chile and parts of the US .
In 2005 , the City of Calgary finished replacing all 37,500 street lights with efficient lighting , saving $ 2 m ( £ 0.9 m ) per year - which will offset the replacement costs in just six years .
HAVE YOUR SAY
While many people have heard of light pollution , regrettably few make the small effort needed to eradicate it
Send us your views
Elsewhere , street lighting in Rome dims after midnight , reducing lighting costs by 40 % , and in the US , the Long Island Power Authority converted all their outdoor operational - yard lighting to efficient fixtures .
These all prove that you can have light without light pollution .
So please , make sure your home or business lighting only shines where it is needed and with appropriate power , without wasting light upwards into the sky , or outwards into neighbouring homes .
Walk around your lights , and make sure they are not visible from beyond the area that needs to be lit .
Likewise for street - lighting , where dimming technology should be used wherever possible - it halved energy costs on the M65 while reducing visual stress to drivers .
These small steps will save significant amounts of energy and money , reducing carbon dioxide emissions , and improve our view of both the streets and the sky .
While many people have heard of light pollution , regrettably few make the small effort needed to eradicate it .
Everyone needs lighting , including astronomers , but that need should not be used as an excuse to be unnecessarily inefficient on a massive scale .
No - one should be denied the right to view , explore and be inspired by the night sky .

He is also a member of the Campaign for Dark - Skies , a group initially set - up by amateur astronomers to encourage the use of efficient , responsible lighting
The Green Room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental issues running weekly on the BBC News website .
Lou Dobbs is outraged , outraged , I tell you ! , at yet another example of lip service by the Bush Administration of caring about national security while doing something entirely opposite .
No offense , Lou , but get in line .
Apparently , our tax dollars are going to fund a Russian nuclear lab ( why ? ) that is in turn , working with the Iranians .
The subtext is that the Russians are helping the Iranians develop a nuclear weapons program , NIE Report be damned .
However , it would be interesting to know why the US continues to fund nuclear technology development in Russia .
PILGRIM :
The rationale for the Department of Energy program was to pay the salaries of Russian scientists who were left without incomes after the Cold War .
The thinking was to keep them on the payroll so they would n?t peddle their nuclear expertise to rogue nations like Iran . [..]
DOBBS : This administration , everyone keeps talking about the legacy of this administration , well their legacy is mind - boggling , unbelievable , breathtaking , incompetence and stupidity .
That is going to be the legacy of the Bush administration .
Thank god that Congressman Dingell and Stupak are leading the way on this issue .

Maya Blue on an ancient Maya mural .
Scientists have solved the mystery of how the Maya concocted this pigment .
Ancient Maya would paint unlucky people blue and throw them down a sacred well as human sacrifices .
Now scientists have solved the mystery of how to make the famous blue pigment by analyzing traces on pottery left in the bottom of the well .
The Maya associated the color blue with their rain deities .
When they offered sacrifices to the god Chaak , they would paint them blue in hopes he would send rain to make corn grow .
The blue paint has been found on objects for a long time , but scientists have debated how the Maya created the pigment .
Now Gary Feinman , curator of anthropology at the Field Museum in Chicago , and Dean E. Arnold , a professor of anthropology at Wheaton College , have figured out the secret ingredient in the ancient Maya concoction .
The scientists studied pottery found at the bottom of the well at an important Pre-Columbian Maya site called Chichén Itzá in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico .
During the Postclassic Period , from around 900 A.D. to 1500 A.D. , the Maya would sacrifice people and objects by throwing them into the well , a wide , naturally - formed sinkhole called the Sacred Cenote .
Based on studies of bones found at the bottom , it seems most of the human sacrifices were male .
The researchers analyzed a bowl from the cenote that was used to burn incense .
The pottery contained traces of Maya Blue .
Scientists have long puzzled over how the ancient people created such a vivid , durable , fade - resistant pigment .
They knew it contained two substances — extract from the leaves of the indigo plant and a clay mineral called palygorskite .
By examining these pigment samples under an electron microscope , the researchers were able to detect the signatures of its key ingredients .
" Nobody has ever really figured out how those two key ingredients were fused into a very stable pigment , " Feinman told LiveScience .
" We think that copal , the sacred incense , may have been a third ingredient .
We 're arguing that heat and perhaps copal resin were the keys to fusing the indigo extract and the clay mineral .
And also we have some pretty decent evidence that this was likely taking place at the edge of the cenote . "
The copal incense may have been the binding agent that allowed the color to stay true for so long , Feinman said .
" One of the things that ’s always been distinctive about Maya Blue is how durable and steadfast a color it is , which is unusual compared to many natural pigments , which fade a lot through time , " he said .
" This may have been one reason why it was quite so durable . "
The scientists think making Maya Blue was part of the sacrifice ritual .
" My guess is that they probably had a large fire and a vessel over that fire where they were combining the key ingredients , " Feinman said .
" And then they probably took pieces of the hot copal and put them into the vessel . "
When the Sacred Cenote was first dredged in 1904 , researchers found a 14 - foot thick layer of blue residue at the bottom , but did n’t understand its origin .
Now , Feinman said , we know it is probably left over from the years ' worth of blue - coated sacrifices thrown into the well .
During its heyday , Chichén Itzá was a thriving city .
Even after the city collapsed , ancient Maya would take pilgrimages to the site to make sacrifices .
Now tourists flock there to see the cenote and a giant step pyramid temple dedicated to Quetzalcoatl .
In 2007 , it was designated one of the New Seven Wonders of the World by the New Open World Corp .
The new study will be published online Feb. 26 in the British journal Antiquity .
Editor ’s note :
There are two answers to the question of what the Bible says about homosexuality :
The short answer and the long one .
The short one is that nowhere in the Bible are same - sex committed and loving relationships condemned .
The long answer is that there is plenty of reputable scholarship showing that the six “ clobber ” passages commonly used to make the claim that the Bible condemns homosexuality are simply misunderstood by those making those claims .
This series of essays is the tip of that iceberg ; Editor Emeritus Rev. Candace Chellew ‘s book Bulletproof Faith : A Spiritual Survival Guide for Gay and Lesbian Christians explores homosexuality in the Bible even more fully .
The Bible and Homosexuality
Introduction from Rev. Candace Chellew
Of the negative or critical e-mails I receive from critics of this magazine and its mission , I ’d estimate 90 percent of them advise me to read my Bible .
Specifically , I am urged to read at least one or all of the six passages we as GLBT Christians know as the “ clobber passages ” .
These are verses , we ’re told , where God condemns homosexuality in no uncertain terms .
As I inform those letter writers , I have read my Bible , and I ’ve paid close attention to those “ clobber passages . ”
So have many Bible scholars .
We all agree that nowhere in the Bible are same - sex committed and loving relationships condemned .
It ’s just not there .
Instead , the Bible holds much joy , comfort and love for GLBT Christians willing to wade into its pages and hear the loving voice of God .
The Six “ Clobber Passages ”
In this section of Whosoever we explore the six “ clobber passages ” and several other verses used as “ prooftexts ” of homosexuality ’s condemnation .
Before we begin we must clarify the concept of “ prooftexts , ” or isogesis ( a.k.a. eisegesis ) .
To defend their assertion that God condemns homosexuals , people always use small passages from the Bible to prove their point .
Using the Bible in this manner is destructive .
Instead of “ exegesis , ” which involves examining the history of scripture to find out what it means and how it applies to us , “ eisegesis ” approaches scripture with a preconceived idea of what you will find there .
It is abuse of scripture .
Pre-Conceived Notions
In eisegesis you search the Book until you find a passage you think applies and use it as your “ proof ” that God backs you up .
You isolate that phrase or passage , take it out of context and improperly use it to back up your argument .
It ’s like a friend taking a sentence or phrase out of a letter you wrote and using it to represent what you believe as a whole .
It ’s easy to be taken out of context .
You would n’t want your views represented that way , but that ’s how the ideas and beliefs of the Bible ’s authors are presented every day !
It is my sincere hope that GLBT Christians and our critics alike will approach this material with open hearts and minds .
Not everyone will come away convinced , but I ’ve discovered it takes time to unlearn all the misinterpretations of scripture we ’ve been taught through the years .
I invite you to sit with this information , pray and meditate on it , and let God speak to your heart .
I hope that when your journey is complete you ’ll see God ’s word with new eyes and realize GLBT Christians are welcomed in Jesus ’ one word , “ Whosoever . ”
Blessings ,
Candace Chellew

Congressman Ron Paul is a Republican from Texas .
An obstetrician by profession , Paul is noted for never voting for legislation unless it is authorized by the U.S. Constitution .
He is an advocate of limited government .
He has also opposed U.S. military interventions overseas , including Iraq .
Michael Shank :
You ’ve said that " It ’s nothing more than a canard to claim that those of us who struggled to prevent the bloodshed and now want it stopped are somehow less patriotic and less concerned about the welfare of our military personnel . "
During wartime this is often the case .
How can one work to counter this tendency to claim that those who question or work to stop a war are unpatriotic ?
Rep. Ron Paul :
It ’s very difficult because the executive branch , and particularly the president , always has the bully pulpit .
He can say it over and over and over again , and it ’s always heard : " If you do n’t vote for the money and you do n’t support the policy , you do n’t support the troops . "
And that ’s not true because if you ’re spending money to support a policy that puts the troops in harm ’s way , performing a task that ’s unachievable , then you ’re doing everything in the world to hurt the troops .
You ’re doing everything you can to undermine the rule of law because it ’s an undeclared illegal war and it ’s very detrimental economically .
So to argue that you ’re unpatriotic because you do n’t support the troops , because you do n’t support the policy , is a canard , it ’s just not true .
Even the strong opponents to the war , in the Congress here , are intimidated by that .
Not so much that they believe it , but they ’re intimidated , they say " when I go home the people are going to say that I ’m unpatriotic and I do n’t support the troops and I do n’t support national defense and I might lose my congressional seat . "
As political pragmatists they back away from doing what I ’m quite sure a lot of them would know would be the right thing to do .
And that is to change the policy and de-fund the war .
Shank :
And what role does the media play in reinforcing the idea that opposition to the war is unpatriotic ?
Paul :
They repeat everything the president says and they do n’t ask tough questions .
They would very rarely give those of us that have opposed the war from the very beginning any credibility .
For very special reasons , I think , they are n’t interested in having an anti-war policy .
They have other reasons for wanting us to be there and they ’re not hesitant at all to continue that policy and they do n’t want their policy undermined .
Shank :
For political or economic reasons ?
Paul :
There are a lot [ of reasons ] .
There is something to the old saying about the military industrial complex and the banking system and that some countries in the Middle East like us to be there .
It ’s not only Israel .
Saudi Arabia likes us to prop them up .
We ’ve been doing that for a long , long time .
There ’s a lot of special interest there and a lot of people who are deceived into believing that we could n’t drive our cars if we were n’t over there , because we would n’t have the oil supply protected .
They do n’t realize that since we ’ve been there the price of oil has tripled .
It is n’t very practical .
Shank :
In a House floor speech you noted the " misinformation given the American people to justify our invasion " in Iraq .
In perhaps the world ’s most free democracy , where free speech prevails , how does misinformation like this go unchallenged ?
Paul : Fortunately it always gets challenged ; the unfortunate thing is that it ’s always very late .
We ’re getting to the bottom of the truth .
People spoke out in elections .
Now there ’s a different party in charge .
There are going to be more investigations .
But the real tragedy is that a lot of people die in the meantime .
We finally found out that the Gulf of Tonkin was all fudged , and yet we lost 60,000 men .
Now we have the misinformation , that ’s a generous term , about getting us involved in Iraq .
We ’ve lost a lot of people , and literally hundreds of thousands are applying for disability .
And it goes on and on .
To me , it is a real tragedy .
The media , if they ’re not in conspiracy to promote war , they ’re not doing a very good job by asking questions .
And nobody knows what their intent really is .
Sometimes the media and big industry are very often the same company .
Intellectually , if you want to stay strictly on an intellectual level , our society has been engrained with the attitude that we have a moral obligation to intervene .
Some people do n’t think in terms of non-intervention versus intervention .
The debate here in Washington is always : we intervene this way , this way , or that way , with whom and how far and how long .
It ’s always the technicalities of intervention .
But we ’re never taught in school what our traditions have been and what the founders advised and what the constitution allows .
Even the UN charter talks more about peace ; they do n’t even authorize war in the UN charter .
And we ignore that too .
There ’s a lot of ignorance out there , and a lot of it is perpetuated in our universities .
Except today we ’re getting a broader education through the Internet .
More people are understanding some of our views .
So I think in spite of all the pessimism , we ’re much better off today than we were 20 years ago when our voices were not heard at all .
Today , our voices are being heard a lot easier because of the Internet .
Shank :
In one of your speeches , titled " Do n’t Do It , Mr. President " , you urged the president to not bomb Iran .
Why are you so against a military invasion of Iran ?
Paul : Because I ’m against military activity in almost every circumstance when war is n’t declared .
I recognize there are a few times our president could act but I think I pointed out in one of my speeches that I can’t remember a time that the president was required to act , i.e. that it was so necessary : the tanks were landing , there was a landing on our beach , the missiles were flying .
It ’s never happened .
The president has the authority to repel an invasion or an attack .
But going into Iran does n’t make any sense whatsoever .
It ’s going to expand the war , spread the war , and probably close down the Straits of Hormuz .
We do n’t have the authority nationally or internationally .
It ’s just the most foolish thing I could conceive of .
And yet it looks like there ’s bipartisan consensus that we ca n’t take anything off the table .
We ca n’t even take off the table that we might use a nuclear first strike to go after Iran .
They do n’t even have a weapon and our CIA says they probably can’t get one for 10 years .
And even if they did have one , what are they going to do with it ?
Are they going to attack us ?
They would n’t do that .
Yet at the same time we stood up against the Soviet system .
They probably had 30,000 nuclear warheads and they had the capability of launching missiles at us .
We did n’t have to have a nuclear war to finally win the cold war .
We talked to them and there were negotiations .
Their system was a failed system , and it failed .
The Iranian [ system ] will fail too if we just leave them alone .
They can never become a power capable of attacking us .
They do n’t have an air force , they do n’t have a navy .
It ’s an unbelievable , hysterical reaction on our part to become so frightened that we have to attack people like Saddam Hussein .
It just bewilders me how people can fall into a trap of believing these stories that are put out and that the media propagates .
Shank :
In your words , " if you do n’t have a nuke , we ’ll threaten to attack you , if you do have a nuke , we ’ll leave you alone . "
How do you explain this policy ?
Paul : The North Koreans exploded [ weapons ] minimally , and yet it seemed to get respect .
All of the sudden we ’re talking to them and offering them deals .
We knew the Chinese had them .
We knew the Russians had them , and we treated them differently .
We treat Pakistan differently , we give them money .
We treat India differently , and they got their nuclear weapons outside international law .
But if you do n’t have a weapon we threaten you , as if you did , with the idea that we ’re going to go in and take over .
And we do .
We went into Iraq , and we ’re getting ready to do something with Iran .
We give them a tremendous incentive to have a nuclear weapon and that ’s why Saddam Hussein was betting on the fact that " if I can convince them I have a nuclear weapon they wo n’t come in . "
But we knew he did n’t have one , that ’s why we went in .
Shank :
Has the policy of intervention in the name of nation - building  in Afghanistan , Iraq and possibly now Iran  ultimately served or undermined US interests ?
Paul :
It all undermines our interests .
I do n’t see how anything we ’ve done in the last 50 years has served our interests .
You can go back longer than that .
I ’d go back all the way to Wilson .
The unnecessary involvement in World War I gave us Hitler and World War II and on .
But if you want to start with more recent ones , I think Roosevelt ’s promise to protect Saudi Arabia and prop up secular governments that offended and annoyed the more fundamentalist Arabs and Muslims has been a real thorn in our side .
Then with the Cold War going on , there was a tremendous incentive for our government to use our CIA and our funding to literally set these schools up , the Wahhabi schools , to teach them to fight communism in the name of radical Islam .
I think the term blowback is a very accurate term .
Our policies are ill - advised , maybe well intended .
Some people think we need to do this to have oil , I do n’t .
Once we start to intervene it comes back to haunt us .
Osama bin Laden was an ally and now he ’s our enemy .
Saddam Hussein was an ally , now he ’s our enemy .
I think the founders were right about minding our own business .
Try to get along with people , trade with them , talk to them .
But I do n’t believe in isolating ourselves .
It ’s ironic that they accuse people like me of being isolationist , but yet they have isolated us .
Our current administration has isolated us from the world .
We have fewer friends and more enemies than ever before .
It ’s ironic .
Shank :
How will the rising defense budget and Iraq war spending undermine our economic and political security ?
Paul :
It ’s a major contributing factor to our deficit , and it ’s going to be a big factor in the dollar crisis that I anticipate is coming .
We ’re not talking about a few dollars ; we ’re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars .
In the pipeline this year there ’s close to $ 700 billion dollars , supposedly in the defense of this country .
Yet if you talk to generals you find that the military operation is in shambles , they do n’t have enough personnel , the morale is low , and the equipment is in bad shape .
All this money is doing the opposite of what it should be doing : it hurts our defense , antagonizes our allies , and creates new enemies .
And it ’s very , very costly .
We have to depend , literally , on borrowing from countries like China and Japan .
And that ’ll come to an end .
We ca n’t tax , borrow , and inflate forever .
That ’s what we ’ve been doing , and our obligations are overwhelming .
Although most of the military [ spending ] is more or less immediate , the policy is indefinite and overwhelming .
We ’ve committed ourselves to policing the world .
But if you combine this with the pressure of the entitlements , we ’re talking about $ 50 - 60 trillion dollars that we do n’t have enough wealth [ to cover ] .
We ’re not producing enough wealth to maintain our standard of living .
We have to borrow almost $ 3 billon a day to keep this going .
I think financially it ’s going to lead to problems worse than the 1970s , coming out of Vietnam .
They pretended they had guns and butter , and it ’s the same story again .
Even today ’s statistics show that inflation is alive and well , probably much more alive than the government will admit .
So I think we ’re going to have inflation , a weak dollar , interest rates will eventually go up , the economy is going to remain sluggish , and the only alternative here in Washington is to spend more money .
And I think it ’s going to lead to a disaster .
Shank :
You ’ve said the war on terrorism is " deliberately vague and non-definable to justify and permit perpetual war anywhere . "
Why has the " war on terrorism " received so much traction in Washington , and is this " war " any different from , for example , our " war on communism " ?
Is it more dangerous than any war we ’ve concocted before ?
Paul :
The war on terrorism is broader and more vague .
Before , the war against communism was a little more concrete .
The Soviets were a powerhouse , and they had missiles .
But today , with the war on terrorism … you always have to have a war to frighten the people , to get the people to rally around the flag and sacrifice their liberties and allow the state to do a lot more than they should be doing .
That ’s why I would say that the war on terrorism looks like it ’s going to have a longer life unless somebody can point out the fallacies of the [ administration ’s ] thinking .
To me the war on terrorism is like saying the war on crime .
Of course we ’re all against crime , we ’re all against terrorists .
But if you have a literal war and you send troops all around the world — and since terrorism is not very often committed by the state itself , it ’s just thugs out there , bands of individuals who are killing other people — this justifies anything and everything forever .
That , I think , is very dangerous .
We have accepted this notion that you can make this vague declaration .
It ’s not a real declaration .
You do n’t know who the enemy is .
For people who like the state to grow during wartime , it ’s easy just to declare a war .
Whether it ’s a war on drugs , a war on illiteracy , or a war on whatever , people say " well , it ’s a war ; we have to be willing to sacrifice our liberties and let the government take care of us . "
It ’s a contest between those who want to or enjoy being dependent on the government  or are frightened into it both physically and economically  versus those who believe and understand how a free society is safer and wealthier .
Right now , for most of my lifetime , those who want to be safe and secure and believe government can provide have won out over those of us who believe that we would be safer and we would be more economically secure if we assumed responsibility for ourselves .
Who is going to win that debate ?
We ’re making inroads but we ’re not on the verge of victory .

Since 9/11 , and seemingly without the notice of most Americans , the federal government has assumed the authority to institute martial law , arrest a wide swath of dissidents ( citizen and noncitizen alike ) , and detain people without legal or constitutional recourse in the event of “ an emergency influx of immigrants in the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs . ”
Beginning in 1999 , the government has entered into a series of single - bid contracts with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars , some reportedly equipped with shackles , ostensibly to transport detainees .
According to diplomat and author Peter Dale Scott , the KBR contract is part of a Homeland Security plan titled ENDGAME , which sets as its goal the removal of “ all removable aliens ” and “ potential terrorists . ”
Fraud - busters such as Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , have complained about these contracts , saying that more taxpayer dollars should not go to taxpayer - gouging Halliburton .
But the real question is :
What kind of “ new programs ” require the construction and refurbishment of detention facilities in nearly every state of the union with the capacity to house perhaps millions of people ?
Sect. 1042 of the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) , “ Use of the Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies , ” gives the executive the power to invoke martial law .
For the first time in more than a century , the president is now authorized to use the military in response to “ a natural disaster , a disease outbreak , a terrorist attack or any other condition in which the President determines that domestic violence has occurred to the extent that state officials cannot maintain public order . ”
The Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , rammed through Congress just before the 2006 midterm elections , allows for the indefinite imprisonment of anyone who donates money to a charity that turns up on a list of “ terrorist ” organizations , or who speaks out against the government ’s policies .
The law calls for secret trials for citizens and noncitizens alike .

At Ain't It Cool News an entertainment news website based out of Austin Texas , there has been a talk back with Sylvester Stallone , the last one , January 14th , was titled , " Answering Questions Is As Easy As Breathing - Sly Answers Back ! "
Here , Stallone himself answered ten questions from his fans .
One fan Dr. H from Los Angeles offers insight into the mind of an average American .
He asks why Rambo does n't fight a real enemy in the latest Rambo movie , " I always assumed that if Rambo returned he'd be taking on the real villain of this day : extreme , radical Islamist bastards hellbent on worldwide jihad ... they are clearly the bad guys in the real world right now . "
But in this film , Rambo finds his enemy in " a hellhole beyond your wildest dreams . "
The latest film takes place and was filmed in Burma .
A place that " has had the longest civil war in global history . "
Stallone chose Burma after finding out that " Soldier of Fortune magazine said Burma was the foremost area of human abuse on the planet . "
But this American movie fan wonders where the " real enemy " is , like the blond haired blue eyed Al - Qaeda recruits they reported about on Fox News ?
Before closing Dr. H completes his ignorance with a cliche , and questions Rambo 's intentions , " Has he become politically correct ? "
Stallone gently puts things into perspective , " The phrase ‘ politically correct ’ is basically a euphemism for bold face lying because unfortunately , lies keep society functioning . "
That is what is going on in America today , and Stallone goes even further , " The day we have our politicians actually tell us the real truth , we ’d have anarchy in the streets .
So we ’re told what they think will pacify the masses . "
That is a powerful statement from Stallone , loaded with truth about what is really going on , could all these years of playing John Rambo taught him about the military industrial complex and the plans of the New World Order ?
Let 's see , in Rambo he unveiled the plight of the soldier returning home from the war Vietnam War , to a country that did n't understand or care to understand the affects of the war .
We are introduced to a man that the army turned into a fighting machine .
Rambo II was filmed in Vietnam , where Rambo went back to find POW's , and the government purposefully leaves Rambo and the POW 's behind .
And of course there is Rambo III where he joins the mujahedeen who are fighting the Soviets , consistent with what was really going on in the world , " During most of the 1980 ’s , the CIA secretly sent billions of dollars of military aid to Afghanistan to support the mujahedeen–or holy warriors –against the Soviet Union , which had invaded in 1979 . "
Playing Rambo over the last twenty five years has clearly brought truth to Sylvester Stallone .
He is awake to the lies that the politicians are telling us , and he believes that these hidden truths are powerful enough to cause chaos on the streets of America .
I look forward to the next installment at Ain't It Cool News , perhaps Stallone will reveal some more truth .

Throughout the Second World War , the town of Hillersleben , Germany was home to one of the Third Reich ’s most crucial weapons research centers .
At a sprawling facility nestled in the forested hills , a contingent of 150 engineers and physicists developed and evaluated all manner of experimental weapons , a substantial number of which were ultimately adopted by the Nazi war machine .
When Germany surrendered in May 1945 , the scientists at Hillersleben were forced to abandon an assortment of death - bringing innovations at various stages of completion .
Among these were a rocket - assisted artillery shell which had 50 % more range than standard artillery , a 600 mm mortar which fired one - ton self - propelled projectiles for up to three and a half miles , a modified Tiger tank which could fire 760 - pound rockets up to six miles , and a chain - like projectile made up of small , linked rockets with a range of 100 miles .
But the military masterminds ’ most sinister ambitions were embodied in their behemoth Sonnengewehr , or “ Sun Gun ” project ⁠ — an orbital weapon intended to exact fiery punishment upon the enemies of the Third Reich , forever establishing their dominance over the genetically inferior Untermenschen of the Earth .
The Sun Gun was based on a design originally conceived by Hermann Oberth , a physicist who is widely credited as one of the founding fathers of rocketry and astronautics .
In his 1929 book Wege zur Raumschiffahrt , or “ Ways to Spaceflight , ” Oberth presented a scientific description of a hypothetical manned space station orbiting at an altitude of one thousand kilometers .
He detailed potential construction methods using prefabricated sections , described a rotational cycle to produce centrifugal gravity within the station , and outlined a system for periodic resupply missions .
Oberth advocated the development of these Raumstations to serve as astronomical observatories and telegraph relays , in addition to Earth - observing activities such as meteorology , search - and - rescue , and military intelligence .
What interested the Nazi scientists , however , was his suggestion that a specially engineered 100 - meter - wide concave mirror could be used to reflect sunlight into a concentrated point on the Earth .
But whereas Oberth ’s design had peaceful intentions ⁠ — to use the intense heat to produce electricity with steam turbines⁠ — the nefarious Nazis envisioned a colossal heat ray which could vanquish humanity .
Archimedes and one of his death ray mirrors
The Sun Gun concept was essentially a scaled - up version of Archimedes ’ ancient and oft - debated “ Death Ray . ”
In 212 BCE , the Roman Republic sought to seize the city of Syracuse from its Greek inhabitants .
Some accounts claim that the initial attack was repelled by Archimedes⁠ — the astonishingly talented Greek mathematician , physicist , inventor , and astronomer⁠ — who is said to have used an array of sunlight - concentrating copper mirrors to set the advancing ships aflame .
Many scientific attempts have been made to confirm or deny the feasibility of such a weapon , with varying outcomes .
Most prominently , the myth was “ busted ” on the television program MythBusters in 2006 .
The ‘ Busters found that an array of metal mirrors could indeed ignite a wooden ship , but only after a tactically - tricky exposure of several minutes .
Although the authenticity of the ancient legend is questionable , however , the principle behind it is fundamentally sound .
Using Hermann Oberth ’s 1929 design as a starting point , the optimistic physicists of Hillersleben expanded upon the space - mirror concept considerably .
Their calculations indicated a parabolic mirror of at least three square kilometers to achieve the desired destructive power⁠ — about 100,000 times larger than Archimedes ’ mythical death ray⁠ — and an ideal orbit of 8,200 kilometers .
After considering a number of shiny materials , the scientists settled upon metallic sodium , an element which is relatively abundant among natural compounds .
Under ordinary conditions , pure sodium tarnishes quickly and reacts violently to moisture , however the researchers reasoned that these shortcomings would not pose any problem in the virtually vacuous exosphere .
To heft the pre-built pieces into orbit , engineers planned to employ a beefed - up version of trailblazing - but - treacherous V - 2 rocket which Germany had been using to terrorize London .
This “ A11 ” multi-stage variant⁠ — which was undergoing development at the V - 2 facility in Peenemünde⁠ — was designed by Wernher von Braun to deliver people into space , and to export white - hot Nazi shrapnel to the US .
Inside the living area of the station , electricity would be provided by special steam - driven dynamos which would utilize the heat of raw solar radiation .
The station ’s complement of Nazi astronauts would wear magnetic shoes to accommodate working in weightlessness , and their oxygen would be constantly replenished by vast onboard greenhouses filled with CO2 - thirsty pumpkin plants .
Artist 's impression of the assembly process ( Life magazine , 1945 )
The crew of a fully - assembled Sun Gun station would receive encoded orders via radio or wireless telegraph , while keeping a sharp eye on enemies of the Reich .
When commanded to attack a terrestrial target , the crew would engage a network of rocket thrusters to rotate the massive reflector into a carefully calculated orientation .
Once in position , the mirror ’s curvature would converge the sun ’s mighty rays into a focal point on the Earth ’s surface , pouring a column of raw , super - concentrated solar radiation upon the target site .
Hypothetically this beam would have sufficient heat to scorch away fields , incinerate cities , vaporize reservoirs , and melt screaming onlookers like wax dummies .
Any nation lacking space - capable rockets would be utterly defenseless against the onslaught .
Once the desired destruction threshold was reached , the mirror would be tilted back into a safe orientation , facing away from the Earth .
The project was stalled in the summer spring of ’ 45 , however , as the impending Allied victory became increasingly evident .
American intelligence agencies immediately invoked Operations Overcast and Paperclip to extricate German scientists and equipment ahead of the Soviets .
Lieut .
Col. John A. Keck , chief of the Ordinance Service ’s enemy technical intelligence branch in European theater , led the interrogation of a number of Nazi researchers .
The German engineers described their participation in the development of the V - 2 , and disclosed details regarding several other nearly - perfected technologies : a submarine - based V - 2 launch system , an infrared sniper scope , and an anti-aircraft rocket capable of auto - detonating within ten yards of a target .
In addition , they handed over the schematics and calculations for their formidable Sun Gun concept .
Considering the Nazi scientists ’ other impressive achievements , Lieut .
Col .
Keck and his team of hard - headed engineers took the death star concept seriously .
“ We were impressed with their practical engineering minds , ” Keck said of the Hillersleben researchers , “ and their distaste for the fantastic . ”
Many American scientists , however , were more skeptical Sun Gun ’s feasibility .
Astronomical amounts of time , money , and resources would be required to hoist the hundreds of tons of equipment into orbit , not to mention the million or so tons of metallic sodium .
Furthermore , there were doubts regarding whether a single parabolic mirror could concentrate destructive levels of energy upon such a distant focal point ; though this problem could be overcome by building multiple Sun Guns to operate as an orchestrated orgy of annihilation .
In spite of the monumental scale of the concept , the physicists from Hillersleben were confident that their Sonnengewehr Raumstation was feasible , and that its uninterrupted development could have furnished the Fatherland with global conquest in as little as fifty years .
Solar furnace in Odeillo , France
The weaponization of the sun has still yet to be realized , though similar concepts are used today to collect heat on smaller scales .
Solar furnaces use parabolic mirrors provide heat for cooking , electricity , metal - working , and hydrogen production .
The largest solar furnace in the world is currently located in the commune of Odeillo in the French Pyrenees mountains , where its eight - story - tall array of 10,000 small mirrors concentrates sunlight to produce temperatures up to 3,000 degrees Celsius .
A similar concept is used in solar power towers , where a brigade of mirrors reflect the sun ’s heat onto a central receiver to produce steam for electricity .
Despite appearances , the Hillersleben researchers were not exclusively sinister .
Nestled amongst the heat - ray - of - doom diagrams , scientists included notes describing the space station ’s potential as a radio - relay satellite , a weather observation post , a launch pad for the interstellar rocket expeditions , and of course , Hermann Oberth ’s original vision to use the giant mirror to generate electricity on Earth .
Many German rocket scientists ⁠— including Oberth and Wernher von Braun⁠ — ultimately opted to put science ahead of patriotism , and moved to the US to continue their rocketry research .
In addition to their work with US missile defense systems , many of the men went to work for the fledgling space program in the 1950s .
The rocket originally slated to carry the Sun Gun segments into space ⁠ — Von Braun ’s A11⁠ — eventually became the foundation for the Saturn V , the engine which carried the Apollo astronauts into orbit for the moon missions of 1969 - 1972 .
It seems that through hard work and perseverance , these pioneers of rocketry finally managed to hit their ultimate goal :
The stars .
And occasionally , London .
Just take me down to the solutions , please .
Creating a horizontal row of objects that are equidistant from each other is another one of those things in web design that is much more difficult than it should be .
This can be a very useful thing to do , especially in fluid width layouts when you are trying to make the most of whatever horizontal space you have .
Here are the goals we are trying to achieve :
The left - most object is left aligned with it ’s parent element .
with it ’s parent element .
The right - most object is right aligned with it ’s parent element .
with it ’s parent element .
Each object is equidistant from one another at all times .
from one another at all times .
The objects will stop short of overlapping each other as the browser window narrows .
each other as the browser window narrows .
The objects will not wrap down as the browser window narrows .
down as the browser window narrows .
The technique will work in a fluid width environment .
Even one that is centered .
I tried a number of different techniques to try and achieve this .
Let ’s go through all my failures and then to the final technique which seems to work pretty good .
FAIL : Give each object a percentage left position
First I gave each image a unique class :
< img src=" images/shape-red.png " class= " first-r " > < img src=" images/shape-green.png " class= " second-r " > < img src=" images/shape-yellow.png " class = " third - r " > < img src=" images/shape-blue.png " class= " fourth- r " >
Then I gave percentage - based left positioning to each of those classes :
img .
first-r { left : 0 % ; position : relative ; } img.second -r { left : 25 % ; position : relative ; } img. third -r { left : 50 % ; position : relative ; } img. third -r { left : 75 % ; position : relative ; }
Notice the relative positioning .
This is required to get the left - most image to respect the parent element assuming the content is centered and not left - aligned .
The problem with this is that the left margin being applied to the right - most object is 75 % of the browser window width , but applied starting at the left of the parent element not the browser window .
This can cause the right - most element to push off the screen ( not respecting the right edge of the parent element ) .
Also , inexplicably , these element will eventually wrap if you move the browser window narrow enough .
If you switch to absolute positioning here , you solve some of the above problem but then your objects will be left - aligned and ignore the parent elements left position entirely .
Also , at narrow enough browser window sizes , the images will overlap .
But hey , at least the objects were equidistant !
FAIL : Give the objects a common left percentage margin
My next stab was to give each element , except the first one , a common percentage left margin .
< span class = " do - not - wrap " > < img src=" images/shape-red.png " > < img src=" images/shape-green.png " class= " mover " > < img src=" images/shape-yellow.png " class= " mover " > < img src=" images/shape-blue.png " class= " mover " > </ span >
Applying the margin :
img .mover { margin - left : 15 % ; }
You should be able to tell from looking at that percentage that this technique is doomed .
I just picked a percentage that seemed to work best .
There is nothing mathematical I could think of that would work here .
Because the parent element is a percentage of the width of the browser window , and the margin is a percentage of the browser window not the parent element , the growth rates will be very difficult to match .
Also notice the “ no - wrap ” span , which is necessary to prevent … wait for it … wrapping .
But hey , at least the objects were equidistant !
FAIL : Just use a table !
Even “ throwing in the towel ” on CSS does n’t seem to work here .
I thought this would work for sure , being that tables have that sometimes - useful - sometimes - infuriating ability to auto space it ’s cells evenly .
< table > < tr> < td class = " leftalign " > < img src=" images/shape-red.png " >
</td > < td> < img src=" images/shape-green.png " >
</td > < td> < img src=" images/shape-yellow.png " > </td > < td class= " rightalign " > < img src=" images/shape-blue.png " >
</td > </tr> </table >
Notice the extra align classes in the first and last cells .
If all the cells are centered , that allows the objects to be equidistant but then neither the left object or the right object is aligned to the edge of the parent element .
This is solveable by applying a left alignment to the left - most cell and a right alignment to the right - most cell — but then the objects are no longer equidistant .
Back to the drawing board .
PASS : Flexbox Justification
I ’m adding this in June 2015 ( seven years later ! ) because it ’s the best solution ( if you ’re able to use flexbox ) .
< div class= " container " > < div></div > < div></div > < div></div > < div></div > </div >​
. container { display : flex ; justify - content : space - between ; }
See the Pen Equidistant Objects by Chris Coyier ( @chriscoyier ) on CodePen .
PASS : First on the left , float the rest right in equal size boxes
Fortunately the table idea sparked some thought .
The first image needs to be left aligned , but all the rest of them could be right - aligned .
In fact , if they are , and also inside of boxes that divide the rest of that space evenly , that might just do it .
Perhaps this is best explained visually :
HTML :
< img src=" images/shape-red.png " > < div id =" movers-row " > < div >< img src=" images/shape-green.png " ></div > < div><img src=" images/shape-yellow.png " ></div > < div><img src=" images/shape-blue.png " ></div> </div >
CSS :
#movers - row { margin : - 120 px 0 0 120 px ; } #movers - row div { width : 33.3 % ; float : left ; } #movers - row div img { float : right ; }
There is an example page , where I was working this .
It ’s not pretty … but you can see the winner on the bottom .
I ’m sure some of you all have some better solutions for this , so let me have it !
PASS : Using inline - block and justified text
This can be done by setting the elements to display : inline - block ; and the parent element to text - align : justify ; .
Well , it ’s slightly more complicated and what I ’d call a bona fide CSS trick .
You add an additional element ( via pseudo element ) that is 100 % wide and the previous inline blocks will line up .
< div id =" container " > < div></div > < div></div > < div></div > < div></div > </div >​
# container { height : 125 px ; text - align : justify ; border : 10 px solid black ; font - size : 0.1 px ; /* IE 9/10 do n't like font - size : 0 ; */ min-width : 600 px ; } #container div { width : 150 px ; height : 125 px ; display : inline - block ; background : red ; } #container : after { content : '' ; width : 100 % ; /* Ensures there are at least 2 lines of text , so justification works */ display : inline - block ; }

Neocons believe US intelligence community too timid after Iraq David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday December 4 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Following its botched reports about Iraq 's weapons capabilities , the US intelligence community is now too gun-shy to get it right about Iran , according to some hawkish conservatives who have advocated possible military intervention against the country .
Newly declassified portions of a new National Intelligence Estimate -- which indicates that Iran is no longer actively developing a nuclear weapon -- are part of an effort by the US intelligence community to avoid a repeat of its mistakes in the run-up to war with Iraq , former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton told Fox News .
" They 're so concerned about overstating the threat in Iraq , that they 're overcompensating in the wrong direction , " Bolton said .
" You know they 've changed their estimate on Iran from just two years ago .
One has to ask why we should be more inclined to believe this one today than the one two years ago . "
A 2005 NIE reported Iran was " determined " develop nuclear capability .
Bolton characterized the White House as having been taken aback by the new NIE report 's conclusions .
" I think they were floored by it , since it 's inconsistent with what the intelligence community was telling them as recently as a week ago , " he said .
" In fact , members of the House and Senate were briefed on this last week , and there was no mention of the suspension point .
So , I think there are some questions that need to be raised about how this thing was put together and what its conclusions are . "
He also contends that there is that there is a whiff of politics to the NIE summary .
" I think there is a risk here , and I raise this as a question , whether people in the intelligence community who had their own agenda on Iran for some time now , have politicized this intelligence and politicized these judgments in a way contrary to where the administration was going , " said Bolton .
" I think somebody needs to look at that . "
Neoconservative columnist Norman Podhoretz also has " dark suspicions " about the new report , and suggests that the intelligence community 's current beliefs about Iran amount to a calculated reverse image of it's determinations about Iraq .
" I must confess to suspecting that the intelligence community , having been excoriated for supporting the then universal belief that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction , is now bending over backward to counter what has up to now been a similarly universal view ... that Iran is hell - bent on developing nuclear weapons , " writes Podhoretz in a Commentary Magazine column published Monday .
" I also suspect that , having been excoriated as well for minimizing the time it would take Saddam to add nuclear weapons to his arsenal , the intelligence community is now bending over backward to maximize the time it will take Iran to reach the same goal . "
Podhoretz goes on to suggest that intelligence agencies may also harbor political motivations to thwart Bush administration policy goals .
" But I entertain an even darker suspicion , " he adds .
" It is that the intelligence community , which has for some years now been leaking material calculated to undermine George W. Bush , is doing it again . "

A study from Texas - based research firm Parks Associates predicts that 33 million US households will have broadband connections of 10 M bps or faster by 2012 .
As of the end of 2007 , that figure stood at 5.7 million , which means that a lot of change will have to occur in the US market for that 33 million figure to become a reality .
There are two competing factors at play , according to Parks .
First is the arrival of technologies like DOCSIS 3.0 that will make 10 M bps + speeds more widely available .
Comcast has big plans this year for DOCSIS 3.0 , which could lead to download speeds of over 100 Mbps .
Other cable companies are likely to follow suit soon , since upgrading their networks is n't prohibitively expensive .
" Moving to DOCSIS 3.0 is not that bad of a capital investment , " Larry Socher , an executive in Accenture 's Communications & High Tech Operating Group , told Ars .
" It 's a lot less painful to deploy DOCSIS 3.0 than FTTH [ fiber - to - the - home ] or even FTTN [ fiber - to - the - node ] . "
Fiber is the other factor .
Both Verizon and AT&T are heavily invested in fiber - centric network upgrades , with Verizon 's FiOS running it directly to the home and AT&T stopping at the node with U - Verse .
Combined , the fiber projects of the two telecoms will pass well over 30 million homes by 2010 .
But Parks Associates sees clouds on the high - bandwidth horizon .
Broadband providers need to do a better job with traffic management and managing net neutrality issues for the 33 million milestone to be reached .
Socher agrees .
" [ Broadband ] operators [ need to ] do a better job of educating the public that ... the entire neighborhood is subsidizing one or two kids doing P2P traffic . "
Although ISPs have lined up to support Comcast in the Federal Communication Commission 's investigation into the cable company 's traffic management practices , Verizon has always been happy to talk smack about the bandwidth constraints faced by cable ISPs .
Socher believes that all broadband ISPs need to be on the same page when it comes to both traffic management and being transparent with their customers .
" It 's in all of their interests to work together , " he told Ars .
" Ultimately , it 's going to drive value to all of them and increase the size of the pie . "
Given the advent of DOCSIS 3.0 in the US and the continued rollout of FiOS and U - verse , the 33 million figure given by Parks is a very real possibility for 2012 .
Unfortunately , the 10 M bps - plus goodness is unlikely to be spread around evenly .
In areas where a fiber - loving telecom is going head - to - head with a cable company ( think Verizon FiOS vs. Comcast High Speed Internet in Boston ) , we 'll see a concentration of homes with superfast broadband .
But those living in areas with little high - speed competition ( like Denver , which is served by Qwest ) are likely to be stuck with single - digit broadband speeds when 2012 rolls around .

Interception Capabilities 2000 Report to the Director General for Research of the European Parliament
( Scientific and Technical Options Assessment programme office )
on the development of surveillance technology and risk of abuse of economic information .
This study considers the state of the art in Communications intelligence ( Comint ) of
automated processing for intelligence purposes of intercepted broadband multi-language leased or
common carrier systems , and its applicability to Comint targeting and selection , including speech recognition .
Report by : Duncan Campbell , IPTV Ltd
Edinburgh , Scotland : April , 1999 Mailto : [ email protected ]
Illustration : 30 metre antennae at the Composite Signals Organisation Station , Morwenstow , England ,
intercepting communications from Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean regional satellites .
( D Campbell )
1. Communications intelligence ( Comint ) involving the covert interception of foreign communications has been practised by almost every advanced nation since international telecommunications became available .
Comint is a large - scale industrial activity providing consumers with intelligence on diplomatic , economic and scientific developments .
The capabilities of and constraints on Comint activity may usefully be considered in the framework of the " intelligence cycle " ( section 1 ) .
2. Globally , about 15 - 20 billion Euro is expended annually on Comint and related activities .
The largest component of this expenditure is incurred by the major English - speaking nations of the UKUSA alliance .
( 1 ) This report describes how Comint organisations have for more than 80 years made arrangements to obtain access to much of the world 's international communications .
These include the unauthorised interception of commercial satellites , of long distance communications from space , of undersea cables using submarines , and of the Internet .
In excess of 120 satellite systems are currently in simultaneous operation collecting intelligence ( section 2 ) .
3 . The highly automated UKUSA system for processing Comint , often known as ECHELON , has been widely discussed within Europe following a 1997 STOA report .
( 2 ) That report summarised information from the only two primary sources then available on ECHELON .
( 3 ) This report provides original new documentary and other evidence about the ECHELON system and its involvement in the interception of communication satellites ( section 3 ) .
A technical annexe give a supplementary , detailed description of Comint processing methods .
4. Comint information derived from the interception of international communications has long been routinely used to obtain sensitive data concerning individuals , governments , trade and international organisations .
This report sets out the organisational and reporting frameworks within which economically sensitive information is collected and disseminated , summarising examples where European commercial organisations have been the subject of surveillance ( section 4 ) .
5 . This report identifies a previously unknown international organisation - " ILETS " - which has , without parliamentary or public discussion or awareness , put in place contentious plans to require manufacturers and operators of new communications systems to build in monitoring capacity for use by national security or law enforcement organisations ( section 5 ) .
6 . Comint organisations now perceive that the technical difficulties of collecting communications are increasing , and that future production may be costlier and more limited than at present .
The perception of such difficulties may provide a useful basis for policy options aimed at protective measures concerning economic information and effective encryption ( section 6 ) .
7 . Key findings concerning the state of the art in Comint include :
Comprehensive systems exist to access , intercept and process every important modern form of communications , with few exceptions ( section 2 , technical annexe ) ; Contrary to reports in the press , effective " word spotting " search systems automatically to select telephone calls of intelligence interest are not yet available , despite 30 years of research .
However , speaker recognition systems - in effect , " voiceprints " - have been developed and are deployed to recognise the speech of targeted individuals making international telephone calls ;
Recent diplomatic initiatives by the United States government seeking European agreement to the " key escrow " system of cryptography masked intelligence collection requirements , and formed part of a long - term program which has undermined and continues to undermine the communications privacy of non-US nationals , including European governments , companies and citizens ;
There is wide - ranging evidence indicating that major governments are routinely utilising communications intelligence to provide commercial advantage to companies and trade .
1. Organisations and methods
What is communications intelligence ?
1. Communications intelligence ( Comint ) is defined by NSA , the largest agency conducting such operations as " technical and intelligence information derived from foreign communications by other than their intended recipient " .
( 4 ) Comint is a major component of Sigint ( signals intelligence ) , which also includes the collection of non-communications signals , such as radar emissions .
( 5 ) Although this report deals with agencies and systems whose overall task may be Sigint , it is concerned only with Comint .
2. Comint has shadowed the development of extensive high capacity new civil telecommunications systems , and has in consequence become a large - scale industrial activity employing many skilled workers and utilising exceptionally high degrees of automation .
3 . The targets of Comint operations are varied .
The most traditional Comint targets are military messages and diplomatic communications between national capitals and missions abroad .
Since the 1960s , following the growth of world trade , the collection of economic intelligence and information about scientific and technical developments has been an increasingly important aspect of Comint .
More recent targets include narcotics trafficking , money laundering , terrorism and organised crime .
4 . Whenever access to international communications channels is obtained for one purpose , access to every other type of communications carried on the same channels is automatic , subject only to the tasking requirements of agencies .
Thus , for example , NSA and its British counterpart GCHQ , used Comint collected primarily for other purposes to provide data about domestic political opposition figures in the United States between 1967 and 1975 .
UKUSA alliance
5 . The United States Sigint System ( USSS ) consists of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , military support units collectively called the Central Security Service , and parts of the CIA and other organisations .
Following wartime collaboration , in 1947 the UK and the US made a secret agreement to continue to conduct collaborative global Comint activities .
Three other English - speaking nations , Canada , Australia and New Zealand joined the UKUSA agreement as " Second Parties " .
The UKUSA agreement was not acknowledged publicly until March 1999 , when the Australian government confirmed that its Sigint organisation , Defence Signals Directorate ( DSD ) " does co-operate with counterpart signals intelligence organisations overseas under the UKUSA relationship " .
(6 ) The UKUSA agreement shares facilities , tasks and product between participating governments .
6. Although UKUSA Comint agency staffs and budgets have shrunk following the end of the cold war , they have reaffirmed their requirements for access to all the world 's communications .
Addressing NSA staff on his departure in 1992 , then NSA director Admiral William Studeman described how " the demands for increased global access are growing " .
The " business area " of " global access " was , he said , one of " two , hopefully strong , legs upon which NSA must stand " in the next century . ( 7 )
Other Comint organisations
7. Besides UKUSA , there at least 30 other nations operating major Comint organisations .
The largest is the Russian FAPSI , with 54,000 employees .
(8) China maintains a substantial Sigint system , two stations of which are directed at Russia and operate in collaboration with the United States .
Most Middle Eastern and Asian nations have invested substantially in Sigint , in particular Israel , India and Pakistan .
How intelligence works
8 . In the post cold war era , Comint interception has been constrained by recognisable industrial features , including the requirement to match budgets and capabilities to customer requirements .
The multi-step process by means of which communications intelligence is sought , collected , processed and passed on is similar for all countries , and is often described as the " intelligence cycle " .
The steps of the intelligence cycle correspond to distinct organisational and technical features of Comint production .
Thus , for example , the administration of NSA 's largest field station in the world , at Menwith Hill in England and responsible for operating over 250 classified projects , is divided into three directorates : OP , Operations and Plans ; CP , Collection Processing ; and EP , Exploitation and Production .
Planning
9 . Planning first involves determining customer requirements .
Customers include the major ministries of the sponsoring government - notably those concerned with defence , foreign affairs , security , trade and home affairs .
The overall management of Comint involves the identification of requirements for data as well as translating requirements into potentially achievable tasks , prioritising , arranging analysis and reporting , and monitoring the quality of Comint product .
10 .
Once targets have been selected , specific existing or new collection capabilities may be tasked , based on the type of information required , the susceptibility of the targeted activity to collection , and the likely effectiveness of collection .
Access and collection
11 . The first essential of Comint is access to the desired communications medium so that communications may be intercepted .
Historically , where long - range radio communications were used , this task was simple .
Some important modern communications systems are not " Comint friendly " and may require unusual , expensive or intrusive methods to gain access .
The physical means of communication is usually independent of the type of information carried .
For example , inter-city microwave radio - relay systems , international satellite links and fibre optic submarine cables will all usually carry mixed traffic of television , telephone , fax , data links , private voice , video and data .
12 . Collection follows interception , but is a distinct activity in that many types of signals may be intercepted but will receive no further processing save perhaps technical searches to verify that communications patterns remain unchanged .
For example , a satellite interception station tasked to study a newly launched communications satellite will set up an antenna to intercept all that the satellite sends to the ground .
Once a survey has established which parts of the satellite 's signals carry , say , television or communications of no interest , these signals will not progress further within the system .
13 . Collection includes both acquiring information by interception and passing information of interest downstream for processing and production .
Because of the high information rates used in many modern networks , and the complexity of the signals within them , it is now common for high speed recorders or " snapshot " memories temporarily to hold large quantities of data while processing takes place .
Modern collection activities use secure , rapid communications to pass data via global networks to human analysts who may be a continent away .
Selecting messages for collection and processing is in most cases automated , involving large on - line databanks holding information about targets of interest .
Processing
14 . Processing is the conversion of collected information into a form suitable for analysis or the production of intelligence , either automatically or under human supervision .
Incoming communications are normally converted into standard formats identifying their technical characteristics , together with message ( or signal ) related information ( such as the telephone numbers of the parties to a telephone conversation ) .
15 .
At an early stage , if it is not inherent in the selection of the message or conversation , each intercepted signal or channel will be described in standard " case notation " .
Case notation first identifies the countries whose communications have been intercepted , usually by two letters .
A third letter designates the general class of communications : C for commercial carrier intercepts , D for diplomatic messages , P for police channels , etc .
A fourth letter designates the type of communications system ( such as S for multi- channel ) .
Numbers then designate particular links or networks .
Thus for example , during the 1980s NSA intercepted and processed traffic designated as " FRD " ( French diplomatic ) from Chicksands , England , while the British Comint agency GCHQ deciphered " ITD " ( Italian diplomatic ) messages at its Cheltenham headquarters . ( 9 )
16 . Processing may also involve translation or " gisting " ( replacing a verbatim text with the sense or main points of a communication ) .
Translation and gisting can to some degree be automated .
Production and dissemination
17 . Comint production involves analysis , evaluation , translation and interpretation of raw data into finished intelligence .
The final step of the intelligence cycle is dissemination , meaning the passing of reports to the intelligence consumers .
Such reports can consist of raw ( but decrypted and / or translated ) messages , gists , commentary , or extensive analyses .
The quality and relevance of the disseminated reports lead in turn to the re-specification of intelligence collection priorities , thereby completing the intelligence cycle .
18 . The nature of dissemination is highly significant to questions of how Comint is exploited to obtain economic advantage .
Comint activities everywhere are highly classified because , it is argued , knowledge of the success of interception would be likely to lead targets to change their communications methods to defeat future interception .
Within the UKUSA system , the dissemination of Comint reports is limited to individuals holding high - level security " SCI " clearances .
( 10 ) Further , because only cleared officials can see Comint reports , only they can set requirements and thus control tasking .
Officials of commercial companies normally neither have clearance nor routine access to Comint , and may therefore only benefit from commercially relevant Comint information to the extent that senior , cleared government officials permit .
The ways in which this takes place is described in Section 5 , below .
19 . Dissemination is further restricted within the UKUSA organisation by national and international rules generally stipulating that the Sigint agencies of each nation may not normally collect or ( if inadvertently collected ) record or disseminate information about citizens of , or companies registered in , any other UKUSA nation .
Citizens and companies are collectively known as " legal persons " .
The opposite procedure is followed if the person concerned has been targeted by their national Comint organisation .
20 .
For example , Hager has described ( 11 ) how New Zealand officials were instructed to remove the names of identifiable UKUSA citizens or companies from their reports , inserting instead words such as " a Canadian citizen " or " a US company " .
British Comint staff have described following similar procedures in respect of US citizens following the introduction of legislation to limit NSA 's domestic intelligence activities in 1978 .
( 12 ) The Australian government says that " DSD and its counterparts operate internal procedures to satisfy themselves that their national interests and policies are respected by the others ... the Rules [ on Sigint and Australian persons ] prohibit the dissemination of information relating to Australian persons gained accidentally during the course of routine collection of foreign communications ; or the reporting or recording of the names of Australian persons mentioned in foreign communications " .
( 13 )
The corollary is also true ; UKUSA nations place no restrictions on intelligence gathering affecting either citizens or companies of any non-UKUSA nation , including member states of the European Union ( except the UK ) .
2. Intercepting international communications
International Leased Carrier ( ILC ) communications
21 . It is a matter of record that foreign communications to and from , or passing through the United Kingdom and the United States have been intercepted for more than 80 years .
( 14 ) Then and since , most international communications links have been operated by international carriers , who are usually individual national PTTs or private companies .
In either case , capacity on the communication system is leased to individual national or international telecommunications undertakings .
For this reason , Comint organisations use the term ILC ( International Leased Carrier ) to describe such collection .
High frequency radio
22 . Save for direct landline connections between geographically contiguous nations , high frequency ( HF ) radio system were the most common means of international telecommunications prior to 1960 , and were in use for ILC , diplomatic and military purposes .
An important characteristic of HF radio signals is that they are reflected from the ionosphere and from the earth 's surface , providing ranges of thousands of miles .
This enables both reception and interception .
Microwave radio relay
23 . Microwave radio was introduced in the 1950s to provide high capacity inter-city communications for telephony , telegraphy and , later , television .
Microwave radio relay communications utilise low power transmitters and parabolic dish antennae placed on towers in high positions such as on hilltops or tall buildings .
The antennae are usually 1 - 3 m in diameter .
Because of the curvature of the earth , relay stations are generally required every 30 - 50 km .
Subsea cables
24 . Submarine telephone cables provided the first major reliable high capacity international communications systems .
Early systems were limited to a few hundred simultaneous telephone channels .
The most modern optical fibre systems carry up to 5 Gbps ( Gigabits per second ) of digital information .
This is broadly equivalent to about 60,000 simultaneous telephone channels .
Communications satellites
25 . Microwave radio signals are not reflected from the ionosphere and pass directly into space .
This property has been exploited both to provide global communications and , conversely , to intercept such communications in space and on land .
The largest constellation of communications satellites ( COMSATs ) is operated by the International Telecommunications Satellite organisation ( Intelsat ) , an international treaty organisation .
To provide permanent communications from point to point or for broadcasting purposes , communications satellites are placed into so - called " geostationary " orbits such that , to the earth - based observer , they appear to maintain the same position in the sky .
26 . The first geostationary Intelsat satellites were orbited in 1967 .
Satellite technology developed rapidly .
The fourth generation of Intelsat satellites , introduced in 1971 , provided capacity for 4,000 simulataneous telephone channels and were capable of handling all forms of communications simultaneously - telephone , telex , telegraph , television , data and facsimile .
In 1999 , Intelsat operated 19 satellites of its 5th to 8th generations .
The latest generation can handle the equivalent to 90,000 simultaneous calls .
Communications techniques
27 . Prior to 1970 , most communications systems ( however carried ) utilised analogue or continuous wave techniques .
Since 1990 , almost all communications have been digital , and are providing ever higher capacity .
The highest capacity systems in general use for the Internet , called STM - 1 or OC - 3 , operates at a data rate of 155 Mbs .
( Million bits per second ; a rate of 155 Mbps is equivalent to sending 3 million words every second , roughly the text of one thousand books a minute . )
For example , links at this capacity are used to provide backbone Internet connections between Europe and the United States .
Further details of communications techniques are given in the technical annexe .
ILC communications collection Access
28 . Comint collection cannot take place unless the collecting agency obtains access to the communications channels they wish to examine .
Information about the means used to gain access are , like data about code - breaking methods , the most highly protected information within any Comint organisation .
Access is gained both with and without the complicity or co-operation of network operators .
Operation SHAMROCK
29 .
From 1945 onwards in the United States the NSA and predecessor agencies systematically obtained cable traffic from the offices of the major cable companies .
This activity was codenamed SHAMROCK .
These activities remained unknown for 30 years , until enquiries were prompted by the Watergate affair .
On 8 August 1975 , NSA Director Lt General Lew Allen admitted to the Pike Committee of the US House of Representatives that :
" NSA systematically intercepts international communications , both voice and cable " .
30 .
He also admitted that " messages to and from American citizens have been picked up in the course of gathering foreign intelligence " .
US legislators considered that such operations might have been unconstitutional .
During 1976 , a Department of Justice team investigated possible criminal offences by NSA .
Part of their report was released in 1980 .
It described how intelligence on US citizens :
" was obtained incidentally in the course of NSA 's interception of aural and non-aural ( e.g. , telex ) international communications and the receipt of GCHQ - acquired telex and ILC ( International Leased Carrier ) cable traffic ( SHAMROCK ) " ( emphasis in original ) .
( 15 ) High frequency radio interception antenna ( AN / FLR9 ) DODJOCC sign at NSA station , Chicksands
High frequency radio interception
31 . High frequency radio signals are relatively easy to intercept , requiring only a suitable area of land in , ideally , a " quiet " radio environment .
From 1945 until the early 1980s , both NSA and GCHQ operated HF radio interception systems tasked to collect European ILC communications in Scotland . ( 16 )
32 . The most advanced type of HF monitoring system deployed during this period for Comint purposes was a large circular antenna array known as AN / FLR - 9 .
AN / FLR - 9 antennae are more than 400 metres in diameter .
They can simultaneously intercept and determine the bearing of signals from as many directions and on as many frequencies as may be desired .
In 1964 , AN / FLR - 9 receiving systems were installed at San Vito dei Normanni , Italy ; Chicksands , England , and Karamursel , Turkey .
33 .
In August 1966 , NSA transferred ILC collection activities from its Scottish site at Kirknewton , to Menwith Hill in England .
Ten years later , this activity was again transferred , to Chicksands .
Although the primary function of the Chicksands site was to intercept Soviet and Warsaw Pact air force communications , it was also tasked to collect ILC and " NDC " ( Non -US Diplomatic Communications ) .
Prominent among such tasks was the collection of FRD traffic ( i.e. , French diplomatic communications ) .
Although most personnel at Chicksands were members of the US Air Force , diplomatic and ILC interception was handled by civilian NSA employees in a unit called DODJOCC . ( 17 )
34 . During the 1970s , British Comint units on Cyprus were tasked to collect HF communications of allied NATO nations , including Greece and Turkey .
The interception took place at a British army unit at Ayios Nikolaos , eastern Cyprus . ( 18 ) In the United States in 1975 , investigations by a US Congressional Committee revealed that NSA was collecting diplomatic messages sent to and from Washington from an army Comint site at Vint Hill Farms , Virginia .
The targets of this station included the United Kingdom . ( 19 )
Space interception of inter-city networks
35 . Long distance microwave radio relay links may require dozens of intermediate stations to receive and re-transmit communications .
Each subsequent receiving station picks up only a tiny fraction of the original transmitted signal ; the remainder passes over the horizon and on into space , where satellites can collect it .
These principles were exploited during the 1960s to provide Comint collection from space .
The nature of microwave " spillage " means that the best position for such satellites is not above the chosen target , but up to 80 degrees of longitude away .
36 .
The first US Comint satellite , CANYON , was launched In August 1968 , followed soon by a second .
The satellites were controlled from a ground station at Bad Aibling , Germany .
In order to provide permanent coverage of selected targets , CANYON satellites were placed close to geostationary orbits .
However , the orbits were not exact , causing the satellites to change position and obtain more data on ground targets .
( 20 ) Seven CANYON satellites were launched between 1968 and 1977 .
37 . CANYON 's target was the Soviet Union .
Major Soviet communications links extended for thousands of miles , much of it over Siberia , where permafrost restricted the reliable use of underground cables .
Geographical circumstances thus favoured NSA by making Soviet internal communications links highly accessible .
The satellites performed better than expected , so the project was extended .
38 .
The success of CANYON led to the design and deployment of a new class of Comint satellites , CHALET .
The ground station chosen for the CHALET series was Menwith Hill , England .
Under NSA project P - 285 , US companies were contracted to install and assist in operating the satellite control system and downlinks ( RUNWAY ) and ground processing system ( SILKWORTH ) .
The first two CHALET satellites were launched in June 1978 and October 1979 .
After the name of the first satellite appeared in the US press , they were renamed VORTEX .
In 1982 , NSA obtained approval for expanded " new mission requirements " and were given funds and facilities to operate four VORTEX satellites simultaneously .
A new 5,000 m2 operations centre ( STEEPLEBUSH ) was constructed to house processing equipment .
When the name VORTEX was published in 1987 , the satellites were renamed MERCURY . ( 21 )
39 .
The expanded mission given to Menwith Hill after 1985 included MERCURY collection from the Middle East .
The station received an award for support to US naval operations in the Persian Gulf from 1987 to 1988 .
In 1991 , a further award was given for support of the Iraqi war operations , Desert Storm and Desert Shield .
( 22 ) Menwith
Hill is now the major US site for Comint collection against its major ally , Israel .
Its staff includes linguists trained in Hebrew , Arabic and Farsi as well as European languages .
Menwith
Hill has recently been expanded to include ground links for a new network of Sigint satellites launched in 1994 and 1995 ( RUTLEY ) .
The name of the new class of satellites remains unknown .
Sigint satellites
40 .
The CIA developed a second class of Sigint satellite with complementary capabilities over the period from 1967 to 1985 .
Initially known as RHYOLITE and later AQUACADE , these satellites were operated from a remote ground station in central Australia , Pine Gap .
Using a large parabolic antenna which unfolded in space , RHYOLITE intercepted lower frequency signals in the VHF and UHF bands .
Larger , most recent satellites of this type have been named MAGNUM and then ORION .
Their targets include telemetry , VHF radio , cellular mobile phones , paging signals , and mobile data links .
41 . A third class of satellite , known first as JUMPSEAT and latterly as TRUMPET , operates in highly elliptical near - polar orbits enabling them to " hover " for long period over high northern latitudes .
They enable the United States to collect signals from transmitters in high northern latitudes poorly covered by MERCURY or ORION , and also to intercept signals sent to Russian communications satellites in the same orbits .
Comint satellites in geostationary orbits , such as VORTEX , intercept terrestial microwave spillage Inter - city microwave radio relay tower pills " signals into space
42 . Although precise details of US space - based Sigint satellites launched after 1990 remain obscure , it is apparent from observation of the relevant ground centres that collection systems have expanded rather than contracted .
The main stations are at Buckley Field , Denver , Colorado ; Pine Gap , Australia ; Menwith Hill , England ; and Bad Aibling , Germany .
The satellites and their processing facilities are exceptionally costly ( of the order of $ 1 billion US each ) .
In 1998 , the US National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) announced plans to combine the three separate classes of Sigint satellites into an Integrated Overhead Sigint Architecture ( IOSA ) in order to " improve Sigint performance and avoid costs by consolidating systems , utilising ... new satellite and data processing technologies " . ( 23 )
43 .
It follows that , within constraints imposed by budgetary limitation and tasking priorities , the United States can if it chooses direct space collection systems to intercept mobile communications signals and microwave city - to - city traffic anywhere on the planet .
The geographical and processing difficulties of collecting messages simultaneously from all parts of the globe suggest strongly that the tasking of these satellites will be directed towards the highest priority national and military targets .
Thus , although European communications passing on inter-city microwave routes can be collected , it is likely that they are normally ignored .
But it is very highly probable that communications to or from Europe and which pass through the microwave communications networks of Middle Eastern states are collected and processed .
44 . No other nation ( including the former Soviet Union ) has deployed satellites comparable to CANYON , RHYOLITE , or their successors .
Both Britain ( project ZIRCON ) and France ( project ZENON ) have attempted to do so , but neither persevered .
After 1988 the British government purchased capacity on the US VORTEX ( now MERCURY ) constellation to use for unilateral national purposes . ( 24 ) A senior UK Liaison Officer and staff from GCHQ work at Menwith Hill NSA station and assist in tasking and operating the satellites .
COMSAT ILC collection
45 . Systematic collection of COMSAT ILC communications began in 1971 .
Two ground stations were built for this purpose .
The first at Morwenstow , Cornwall , England had two 30 - metre antennae .
One intercepted communications from the Atlantic Ocean Intelsat ; the other the Indian Ocean Intelsat .
The second Intelsat interception site was at Yakima , Washington in the northwestern United States .
NSA 's " Yakima Research Station " intercepted communications passing through the Pacific Ocean Intelsat satellite .
46 . ILC interception capability against western - run communications satellites remained at this level until the late 1970s , when a second US site at Sugar Grove , West Virginia was added to the network .
By 1980 , its three satellite antenna had been reassigned to the US Naval Security Group and were used for COMSAT interception .
Large - scale expansion of the ILC satellite interception system took place between 1985 and 1995 , in conjunction with the enlargement of the ECHELON processing system ( section 3 ) .
New stations were constructed in the United States ( Sabana Seca , Puerto Rico ) , Canada ( Leitrim , Ontario ) , Australia ( Kojarena , Western Australia ) and New Zealand ( Waihopai , South Island ) .
Capacity at Yakima , Morwenstow and Sugar Grove was expanded , and continues to expand .
Based on a simple count of the number of antennae currently installed at each COMSAT interception or satellite SIGINT station , it appears that the UKUSA nations are between them currently operating at least 120 satellite based collection systems .
The approximate number of antennae in each category are :
- Tasked on western commercial communications satellites ( ILC ) 40 - Controlling space based signals intelligence satellites
30 - Currently or formerly tasked on Soviet communications satellites 50
Systems in the third category may have been reallocated to ILC tasks since the end of the cold war . ( 25 )
47 . Other nations increasingly collect Comint from satellites .
Russia 's FAPSI operates large ground collection sites at Lourdes , Cuba and at Cam Ranh Bay , Vietnam .
( 26 ) Germany 's BND and France 's DGSE are alleged to collaborate in the operation of a COMSAT collection site at Kourou , Guyana , targeted on " American and South American satellite communications " .
DGSE is also said to have COMSAT collection sites at Domme ( Dordogne , France ) , in New Caledonia , and in the United Arab Emirates .
( 27 ) The Swiss intelligence service has recently announced a plan for two COMSAT interception stations . ( 28 )
Satellite ground terminal at Etam , West Virginia connecting Europe and the US via Intelsat IV GCHQ constructed an identical " shadow " station in 1972 to intercept Intelsat messages for UKUSA
Submarine cable interception
48 . Submarine cables now play a dominant role in international telecommunications , since - in contrast to the limited bandwidth available for space systems - optical media offer seemingly unlimited capacity .
Save where cables terminate in countries where telecommunications operators provide Comint access ( such as the UK and the US ) , submarine cables appear intrinsically secure because of the nature of the ocean environment .
49 .
In October 1971 , this security was shown not to exist .
A US submarine , Halibut , visited the Sea of Okhotsk off the eastern USSR and recorded communications passing on a military cable to the Khamchatka Peninsula .
Halibut was equipped with a deep diving chamber , fully in view on the submarine 's stern .
The chamber was described by the US Navy as a " deep submergence rescue vehicle " .
The truth was that the " rescue vehicle " was welded immovably to the submarine .
Once submerged , deep - sea divers exited the submarine and wrapped tapping coils around the cable .
Having proven the principle , USS Halibut returned in 1972 and laid a high capacity recording pod next to the cable .
The technique involved no physical damage and was unlikely to have been readily detectable . ( 29 )
50 .
The Okhotsk cable tapping operation continued for ten years , involving routine trips by three different specially equipped submarines to collect old pods and lay new ones ; sometimes , more than one pod at a time .
New targets were added in 1979 .
That summer , a newly converted submarine called USS Parche travelled from San Francisco under the North Pole to the Barents Sea , and laid a new cable tap near Murmansk .
Its crew received a presidential citation for their achievement .
The Okhotsk cable tap ended in 1982 , after its location was compromised by a former NSA employee who sold information about the tap , codenamed IVY BELLS , to the Soviet Union .
One of the IVY BELLS pods is now on display in the Moscow museum of the former KGB .
The cable tap in the Barents Sea continued in operation , undetected , until tapping stopped in 1992 .
51 . During 1985 , cable - tapping operations were extended into the Mediterranean , to intercept cables linking Europe to West Africa . ( 30 )
After the cold war ended , the USS Parche was refitted with an extended section to accommodate larger cable tapping equipment and pods .
Cable taps could be laid by remote control , using drones .
USS Parche continues in operation to the present day , but the precise targets of its missions remain unknown .
The Clinton administration evidently places high value on its achievements , Every year from 1994 to 1997 , the submarine crew has been highly commended .
( 31 ) Likely targets may include the Middle East , Mediterranean , eastern Asia , and South America .
The United States is the only naval power known to have deployed deep - sea technology for this purpose .
52 . Miniaturised inductive taps recorders have also been used to intercept underground cables .
( 32 ) Optical fibre cables , however , do not leak radio frequency signals and cannot be tapped using inductive loops .
NSA and other Comint agencies have spent a great deal of money on research into tapping optical fibres , reportedly with little success .
But long distance optical fibre cables are not invulnerable .
The key means of access is by tampering with optoelectronic " repeaters " which boost signal levels over long distances .
It follows that any submarine cable system using submerged optoelectronic repeaters cannot be considered secure from interception and communications intelligence activity .

Intercepting the Internet
53 .
The dramatic growth in the size and significance of the Internet and of related forms of digital communications has been argued by some to pose a challenge for Comint agencies .
This does not appear correct .
During the 1980s , NSA and its UKUSA partners operated a larger international communications network than the then Internet but based on the same technology .
( 33 ) According to its British partner " all GCHQ systems are linked together on the largest LAN [ Local Area Network ] in Europe , which is connected to other sites around the world via one of the largest WANs [ Wide Area Networks ] in the world ... its main networking protocol is Internet Protocol ( IP ) . ( 34 ) This global network , developed as project EMBROIDERY , includes PATHWAY , the NSA 's main computer communications network .
It provides fast , secure global communications for ECHELON and other systems .
54 .
Since the early 1990s , fast and sophisticated Comint systems have been developed to collect , filter and analyse the forms of fast digital communications used by the Internet .
Because most of the world 's Internet capacity lies within the United States or connects to the United States , many communications in " cyberspace " will pass through intermediate sites within the United States .
Communications from Europe to and from Asia , Oceania , Africa or South America normally travel via the United States .
55 . Routes taken by Internet " packets " depend on the origin and destination of the data , the systems through which they enter and leaves the Internet , and a myriad of other factors including time of day .
Thus , routers within the western United States are at their most idle at the time when central European traffic is reaching peak usage .
It is thus possible ( and reasonable ) for messages travelling a short distance in a busy European network to travel instead , for example , via Internet exchanges in California .
It follows that a large proportion of international communications on the Internet will by the nature of the system pass through the United States and thus be readily accessible to NSA .
56 . Standard Internet messages are composed of packets called " datagrams " .
Datagrams include numbers representing both their origin and their destination , called " IP addresses " .
The addresses are unique to each computer connected to the Internet .
They are inherently easy to identify as to country and site of origin and destination .
Handling , sorting and routing millions of such packets each second is fundamental to the operation of major Internet centres .
The same process facilitates extraction of traffic for Comint purposes .
57 .
Internet traffic can be accessed either from international communications links entering the United States , or when it reaches major Internet exchanges .
Both methods have advantages .
Access to communications systems is likely to be remain clandestine - whereas access to Internet exchanges might be more detectable but provides easier access to more data and simpler sorting methods .
Although the quantities of data involved are immense , NSA is normally legally restricted to looking only at communications that start or finish in a foreign country .
Unless special warrants are issued , all other data should normally be thrown away by machine before it can be examined or recorded .
58 . Much other Internet traffic ( whether foreign to the US or not ) is of trivial intelligence interest or can be handled in other ways .
For example , messages sent to " Usenet " discussion groups amounts to about 15 Gigabytes ( GB ) of data per day ; the rough equivalent of 10,000 books .
All this data is broadcast to anyone wanting ( or willing ) to have it .
Like other Internet users , intelligence agencies have open source access to this data and store and analyse it .
In the UK , the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency maintains a 1 Terabyte database containing the previous 90 days of Usenet messages . ( 35 ) A similar service , called " Deja News " , is available to users of the World Wide Web ( WWW ) .
Messages for Usenet are readily distinguishable .
It is pointless to collect them clandestinely .
59 . Similar considerations affect the World Wide Web , most of which is openly accessible .
Web sites are examined continuously by " search engines " which generate catalogues of their contents .
" Alta Vista " and " Hotbot " are prominent public sites of this kind .
NSA similarly employs computer " bots " ( robots ) to collect data of interest .
For example , a New York web site known as JYA.COM ( http://www.jya.com/cryptome) offers extensive public information on Sigint , Comint and cryptography .
The site is frequently updated .
Records of access to the site show that every morning it is visited by a " bot " from NSA 's National Computer Security Centre , which looks for new files and makes copies of any that it finds . ( 36 )
60 .
It follows that foreign Internet traffic of communications intelligence interest - consisting of e-mail , file transfers , " virtual private networks " operated over the internet , and some other messages - will form at best a few per cent of the traffic on most US Internet exchanges or backbone links .
According to a former employee , NSA had by 1995 installed " sniffer " software to collect such traffic at nine major Internet exchange points ( IXPs ) . ( 37 )
The first two such sites identified , FIX East and FIX West , are operated by US government agencies .
They are closely linked to nearby commercial locations , MAE East and MAE West ( see table ) .
Three other sites listed were Network Access Points originally developed by the US National Science Foundation to provide the US Internet with its initial " backbone " .

Table 1 NSA Internet Comint access at IXP sites ( 1995 ) ( 38 )
61 .
The same article alleged that a leading US Internet and telecommunications company had contracted with NSA to develop software to capture Internet data of interest , and that deals had been struck with the leading manufacturers Microsoft , Lotus , and Netscape to alter their products for foreign use .
The latter allegation has proven correct ( see technical annexe ) .
Providing such features would make little sense unless NSA had also arranged general access to Internet traffic .
Although NSA will not confirm or deny such allegations , a 1997 court case in Britain involving alleged " computer hacking " produced evidence of NSA surveillance of the Internet .
Witnesses from the US Air Force component of NSA acknowledged using packet sniffers and specialised programmes to track attempts to enter US military computers .
The case collapsed after the witnesses refused to provide evidence about the systems they had used . ( 39 )
Covert collection of high capacity signals
62 . Where access to signals of interest is not possible by other means , Comint agencies have constructed special purpose interception equipment to install in embassies or other diplomatic premises , or even to carry by hand to locations of special interest .
Extensive descriptions of operations of this kind have been published by Mike Frost , a former official of CSE , the Canadian Sigint agency .
( 40 ) Although city centre embassy premises are often ideally situated to intercept a wide range of communications , ranging from official carphone services to high capacity microwave links , processing and passing on such information may be difficult .
Such collection operations are also highly sensitive for diplomatic reasons .
Equipment for covert collection is therefore specialised , selective and miniaturised .
63 . A joint NSA / CIA " Special Collection Service " manufactures equipment and trains personnel for covert collection activities
One major device is a suitcase - sized computer processing system .
ORATORY .
ORATORY is in effect a miniaturised version of the Dictionary computers described in the next section , capable of selecting non-verbal communications of interest from a wide range of inputs , according to pre-programmed selection criteria .
One major NSA supplier ( " The IDEAS Operation " ) now offers micro-miniature digital receivers which can simultaneously process Sigint data from 8 independent channels .
This radio receiver is the size of a credit card .
It fits in a standard laptop computer .
IDEAS claim , reasonably , that their tiny card " performs functions that would have taken a rack full of equipment not long ago " .
New satellite networks
64 . New network operators have constructed mobile phone systems providing unbroken global coverage using satellites in low or medium level earth orbits .
These systems are sometimes called satellite personal communications systems ( SPCS ) .
Because each satellite covers only a small area and moves fast , large numbers of satellites are needed to provide continuous global coverage .
The satellites can relay signals directly between themselves or to ground stations .
The first such system to be completed , Iridium , uses 66 satellites and started operations in 1998 .
Iridium appears to have created particular difficulties for communications intelligence agencies , since the signals down from the Iridium and similar networks can only be received in a small area , which may be anywhere on the earth 's surface .
3. ECHELON and Comint production
65 .
The ECHELON system became well known following publication of the previous STOA report .
Since then , new evidence shows that ECHELON has existed since the 1970s , and was greatly enlarged between 1975 and 1995 .
Like ILC interception , ECHELON has developed from earlier methods .
This section includes new information and documentary evidence about ECHELON and satellite interception .
The " Watch List "
66 .
After the public revelation of the SHAMROCK interception programme , NSA Director Lt General Lew Allen described how NSA used " ' watch lists " as an aid to watch for foreign activity of reportable intelligence interest " .
( 41 ) " We have been providing details ... of any messages contained in the foreign communications we intercept that bear on named individuals or organisations .
These compilations of names are commonly referred to as ' Watch Lists ' " , he said .
( 42 ) Until the 1970s , Watch List processing was manual .
Analysts examined intercepted ILC communications , reporting , " gisting " or analysing those which appeared to cover names or topics on the Watch List .
New information about ECHELON sites and systems
67 .
It now appears that the system identified as ECHELON has been in existence for more than 20 years .
The need for such a system was foreseen in the late 1960s , when NSA and GCHQ planned ILC satellite interception stations at Mowenstow and Yakima .
It was expected that the quantity of messages intercepted from the new satellites would be too great for individual examination .
According to former NSA staff , the first ECHELON computers automated Comint processing at these sites . ( 43 )
68 . NSA and CIA then discovered that Sigint collection from space was more effective than had been anticipated , resulting in accumulations of recordings that outstripped the available supply of linguists and analysts .
Documents show that when the SILKWORTH processing systems was installed at Menwith Hill for the new satellites , it was supported by ECHELON 2 and other databanks ( see illustration ) .
69 .
By the mid 1980s , communications intercepted at these major stations were heavily sifted , with a wide variety of specifications available for non-verbal traffic .
Extensive further automation was planned in the mid 1980s as NSA Project P -415 .
Implementation of this project completed the automation of the previous Watch List activity .
From 1987 onwards , staff from international Comint agencies travelled to the US to attended training courses for the new computer systems .
70 . Project P-415/ ECHELON
made heavy use of NSA and GCHQ 's global Internet - like communication network to enable remote intelligence customers to task computers at each collection site , and receive the results automatically .
The key component of the system are local " Dictionary " computers , which store an extensive database on specified targets , including names , topics of interest , addresses , telephone numbers and other selection criteria .
Incoming messages are compared to these criteria ; if a match is found , the raw intelligence is forwarded automatically .
Dictionary computers are tasked with many thousands of different collection requirements , described as " numbers " ( four digit codes ) .
71 . Tasking and receiving intelligence from the Dictionaries involves processes familiar to anyone who has used the Internet .
Dictionary sorting and selection can be compared to using search engines , which select web pages containing key words or terms and specifying relationships .
The forwarding function of the Dictionary computers may be compared to e-mail .
When requested , the system will provide lists of communications matching each criterion for review , analysis , " gisting " or forwarding .
An important point about the new system is that before ECHELON , different countries and different stations knew what was being intercepted and to whom it was sent .
Now , all but a fraction of the messages selected by Dictionary computers at remote sites are forwarded to NSA or other customers without being read locally .
List of intelligence databanks operating at ECHELON Menwith Hill in 1979 included the second generation of ECHELON Satellite interception site at Sugar Grove , West Virginia , showing six antennae targeted on European and Atlantic
Ocean regional communications satellites
Westminster , London - Dictionary computer
72 . In 1991 , a British television programme reported on the operations of the Dictionary computer at GCHQ's Westminster , London office .
The system " secretly intercepts every single telex which passes into , out of or through London ; thousands of diplomatic , business and personal messages every day .
These are fed into a programme known as ` Dictionary ' .
It picks out keywords from the mass of Sigint , and hunts out hundreds of individuals and corporations " .
( 44 ) The programme pointed out that the Dictionary computers , although controlled and tasked by GCHQ , were operated by security vetted staff employed by British Telecom ( BT ) , Britain 's dominant telecommunications operator .
( 45 ) The presence of Dictionary computers has also been confirmed at Kojarena , Australia ; and at GCHQ Cheltenham , England . ( 46 )
Sugar Grove , Virginia - COMSAT interception at ECHELON site
73 . US government documents confirm that the satellite receiving station at Sugar Grove , West Virginia is an ECHELON site , and that collects intelligence from COMSATs .
The station is about 250 miles south - west of Washington , in a remote area of the Shenandoah Mountains .
It is operated by the US Naval Security Group and the US Air Force Intelligence Agency .
74 .
An upgraded system called TIMBERLINE II , was installed at Sugar Grove in the summer of 1990 .
At the same time , according to official US documents , an " ECHELON training department " was established .
( 47 ) With training complete , the task of the station in 1991 became " to maintain and operate an ECHELON site " . ( 48 )
75 .
The US Air Force has publicly identified the intelligence activity at Sugar Grove : its " mission is to direct satellite communications equipment [ in support of ] consumers of COMSAT information ...
This is achieved by providing a trained cadre of collection system operators , analysts and managers " .
( 49 ) In 1990 , satellite photographs showed that there were 4 satellite antennae at Sugar Grove .
By November 1998 , ground inspection revealed that this had expanded to a group of 9 .
Sabana Seca , Puerto Rico and Leitrim , Canada - COMSAT interception sites
76 . Further information published by the US Air Force identifies the US Naval Security Group Station at Sabana Seca , Puerto Rico as a COMSAT interception site .
Its mission is " to become the premier satellite communications processing and analysis field station " . ( 50 )
77 . Canadian Defence Forces have published details about staff functions at the Leitrim field station of the Canadian Sigint agency CSE .
The station , near Ottawa , Ontario has four satellite terminals , erected since 1984 .
The staff roster includes seven Communications Satellite Analysts , Supervisors and Instructors . ( 51 )
78 .
In a publicly available resume , a former Communication Satellite Analyst employed at Leitrim describes his job as having required expertise in the " operation and analysis of numerous Comsat computer systems and associated subsystems ... [ utilising ] computer assisted analysis systems ... [ and ] a broad range of sophisticated electronic equipment to intercept and study foreign communications and electronic transmissions .
( 52 ) Financial reports from CSE also indicate that in 1995 / 96 , the agency planned payments of $ 7 million to ECHELON and $ 6 million to Cray ( computers ) .
There were no further details about ECHELON . ( 53 )
Waihopai , New Zealand - Intelsat interception at ECHELON site
79 . New Zealand 's Sigint agency GCSB operates two satellite interception terminals at Waihopai , tasked on Intelsat satellites covering the Pacific Ocean .
Extensive details have already been published about the station 's Dictionary computers and its role in the ECHELON network .
( 54 ) After the book was published , a New Zealand TV station obtained images of the inside of the station operations centre .
The pictures were obtained clandestinely by filming through partially curtained windows at night .
The TV reporter was able to film close - ups of technical manuals held in the control centre .
These were Intelsat technical manuals , providing confirmation that the station targeted these satellites Strikingly , the station was seen to be virtually empty , operating fully automatically .
One guard was inside , but was unaware he was being filmed . ( 55 )
ILC processing techniques
80 .
The technical annexe describes the main systems used to extract and process communications intelligence .
The detailed explanations given about processing methods are not essential to understanding the core of this report , but are provided so that readers knowledgeable about telecommunications may fully evaluate the state of the art .
81 . Fax messages and computer data ( from modems ) are given priority in processing because of the ease with which they are understood and analysed .
The main method of filtering and analysing non-verbal traffic , the Dictionary computers , utilise traditional information retrieval techniques , including keywords .
Fast special purpose chips enable vast quantities of data to be processed in this way .
The newest technique is " topic spotting " .
The processing of telephone calls is mainly limited to identifying call - related information , and traffic analysis .
Effective voice " wordspotting " systems do not exist are not in use , despite reports to the contrary .
But " voiceprint " type speaker identification systems have been in use since at least 1995 .
The use of strong cryptography is slowly impinging on Comint agencies ' capabilities .
This difficulty for Comint agencies has been offset by covert and overt activities which have subverted the effectiveness of cryptographic systems supplied from and / or used in Europe .
82 . The conclusions drawn in the annexe are that Comint equipment currently available has the capability , as tasked , to intercept , process and analyse every modern type of high capacity communications system to which access is obtained , including the highest levels of the Internet .
There are few gaps in coverage .
The scale , capacity and speed of some systems is difficult fully to comprehend .
Special purpose systems have been built to process pager messages , cellular mobile radio and new satellites .
4. Comint and Law Enforcement
83 .
In 1990 and 1991 , the US government became concerned that the marketing of a secure telephone system by AT&T could curtail Comint activity .
AT&T was persuaded to withdraw its product .
In its place the US government offered NSA " Clipper " chips for incorporation in secure phones .
The chips would be manufactured by NSA , which would also record built - in keys and pass this information to other government agencies for storage and , if required , retrieval .
This proposal proved extremely unpopular , and was abandoned .
In its place , the US government proposed that non government agencies should be required to keep copies of every user 's keys , a system called " key escrow " and , later , " key recovery " .
Viewed in retrospect , the actual purpose of these proposals was to provide NSA with a single ( or very few ) point (s ) of access to keys , enabling them to continue to access private and commercial communications .
Misrepresentation of law enforcement interception requirements
84 . Between 1993 to 1998 , the United States conducted sustained diplomatic activity seeking to persuade EU nations and the OECD to adopt their " key recovery " system .
Throughout this period , the US government insisted that the purpose of the initiative was to assist law enforcement agencies .
Documents obtained for this study suggest that these claims wilfully misrepresented the true intention of US policy .
Documents obtained under the US Freedom of Information
Act indicate that policymaking was led exclusively by NSA officials , sometimes to the complete exclusion of police or judicial officials .
For example , when the specially appointed US " Ambassador for Cryptography " , David Aaron , visited Britain on 25 November 1996 , he was accompanied and briefed by NSA 's most senior representative in Britain , Dr James J Hearn , formerly Deputy Director of NSA .
Mr Aaron had did not meet or consult FBI officials attached to his Embassy .
His meeting with British Cabinet officials included NSA 's representative and staff from Britain 's GCHQ , but police officers or justice officials from both nations were excluded .
85 . Since 1993 , unknown to European parliamentary bodies and their electors , law enforcement officials from many EU countries and most of the UKUSA nations have been meeting annually in a separate forum to discuss their requirements for intercepting communications .
These officials met under the auspices of a hitherto unknown organisation , ILETS ( International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar ) .
ILETS was initiated and founded by the FBI .
Table 2 lists ILETS meetings held between 1993 and 1997 .
86 .
At their 1993 and 1994 meetings , ILETS participants specified law enforcement user requirements for communications interception .
These appear in a 1974 ILETS document called " IUR 1.0 " .
This document was based on an earlier FBI report on " Law Enforcement Requirements for the Surveillance of Electronic Communications " , first issued in July 1992 and revised in June 1994 .
The IUR requirement differed little in substance from the FBI 's requirements but was enlarged , containing ten requirements rather than nine .
IUR did not specify any law enforcement need for " key escrow " or " key recovery " .
Cryptography was mentioned solely in the context of network security arrangements .
87 . Between 1993 and 1997 police representatives from ILETS were not involved in the NSA - led policy making process for " key recovery " , nor did ILETS advance any such proposal , even as late as 1997 .
Despite this , during the same period the US government repeatedly presented its policy as being motivated by the stated needs of law enforcement agencies .
At their 1997 meeting in Dublin , ILETS did not alter the IUR .
It was not until 1998 that a revised IUR was prepared containing requirements in respect of cryptography .
It follows from this that the US government misled EU and OECD states about the true intention of its policy .
88 . This US deception was , however , clear to the senior Commission official responsible for information security .
In September 1996 , David Herson , head of the EU Senior Officers ' Group on Information Security , stated his assessment of the US " key recovery " project :
" ' Law Enforcement ' is a protective shield for all the other governmental activities ...
We 're talking about foreign intelligence , that 's what all this is about .
There is no question [ that ] ' law enforcement ' is a smoke screen " . ( 56 )
89 .
It should be noted that technically , legally and organisationally , law enforcement requirements for communications interception differ fundamentally from communications intelligence .
Law enforcement agencies ( LEAs ) will normally wish to intercept a specific line or group of lines , and must normally justify their requests to a judicial or administrative authority before proceeding .
In contract , Comint agencies conduct broad international communications " trawling " activities , and operate under general warrants .
Such operations do not require or even suppose that the parties they intercept are criminals .
Such distinctions are vital to civil liberty , but risk being eroded it the boundaries between law enforcement and communications intelligence interception becomes blurred in future .

Table 2 ILETS meetings , 1993-1997
Law enforcement communications interception - policy development in Europe
90 .
Following the second ILETS meeting in Bonn in 1994 , IUR 1.0 was presented to the Council of Ministers and was passed without a single word being altered on 17 January 1995 .
( 57 ) During 1995 , several non EU members of the ILETS group wrote to the Council to endorse the ( unpublished ) Council resolution .
The resolution was not published in the Official Journal for nearly two years , on 4 November 1996 .
91 . Following the third ILETS meeting in Canberra in 1995 , the Australian government was asked to present the IUR to International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) .
Noting that " law enforcement and national security agencies of a significant number of ITU member states have agreed on a generic set of requirements for legal interception " , the Australian government asked the ITU to advise its standards bodies to incorporate the IUR requirements into future telecommunications systems on the basis that the " costs of [ providing ] legal interception capability and associated disruptions can be lessened by providing for that capability at the design stage " . ( 58 )
92 .
It appears that ILETS met again in 1998 and revised and extended its terms to cover the Internet and Satellite Personal Communications Systems such as Iridium .
The new IUR also specified " additional security requirements for network operators and service providers " , extensive new requirements for personal information about subscribers , and provisions to deal with cryptography .
93 .
On 3 September 1998 , the revised IUR was presented to the Police Co-operation Working Group as ENFOPOL 98 .
The Austrian Presidency proposed that , as in 1994 , the new IUR be adopted verbatim as a Council Resolution on interception " in respect of new technology " .
( 59 ) The group did not agree .
After repeated redrafting , a fresh paper has been prepared by the German Presidency , for the eventual consideration of Council Home and Justice ministers . ( 60 )
5. Comint and economic intelligence
94 . During the 1998 EP debate on " Transatlantic relations / ECHELON system " Commissioner Bangeman observed on behalf of the Commission that " If this system were to exist , it would be an intolerable attack against individual liberties , competition and the security of the states " .
( 61 ) The existence of ECHELON was described in section 3 , above .
This section describes the organisational and reporting frameworks within which economically sensitive information collected by ECHELON and related systems is disseminated , summarising examples where European organisations have been the subject of surveillance .
Tasking economic intelligence
95 . US officials acknowledge that NSA collects economic information , whether intentionally or otherwise .
Former military intelligence attaché Colonel Dan Smith worked at the US Embassy , London until 1993 .
He regularly received Comint product from Menwith Hill .
In 1998 , he told the BBC that at Menwith Hill :
" In terms of scooping up communications , inevitably since their take is broadband , there will be conversations or communications which are intercepted which have nothing to do with the military , and probably within those there will be some information about commercial dealings "
" Anything would be possible technically .
Technically they can scoop all this information up , sort through it and find out what it is that might be asked for . . .
But there is not policy to do this specifically in response to a particular company 's interest ( 62 )
96 .
In general , this statement is not incorrect .
But it overlooks fundamental distinctions between tasking and dissemination , and between commercial and economic intelligence .
There is no evidence that companies in any of the UKUSA countries are able to task Comint collection to suit their private purposes .
They do not have to .
Each UKUSA country authorises national level intelligence assessment organisations and relevant individual ministries to task and receive economic intelligence from Comint .
Such information may be collected for myriad purposes , such as : estimation of future essential commodity prices ; determining other nation 's private positions in trade negotiations ; monitoring international trading in arms ; tracking sensitive technology ; or evaluating the political stability and / or economic strength of a target country .
Any of these targets and many others may produce intelligence of direct commercial relevance .
The decision as to whether it should be disseminated or exploited is taken not by Comint agencies but by national government organisation (s ) .
Disseminating economic intelligence
97 .
In 1970 , according to its former Executive Director , the US Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board recommended that " henceforth economic intelligence be considered a function of the national security , enjoying a priority equivalent to diplomatic , military , technological intelligence " .
( 63 ) On 5 May 1977 , a meeting between NSA , CIA and the Department of Commerce authorised the creation of secret new department , the " Office of Intelligence Liaison " .
Its task was to handle " foreign intelligence " of interest to the Department of Commerce .
Its standing orders show that it was authorised to receive and handle SCI intelligence - Comint and Sigint from NSA .
The creation of this office THUS provided a formal mechanism whereby NSA data could be used to support commercial and economic interests .
After this system was highlighted in a British TV programme in 1993 , its name was changed to the " Office of Executive Support " .
( 64 ) Also in 1993 , President Clinton extended US intelligence support to commercial organisations by creating a new National Economic Council , paralleling the National Security Council .
98 .
The nature of this intelligence support has been widely reported .
" Former intelligence officials and other experts say tips based on spying ... regularly flow from the Commerce Department to U.S. companies to help them win contracts overseas .
( 65 ) The Office of Executive Support provides classified weekly briefings to security officials .
One US newspaper obtained reports from the Commerce Department demonstrating intelligence support to US companies :
One such document consists of minutes from an August 1994 Commerce Department meeting [ intended ] to identify major contracts open for bid in Indonesia in order to help U.S. companies win the work .
A CIA employee ... spoke at the meeting ; five of the 16 people on the routine distribution list for the minutes were from the CIA .
99 .
In the United Kingdom , GCHQ is specifically required by law ( and as and when tasked by the British government ) to intercept foreign communications " in the interests of the economic well - being of the United Kingdom ... in relation to the actions or intentions of persons outside the British Islands " .
Commercial interception is tasked and analysed by GCHQ's K Division .
Commercial and economic targets can be specified by the government 's Overseas Economic Intelligence Committee , the Economic Staff of the Joint Intelligence Committee , the Treasury , or the Bank of England . ( 66 ) According to a former senior JIC official , the Comint take routinely includes " company plans , telexes , faxes , and transcribed phone calls .
Many were calls between Europe and the South[ern Hemisphere ] " . ( 67 )
100 .
In Australia , commercially relevant Comint is passed by DSD to the Office of National Assessments , who consider whether , and if so where , to disseminate it .
Staff there may pass information to Australian companies if they believe that an overseas nation has or seeks an unfair trade advantage .
Targets of such activity have included Thomson - CSF , and trade negotiations with Japanese purchasers of coal and iron ore .
Similar systems operate in the other UKUSA nations , Canada and New Zealand .
The use of Comint economic intelligence product Panavia European Fighter Aircraft consortium and Saudi Arabia
101 .
In 1993 , former National Security Council official Howard Teicher described in a programme about Menwith Hill how the European Panavia company was specifically targeted over sales to the Middle East .
" I recall that the words ' Tornado ' or ' Panavia ' - information related to the specific aircraft - would have been priority targets that we would have wanted information about " . ( 68 )
Thomson CSF and Brazil
102 .
In 1994 , NSA intercepted phone calls between Thomson - CSF and Brazil concerning SIVAM , a $ 1.3 billion surveillance system for the Amazon rain forest .
The company was alleged to have bribed members of the Brazilian government selection panel .
The contract was awarded to the US Raytheon Corporation - who announced afterwards that " the Department of Commerce worked very hard in support of U.S. industry on this project " .
( 69 ) Raytheon also provide maintenance and engineering services to NSA 's ECHELON satellite interception station at Sugar Grove .
Airbus Industrie and Saudi Arabia
103 .
According to a well - informed 1995 press report :" from a commercial communications satellite , NSA lifted all the faxes and phone calls between the European consortium Airbus , the Saudi national airline and the Saudi government .
The agency found that Airbus agents were offering bribes to a Saudi official .
It passed the information to U.S. officials pressing the bid of Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp. , which triumphed last year in the $ 6 billion competition . " ( 70 )
International trade negotiations
104 .
Many other accounts have been published by reputable journalists and some firsthand witnesses citing frequent occasions on which the US government has utlitised Comint for national commercial purposes .
These include targeting data about the emission standards of Japanese vehicles ; ( 71 ) 1995 trade negotiations the import of Japanese luxury cars ; ( 72 ) French participation in the GATT trade negotiations in 1993 ; the Asian - Pacific Economic Conference ( APEC ) , 1997 .
Targeting host nations
105 .
The issue of whether the United States utilises communications intelligence facilities such as Menwith Hilll or Bad Aibling to attack host nations ' communications also arises .
The available evidence suggests that such conduct may normally be avoided .
According to former National Security Council official Howard Teicher , the US government would not direct NSA to spy on a host governments such as Britain :
" [ But ] I would never say never in this business because , at the end of the day , national interests are national interests ... sometimes our interests diverge .
So never say never - especially in this business "
. 6 . Comint capabilities after 2000
Developments in technology
106 .
Since the mid-1990s , communications intelligence agencies have faced substantial difficulties in maintaining global access to communications systems .
These difficulties will increase during and after 2000 .
The major reason is the shift in telecommunications to high capacity optical fibre networks .
Physical access to cables is required for interception .
Unless a fibre network lies within or passes through a collaborating state , effective interception is practical only by tampering with optoelectronic repeaters ( when installed ) .
This limitation is likely to place many foreign land - based high capacity optical fibre networks beyond reach .
The physical size of equipment needed to process traffic , together with power , communications and recording systems , makes clandestine activity impractical and risky .
107 .
Even where access is readily available ( such as to COMSATs ) , the proliferation of new systems will limit collection activities , partly because budgetary constraint will restrict new deployments , and partly because some systems ( for example , Iridium ) cannot be accessed by presently available systems .
108 .
In the past 15 years the substantial technological lead in computers and information technology once enjoyed by Comint organisations has all but disappeared .
Their principal computer systems are bought " off the shelf " and are the equal of or even inferior to those used by first rank industrial and academic organisations .
They differ only in being " TEMPEST shielded " , preventing them emitting radio signals which could be used to analyse Sigint activity .
109 .
Communications intelligence organisations recognise that the long war against civil and commercial cryptography has been lost .
A thriving academic and industrial community is skilled in cryptography and cryptology .
The Internet and the global marketplace have created a free flow in information , systems and software .
NSA has failed in its mission to perpetuate access by pretending that that " key escrow " and like systems were intended to support law enforcement ( as opposed to Comint ) requirements .
110 .
Future trends in Comint are likely to include limits on investment in Comint collection from space ; greater use of human agents to plant collection devices or obtain codes than in the past ; and an intensified effort to attack foreign computer systems , using the Internet and other means ( in particular , to gain access to protected files or communications before they are encrypted ) .
111 . Attempts to restrict cryptography have nevertheless delayed the large - scale introduction of effective cryptographic security systems .
The reduced cost of computational power has also enabled Comint agencies to deploy fast and sophisticated processing and sorting tools .
112 . Recent remarks to CIA veterans by the head of staff of the US House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , ex CIA officer John Millis illustrate how NSA views the same issues :
" Signals intelligence is in a crisis .
...
Over the last fifty years ...
In the past , technology has been the friend of NSA , but in the last four or five years technology has moved from being the friend to being the enemy of Sigint .
The media of telecommunications is no longer Sigint - friendly .
It used to be .
When you were doing RF signals , anybody within range of that RF signal could receive it just as clearly as the intended recipient .
We moved from that to microwaves , and people figured out a great way to harness that as well .
Well , we 're moving to media that are very difficult to get to .
Encryption is here and it's going to grow very rapidly .
That is bad news for Sigint ...
It is going to take a huge amount of money invested in new technologies to get access and to be able to break out the information that we still need to get from Sigint " .
Policy issues for the European Parliament
1 . The 1998 Parliamentary resolution on " Transatlantic relations / ECHELON system " ( 73 ) called for " protective measures concerning economic information and effective encryption " .
Providing such measures may be facilitated by developing an in - depth understanding of present and future Comint capabilities .
2 . At the technical level , protective measures may best be focused on defeating hostile Comint activity by denying access or , where this is impractical or impossible , preventing processing of message content and associated traffic information by general use of cryptography .
3 . As the SOGIS group within the Commission has recognised , ( 74 ) the contrasting interests of states is a complex issue .
Larger states have made substantial investments in Comint capabilities .
One member state is active in the UKUSA alliance , whilst others are either " third parties " to UKUSA or have made bilateral arrangements with NSA .
Some of these arrangements were a legacy of the cold war ; others are enduring .
These issues create internal and international conflicts of interest .
Technical solutions are not obvious .
It should be possible to define a shared interest in implementing measures to defeat future external Comint activities directed against European states , their citizens and commercial activities .
4. A second area of apparent conflict concerns states ' desires to provide communications interception for legitimate law enforcement purposes .
The technical and legal processes involved in providing interception for law enforcement purpose differ fundamentally from those used in communications intelligence .
Partly because of the lack of parliamentary and public awareness of Comint activities , this distinction is often glossed over , particularly by states that invest heavily in Comint .
Any failure to distinguish between legitimate law enforcement interception requirements and interception for clandestine intelligence purposes raises grave issues for civil liberties .
A clear boundary between law enforcement and " national security " interception activity is essential to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
5 . At the present time , Internet browsers and other software used in almost every personal computer in Europe is deliberately disabled such that " secure " communications they send can , if collected , be read without difficulty by NSA .
US manufacturers are compelled to make these arrangements under US export rules .
A level playing field is important .
Consideration could be given to a countermeasure whereby , if systems with disabled cryptographic systems are sold outside the United States , they should be required to conform to an " open standard " such that third parties and other nations may provide additional applications which restore the level of security to at least enjoyed by domestic US customers .
6 . The work of ILETS has proceeded for 6 years without the involvement of parliaments , and in the absence of consultation with the industrial organisations whose vital interests their work affects .
It is regrettable that , prior to the publication of this report , public information has not been available in states about the scope of the policy - making processes , inside and outside the EU , which have led to the formulation of existing and new law enforcement " user requirements " .
As a matter of urgency , the current policy - making process should be made open to public and parliamentary discussion in member states and in the EP , so that a proper balance may be struck between the security and privacy rights of citizens and commercial enterprises , the financial and technical interests of communications network operators and service providers , and the need to support law enforcement activities intended to suppress serious crime and terrorism .
Technical annexe Broadband ( high capacity multi-channel ) communications
1. From 1950 until the early 1980s , high capacity multi-channel analogue communications systems were usually engineered using separate communications channels carried at different frequencies
The combined signal , which could include 2,000 or more speech channels , was a " multiplex " .
The resulting " frequency division multiplex " ( FDM ) signal was then carried on a much higher frequency , such as by a microwave radio signal .
2. Digital communications have almost universally taken over from analogue methods .
The basic system of digital multi-channel communications is time division multiplexing ( TDM ) .
In a TDM telephony system , the individual conversational channels are first digitised .
Information concerning each channel is then transmitted sequentially rather than simultaneously , with each link occupying successive time " slots " .
3. Standards for digital communications evolved separately within Europe and North America .
In the United States , the then dominant public network carrier ( the Bell system , run by AT&T ) established digital data standards .
The basic building block , a T - 1 link , carries the equivalent of 24 telephone channels at a rate of 1.544 Mbps .
Higher capacity systems operate at greater data transmission rates
Thus , the highest transmission rate , T - 5 , carries the equivalent of 8,000 speech channels at a data rate of 560 Mbps .
4. Europe adopted a different framework for digital communications , based on standards originally agreed by the CEPT .
The basic European standard digital link , E - 1 , carries 30 telephone channels at a data rate of 2 Mbps .
Most European telecommunications systems are based on E - 1 links or ( as in North America ) , multiples thereof .
The distinction is significant because most Comint processing equipment manufactured in the United States is designed to handle intercepted communications working to the European forms of digital communications .
5 . Recent digital systems utilise synchronised signals carried by very high capacity optical fibres .
Synchronising signals enables single channels to be easily extracted from high capacity links .
The new system is known in the US as the synchronous optical network ( SONET ) , although three equivalent definitions and labels are in use . ( 75 )
Communications intelligence equipment
6. Dozens of US defence contractors , many located in Silicon Valley ( California ) or in the Maryland " Beltway " area near Washington , manufacture sophisticated Sigint equipment for NSA .
Major US corporations , such as Lockheed Martin , Space Systems / Loral , TRW , Raytheon and Bendix are also contracted by NSA to operate major Sigint collection sites .
A full report on their products and services is beyond the scope of this study .
The state of the art in contemporary communications intelligence may usefully be demonstrated , however , by examining some of the Comint processing products of two specialist NSA niche suppliers : Applied Signal Technology Inc ( AST ) , of Sunnyvale , California , and The IDEAS Operation of Columbia , Maryland ( part of Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) ) . ( 76 )
7 . Both companies include senior ex-NSA staff as directors .
When not explicitly stated , their products can be identified as intended for Sigint by virtue of being " TEMPEST screened " .
AST states generally that its " equipment is used for signal reconnaissance of foreign telecommunications by the United States government " .
One leading cryptographer has aptly and and engagingly described AST as a " one-stop ECHELON shop " .
Wideband extraction and signal analysis
8. Wideband ( or broadband ) signals are normally intercepted from satellites or tapped cables in the form of multiplex microwave or high frequency signals .
The first step in processing such signals for Comint purposes is " wideband extraction " .
An extensive range of Sigint equipment is manufactured for this purpose , enabling newly intercepted systems to be surveyed and analysed .
These include transponder survey equipment which identify and classify satellite downlinks , demodulators , decoders , demultiplexers , microwave radio link analysers , link survey units , carrier analysis systems , and many other forms of hardware and software .
9 . A newly intercepted communications satellite or data link can be analysed using the AST Model 196 " Transponder characterisation system " .
Once its basic communications structure has been analysed , the Model 195 " Wideband snapshot analyser " , also known as SNAPPER , can record sample data from even the highest capacity systems , sufficient to analyse communications in minute detail .
By the start of 1999 , operating in conjunction with the Model 990 " Flexible Data Acquisition Unit " , this systems was able to record , playback and analyse at data rates up to 2.488 Gbps ( SONET OC - 48 ) .
This is 16 times faster than the largest backbone links in general use on the Internet ; larger than the telephony capacity of any current communications satellite ; and equivalent to 40,000 simultaneous telephone calls .
It can be fitted with 48 Gbyte of memory ( 500 - 1000 times larger than found in an average personal computer ) , enabling relatively lengthy recordings of high - speed data links .
The 2.5 Gbps capacity of a single SNAPPER unit exceeds the current daily maximum data rate found on a typical large Internet exchange . ( 77 )
10 . Both AST and IDEAS offer a wide range of recorders , demultiplexers , scanners and processors , mostly designed to process European type ( CEPT ) E - 1 , E - 3 ( etc ) signals at data rates of up to 160 Mbps .
Signals may be recorded to banks of high - speed tape recorders , or into high capacity " RAID " ( 78 ) hard disk networks .
Intercepted optical signals can be examined with the AST Model 257E " SONET analyser " .
11 . Once communications links have been analysed and broken down to their constituent parts , the next stage of Comint collection involves multi-channel processors which extract and filter messages and signals from the desired channels .
There are three broad categories of interest : " voice grade channels " , normally carrying telephony ; fax communications ; and analogue data modems .
A wide selection of multi-channel Comint processors are available .
Almost all of them separate voice , fax and data messages into distinct " streams " for downstream processing and analysis .
12 . The AST Model 120 multi-channel processor - used by NSA in different configurations known as STARQUAKE , COBRA and COPPERHEAD - can handle 1,000 simultaneous voice channels and automatically extract fax , data and voice traffic .
Model 128 , larger still , can process 16 European E - 3 channels ( a data rate of 500 Mbps ) and extract 480 channels of interest .
The 1999 giant of AST 's range , the Model 132 " Voice Channel Demultiplexer " , can scan up to 56,700 communications channels , extracting more than 3,000 voice channels of interest .
AST also provides Sigint equipment to intercept low capacity VSAT ( 79 ) satellite services used by smaller businesses and domestic users .
These systems can be intercepted by the AST Model 285 SCPS processor , which identifies and extracts up to 48 channels of interest , distinguished between voice , fax and data .
13 . According to US government publications , an early Wideband Extraction system was installed at NSA 's Vint Hill Farms field station in 1970 , about the time that systematic COMSAT interception collection began .
That station is now closed .
US publications identify the NSA / CSS Regional Sigint Operations Centre at San Antonio , Texas , as a site currently providing a multi-channel Wideband Extraction service .
Filtering , data processing , and facsimile analysis
14 .
Once communications channels have been identified and signals of interest extracted , they are analysed further by sophisticated workstations using special purpose software .
AST 's ELVIRA Signals Analysis Workstation is typical of this type of Sigint equipment .
This system , which can be used on a laptop computer in covert locations , surveys incoming channels and extracts standard Comint data , including technical specifications ( STRUM ) and information about call destinations ( SRI , or signal related information ) .
Selected communications are relayed to distant locations using NSA standard " Collected Signals Data Format " ( CSDF ) . ( 80 )
15 . High - speed data systems can also be passed to AST 's TRAILMAPPER software system , which works at a data rate of up to 2.5 Gbps .
It can interpret and analyse every type of telecommunications system , including European , American and optical standards .
TRAILMAPPER appears to have been designed with a view to analysing ATM ( asynchronous transfer mode ) communications .
ATM is a modern , high - capacity digital communications system .
It is better suited than standard Internet connections to carrying multimedia traffic and to providing business with private networks ( VPN , LAN or WAN ) .
TRAILMAPPER will identify and characterise such business networks .
16 .
In the next stage downstream , intercepted signals are processed according to whether they are voice , fax or data .
AST's " Data Workstation " is designed to categorise all aspects of data communications , including systems for handling e-mail or sending files on the Internet .
( 81 ) Although the very latest modem systems ( other than ISDN ) are not included in its advertised specification , it is clear from published research that AST has developed the technology to intercept and process the latest data communications systems used by individuals and business to access the Internet .
( 82 ) The Data Workstation can stored and automatically process 10,000 different recorded signals .
17 . Fax messages are processed by AST 's Fax Image Workstation .
This is described as a " user friendly , interactive analysis tool for rapid examination images stored on disk .
Although not mentioned in AST 's literature , standard fax pre-processing for Dictionary computers involves automatic " optical character recognition " ( OCR ) software .
This turns the typescript into computer readable ( and processable ) text .
The effectiveness of these systems makes fax - derived Comint an important collection subsystem .
It has one drawback .
OCR computer systems that can reliably recognise handwriting do not exist .
No one knows how to design such a system .
It follows that , perversely , hand - written fax messages may be a secure form of communication that can evade Dictionary surveillance criteria , provided always that the associated " signal related information " ( calling and receiving fax numbers ) have not been recognised as being of interest and directed to a Fax Image Workstation .
18 . AST also make a " Pager Identification and Message Extraction " system which automatically collects and processes data from commercial paging systems .
IDEAS offer a Video Teleconferencing Processor that can simultaneously view or record two simultaneous teleconferencing sessions .
Sigint systems to intercept cellular mobile phone networks such as GSM are not advertised by AST or IDEAS , but are available from other US contractors .
The specifications and ready availability of such systems indicate how industrialised and pervasive Comint has became .
It has moved far from the era when ( albeit erroneously ) , it was publicly associated only with monitoring diplomatic or military messages .

Traffic analysis , keyword recognition , text retrieval , and topic analysis
19 . Traffic analysis is a method of obtaining intelligence from signal related information , such as the number dialled on a telephone call , or the Calling Line Identification Data ( CLID ) which identifies the person making the call .
Traffic analysis can be used where message content is not available , for example when encryption is used .
By analysing calling patterns , networks of personal associations may be analysed and studied .
This is a principal method of examining voice communications .
20 .
Whenever machine readable communications are available , keyword recognition is fundamental to Dictionary computers , and to the ECHELON system .
The Dictionary function is straightforward .
Its basic mode of operation is akin to web search engines .
The differences are of substance and of scale .
Dictionaries implement the tasking of their host station against the entire mass of collected communications , and automate the distribution of selected raw product .
21 . Advanced systems have been developed to perform very high speed sorting of large volumes of intercepted information .
In the late 1980s , the manufacturers of the RHYOLITE Sigint satellites , TRW , designed and manufactured a Fast Data Finder ( FDF ) microchip for NSA .
The FDF chip was declassified in 1972 and made available for commercial use by a spin - off company , Paracel .
Since then Paracel has sold over 150 information filtering systems , many of them to the US government .
Paracel describes its current FDF technology as the " fastest , most accurate adaptive filtering system in the world " :
A single TextFinder application may involve trillions of bytes of textual archive and thousands of online users , or gigabytes of live data stream per day that are filtered against tens of thousands of complex interest profiles ... the TextFinder chip implements the most comprehensive character - string comparison functions of any text retrieval system in the world .
Devices like this are ideal for use in ECHELON and the Dictionary system .
22 . A lower capacity system , the PRP - 9800 Pattern Recognition Processor , is manufactured by IDEAS .
This is a computer card which can be fitted to a standard PC .
It can analyse data streams at up to 34 Mbps ( the European E - 3 standard ) , matching every single bit to more than 1000 pre-selected patterns .
23 . Powerful though Dictionary methods and keyword search engines may be , however , they and their giant associated intelligence databases may soon seem archaic .
Topic analysis is a more powerful and intuitive technique , and one that NSA is developing and promoting with confidence .
Topic analysis enables Comint customers to ask their computers to " find me documents about subject X " .
X might be " Shakespeare in love " or " Arms to Iran " .
24 .
In a standard US test used to evaluate topic analysis systems , ( 83 ) one task the analysis program is given is to find information about " Airbus subsidies " .
The traditional approach involves supplying the computer with the key terms , other relevant data , and synonyms .
In this example , the designations A - 300 or A - 320 might be synonymous with " Airbus " .
The disadvantage of this approach is that it may find irrelevant intelligence ( for example , reports about export subsidies to goods flown on an Airbus ) and miss relevant material ( for example a financial analysis of a company in the consortium which does not mention the Airbus product by name ) .
Topic analysis overcomes this and is better matched to human intelligence .
25 .
The main detectable thrust of NSA research on topic analysis centres on a method called N - gram analysis .
Developed inside NSA 's Research group - responsible for Sigint automation - N - gram analysis is a fast , general method of sorting and retrieving machine - readable text according to language and / or topic .
The N - gram system is claimed to work independently of the language used or the topic studied .
NSA patented the method in 1995 . ( 84 )
26 .
To use N - gram analysis , the operator ignores keywords and defines the enquiry by providing the system with selected written documents concerning the topic of interest .
The system determines what the topic is from the seed group of documents , and then calculates the probability that other documents cover the same topic .
In 1994 , NSA made its N - gram system available for commercial exploitation .
NSA 's research group claimed that it could be used on " very large data sets ( millions of documents ) " , could be quickly implemented on any computer system and that it could operate effectively " in text containing a great many errors ( typically 10 - 15 % of all characters ) " .
27 . According to former NSA Director William Studeman , " information management will be the single most important problem for the ( US ) Intelligence Community " in the future .
( 85 ) Explaining this point in 1992 , he described the type of filtering involved in systems like ECHELON :
One [ unidentified ] intelligence collection system alone can generate a million inputs per half hour ; filters throw away all but 6500 inputs ; only 1,000 inputs meet forwarding criteria ; 10 inputs are normally selected by analysts and only one report Is produced .
These are routine statistics for a number of intelligence collection and analysis systems which collect technical intelligence .
The " Data Workstation " Comint software system analyses up to 10,000 recorded messages ,
identifying Internet traffic , e-mail messages and attachments
Speech recognition systems
28 .
For more than 40 years , NSA , ARPA , GCHQ and the British government Joint Speech Research Unit have conducted and sponsored research into speech recognition .
Many press reports ( and the previous STOA report ) have suggested that such research has provided systems which can automatically select telephone communications of intelligence interest based on the use of particular " key words " by a speaker .
If available , such systems would enable vastly more extensive Comint information to be gathered from telephone conversations than is available from other methods of analysis .
The contention that telephone word - spotting systems are readily available appears to by supported by the recent availability of a string of low - cost software products resulting from this research .
These products permit PC users to dictate to their computers instead of entering data through the keyboard . ( 86 )
29 .
The problem is that for Comint applications , unlike personal computer dictation products , speech recognition systems have to operate in a multi-speaker , multi-language environment where numerous previously never heard speakers may each feature physiological differences , dialect variations , and speech traits .

Talent flows to where it is highly rewarded so if price and wage control limit rewards in one sector of the economy , talent will flow to the uncontrolled sector .
Mark Ramseyer looks at one implication :
The Japanese national health insurance
provides universal coverage .
Necessarily , this entails a subsidy that
dramatically raises the demand for medical services .
In the face of the
increased demand , the government suppresses costs by suppressing
prices .
By combining extensive biographical ( including income ) data on
all 449 Tokyo cosmetic surgeons and a random sample of 499 other Tokyo
physicians , I explore the effect of this price suppression on the
allocation of talent and the development of expertise .
Crucially , the
national health insurance does not cover services – like elective
cosmetic surgery – deemed medically superfluous .
Facing price caps in
the covered sector but competitive prices in these superfluous sectors ,
the most talented doctors should tend to shift into the superfluous
sectors and there to invest heavily in their expertise .
I find evidence
consistent with this : cosmetic surgeons earn higher incomes than other
doctors ; are more likely to have attended a national ( generally more
selective ) medical school ; are more likely to have served on the
faculty of a medical school ; and are more likely to be board - certified .
I speculate on the broader implications this phenomenon poses for the
allocation of talent in medicine .
Anton N is not a programmer by trade .
Whenever he comes across “ questionable ” code in his job as an engineer , he always gives the programmer the benefit of the doubt : it might just have to be that complicated to work ; maybe he did it to work around some system limitation ; or perhaps it ’s some optimized routine .
It ’s only fair .
Certainly , he would n't want some programmer critiquing his decision to use the modial interaction of magneto - reluctance ( rather than a more efficient method , such as capacitive directance ) for supplying inverse reactive current in a unilateral phase detractor .
Not too long ago , Anton had one of those questionable code moments .
It all started when he noticed some rather bizarre readings and strange error messages come up in the Test Control System .
The TCS is a C - based application that was built by in - house programmers over the course of several years .
It was designed so that , theoretically , it could monitor an unlimited number of devices ( of any possible type ) , each which could provide an unlimited amount of input via an unlimited amount of connections .
In reality , Anton and his fellow engineers use the TCS to monitor one , maybe two , temperature control devices that they build for use in large - scale industrial equipment .
Unsure of what exactly the TCS was telling him , Anton went to the source code .
Usually , that ’s where most problems were found .
While paging through the Temperature Device Module , Anton noticed some rather oddly formatted code …
int K2C ( Ktemp int ) { // See tempconv.xls if ( Ktemp= 273 ) {return 0 } else if ( Ktemp= 274 ) {return 1 } else if ( Ktemp= 275 ) {return 2 } else if ( Ktemp= 276 ) {return 3 } else if ( Ktemp= 277 ) {return 4 } else if ( Ktemp= 278 ) {return 5 } else if ( Ktemp= 279 ) {return 6 } else if ( Ktemp= 280 ) {return 7 } else if ( Ktemp= 281 ) {return 8 } else if ( Ktemp= 282 ) {return 9 } else if ( Ktemp= 283 ) {return 10 } else if ( Ktemp= 284 ) {return 11 } else if ( Ktemp= 285 ) {return 12 } else if ( Ktemp= 286 ) {return 13 } else if ( Ktemp= 287 ) {return 14 } else if ( Ktemp= 288 ) {return 15 } else if ( Ktemp= 289 ) {return 16 } else if ( Ktemp= 290 ) {return 17 } else if ( Ktemp= 291 ) {return 18 } else if ( Ktemp= 292 ) {return 19 } else if ( Ktemp= 293 ) {return 20 } else if ( Ktemp= 294 ) {return 21 } else if ( Ktemp= 295 ) {return 22 } else if ( Ktemp= 296 ) {return 23 } else if ( Ktemp= 297 ) {return 24 } else if ( Ktemp= 298 ) {return 25 } else if ( Ktemp= 299 ) {return 26 } else if ( Ktemp= 300 ) {return 27 } else if ( Ktemp= 301 ) {return 28 } else if ( Ktemp= 302 ) {return 29 } else if ( Ktemp= 303 ) {return 30 } else { printf ( " Temp out of range " ) } }}
Clearly , the method was used to convert Kelvin to degrees Celsius .
Anton was n’t quite sure why this was used instead of " return Ktemp - 270 ; " , but he looked past it .
After all , there was something far stranger in the code …
// See tempconv.xls
It was as if the code was telling him something .
Anton … oh Anton , go see tempconv.xls .
Come on , Anton .
You know you wanna , Anton .
Do it , Anton !
Do it !
He knew that tempconv.xls certainly would n’t be good for his quickly fleeting sanity , but he just had to take a look .
He dug further in the src directory and opened up tempconv.xls .
Anton clicked through the cells – B1 , D1 , B2 , D2 , B3 , D3 – and noticed something even stranger : the cells were not set up as formulas .
Someone had apparently typed each Kelvin and degree Celsius value in by hand .
In retrospect , it probably would have been even more strange if the C - programmer was able to code an Excel formula , but not one in C .
As Anton rubbed his eyes and dreamt of the Test Control System magically melting away , something else occurred to him .
The temperature devices that they build communicate only in Kelvin : there ’s no conceivable reason that they ’d ever need to see or use Celsius .
In fact , doing so would add nothing but confusion .
Against his better judgment , Anton did a search through the codebase for " K2C " ...
Occurrence 1 : // calc the deltas deltaA = K2C( tempA1 ) - K2C(tempA2 ) ; deltaB = K2C( tempB1 ) - K2C(tempB2 ) ; deltaC = K2C( tempC1 ) - K2C(tempC2 ) ; deltaD = K2C( tempD1 ) - K2C( tempD2 ) ; Occurrence 2 : rDev = abs ( K2C( temp ) - K2C( avg ) )
Those were the only two usages of K2C that Anton could find .
After digging through the code for a few more mintues – and doing his best to avoid more " investigations " into functions like K2C – Anton realized that the Test Control System could n’t possibly be the culprit .
This whole time , it was his fault : he neglected to connect the temperature control board ’s panendermic semiboloid to the " up " end of his grammeter .
Obviously , this caused very high levels of sinusoidal depleneration and , hence , strange readings .
And to think … he was about to call the programmer ’s work a WTF !

Bottom trawling for fish is so destructive to marine environment that its plume can be seen from space !
" Bottom trawling is the most destructive of any actions that humans conduct in the ocean , " said zoologist Les Watling of the University of Hawaii .
" Ten years ago , Elliott Norse ( of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute ) and I calculated that , each year , worldwide , bottom trawlers drag an area equivalent to twice the lower 48 states .
Most of that trawling happens in deep waters , out of sight .
But now we can more clearly envision what trawling impacts down there by looking at the sediment plumes that are shallow enough for us to see from satellites . "
We kicked off 2008 with the price per barrel at double the starting point from 2007 .
Prices declined to the high $ 80 ’s though bounced back over $ 90 when the news of the stimulus plan was announced .
Prices could free fall , but as long as the Federal Reserve continues with its pro-inflation policy , prices appear more likely to stay high .
Within that context , Big Oil will be rolling out financially impressive profit figures this week .
Remember when Bush and the GOP wanted to give them even more tax breaks and handouts ?
Shell will be at the centre of a political storm this week when it posts profits of almost $ 27bn ( £ 13.6bn ) , the highest earnings ever made by a British company .
The record - breaking profits , on the back of soaring oil prices , seem likely to stir fresh allegations of profiteering .
The price of petrol has been increasing sharply , rising from 71 p a litre five years ago to about 104p a litre today , according to the AA .
Texas - based Exxon Mobil , the world ’s largest privately - owned oil company , is expected to improve on its own previous record on Friday by reporting earnings of $ 39.6bn , the biggest annual profits that the US has ever seen .

REUTERS / Peter Morgan
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City street performer “ The Naked Cowboy ” is suing Mars Inc. for $ 6 million over the use of his trademark look -- white underwear , cowboy boots and a hat -- by a blue M&M candy on a Times Square billboard .
For nearly a decade , Robert Burck has been a fixture in Times Square , where he strums a guitar on a street corner while dressed in his skimpy signature costume .
In a lawsuit filed this week in Manhattan federal court , Burck said that two oversized Times Square billboards that promote M&Ms used his look without compensating him .
The billboards feature a scantily clad blue M&M with a guitar alongside views of New York including street scenes and the Statue of Liberty .
Burck is suing privately held Mars Inc. , which makes M&Ms , and Chute Gerdeman Inc. , an Ohio agency that he said created the ad , for trademark infringement .
Neither company was immediately available for comment .
“ Just like The Naked Cowboy does on a daily basis in Times Square , the M&M is not only dressed as “ The Naked Cowboy , ” it is playing the Naked Cowboy ’s distinctive white guitar in the cartoon , ” the lawsuit said .
Mars and Chute Gerdeman “ decided to exploit and trade upon The Naked Cowboy ’s well - recognized likeness without a license and without furnishing any compensation , ” the lawsuit said .
Burck has trademarked his signature look and has made several television and movie appearances in costume , including for a televised audition on the “ American Idol ” reality TV program , the lawsuit said .
It was an electric experience , heady , powerful , filled with joy and individual empowerment .
People from all parts of society came together to work on the election .
They made signs and waved them over freeway bridges ; they printed their own literature because they could not get it fast enough .
They wrote what was needed , did the graphics , printed it .
They used their own money to get the job done .
Every dollar they spent they saw as moving them closer to the shining vision on which America was founded .
There was friendship , happiness and trust .
You may think I am talking about the Ron Paul Revolution .
Actually , that was the early days of the Libertarian Party .
The Presidential Campaign that incited us was that of Roger MacBride in 1976 .
You would not know today .
I still have many Libertarian friends but the Libertarian Party is very different .
You need to know what happened and why .
We lived those heady days ;
We stood on the bridges holding up signs in all weather .
We were well on the way to creating a real grassroots organization .
What stopped us was people who decided we , ' needed to get organized . '
You know about one of those people .
That is Edward H. Crane , III of Cato Institute .
Others of like mind followed .
If you are a Ron Paul Activist , working on the Revolution , you are working for something that matters much more than electing Ron Paul as President , as important as that is .
You are working on creating a new form through which the people can govern themselves .
That is the revolutionary part .
The people must govern themselves .
Ron Paul signed up to roll back the Federal Government .
The rest of the job , most of it , truthfully , will remain to be carried out from our communities by us as individuals who live there .
You will encounter many people who want to ' organize ' you .
Ignore them and keep doing it exactly like you are doing it now .
Using the tools they offer you will result in the creation of yet another Reform Party , another ' not for profit ' that makes lots of money for those who are at the top .
The idea that there is a top should be enough to tell you this is the wrong direction .
Instead you need to continue to use the hub system that you have been using .
That was what I recommended to the Libertarian Party in 1999 .
Instead of a National Office that ' coordinated ' the grassroots I proposed that they close the office in DC and provide services to activists .
Those were to include putting on a National Convention with speakers and a newsletter that simply let people share their experiences , successful and unsuccessful , with local projects .
There , literature could also be shared , made available via the Internet with local people adding and using it as needed .
Naturally , no one listened .
They were firmly entrenched in the ' structure ' of a political party and busy jockeying for positions that would augment egos and income .
Here and there across the country local LP organizations continued to use the networking forms you would recognize .
San Diego is one of those .
San Diego declined to be part of the centralization of the LP .
Instead of central committees voting on how to spend money they came together ( this spanned the time before the Internet ) to hear people talk about their ideas for projects .
Activists then decided how to spend their own time and money .
That is what the Ron Paul Revolution has been doing online .
That is the essence of networking , each deciding for themselves where they will participate .
That is the story of the past .
It was easier for us then in many ways .
We did not have the Internet but we also faced less immediate threats .
Today one of the most critical issues we face is the present use of the still unpassed Home Grown Terrorism Act .
It is already being used .
Following their usual strategies the NeoCons did not wait for Congress .
The idea of Constitutionalists as Terrorists is part of the training being given to local police and has been for a while now .
I heard that straight from the horse 's mouth last September at a National Federation of Republican Women 's Luncheon .
The guest speaker was a local law enforcement officer who lumped Constitutionalists together with gang members .
In the terms of the man speaking I am a terrorist .
None of the other ladies present questioned him on that .
I did .
We are facing immediate danger and we need to take action .
I ncreasingly , those of us involved on issues will be targeted because we are threatening the corporate establishment .
There is no reason to make it easier for them and more dangerous for ourselves .
The solution is even more networking and increased communication between those of us working on specific issues .

Anti-whaling activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have admitted to bugging Japan 's whaling fleet with high - tech tracking devices in order to follow them .
Sea Shepherd 's vessel the Steve Irwin caught up with the Japanese whaling fleet near the Shackleton Ice Shelf on Saturday , having returned to Antarctic waters from a refueling pit stop in Melbourne .
Sea Shepherd leader Paul Watson said the bugs had been planted on the Japanese harpoon boat Yushin Maru 2 when two of its crew boarded the vessel last month .
" That 's why when we left Melbourne it only took us nine days to find them .
We went straight towards them , " Mr Watson said .
" I think it 's really funny .
They are probably ripping the ship apart right now trying to find them , but they are n't going to find them . "
Mr Watson said further tracking devices had also been planted on some of the other Japanese vessels .
" We are not saying which ones , or how we did it , but we have the ability to follow the fleet and that 's what we are doing right now , " Mr Watson said .
A spokesman for the Institute of Cetacean Research , which conducts Japan 's scientific whaling program on behalf of the Japanese government , admitted it was possible the Yushin Maru had been bugged .
" Given that the Sea Shepherd found the fleet so quickly it is certainly one explanation , " spokesman Glenn Inwood said .
He said it was also possible the two Sea Shepherd activists , who boarded the Yushin Maru on January 15 , were treated too lightly by Japan .
The incident sparked a three - day standoff before the Australian customs vessel the Oceanic Viking intervened .
Mr Inwood said he did not believe the other Japanese ships had been bugged .
" It 's seems very unlikely .
There has n't been any opportunity for the Sea Shepherd to have planted devices on any of the other vessels , " he said .
Mr Watson said the Sea Shepherd had managed to chase the Japanese fleet for the past three days , during which no whales had been killed .
" We will keep this up until the middle of March , by which time the weather will have turned and they ( the whalers ) will have no choice but to give it up , " he said .
Mr Watson estimated the whalers had managed to kill no more than 400 whales since the season began in November , which would make it almost impossible for Japan to reach its annual quota of up to 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales .

How Far Will the Clintons Go? Hillary Clinton , who has built her case for the presidency on her superior “ ready on Day One ” management skills , burned through almost $ 130 million of campaign money , had to kick in $ 5 million from her own murky family funds , and is now pressing her chief financial backers to find creative ways to raise more money .

Some of those financial schemes appear to skirt the law – as some backers consider putting money into “ independent ” entities that can spend unlimited sums but are n’t supposed to coordinate with the campaign – while other ideas are more traditional , like appealing to wealthy donors involved with the pro-Israel AIPAC lobby .
Sen .
Clinton ’s new scramble for money – as well as her campaign ’s declaration that it is prepared to override the will of the elected Democratic delegates if necessary to secure the nomination – raise the question of just how far Bill and Hillary Clinton are willing to go to achieve their presidential restoration .
Some Democrats , who have e-mailed me , praise the ruthlessness of the Clinton political machine , arguing that only a readiness to throw sharp elbows can defeat the Republicans this fall .
These Democrats hate what they call Barack Obama ’s “ Kumbayah ” message of national reconciliation , a reference to the campfire song based on an old African spiritual .
However , other Democrats fear that the Clintons are putting their personal ambitions ahead of what ’s good for the party and the country , that they are ready to dirty up Sen .
Obama with attack ads and dismiss his millions of supporters as – what one key Clinton backer called – “ a cult of personality . ”
If the Clintons overturn the majority will , the Democratic convention in Denver could bring to mind the infamous Chicago convention in 1968 when the Democratic establishment imposed its favored candidate , Vice President Hubert Humphrey , on a rebellious rank - and - file , contributing to the election of Republican Richard Nixon .
Though a repeat of the 1968 violence is unlikely , a Clinton - driven insistence that the will of Democratic voters be cast aside could alienate millions of young people and independents who have rallied to Sen .
Obama ’s message of political change .
[ For details on the comparison to 1968 , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Stomping on Their Children ’s Dreams . ” ]
In a conference call to reporters this week , Sen. Clinton ’s communications director , Howard Wolfson , made clear that the campaign was prepared to rely on her superior support among the 796 “ superdelegates ” – party insiders and government officials – to overcome Obama ’s lead among delegates chosen through primaries and caucuses .
“ I want to be clear about the fact that neither campaign is in a position to win this nomination without the support of the votes of the superdelegates , ” Wolfson said , adding that the Clinton campaign would make no distinction between the caucus / primary delegates and the “ superdelegates . ”
“ We are interested in acquiring delegates , period , ” Wolfson said .
[ Boston Globe , Feb. 13 , 2008 ]
Senior strategist Mark Penn also indicated that the Clinton campaign would press the issue of seating pro-Clinton delegates from Florida and Michigan , where she won unauthorized primaries conducted after the national party barred the states from holding contests before Feb.
5 and after other major candidates agreed not to compete .
The Money Race The Clinton campaign also is appealing for substantial sums of money to spend on advertisements in upcoming primary states : Texas , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 13 that some of Sen. Clinton ’s top fund - raisers , who have “ maxed out ” at the individual limit of $ 2,300 and have tapped out their personal network of donors , are consulting with lawyers about how they can create “ independent ” groups that can spend unlimited money in support of her campaign .
Susie Tompkins Buell , founder of the Esprit clothing company , was weighing whether to start her own entity for buying ads to promote Clinton or to put money into an existing pro-Clinton organization , like the feminist political organization Emily ’s List which has already spent about $ 1 million on Clinton ’s behalf , the Journal reported .
" We all feel very passionate about it , so the question is , what is the best thing we can do to get her across the finish line ? "
Buell told the Journal .
The Journal interviewed another Clinton fund - raiser , who declined to be named but who said he might spend $ 500,000 on pro-Clinton television , radio and newspaper ads .
As the Journal noted , however , “ It 's not certain that any of the efforts by the Clinton fund - raisers will get off the ground [ because ] campaign - finance law makes it difficult for campaign insiders to fund independent efforts to elect candidates . ”
[ WSJ , Feb. 13 , 2008 ] “ Independent ” campaign initiatives carry both legal and political risks .
Not only would a new group have to convince Federal Election Commission lawyers that it is not collaborating with the candidate , the tactic also might remind Democrats of how pro-Republican “ independent ” organizations , such as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , attacked – or “ swift - boated ” – Sen.
John Kerry ’s Vietnam War record .
On the other hand , some hyper - partisan Democrats might laud Sen. Clinton for resorting to hardball tactics that have worked for Republicans .
AIPAC Appeal The Clinton team also was shaking the money trees in more traditional ways .
For instance , campaign finance director Jonathan Mantz met with donors from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in a Washington hotel lobby when the AIPAC supporters were in town for other business , the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 14 .
AIPAC wields its legendary influence in Washington , in large part , because of its ability to pour money into cash - strapped political campaigns .
A longtime Democratic operative once recounted an anecdote to explain how AIPAC has amassed its extraordinary clout .
He recalled a situation when he was working for a powerful House committee chairman who normally ran unopposed but found himself facing a well - financed Republican challenger .
Unaccustomed to raising large sums of campaign cash , the senior Democrat asked some of his aides to reach out to people they knew .
One call was made to AIPAC chief Thomas Dine , who assured the congressman that there was no need to worry .
Suddenly , campaign contributions were pouring in from all over the country , from AIPAC ’s network of donors .
With that one phone call , the congressman ’s financial problems were solved , assuring both his reelection and his gratitude to AIPAC .
However , given the political sensitivity of the Iraq War – and AIPAC ’s perceived support for neoconservative strategies in the Middle East – many rank - and - file Democrats view the pro-Israel organization with greater suspicion these days .
But the Clinton campaign apparently feels the risk in reaching out to AIPAC is worth the reward .
Sen .
Clinton ’s money scramble also has raised eyebrows about the sources of the Clinton family income .
The New York Times ’ Feb. 15 lead editorial urged Clinton and Sen. John McCain to join Sen. Obama in releasing tax returns that provide details not included in annual congressional disclosure forms .
“ The need for greater transparency regarding the income and overall financial dealings of candidates and their spouses was underscored by Mrs. Clinton ’s recent decision to make a $ 5 million loan to her campaign , ” the Times wrote .
“ The campaign said the money came from her share of the Clintons ’ joint resources , and that calls attention to the lack of information about their family finances .
“ As a former president , Bill Clinton has been making millions annually giving speeches and traveling the globe .
What is publicly known about his business dealings is sketchy , and clearer disclosure of them is required to reassure voters that Mrs. Clinton ’s candidacy is unencumbered by hidden entanglements . ”
On Feb. 9 at Consortiumnews.com , we published an article that made a similar point , noting that the Clintons have amassed virtually their entire multi-million - dollar fortune ( estimated at around $ 30 million ) in the seven years after leaving the White House .
While some of that money is explained from book contracts , the bulk of the family ’s post - presidential income appears to come from Bill Clinton ’s lucrative speaking engagements and financial deals with political backers .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Hillary ’s Curious Campaign Loan . ” ]
The larger campaign question , however , may be whether the Clintons will set any limits on their hunger to return to the White House – and whether Democrats will view that single - minded determination as a plus or a minus .

Home Testing Telecoms Software with Quviq QuickCheck Testing Telecoms Software with Quviq QuickCheck by John Hughes , Thomas Arts , Joakim Johansson , Ulf Wiger .
We present a case study in which a novel testing tool , Quviq QuickCheck , is used to test an industrial implementation of the Megaco protocol .
We considered positive and negative testing and we used our developed specification to test an old version in order to estimate how useful QuickCheck could potentially be when used early in development .
The results of the case study indicate that , by using Quviq QuickCheck , we would have been able to detect faults early in the development .
We detected faults that had not been detected by other testing techniques .
We found unclarities in the specifications and potential faults when the software is used in a different setting .
The results are considered promising enough to Ericsson that they are investing in an even larger case study , this time from the beginning of the development of a new product .
That 's right , the illustrious John Hughes is dropping out of school to do an Erlang startup !

Millions of lives have been saved by immunisation , Unicef says
Worldwide , the number of young children who died in 2006 dropped below 10 million for the first time , it said .
Measles vaccinations , mosquito nets and increased rates of breast - feeding were said to have contributed to the fall .
However , experts said most of the deaths were preventable and that more needed to be done .
The Unicef figures are based on government - conducted surveys in more than 50 countries in 2005 and 2006 .
Unicef said 9.7 million children under five died in 2006 , down from almost 13 million in 1990 .
The decline was particularly marked in Morocco , Vietnam and the Dominican Republic , where the number of children dying dropped by a third , Unicef said .
The Latin American and Caribbean region is on course to achieve the millennium development goal of reducing child mortality by two - thirds by 2015 - it registered 27 deaths on average for every 1,000 live births in 2006 , compared with 55 in 1990 .
WORLDWIDE DEATHS AMONG UNDER -FIVES IN 2006 1990 figures appear in brackets Sub-Saharan Africa :
4.8 m ( 4.1 m ) Eastern / Southern Africa :
1.9 m ( 1.8 m ) West and Central Africa :
2.9 m ( 2.4 m ) Mid East and North Africa : 0.4 m ( 0.7 m ) South Asia :
3.1 m ( 4.7 m ) East Asia and Pacific :
0.9 m ( 2 m ) Latin America / Caribbean :
0.3 m ( 0.6 m ) Central / E Europe and CIS :
0.2 m ( 0.4 m ) Industrialised countries :
0.1 m ( 0.1 m )
World :
9.7 m ( 12.7 m )
What 's driven the change ?
The majority of deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa ( 4.8 million ) and south Asia ( 3.1 million ) .
Rates were highest in west and central Africa , where HIV and Aids are prevalent .
The actual numbers of deaths in many parts of Africa rose , although mortality rates were lower .
Ann Veneman , Unicef 's executive director , said that dropping below 10 million was an historic moment , but warned that most of the deaths were preventable .
" We know that lives can be saved when children have access to integrated , community - based health services , backed by a strong referral system , " she said .
Peter Salama , Unicef 's head of global health , called on the global community to invest another $ 5 bn ( £ 2.4bn ) to help the UN achieve its millennium development goals .
Millions of deaths could be prevented using currently available health measures , Mr Salama said .
Among these were campaigns to increase childhood immunisations , the distribution of vitamin A supplements and mosquito nets treated with insecticides , drug treatments for children infected with HIV .
In sub -Saharan Africa , deaths from measles have been reduced by 75 % due to increased vaccination coverage .
In Vietnam , child mortality dropped by about 40 % after 30,000 people were trained as health workers and paid to treat people in their own villages , Unicef said .
Convincing mothers to exclusively breastfeed their children for the first six months of life was also important , the agency said .
The remote Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is the only country in the world which puts happiness at the heart of government policy .
The government must consider every policy for its impact not only on Gross Domestic Product , but also on GNH : " Gross National Happiness " .
The politics of happiness has led Bhutan to make very different decisions from countries simply searching for wealth .
The capital , Thimpu , is remarkable for its lack of advertising .
In an attempt to hold back consumerism the city council recently banned hoardings promoting Coke and Pepsi .
Bhutan was the last nation in the world to introduce television in 1999 .
Recently they banned a number of channels including international wrestling and MTV , which they felt did little to promote happiness .
Bhutan has even banned plastic bags and tobacco on the grounds that they make the country less happy .
The one set of traffic lights Bhutan ever had was on this junction .
But people found them frustrating , so they went back to a human being .
Buddhist prayer flags flutter in the wind .
In Bhutan the government puts inner spiritual development on a par with material improvement .
One of the pillars of Bhutan 's happiness philosophy is care for the environment .
Strict conservation laws are aimed at achieving sustainable development .
Development has been moderated and people are less well off financially than they could have been .
Bhutan has been able to adopt radical policies partly because it is a remote kingdom and partly because it is an absolute monarchy .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Faced with mounting account delinquencies , major U.S. banks are penalizing credit - card customers late on payments by hiking their accounts to maximum default interest rates of 30 % and more -- even those with good credit records .
Default rates imposed for late payments , exceeding credit limits and bounced payment checks typically are levied on cardholders with poor credit scores , often incrementally .
But state banking regulators and watchdog groups report a growing number of complaints of maximum default rates being imposed on erring customers with above - average credit scores of 700 and higher .
The tighter rein on credit - card debtors comes amid heightened scrutiny in Congress of suspect industry practices .
Lawmakers fear wary lenders will resort in the months ahead to " hair - trigger repricing " of interest rates on cardholder 's existing balances at the least provocation .
" We find it totally unfair that if you 're one day late , you get hit with a 30 % - plus interest rate , " said Linda Sherry , director of national priorities for Consumer Action .
" There 's been a pervasive attitude of hands - off the industry because we do n't want to tinker with the marketplace , but some of its practices are just patently wrong . "
" Some issuers are pointing to the hits they 've taken from the subprime mortgage fallout as a reason Congress should n't regulate the credit - card industry , " said U.S. Rep.
Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , chair of the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit .
But " the hands - off approach prior Congresses have taken to this industry has spawned unfair practices that hurt consumers , including hair - trigger repricing . "
A questionable concession
In a bid to forestall tighter regulation , leading card issuers Citibank and Chase declared this year they 'd abandon highly criticized " universal default " policies .
Under that practice , banks boost a cardholder 's interest rate for delinquencies on outside accounts or a drop in their credit score even if they have a flawless payment record on that lender 's account .
Consumer advocates said the banks made that concession knowing they 'll need to take a harder line with customers as delinquencies rise and would face intense heat in Congress if they sharply hiked rates for so - called " off us " activity .
Citibank , which dropped universal default in March , declined to disclose whether it is since hiking late payers to maximum default rates more often or swiftly .
" We reprice to our default rate only a very small portion of customers , " spokesman Sam Wang said .
The industry 's fear
The decline in Americans ' home equity due to slumping real - estate values is limiting cardholders ' ability to pay off higher - interest credit - card debt with home - equity loans .
As that resource becomes unavailable to more borrowers , experts say , lenders are taking aggressive measures to limit their exposure on unsecured credit - card debt .
Credit - card lending is the riskiest personal debt for banks to hold because , unlike mortgages or car loans , it 's not secured by collateralized real property they can seize if borrowers fail to make payments .
Lenders are now confronting rising defaults on the $ 920 billion that the Federal Reserve estimates Americans currently carry in credit - card debt .
Delinquencies of 90 days or more -- which lenders generally write off -- rose 18 % to $ 961 million in October from a year earlier at 17 trusts holding 45 % of U.S. credit - card debt , according to an Associated Press analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
Free rein on rate - setting
Today 's punitive default rates of 30 % and more owe to the absence of usury ceilings in Delaware and South Dakota , which eliminated them during the 1981 - 82 recession to attract major banks ' credit - card operations .
Those states ' subsequent big job gains came at the loss of interest - rate protections for cardholders nationwide .
States cannot impose their own rate ceilings because of a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that permitted banks to " export " uncapped credit - card interest rates in their headquarter state to customers throughout the nation .
Consumer advocates say banking regulators in Delaware and South Dakota have become industry champions rather than watchdogs .
Delaware Bank Commissioner Robert A. Glen did not return repeated phone calls inquiring what his agency is doing to police or curb abusive practices of the major credit - card banks based in his mid-Atlantic state .
Due to limited government oversight , neither regulators nor industry analysts have the means to determine the degree to which lenders are taking customers to the highest default rates allowed in cardholder agreements accepted at the time of application .
The default rates typically are set at the prime interest rate -- currently 7.25 % -- plus an added percentage of up to 25 % .
But issuers can jack rates much higher when card agreements expire , typically two years from the issue date .
' Red alert '
The New York State Banking Department has been fielding more than 50 complaints a day recently from credit - card customers , mostly about steep interest - rate hikes , agency spokeswoman Jacqueline McCormack said .
The department lacks the authority to do anything about them , she said .
Industry analysts said they'd be surprised if banks are increasing hair - trigger repricing , but acknowledged that rate repricing is the only means they have to manage risk with existing customers .
" Credit - card issuers are tightening standards .
They are on red alert , " said Scott Valentin , a banking analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey .
" I 'd be surprised if they 're resorting to hair - trigger repricing on a widespread scale with all the political scrutiny on them , " said Curtis Arnold , founder of cardratings.com .
" It would be crazy for them to start engaging in such egregious activity en masse when they 're already under the gun . "
Regulatory front
Long criticized for regulatory laxity under former Chairman Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve is proposing that cardholders get 45 - day notice of a rate hike , with the option to cease charge activity and retire the balance at the existing interest rate .
Banks currently do n't have to give any notice and some backdate punitive rate hikes to the start of the last billing cycle .
U.S. Sens. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , and Claire McCaskill , D - Mo. , introduced the Stop Unfair Practices in Credit Cards Act in May following an investigation and hearing by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , which Levin chairs .
Among the act 's provisions :
A limit on penalty rate hikes of no more than 7 percentage points .
Rate hikes could apply only to future credit - card debt and not to debt incurred prior to the increase .
A prohibition on " pay to pay " fees when cardholders make a payment , whether by mail , telephone , electronic transfer or otherwise .
A requirement that payments be applied first to balances with the highest interest charge and not the lowest as is now the general practice .
The overriding issue is the unchecked hand lenders have to change terms virtually at will , said Maloney , who is preparing to introduce reform legislation in the House subcommittee she chairs .
" Disclosure is n't enough to protect consumers when the issuer can change terms of the contract at any time and in any way , " Maloney said .
" Many issuers can and do change the interest rate , the penalties , over - limit fees , how rates are calculated , the payment date and many other features . "
For now , the lone recourse for those hit with high default rates is an appeal to the lender to rescind the hike if they have a solid account record .

Members of a Florida county school board who last month wanted a classroom balance between evolution with intelligent design have quietly reversed their positions .
Shortly before Thanksgiving , four members of the Polk County School Board said they did n't support Florida 's proposed science education guidelines , which designate evolution as a fundamental concept that every student should understand .
Wired Science covered the controversy , which came hot on the heels of a Texas education official 's firing for telling people about a lecture critical of intelligent design .
A new battle appeared to have broken out between proponents of evolution – the scientifically observed and accepted explanation for the development of life on Earth – and intelligent design , a religiously - inspired account of life 's origins as being too complicated and coincidental to be explained by anything but divine intervention .
Barely a month later , reports the Tampa Tribune , " the controversy is dying with a whimper , " with school board officials insisting that their personal belief in intelligent design should n't be taught to kids as science .
What happened ?
You can start with the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster .
The satirical religious Web site asserts that an omnipotent , airborne clump of spaghetti intelligently designed all life with the deft touch of its " noodly appendage . "
Adherents call themselves Pastafarians .
They deluged Polk school board members with e-mail demanding equal time for
Flying Spaghetti Monsterism 's version of intelligent design .
" They 've made us the laughingstock of the world , " said Margaret Lofton , a school board member who supports intelligent design .
She dismissed the e-mail as ridiculous and insulting .
The Tribune also credits attention generated by science bloggers , especially Pharygula and Wired Science , who took a locally reported story and made it national .
And make no mistake – this was , and is , a national story .
If evolution and intelligent design were forced to share classroom credibility in Florida , it would be that much easier for a similarly diluted curriculum to pass in Texas , which is embarking on its own curricula revisions .
If Texas wanted scientifically bankrupt textbooks , then textbook manufacturers would provide them – and other states would buy them , too .
So chalk one up for science , and remember : just because you believe in God does n't mean you can't believe in evolution .

Dealing with personal failure is one of the great struggles of growing up .
When we are young , the possibilities seem without limit , but as the years pass , we face every manner of barrier that causes us to be all too aware that we face a world with many constraints , many of them due to the limits of the temporal world but also , we must admit , many of them due to our own inadequacies .
I ’m thinking in particular of my great failure to become a heavy drinker — I mean a serious , quaff - it - down - every - night , devil - may - care , kind of drinker .
I think back to when I was a young man , and how I split the world between two types of people : those who seriously drink , managing their lives well and enjoying every minute ; and the other type who have a " glass of wine at dinner " but nothing else .
How I heaped disdain on the latter type — those puritans who poured up a tiny glass for purely functional purposes only , such as to " relax after a hard day ’s work , " or to " cleanse the palette during dinner . "
How they collected bottles and talked so sweetly about vintages and labels and smelled their wine long and hard .
How pathetic !
At dinner parties , some well - dressed man would refuse a cocktail — you might as well not come at all — and then lovingly take little sips of grape extract with the meal .
When the host or hostess offers to pour another glass , the gesture arrives : the hand over the glass !
It ’s as if to say : I refuse to live robustly as part of this gang .
I ’m too weak , too precious , to handle more .
So many of our influences in life are of a negative kind , people we observe and swear : I will never be like that .
But I ’m here to confess that I am indeed like that .
It is not something I ever wanted .
I wanted to be that other man who drank two double scotches before dinner , two or three glasses of wine during dinner , a brandy over dinner , and finally some peculiar liqueur with dessert .
If I drank like that now , I would be in intensive care and miss work for weeks .
I ’m not sure entirely when the softening and compromises set in .
Instead of two high balls before dinner , I would secretly and inauspiciously have one .
Then during dinner , I started to drink more slowly and then use water to quench dinner thirst — a very bad sign .
Then the whole brandy thing was cut , as was the fancy liqueur bit .
Once I gave up the before - dinner liquor , it was straight into the abyss .
In the course of all of this , there were people who said that the problem was that I was relenting and thereby becoming less tolerant of alcohol .
I was digging my own grave , so to speak .
So I tried to prevent this by deliberately drinking more than I wanted in hopes of increasing my tolerance .
Maybe I had to go through several weeks of not feeling well in the morning before I could restore my old level .
Sadly , this did n’t work at all .
Eventually I gave in to reality and my own defeat .
I became what I once rightly loathed .
My second major failure in life deals with my lifetime ambition to be a heavy smoker until I died .
Here I had many positive influences .
I ’ve seen men in the 80s who were still pack - a - day smokers .
Because they smoked so late in life , they still looked cool .
They were good conversationalists because smoking gave them time to think before they spoke .
These influences were from all classes of people .
I recall a banker who smoked and looked like a movie star from the ’30s well into his dotage .
Then there was a coal miner who rolled his own cigarettes until his 90s .
Every puff seemed to reveal a personal biography of courage and strength in hard times , and a marvelous and manly fighting spirit .
He just had a way about him that was fabulous , and that cigarette seemed to sum it all up .
Such style !
As with most smokers , I had a promising start when I was young , though of course it was a struggle at first .
When you first start , you ca n’t smoke more than 5 a day without gagging .
But gradually , you can increase that to 10 and finally , to the real goal , a pack a day .
This I achieved in less then six months .
I vowed to keep this up until the last day .
You can only imagine my thrill when I bumped it up further to two packs a day , and finally three .
Now , I admit that my bragging rights are limited since I tended to light up incessantly and most of these cigarettes burned up in the ash tray .
Even so , I was well on my way toward achieving my dream .
At some point , however , problems began to set in .
There were rules , of course , about smoking in the office , and these rules tightened over time .
Then the airline restrictions came along .
Then restrictions in restaurants .
But as much as I hated the state for curbing my ambitions , there was a more fundamental problem developing : my lungs just could n’t take it anymore .
Of course I was in denial but as the bouts of coughing and sickness increased , I finally had to face the fact that there was a problem .
No , I did n’t stop altogether .
First I smoked a pipe .
Now here was a new image that worked just fine !
But all that apparatus — the cleaners , the bag of tobacco , the special lighter , the dirty fingers , and bulky pipe itself — became an annoyance .
So next came : the cigar !
But this introduced other problems .
The expense was prohibitive and , frankly , people hated the smell .
Eventually and much to my dread , I had to face the fact that I would have to quit it altogether .
It was a humbling moment but an unavoidable one .
I share all of this in the hope of helping others who have faced similar defeats , and letting them know that they are not alone .
We all stumble .
Perhaps too there are lessons here in avoiding defeat itself .
Perhaps there is a way to work up to becoming a lifetime heavy drinker and smoker by taking it all at a slower pace .
Perhaps one should set a schedule , and only hope to achieve the height at the age of 60 , or something like that .
And key question will always haunt me : perhaps I should have started smoking and drinking earlier , before I was fully grown .
Perhaps then my bodily system might have become more accustomed to the habit and not reacted so negatively by the time I turned 30 .
Then I might have kept it up until a blessed old age .
Always remember that there is no better time for smoking and drinking than when you are young , when your system can handle it .
As you grow older , you never know the ways in which the body will fight back against your dreams to smoke and drink heavily forever .
In any case , there is no sense in giving up hope .
There is still the great lift that comes from observing others who have not similarly failed but rather stayed attached to their ideals .
Nor will I give up hope in myself .
To paraphrase someone , I ’m no failure because I ’m not yet dead .

Lou Dobbs is outraged , outraged , I tell you ! , at yet another example of lip service by the Bush Administration of caring about national security while doing something entirely opposite .
No offense , Lou , but get in line .
Apparently , our tax dollars are going to fund a Russian nuclear lab ( why ? ) that is in turn , working with the Iranians .
The subtext is that the Russians are helping the Iranians develop a nuclear weapons program , NIE Report be damned .
However , it would be interesting to know why the US continues to fund nuclear technology development in Russia .
PILGRIM : The rationale for the Department of Energy program was to pay the salaries of Russian scientists who were left without incomes after the Cold War .
The thinking was to keep them on the payroll so they would n't peddle their nuclear expertise to rogue nations like Iran . [..]
DOBBS : This administration , everyone keeps talking about the legacy of this administration , well their legacy is mind - boggling , unbelievable , breathtaking , incompetence and stupidity .
That is going to be the legacy of the Bush administration .
Thank god that Congressman Dingell and Stupak are leading the way on this issue .
I mean my -- how in the heck can a secretary of the Department of Energy , Samuel Bodman , even get up in the morning and think he has done anything but waste some of God 's protoplasm if he can't run that department better than he is .
Transcript of this segment below .
Full show transcripts available here .
DOBBS : I suspect you 're not going to believe at the outset a startling new twist in Iran 's ambition to develop nuclear power and weaponry .
Unbelievably , the U.S. government has been funding a Russian institute that is working with Iran on nuclear projects .
Another clear failure of the American government to protect our national security and it's absolutely another statement as to the incompetence of our State Department and our foreign policy .
Kitty Pilgrim has our report .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
KITTY PILGRIM , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) : The U.S. Department of Energy is funding two Russian institutes with about $ 4 million and those institutes help Iran with their nuclear program in Bushehr .
Evidence is found in Russian documents obtained by the General Accountability Office .
Page after page shows various projects and one page reads " integration of plant - shared equipment at Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant is in progress " .
An Energy Department official at the House Energy Committee hearing today had no answers .
SAMUEL BODMAN , ENERGY SECRETARY : I have not had time to fully investigate but I have directed the principle deputy of the NNSA , Bill Ostendorf to look into those questions and to report back to me .
PILGRIM : He also added Bushehr is a commercial nuclear power plant not military .
REP .
JOHN DINGELL ( D ) , ENERGY & COMMERCE CHMN . : How , Mr. Secretary , do you then rhyme that statement with what the State Department said when they said this .
Iran uses Bushehr as a cover and a protection for obtaining sensitive technology to advance its nuclear weapons program .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
With respect to the Bushehr reactor , my understanding is that this is something we -- that the president has spoken to President Putin about , that the proliferation issues have been discussed and that reactor remains under IAEA safeguards .
PILGRIM : Nuclear nonproliferation experts say Russian help with Bushehr can be used in other projects .
HENRY SOKOLSKI , NONPROLIFERATION POLICY ED . CTR . :
What the Russians are actually helping to do is to bring a large reactor online which can make scores of bombs worth of plutonium per year and we 're hoping that the Iranians wo n't divert any of this material .
PILGRIM : The rationale for the Department of Energy program was to pay the salaries of Russian scientists who were left without incomes after the Cold War .
The thinking was to keep them on the payroll so they would n't peddle their nuclear expertise to rogue nations like Iran .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
PILGRIM : Now the House Energy Committee can't believe that writing on the Web site only this administration would complain about proliferation in Iran as part of the President Bush 's axis of evil and then finance it with American taxpayer dollars -- Lou .
DOBBS : This administration , everyone keeps talking about the legacy of this administration , well their legacy is mind - boggling , unbelievable , breathtaking , incompetence and stupidity .
That is going to be the legacy of the Bush administration .
Thank god that Congressman Dingell and Stupak are leading the way on this issue .
I mean my -- how in the heck can a secretary of the Department of Energy , Samuel Bodman , even get up in the morning and think he has done anything but waste some of God 's protoplasm if he can't run that department better than he is .
PILGRIM : Well , you know , just the answers today were astonishing .
I do n't know , we 'll check .
DOBBS : Unbelievable .
The arrogant , indifference and utter incompetence of this administration at every level .
It is pervasive , it is shameful and the fact that the American people have had to put up with this and continue to do so , it 's -- it 's just incredible .
That is just an unbelievable story .
PILGRIM : Yes , it is unbelievable .
There will be more -- new developments , I 'm sure , on this .
DOBBS : Any thought to , perhaps , changing the direction of policy at the Energy Department ?
PILGRIM : They were defending the policy .
They say that Russian institutes that participate in Bushehr are not disqualified from these funds .
They were actually defending this policy today .
DOBBS : It -- when I suggested there was a change of policy , I did n't for a moment go into some sort of Polly - Anna lapse and assume that the -- anyone in the Bush administration be intelligent or sensitive enough to think about a change .
But Congressmen Dangle , Congressman Stupak showing some considerable presence and , frankly , some forward looking consideration .
Are they demanding they change ?
PILGRIM : Yes , they are .
DOBBS : Kitty Pilgrim , again , terrific reporting , really a lousy story for those who care about this country .
Thank you
Obama aide : Clinton will ' fail ' Tuesday
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe predicted flatly Friday that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) will “ fail ” to make meaningful progress toward the presidential nomination in the big Ohio and Texas primaries on Tuesday .
“ They have a huge task in front of them , which is to try to erase this pledged delegate lead , ” Plouffe said on a conference call with reporters .
“ They are going to fail by that measure . …
This is n’t whether they can skate by and win the popular vote narrowly . ”
Advertisement
Plouffe ’s tough talk also showed the Obama campaign is going to hit back hard at Clinton for her new ad designed to tap into voters ’ fears about national security .
“ It ’s 3 a .m. and your children are safe and asleep , ” the male narrator says .
“ But there ’s a phone in the White House and it ’s ringing .
Something ’s happening in the world .
Your vote will decide who answers that call . ”
The ad has echoes of a famous “ red telephone ” spot that Roy Spence , now a Clinton adviser , made in 1984 for former Vice President Walter Mondale when he was seeking the Democratic nomination against Gary Hart .
Plouffe said dismissively : “ Senator Clinton has already had her red phone moment , and it was the [ 2002 ] decision whether to allow George Bush to invade Iraq .
She answered affirmatively .
She did not read the National Intelligence Estimate , so she did n’t do her homework either . ”
Plouffe repeated the “ red phone ” comment several times , saying voters will choose based on judgment .
“ Do they trust the judgment of these candidates on not just red - phone issues , but generally , … both domestically and internationally ? ” he asked .
At the start of the call , Plouffe read back predictions by Clinton campaign officials that they would be nearly tied – or even ahead – in the delegate count after March 4 , an eventuality that now seems unlikely even if Clinton has a strong day .
“ Those are their own benchmarks , ” Plouffe said .
“ The Clinton campaign has to begin winning big states by big margins to have any hope of erasing this delegate deficit . …
The most likely outcome Tuesday is not a huge delegate swing either way . ”
The latest CBS News delegate count has Obama at 1,373 and Clinton at 1,265 .
That includes the party insiders known as superdelegates .
The count for pledged delegates – those allocated based on primaries and caucuses – is Obama at 1,192 and Clinton at 1,035 .
Plouffe said that if the Ohio vote is close – say , less than 5 percent – the leader will pick up only three delegates .
He referred to the press role as “ referees ” of how the results will be interpreted , and he sought to convince reporters that even if Clinton wins the popular vote in one of the states , she is likely to still face an insurmountable deficit in the delegate count .
After the call , the Clinton campaign e-mailed a memo titled , " Obama Must - Wins " : " The media has anointed Barack Obama the presumptive nominee and he 's playing the part .
With an eleven - state winning streak coming out of February , Senator Obama is riding a surge of momentum that has enabled him to pour unprecedented resources into Texas , Ohio , Rhode Island and Vermont .
... Senator Obama has campaigned hard in these states .
He has spent time meeting editorial boards , courting endorsers , holding rallies , and - of course - making speeches .
If he can not win all of these states with all this effort , there 's a problem . "
Democrats standing up to Bush on warrantless wiretap bill Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Update : Senate votes against GOP telecom immunity plan
In the shadow of the president 's final State of the Union address , Senate Democrats are preparing for an 11th - hour showdown with George W. Bush and his Republican allies in Congress over controversial surveillance legislation .
The Senate voted down a GOP proposal that would cement an expansion of the president 's authority to spy on Americans and free from legal jeopardy any telephone or Internet service provider who helped the country 's intelligence agencies to collect vast amount of data on US citizens without a warrant .
Anti-immunity activists say they expect the GOP gambit to fail .
On a 48 - 45 vote , Republicans failed to garner the necessary three - fifths majority of the Senate to end debate on a bill to expand the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Sixty votes would be needed to end debate on the measure .
A Democratic measure to extend a temporary FISA extension for 30 days while Senators work out the details of the long - term update also failed on a 48 - 45 vote .
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) successfully led an effort to block immunity in December , just before Congress ' holiday recess , and the Senate returned to the issue last week , considering dual proposals from the Intelligence and Judiciary committees .
Last Thursday , Republicans and a dozen Democrats blocked Judiciary 's proposal to update FISA without immunity , but the GOP then refused an agreement that would have required a mere 51 - vote majority to pass further amendments .
Republicans filed for an immediate cloture vote on the Intelligence bill , which would preclude any amendments from being made .
This angered Democrats , and Reid , who encouraged his caucus to support a filibuster of the bill .
Reid also filed a 30 - day extension of the Protect America Act , which expires Feb .
1 . Although the Judiciary proposal failed on a 60 - 34 vote , the Republicans ' attempt to preclude any further amendments is expected to cost them support from some of the Democrats who joined them in that effort .
Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and Barack Obama ( D - IL ) also have said they will vote against cloture .
Assuming cloture fails , Reid is expected to move forward with a vote on a one - month extension to give the Senate more time to work out its differences .
President Bush has promised to veto such a bill .
After they were cowed last August into passing a temporary expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that critics said did too much to concentrate power in the hands of the executive , Congressional Democrats have decided to hit back against the president .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) turned the tables on Bush over the weekend , saying that blame for any gaps in the ability to collect intelligence resides at the White House .
The Senate 's debate over a long - term FISA expansion has come in fits and starts over the last few months , since passage of the Protect America Act .
Several times the issue was scuttled after left - leaning Senators moved to block a proposal that would grant legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
Those companies , such as AT&T and Verizon , are plaintiffs in 40 or so lawsuits nationwide alleging they violated customers ' privacy ; administration critics say the lawsuits are the only means for oversight of the wiretapping scheme in the face of an ultra-secretive administration .
Bush has promised to veto any temporary expansion of the PAA , and the administration hopes to use the pending deadline to force Congress into giving into telecom immunity .
The House passed an immunity - free update months ago , and Reid has indicated he also will not budge , accusing Bush of " simply posturing " before his final State of the Union , according to the Politico .
" There will be no terrorism intelligence collection gap , " Reid said .
" But if there is any problem , the blame will clearly and unequivocally fall where it belongs : on President Bush and his allies in Congress . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A passenger who went through an airport security checkpoint -- before remembering that he had a loaded gun -- is facing charges after going back to report his error , authorities said .
Travelers go through security at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport .
Gregory Scott Hinkle , 53 , of Davis , West Virginia , went through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport about 7:30 a.m. Sunday , an airport spokeswoman said .
After the traveler evidently recalled having the gun , he returned to the checkpoint and disclosed the weapon , authorities said .
The TSA contacted airport police , who charged the man with possessing or transporting a firearm into an air carrier terminal where prohibited , a misdemeanor , and released him .
He is scheduled to appear April 2 in Arlington County , Virginia , General District Court .
Hinkle did not immediately return a phone call to his residence .
A TSA spokesman said the agency reviewed airport surveillance camera videos of the incident and removed the screener from security duties while an investigation is under way .
" Appropriate actions will be taken once the investigation is complete , " spokesman Christopher White said .
White said that 14 guns were discovered at checkpoints around the country last week .
On average , screeners find two guns a day , he said .
" We know this is not a systemic problem in that our testing indicates TSOs [ Transportation Security Officers ] have a very high success rate at finding firearms .
Given the high degree of reliability that our TSOs can find even carefully concealed firearms , we are evaluating every aspect of this incident , " White said .

Well I " yahooed " and came across a gentleman that was running into the same problem as I am .
He too is using Comcast as his ISP and he knew of other people that were having a similar issue as well .
In order for him to get google loading again he had to unplug his router and power cycle his modem .
So I thought what the heck I 'll try it .
And well what do you know it works .
But after a day or so I 'd run into the same problem and I 'd have to reset my modem and router again .
I was just wondering if anyone else is having the same issue or what may be causing it ?
Well this just started happening a few days ago .

So my first thought was to run a full virus scan and check for spyware to make sure nothing was infected or hijacked .

Yes ,
Im having the same problem here also .
It works for a while and then turns off .
I know it has nothing to do with my computer , as it does this with a clean Windows XP install , and also a clean Linux install .
So , it ca n't be adware / virus related .
Maybe its Comcast being Comcastic .

What do you get back for TTL values when it 's not working ?
Google has their www.l.google.com records set to a 300 second ( 5 min ) time to live ( ttl ) , so if you see a number bigger than that in the addresses that resolve for www.l.google.com you could very well have a DNS issue .

This could be a problem with Comcast DNS if they are caching records longer than Google 's advertised TTL .
Using Comcast 's DNS servers , can you run " nslookup " and do the following :> set debug > www.google.comThe output at the end should have something that looks like this :

It works fine during the day all day every day .
It seems odd that it would only not work at night ?

Well at first I thought it was just me .
I 'm kind of relieved that its not .
But at the same time it seems like a major issue .
Hopefully it will be sorted out soon .
I 'm still having issues .
Mostly at night and the modem / router reset trick does n't always work anymore .

it did however fix itself within approx 30 mins .
it may have been reached BUT it times out in a browser so it's for all intents and purposes dead and unreachable .

Lehi , UT scottwed0 Member Having the same issue .
Using UT Comcast , all other websites work fine .
Have to use alternate DNS IP to reach google.com .
Problem is lasting hours each night .
The problem always includes multiple Reset packets ( part of the TCP header ) .
For some bizarre reason , I noticed that when the google .com problem happens , I can't reconnect my Hamachi VPN client .
If the vpn session was already up , then it continues to work .
If you reset the VPN connection , it will fail as it rotates through :
bravo.hamachi.cc , charlie.hamachi.cc , delta.hamachi.cc , could be more , I 'm guessing there is also an alpha .
Anyone else also having the Hamachi problem at the same time ?

It 's very consistent , I receive a properly formed Reset packet , along with another reset packet with a static sequence number .
In my case , the static sequence number is 12503 .
The odd reset packet is sent in reply to web requests to google.com and vpn login requests to Hamachi 's login servers .
The problem goes away for both sites at ~ midnight .
The double reset reply has the signature of the Sandvine Packet shaping appliance , known to be used by Comcast : »
My understanding is that some ATT HSI customers are also experiencing this issue .
For the record , there is no way that this issue is related any type of Wireless encryption protocol used by an end - user or DNS configuration problem .
I can consistently reach google .com using an external proxy server , and computers on other ISPs .
I 'm starting to think we are getting caught in some sort of private battle between Comcast / ATT and Google .
Did some more research .
I set up a 2 minute interval with wget ( A web reques tool ) , and turned on a packet sniffer to track all Reset packets .
I started the trace at ~ 9:50 pm local time , and the problem goes away at 12 am local time .

I 've been having the same problem the past few months .
I talked with Tier 1 support at Comcast last night for about an hour .
We reset my modem 4 times , my router , even plugged in my laptop directly to the modem .
( It was more to humor the tech lady than any hope of that actually fixing it . )
I 've got a network engineer calling me back within a day or so .
I spoke with my friends that have comcast and they all experience the exact same issue .
I wonder if their packet filter is seeing all the customer requests to google as a DDoS and blocking it for a few hours ( like 4 ) .
It could be possible .
The great thing is that I can ping google.com , connect to it from my servers ( who are on Global Crossing ) , but all HTTP traffic gets very swiftly reset .

While were n't quite as blown away by D - REX as we were by Elmo Live — " jazz hands " killed our objective judgment — the level of interactivity is pretty impressive for what 's supposed to be a dumb child 's toy ( the kid , not the ' bot ) .
About the size of a small puppy , it behaves semi-autonomously , though it'll follow patterns you pick w/ the remote like guarding your room ( if it detects a light change , it goes apeshit ) and ( cutely ) responds to petting , calling and the like .
I 'm not quite sure it 's worth $ 150 yet , but even in this beta stage , it 's damn close , and the fall launch date leaves plenty of polish time .
Holy crap , I want this Elmo , and I do n't even like Sesame Street .
It makes Pleo look like a dumb …
This fall , Mattel adds a new category to its toy portfolio with the introduction of D - Rex , an interactive " pet " dinosaur for boys that boasts life - like movements , obeys commands , displays affection and protects its owner .
Featuring " biomorphic robotics , " a sub - discipline of robotics that focuses on emulating the mechanics , sensor systems and methodologies used by animals , D - Rex is unique in that it features advanced technology along with incredible life - like features , making " him " both a robot and an autonomous pet .
D - Rex has several features that bring him to life - he moves his eyes , wags his tail , responds to care and feeding , comes when called , and like any good pet , protects his owner and his prize possessions .
D - Rex celebrates traditional boys play patterns , while also infusing innovative technology to allow him to come to life and create a memorable " wow " moment for kids .
D-REX
D - Rex is the ultimate pet for boys .
A ferocious yet loyal dinosaur with an independent personality , D - Rex combines robotics , proprietary software and reptilian skin to create a life - like appearance and behavior .
He walks around , chomps his jaw , bares his teeth and roars more than 100 different ways to let you know what he wants .
D - Rex might demand food or want to play a game , and he 'll hear your voice and respond to your touch .
Like the ideal pet , D - Rex will protect his owner and his prize possessions .

Severe shortages of silicon have plagued the solar photovoltaic market over the past few years .
According to a Frost & Sullivan press release a turnaround can be expected this year with polysilicon catching up with the demand .
Quoting from the press release :
It was estimated that the demand for silicon feedstock neared 26,000 tonnes in 2004 .
In 2005 there was a rise in wafer production by nearly 7 per cent .
However , this increase was not sufficient to keep up with the market need .
In 2006 the shortage of feedstock reached a critical point affecting the production of solar panels and , consequently , the industry growth .
However , things are about to change .
" We expect polysilicon supply to catch up with the demand already in 2008 " – says Alina Bakhareva , Renewable Energy Programme Manager at Frost & Sullivan .
" The majority of the new quantities will be supplied to the market by top 4 producers that are expanding their existing production capacities . "
In fact , four top polysilicon producers are expected to add more than 17000 tonnes of capacity in 2008 .
This would represent over 50 % increase over their current capacities .
On the demand side , demand from the semiconductor industry is expected to grow at steady one - digit rates .
Demand for solar - grade polysilicon is expected to reach over 50 % of the total demand for high purity silicon in 2008 - 2009 .
Lawrence H. White responds to critics .
In my Cato email I received :
" A gold standard does not guarantee perfect steadiness in the growth of the money supply , but historical comparison shows that it has provided more moderate and steadier money growth in practice than the present - day alternative , politically empowering a central banking committee to determine growth in the stock of fiat money , " White concludes .
" From the perspective of limiting money growth appropriately , the gold standard is far from a crazy idea . ”
" Far from a crazy idea , " OK .
But would you push the button for it ?
I say no .
There is little doubt that over the broad sweep of world history , commodity standards have outperformed paper money .
But we do n’t live in the broad sweep of world history , we live in 2008 and our ability to monitor and control central banks is unparalleled .
The central banks of the wealthier nations work pretty well .
My main worry with the gold standard is simply the pro-cyclicality of the money supply and for all its talk of money demand the paper does n’t much address this concern .
For instance would you really want a contracting money supply in today ’s environment ?
And yes credit crunches of this kind happen in market settings too so you ca n’t blame it all on Alan Greenspan .
And I am not reassured by this ( admittedly true ) sentence : " At the right reentry rate , dollar prices would not need to jump [ from the transition ] . "
One five or ten percent deflation is enough to crush the economy and indeed the whole gold standard idea .
Given the socialist calculation debate , can we really know the right transition price ?
Gold at $ 900 an ounce ?
$ 600 an ounce ?
Anybody ?

# 3. Gustave Whitehead
Supporters claim he achieved the first sustained heavier - than - air manned flight on August 14 , 1901 , two years before the Wright Brother 's December 17 , 1903 feat .
While many dismiss him , he has the support of the only man who matters : Uncle Ben from 2002 's Spider - Man .
Yes , aviation fan and actor Cliff Robertson went so far as to rebuild Whitehead 's craft and found it briefly took flight , declaring : " We 'll never take away the rightful role of the Wright Brothers , but if this poor little German immigrant did indeed get an airplane to go up and fly one day , then let 's give him the recognition he deserves .

He was legendary .
Nuts , volatile , mad , and his work was exciting . "
One of these men went on to revolutionize acting and win two Oscars .
What happened to Hill ?
Orthodox Judaism !
Deciding he needed to devote himself to his faith , he chose to honor the Sabbath by not working from sunset on Friday to sunset Saturday ( believe it or not , some producers felt this could be inconvenient for a production ) .
He finally achieved a taste of success playing D.A. Adam Schiff on Law & Order only to have his happy days of bantering with A.D.A. McCoy come to an end when he was replaced by Nora Lewin ( screw you , Dianne Wiest ! ) .
That said , he was awesome in Yentl . ( Photo by Ron Galella / WireImage.com )

Less well - known , but equally important to an understanding of Taoism , are the writings of Chuang Tzu .
His Inner Chapters are gaining wider attention as is The Way of Chuang Tzu , an excellent transition of selected writings by Christian mystic Thomas Morton .
Taoism is organized around several key principles and , like any philosophical outlook , presents a way of seeing and understanding reality .
The word TAO itself translates as the Way , or Path .
This meaning includes both the way in which we perceive the world around us ( how do we make assessments ?
what are our values ? ) and also the way in which we interact with life ( how do we behave ?
what are our actions ? ) .
The manner in which we perceive reality influences our way of being in the world , our path of action .
Taoism 's central principle is that all life , all manifestation , is part of an inseparable whole , an interconnected organic unity which arises from a deep , mysterious , and essentially unexplainable source which is the Tao itself .
Everything conceivable is contained within this principle .
Various Western translators have compared this concept to the idea of God , Universal Mind , or Absolute Reality , to name but a few examples .
Taoism views the universe and all of its manifestations as operating according to a set of unchanging , natural laws .
As an inseparable part of the Tao , human beings can gain knowledge of these laws and become attuned to them .
It is these natural laws that constitute the core principles of Taoism .
Aligning ourselves with these principles provides a universal perspective and understanding and allows life to be lived in harmony with the Tao .
Indeed our way of life becomes the Way , a full expression of the Tao .
Taoism has become increasingly popular with Americans for a number of reasons .
As our lives become more stressful and complex , dealing with mounting crises on personal , local and global levels , we naturally seek solutions that will restore us to a more balanced , harmonious , and satisfying way of living .

Chemical reactions are part of our daily lives .
From cooking in the kitchen , to driving a car , these reactions are commonplace .
This list is aimed at some of the more exotic and amazing reactions that most of us have not seen or experienced .
My knowledge of science is limited , so if I have made a blunder in my descriptions , please let me know so that I can correct them !
Here are the top 10 amazing chemical reactions .
Do not try these at home ( but if you do – send us the video clips ! )
10 Sodium and Water in Chlorine Gas
Sodium is a highly combustible element and the addition of water can make it explode .
In this video we see a drop of water added to a small piece of sodium in a flask filled with chlorine gas .
The distinctive yellow color of the light emitted is due to sodium ’s ‘ D lines ’ – this is often used in street lighting .
This experiment produces a great deal of heat .
When you combine sodium and chlorine , you get sodium chloride – common salt .
9 Magnesium and Dry Ice Reaction
Magnesium ignites easily and burns very brightly .
In this experiment , you see magnesium ignited in a shell of dry ice – frozen carbon dioxide .
Magnesium is able to burn in carbon dioxide and nitrogen .
Because of its brilliant light , it was used in early photographic flashes , and it is still used in marine flares and fireworks .
8 Potassium Chlorate and Candy Reaction
Potassium Chlorate is a compound containing potassium , chlorine and oxygen .
It is often used as a disinfectant and in fireworks and explosives .
When potassium chlorate is heated to melting point , any item added to it will cause a rapid disintegration in the form of an explosion ( as we see in the video above ) .
The gas coming off the potassium chlorate is oxygen .
Because of this , it is often used in airplanes , space stations , and submarines as a source for oxygen .
A fire on the space station Mir was attributed to this substance .
7 Meissner Effect
When a superconductor is cooled to below its transitional temperature , it becomes diamagnetic : this is when something is repulsed from a magnetic field rather than drawn in to it .
This discovery by Meissner has lead to the concept of frictionless transportation , as an object could be “ floated ” along a track rather than “ attached ” to it by wheels .
6 Sodium Acetate Super Saturation
Sodium acetate , when heated and cooled , becomes supersaturated in water .
When it comes in contact with another object it re-crystalizes .
This reaction also causes heat , and so this has a practical use in heat pads .
Sodium acetate is also used as a preservative , and also gives salt and vinegar chips their distinctive taste .
It is referred to in foods as E262 or sodium diacetate .
5 Superabsorbent Polymer
Superabsorbent polymers ( also known as hydrogels ) are able to absorb extremely large amounts of liquid relative to its own mass .
For this reason , they are used in the commercial production of diapers , and incontinence garments , and other fields requiring protection from water or liquids such as underground cabling .
4 Floating on Sulfur Hexafluoride
Sulfur Hexafluoride is a colorless , odorless , non-toxic and non-flammable gas .
Because it is over 5 times denser than air , it is able to be poured in to open containers and light weight objects can float on it as if it were water .
Another fun use for this harmless gas is through inhalation ; when inhaled , it lowers the voice drastically – the exact opposite of helium .
You can see that effect here :
The reason that your voice is lowered when you inhale sulfur hexafluoride is that the weight of the gas slows the sound waves produced in your vocal tract to just under half the speed of the sound .
Helium works in the opposite way .
3 Superfluid Helium
When helium is cooled cooled to - 271c , it reaches the lambda point .
At this stage ( as a liquid ) it is known as Helium II .
Hellium II is a superfluid .
When it flows through even capillaries of 10? 7 to 10 ? 8 - m widths it has no measurable viscosity .
In addition , it will creep up a container ( as it seeks out a warmer area ) seemingly against the effects of gravity .
Just watch the clip above and be amazed !
2 Thermite and Liquid Nitrogen
Thermite is aluminum powder and a metal oxide which produces an aluminothermic reaction known as a thermite reaction .
It is not explosive , but it can create short bursts of extremely high temperature .
A thermite reaction is initiated with some type of detonator and it can burn at temperatures of thousands of degrees .
In the clip above we see an attempt to “ cool ” the thermite reaction by dumping it in a vat of liquid nitrogen .
1 Briggs - Rauscher Reaction
The Briggs - Rauscher reaction is known as an oscillating chemical reaction .
According to Wikipedia : “ the freshly prepared colorless solution slowly turns an amber color , suddenly changing to a very dark blue .
This slowly fades to colorless and the process repeats , about ten times in the most popular formulation , before ending as a dark blue liquid smelling strongly of iodine . ”
The reason this occurs is that the first reaction causes certain chemicals to be released in to the liquid , which then , in turn , spark a second reaction , and the process repeats itself until exhausted .

The Workers Plea
My father and I were talking recently and he suddenly produced a note he has carried in his wallet for the last 30 years .
And this is it , ' the workers plea ' , in all its typewriter written glory .
I thought you might be interested in it whether you are an employer or an employee .
It seems to encapsulate a basic code of conduct between people and hell it might even work in other relationships .
For what it is worth the conversation we were having was actually about the relationship between the governed and the state .
very empowering ( and reassuring ) when you see it on paper .

Hmm , in the conversation you were having regarding the governed and the state , whose was the plea , The governed ore the governing ?
As it reads totally differently depending on which one it is .

what a great sentiment .
the workers of the world - the law abiding , hard working vast majority of people - have always had , and always will have , the power to overcome the few of us who seek power over the rest .
lets not plead , lets always show our strength by working together .
Posted by : gareth at February 20 , 2008 10:02 PM
Actually , I find it to be a pathetic , groveling view of the employer / employee relationship .
It 's straight out of the right - wing corporate - propaganda play - book .
-- Worker 's " Plea " ... Definition of " plea " : A humble request for help from someone in authority .
Pathetic .
--" Give me the opportunity to perform " .
Another way of saying , " Please allow me to serve you " ( visualize head bowed and eyes looking toward the floor ) .
--" Let me know how I am getting on " .
Translation : " I need more performance evaluations - I NEED management 's perception of my worth " .
--" Provide me with guidance , support , and training when I need it " .
Translation : " I am a subservient worm who needs to be controlled - even if it is by some weasel in management who needs help tying his shoes " .
--" Reward me according to the contribution I make ... " .
Translation : " Please beat me .
Please take advantage of me . "
What 's really sad here is all of the comments above that buy into this weak , hapless drivel .
Do people even bother to think things through anymore ?
Seriously ... read this " Worker 's Plea " again - only this time , picture the words coming from the family dog .
It 's a perfect fit , is n't it ?
What has happened to this country ?
We were once a country of rugged individualists - now we 're overrun with whimpering wimps .
Shame on all those who swallowed this claptrap without seeing through it .

It looks as though the document 's title " Worker 's Plea " has been cut short .
If you look closely , about 7 - 10 characters to the adjacent left of " Worker 's " is also underlined and mysteriously has been ripped out .
I wonder what type of worker 's plea this really is ....

Wtf is wrong with you , Bobcat ?
The Worker 's Plea shows that this worker does not want to be rewarded for work he / she has not done , and wants to know how they can be of service to their employer .
Is n't that the whole point of competition ?
Being innovative and doing better than your competitors ?
Learning what one can do to do one 's job better is a good thing , not a bad one .

Clearly some of these haters have no clue ( or respect for ) how effective communication works in a successful organization .
Or they have no respect for work .
This is not about " The Man " .
It 's about taking pride and contributing successfully to something bigger .
If your organization and management are not something you wish to be part of , that speaks to you and your organization , not the work .
And I 'm as liberal as it gets .

You earn it , and number 5 is the only valid one you 'll get paid what your worth according to how you increased the bottom for the bosses business !
I do n't need to preview just post the damn thing , this website makes me feel like telling someone of insignificance off !

Matt , i hope that you are never a manager at any company that i am ever involved with .
If you where and i had the authority , i would fire you .
Your job as a manager is to get the best performance out of your workers .
That means you have to follow what is on that list .
How can someone do their job if you do n't tell them what it is ?
Or give them the tools they need to do it ?
And hiring trained people is nice , but would n't you rather train them to do things the way you want them done ?
Most companies biggest problem is that they give lip service to this philosophy , but the individual managers really feel , and treat their people , like Matt .

Hate to bust folks bubbles , but we all work for someone .
I enjoyed reading the paper and believe that if you are working for a company , then you should be following their expectations , why ?
because it is their company and they are paying you .
If you do n't like the company 's expectations , then start your own company and see how many people follow your expectations , bet someone will say " you suck " too . :)
In an ideal world we all pursue our hobbies and live happily ever after .
But I always wondered who is going to clean up after us .
Damn reality :)

I find the list to be simple and straight forward , both for the worker and the supervisor .
Let 's face it , not every person aspires to be or has the inherent capacity to be " the boss " , but everyone has worth .
I once had a boss when I was younger and knew everything that said at a company meeting that this was a volunteer organization , and if you really did n't want to work there , please , for the sake of everyone and yourself , go find work that inspires you .
At the time , I thought he was a arrogant jerk .
The longer I have been around , the truer those words are .

Sadly the greatest factor in business is the businesses ability to deliver appropriate rewards to the really good employees .
Lack of reward can occur simply because the business is going downhill or because various owners are too greedy to leave anything for employees .
But most companies crash , burn or merge themselves out of business or relocate offshore .
The end of it all is that every employee must demand and get top dollar from the first moment of employment .
The way around this conflict is a guarded insurance plan that insures the progress of an employee regardless of whether a business prospers or closes its doors .

Touching note .
To me , it spoke less about generic rules , and more about human poise in the language ( ultimately under the constraints ) of its time .
Quite frankly , I ’m not sure why , since I do n’t know its story ; I ’ve only pictured something ( nothing grand ) to match the 30 years it ’s been carried in a wallet .
Epic nostalgia for a time when things ( and ‘ opinions ’ , ‘ values ’ , ‘ relationships ’ , ‘ roles ’ , etc. , even life itself ) , although rushing down the conveyor belt , still managed to take their time ?...
Maybe .
Then maybe not .
Then went on reading the comments , and felt the rich spicy air of a bizarre metropolis where everybody talks in – at least – a language ( ... ultimately under the constraints ) of its own : the playful , the revolutionary with an off - the - shelf ideology , the fierce nostalgic , the unsuspecting revolutionary , the liberated with chains of a new , imponderable nature , the stiff righteous , the flâneur , the pick - and - mix opinion shopper , the submissive maverick , the humane dictator , the New Wave dialectician , the thinker , the dreamer , the curious , etc. etc . …
Strange thing is , I could understand why to some , the oil - based scent of the bottled message unleashed a soothing nostalgia for a good orderly world mechanism , while to others the message sounded like biblical prescriptions – obsolete , degrading , downright insulting .
And could see why some wisely chose to play with it – like with the traces of words on a palimpsest – to decode hidden teachings .
First confused , then terribly frustrated , could n’t find my own stand on this all .
All of a sudden , cought myself writing a sort of plea ( in 5 points ) , addressed to who knows whom … :-)
Great lab to visit , interesting times .

hey donnie , no one asked you to philosophize the argument taking place .
this is a fair and concise approach to employer / employee managment .
people who practice and think otherwise are damaging to this global economy in the sense that , the disgruntled will have their say .

Brits ( Chesterton , Waugh , Shaw , Wilde , Welles ) used to excel at paradox .
Like " what 's worth doing is worth doing poorly , " as old Gk put it .
Above , Gareth sees the issue .
But he does n't express it the way old Oscar and Bernie would have done it .
The expression that made me an Anglophile before I learned better .
Interesting exchange .

I think that many employers would have the " Employees Plea " read like this :
1 ) Expect me to know / do more than my pay / position is worth .
2 ) Give me expectation of a career path and raises , but deliver excuses and
lay offs .
3 ) Speak grandly to me of how each employee should have loyalty to the
company , yet show no loyalty to me .
4 ) Please change rules in the workplace on the fly , and expect me to be able
to read your mind and know what the new rules are without being told .
5 ) Dump me as an employee whenever the opportunity to hire somebody else at a
lower rate appears .
( Especially if you can send the work to third world
countries where people work for slave wages . )

A 30 - year - old Glaswegian has suffered what may go down in history as the greatest hangover west of the Mississippi - a six - month headache induced by sinking 60 pints over four days .
According to The Lancet , the unnamed man presented himself in a Glasgow A&E last October complaining of " wavy " vision and a relentless headache he'd been suffering for more than a month .
The case report from from Southern General Hospital said he " had no history of head injury or loss of consciousness ; his past medical record was unremarkable , and he was taking no medications " , and that his body temperature and blood pressure were both normal .
It was only when an eye specialist gave the poor bloke the once - over that the truth was revealed .
He was suffering swollen optical discs , greatly enlarged blind spots and " flame haemorrhages " - bleeding nerve fibres .
When quizzed , the patient admitted he'd sunk the aforementioned 60 jars following a domestic crisis .
The resulting dehydration had caused cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ( CVST ) - a rare condition which can lead to seizures , impaired consciousness , loss of vision and neurological damage .
Cue six months of blood - thinning treatment before the chap 's vision returned to normal - and his headache finally subsided . ®

Dolphins love sex .
Dolphins especially bottle nosed dolphins unlike most other creatures use sex not only for procreation .
Like humans dolphins also use sex for pleasure and bonding .
Additionally dolphins engage in homosexuality , bisexuality , rape and bestiality .
Bottled nosed dolphins
Male dolphins upon reaching adulthood usually move away from their pod .
They form alliances with other males .
It does n't stop there .
Most of the time this alliances of two to three are sexual in nature .
These males have been observed to engage in highly charged sexual play with their prehensile dork .
Some even go towards full blown gay sex .
The even more shocking fact is scientists have observed that all adult male dolphins are bisexual as they engage in behaviour stated above and also go for females .
When they feel like having coitus a male dolphin alliance will search for a pod .
Here they single out a female to court .
Then one male will go after a chosen female .
Courtship behaviour of the male includes clinging along to that female , posing for the female , stroking , rubbing , nuzzling , mouthing , jaw clapping , and yelping .
Copulation is preceded by lengthy foreplay ; then the two animals arrange belly to belly , the penis extends out of its slit and is inserted into the vagina .
The act lasts only 10 - 30 seconds , but is repeated numerous times , with several minutes break in between .
After one male is finished having sex his ally will take over .
When we talk about dolphin rape it 's always gang - rape .
For a creature with only flippers living in a water world there is no way a single male dolphin to commit rape so they bring friends .
They raid pods and male alliances ( when they have their girl ) kidnapping a female by surrounding her in order force her away with them .
These poor females are kept for weeks even months being repeatedly raped .
It gets better .
There is even a recording of dolphin rape ( audio ) according to this page .
Here is the testimony by Dr Liz Hawkins .
One day in front of the Cape we recorded a group of dolphins .
And what it looked like was 4 males pursuing and chasing a female who really did n’t want to be chased .
And she would basically put her genitals above the water and she ’d keep putting her belly above the water so the males could n’t get to her .
And as she did that there was a really intense emission of whistles , and basically it was the same whistle being called over and over and over again and it was quite a distressed type of call .
Dolphin sex .
Dolphins are also known to have interspecies sex with other dolphins , porpoises and humans !!?!
Here is an excerpt from a CNN report in June 2002 about George ( a horny male dolphin ) which tried to hump humans .
Georges is a bottlenose dolphin and has made Weymouth harbour , Dorset his home for the summer .
Thousands of people have been swimming with him and watching him from boats , but his behavior starting changing a month ago .
Ric O'Barry , the trainer on the show ' Flipper ' was brought in to investigate and has apparently seen this behavior before .
' When dolphins get sexually excited , they try to isolate a swimmer , normally female .
They do this by circling around the individual and gradually move them away from the beach , boat or crowd of people . '
O'Barry said the dolphin would get very excited and rough before trying to mate with a swimmer , possibly causing them to drown .
More recently , a New Zealand woman was severely injured in December when a dolphin leapt into her boat and crushed her with the full weight of his filthy , heaving body .
A Coast Guard expert explained the behavior by saying that the dolphin had just become " over- excited . "
Even Jessica
Alba almost got nailed by dolphin back when she was teenager while on the syndicated New Adventures Of Flipper back in the 90s .
Here 's her testimony about her encounter from this page .
" Dolphins get excited , even when you 're a human being , and they have long , long ... ( 12 to 14 inch prehensile dork ) I did n't know this until I was poked by a few of them , which was very rude .
I sort of requested female dolphins after that because those are little b------s. "
Dolphins get even more deviant .
In Robin Brown 's jaw - dropping tome , " The Lure of the Dolphin " ( Avon , 1979 ) , he writes that dolphins " engage in love - play with almost every creature in sight - with mothers , brothers , fathers , daughters , cousins or aunts .
There is even one record of a Bottlenose Dolphin masturbating with a herring . "
There is even an account of dolphin - human sex here by a delphinic zoophile .
Killer whale dork .
( Killer whales are the world 's largest dolphin . )

My unreferenced knowledge is from Wikipedia and a National Geographic documentary .
Dolphin and whale penises are known as dorks .
Bottlenosed dolphin pods are made up of females and their young .
Florence Nightingale 's Statistical Diagrams
It has been said that Florence Nightingale was the first to use diagrams for presenting statistical data .
This is not true , of course , but she may have been the first to use them for persuading people of the need for change .
Edward Tufte does not mention Nightingale in his book on the history of graphics1 , and he says that this famous 1869 chart by Minard of Napoleon 's dwindling army as it marched to Moscow and back in 1812 / 13 may be the best statistical graphic ever drawn :
Minard 's diagram includes a temperature chart which misleadingly suggests that Napoleon 's army froze to death .
It shows the falling temperature during the retreat from Moscow , but most of the army was lost during the advance ( 300,000 men , vs. 90,000 in the retreat ) .
Nightingale herself studied this catastrophe , and concluded that Napoleon 's army - like most others - had died of disease2 .
Like Minard's , Nightingale 's most famous graphics illustrated what she called the " loss of an army " - the British army sent to the Crimea .
She published them ten years before Minard's .
Hers also were more topical and conveyed a call to action - they were prescriptive rather than descriptive .
She used recent data to persuade the Government to improve army hygiene .
Although she was before Minard , there were others before her .
The best - known pioneer of statistical graphics was William Playfair , who published what must be the first " pie chart " in 18013 .
It was in a graphic showing that , by comparison with other countries , the British paid more tax .
The vertical line to the left of each circle is the population ( left scale ) and the vertical line to the right is the tax revenue ( right scale ) .
In this selection of four of Playfair 's countries , Britain is the only one in which the tax line is higher than the population line :
Playfair used this graphic to argue for lower taxes .
So you could say that , unlike Minard , his graphics are prescriptive .
But Playfair 's graphics are merely comparisons .
They do not demonstrate what would happen if you reduced taxes .
They look good but make you ask " so what ? "
They do not illustrate cause - and - effect - what Nightingale called a " law " .
Before going into Nightingale 's graphics , let 's look at the state of statistical science in her day .
There was a great revolution in this area in Nightingale 's time .
In 1837 the General Registry Office at Somerset House , led by William Farr who later helped Nightingale with her Crimean statistics , began to systematically record births , deaths , and marriages in the UK .
This gave people the opportunity to examine new cause and effect relationships using registration statistics .
The years of struggle and the visit to Kaiserswerth
Neison estimated the level of education in each county by counting the proportion of people getting married there who were able to write their name on the marriage certificate .
Statistics relied much more on ingenuity and less on complicated formulae in 1847 !
Social improvers like Florence Nightingale eagerly seized on results like Neison 's which showed how mankind could combat social evils .
Part of her interest in statistics was related to her Unitarian faith .
Unitarians believed that mankind has the power to continuously improve itself by observation and the use of reason .
After the Crimean War ( 1854 - 56 ) , Nightingale created a number of spectacular graphics designed to show how improvements in building hygiene could save many lives .
These appear in five different documents :
Appendix 72 of the report of the Royal Commission that Nightingale organised after the war , published in 1858 .
Mortality of the British Army ( 1858 ) , a private edition by Nightingale of the above Appendix , with exactly the same content but with better layout than that used by Government printers .
She produced 2000 copies of this book .
A Contribution to the Sanitary History of the British Army ( 1859 ) .
Nightingale published this anonymously to answer a pamphlet4 that claimed that she had exaggerated the number of deaths in the war .
She showed that the Army 's own figures , released in late 1858 , showed that on the contrary she had underestimated .
The graphics in the Contribution used the same statistics as in No. 2 but with different graphic presentation , as we shall see .
Notes on Matters Affecting the Health of the British Army ( 1858 ) .
This was a confidential report to the Government , that Nightingale printed privately and sent to a number of people .
This contains two of the three graphics from No. 3 . England and Her Soldiers ( 1859 ) by Harriet Martineau .
Nightingale encouraged Martineau to write this book about the war and gave her copies of the graphics used in No. 3 .
There is also one " honeycomb " graphic showing how densely soldiers are packed in camp ( a device which Farr had already used for illustrating urban density ) , and two other graphics that are highly original .
The first is what Nightingale called the " bat 's wing " which is very gloomy to look at and also misleading .
The circle on the right has 12 sectors going clockwise representing the first 12 months of the war .
The circle on the left is the second 12 months .
The superimposed dark shapes show the monthly death rates .
The diagram illustrates how the Sanitary Commission , sent out in the middle of the war , dramatically reduced the death rate .
The length of the radial line in each month is proportional to the death rate , but both the text and the appearance imply that it is the shaded area that is proportional to the death rate , rather than the length of the radial lines .
Florence recognised this error and inserted an erratum slip , but then replaced this diagram in later documents ( nos. 3 , 4 , and 5 listed above ) with what I will call the " wedges " diagram .
This " bat 's wing " and its successor are so different from any diagrams that Farr did before that they may be Nightingale 's own invention .
The other highly original chart is what I will call the " Lines " - a bar chart showing how soldiers in peacetime , living in their barracks in England , were dying at a faster rate than civilians in the cities around them .
There is a black bar in each of four age ranges , and a longer red bar .
The black bar is the number of civilians who die each year , and the red is the number of soldiers .
There are a number of curious overtones to this graphic , which may just be a coincidence .
First , the title " Lines " ( in ornate script in the original ) makes it sound like a poem , as in Lines on the Death of Bismarck .
There are four pairs of bars , when actually the message is clear from one pair alone .
There seems to be a kind of repetition , as in a chorus .
This effect is increased by the words , repeated at the end of each line , English Men , English Soldiers ...
It sounds like a funeral march .
Second , the red bar for the soldiers would certainly make some people think of the " Thin Red Line " which had become famous in the Crimean War when a two - deep row of red- jacketed British infantrymen stopped a Russian heavy cavalry charge , something that was thought to be impossible .
The thin red lines on Nightingale 's chart represented these same heroic soldiers who were now dying unnecessarily because of bad hygiene in their barracks .
Perhaps this graphic is a visual poem by Arthur Hugh Clough , who was Nightingale 's secretary at the time that she produced it5 .
The variation of death rates due to differences in hygiene was very important to reformers like Nightingale because it showed that even the civilian death rate could probably also be improved by better hygiene .
One of Farr 's rules of thumb was that if something varied widely from place to place , it could probably be reduced to zero .
This is an example of the army being used as a controlled environment for testing social theories , which was very common in Victorian times .
This " Lines " graphic is probably the most influential of Nightingale 's diagrams because it dealt with a situation that was still going on .
The " bat 's wing " , on the other hand , described a wartime catastrophe which was now history so that the army could claim that it would n't happen next time .
It was probably the " Lines " diagram that Nightingale particularly wanted to frame and send for hanging in the offices of the Army High Command , as a rebuke6 .
However , it is the last graphic - the successor to the " bat 's wing " which I will call the " wedges " - that Nightingale is most famous for .
Strangely enough , the name that many people give it is wrong .
This graphic is not what Nightingale referred to as the " coxcomb " !
In this diagram , Nightingale resolved the problem of the " bat 's wing " by using areas to represent the variation in the death rate , instead of the length of radial lines .
The blue wedges , representing death by sickness , are far bigger than those representing wounds .
The message of this graphic is twofold : first , most of the fatalities during the war were from sickness and second , improvements in hygiene dramatically reduced the death rate .
Nightingale used this diagram instead of the " bat 's wing " in documents 3 , 4 , and 5 .
But why do I say that this is not the " coxcomb " ?
What did Nightingale mean by the word " coxcomb " ?
A coxcomb is the ostentatious red crest on the top of a cockerel 's head .
Nightingale used the word to describe the 2000 copies she had printed of No. 2 - her Mortality of the British Army .
This booklet , a reprint of an annex containing diagrams , text , and tables , was the " coxcomb " of the enormous Royal Commission report , the colourful and ostentatious part that people would actually take notice of .
In her letter of Christmas Day 1857 to Sidney Herbert ( the President of her Royal Commission ) Nightingale used the word " coxcomb " in this more thoughtful sense , referring to a book consisting of text , tables , and graphics :
" Dear Mr. Herbert ,
I send you one of the " coxcombs "
There are
More oil than the whole Middle East .
Let us say it is true .
How come everyone is not running to exploit it , like they exploit any other economic and financial benefit ?
The other aspect is how much energy , and at what cost , is it going to take to heat the oil shale up and extract the oil ?
I suggest conserving resources .
We should use renewable energy , such as solar and wind energy etc. to heat up the shale .
Another issue is they government is waiting for oil to reach $ 200 per barrel so it can reduce the deficit and pay down outstanding loans .
I hope that is the truth and that there are no hidden agendas .
Technological hurdles to extract oil from shale
“ Despite all the attempts to develop a shale oil industry in the United States over the past 100 years , the fact remains that no proven method exists for efficiently moving the oil from the rock .
There are a number of candidate processes possible , but none has demonstrated a practical capability to produce oil . ”
This statement was made by experts with field experience who are bullish on the prospects for America 's oil shale .
But they recognize that , here and now , we are still not there technologically .
There are a number of problems yet to be solved before US oil shale can be recovered on any type of meaningful scale , let alone a mass scale .
And getting the extraction technology right is only one monkey wrench in the works with US oil shale .
There are others .
For example , there are questions of air quality regarding domestic oil shale operations .
How badly would these operations pollute the air ?
Would the levels be acceptable ?
The Oil Companies are not sure .
There are questions of water availability .
During the extraction process , how much water would be required ?
Experts are not sure .
An early " guess " is two to three barrels of water per barrel of shale .
This could be a conservative estimate .
Either way , will the massive amounts of water necessary for heavy - duty shale extraction even be available in the first place , given that the Colorado River Basin is already running low ?
Environmental and ecological damage and restoration to pre-drilling conditions also need to be considered .
Can you imagine ?
We could have the largest oil reserve in the world if we find an economical way to extract the oil .
We will be energy independent , have a huge economic boom , increase employment with funds staying in our country and inform the countries that are currently supplying us with oil that we do not need them .
They will no longer be able blackmail us or threaten us with economic doom .
American technology and knowhow will find the answer .
All that is needed is to wave the dollar bill in front of corporate America and they will find the answer “ by hook or by crook ” .
Then the executives , the shareholders and the politicians will laugh all the way to the bank .
If you view the source code of a typical web page , you are likely to see something like this near the top :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
and / or
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " ...>
These refer to HTML DTDs and namespace documents hosted on W3 C ’s site .
Note that these are not hyperlinks ; these URIs are used for identification .
This is a machine - readable way to say “ this is HTML ” .
In particular , software does not usually need to fetch these resources , and certainly does not need to fetch the same one over and over !
Yet we receive a surprisingly large number of requests for such resources : up to 130 million requests per day , with periods of sustained bandwidth usage of 350 Mbps , for resources that have n’t changed in years .
The vast majority of these requests are from systems that are processing various types of markup ( HTML , XML , XSLT , SVG ) and in the process doing something like validating against a DTD or schema .
Handling all these requests costs us considerably : servers , bandwidth and human time spent analyzing traffic patterns and devising methods to limit or block excessive new request patterns .
We would much rather use these assets elsewhere , for example improving the software and services needed by W3C and the Web Community .
A while ago we put a system in place to monitor our servers for abusive request patterns and send 503 Service Unavailable responses with custom text depending on the nature of the abuse .
Our hope was that the authors of misbehaving software and the administrators of sites who deployed it would notice these errors and make the necessary fixes to the software responsible .
But many of these systems continue to re-request the same DTDs from our site thousands of times over , even after we have been serving them nothing but 503 errors for hours or days .
Why are these systems bothering to request these resources at all if they do n’t care about the response ?
( For repeat offenders we eventually block the IPs at the TCP level as well . )
We have identified some of the specific software causing this excessive traffic and have been in contact with the parties responsible to explain how their product or service is essentially creating a Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attack against W3C .
Some have been very responsive , correcting the problem in a timely manner ; unfortunately others have been dragging on for quite some time without resolution , and a number of sources remain unidentified .
We would like to see this issue resolved once and for all , not just for our own needs but also to improve the quality of software deployed on the Web at large .
Therefore we have a number of suggestions for those writing and deploying such software :
Pay attention to HTTP response codes
This is basic good programming practice : check your return codes , otherwise you have no idea when something goes wrong .
Honor HTTP caching / expiry information Resources on our site are served in a cache - friendly way : our DTDs and schemata generally have explicit expiry times of 90 days or more , so there ’s no reason to request these resources several times a day .
( In one case we noticed , a number of IP addresses at one company were requesting DTDs from our site more than three hundred thousand times per day each , per IP address . )
Mark Nottingham ’s caching tutorial is an excellent resource to learn more about HTTP caching .
If you implement HTTP in a software library , allow for caching Any software that makes HTTP requests to other sites should make it straightforward to enable the use of a cache .
Applications that use such libraries to contact other sites should clearly document how to enable caching , and preferably ship with caching enabled by default .
Many XML utilities have the ability to use an XML catalog to map URIs for external resources to a locally - cached copy of the files .
For information on configuring XML applications to use a catalog , see Norman Walsh ’s Caching in with Resolvers article or Catalog support in libxml .
Take responsibility for your outgoing network traffic
If you install software that interacts with other sites over the network , you should be aware how it works and what kind of traffic it generates .
If it has the potential to make thousands of requests to other sites , make sure it uses an HTTP cache to prevent inflicting abuse on other sites .
If the software does n’t make it straightforward to do so , file a bug report with the vendor , seek alternatives , or use an intercepting proxy server with a built - in cache .
Do n’t fetch stuff unless you actually need it Judging from the response to our 503 errors , much of the software requesting DTDs and schemata from our site does n’t even need them in the first place , so requesting them just wastes bandwidth and slows down the application .
If you do n’t need it , do n’t fetch it !
Identify your user agents
When deploying software that makes requests to other sites , you should set a custom User - Agent header to identify the software and provide a means to contact its maintainers .
Many of the automated requests we receive have generic user - agent headers such as Java / 1.6.0 or Python- urllib / 2.1 which provide no information on the actual software responsible for making the requests .
Some sites ( e.g. Google , Wikipedia ) block access to such generic user - agents .
We have not done that yet but may consider doing so .
It is generally quite easy to set a custom User - Agent with most HTTP software libraries , see for example How to change the User - Agent of Python ’s urllib .
We are interested in feedback from the community on what else we can do to address the issue of this excessive traffic .
Specifically :
Do we need to make our specifications clearer in terms of HTTP caching and best practices for software developers ?
You might think something like “ do n’t request the same resource thousands of times a day , especially when it explicitly tells you it should be considered fresh for 90 days ” would be obvious , but unfortunately it seems not .
At the W3C Systems Team ’s request the W3C TAG has agreed to take up the issue of Scalability of URI Access to Resources .
Do you have any examples of specific applications that do things right / wrong by default , or pointers to documentation on how to enable caching in software packages that might be affecting us ?
What do other medium / large sites do to detect and prevent abuse ?
We are not alone in receiving excessive schema and namespace requests , take for example the stir when the DTD for RSS 0.91 disappeared .
For other types of excessive traffic , we have looked at software to help block or rate - limit requests , e.g. mod_cband , mod_security , Fail2ban .
Some of the community efforts in identifying abusive traffic are too aggressive for our needs .
What do you use , and how do you use it ?
Should we just ignore the issue and serve all these requests ?
What if we start receiving 10 billion DTD requests / day instead of 100 million ?

FRIENDS of rogue trader Jerome Kerviel last night blamed his $ 7 billion losses on unbearable levels of stress brought on by a punishing 30 hour week .
Kerviel was known to start work as early as nine in the morning and still be at his desk at five or even five - thirty , often with just an hour and a half for lunch .
One colleague said : “ He was , how you say , une workaholique .
“ I have a family and a mistress so I would leave the office at around 2 pm at the latest , if I was n’t on strike .
“ But Jerome was tied to that desk .
One day I came back to the office at 3 pm because I had forgotten my stupid little hat , and there he was , fast asleep on the photocopier .
“ At first I assumed he had been having sex with it , but then I remembered he ’d been working for almost six hours . ”
As the losses mounted , Kerviel tried to conceal his bad trades by covering them with an intense red wine sauce , later switching to delicate pastry horns .
At one point he managed to dispose of dozens of transactions by hiding them inside vol - au - vent cases and staging a fake reception .
His colleague added : “ He is a traitor and should be shot at dawn if anyone in France could actually be bothered to start work that early . ”
Times reporter subpoenaed over source used in CIA book RAW STORY

The reporter who helped break the story on the National Security Agency 's warrantless surveillance has been subpoenaed for refusing to give up a source .
" A federal grand jury has issued a subpoena to a reporter of The New York Times , apparently to try to force him to reveal his confidential sources for a 2006 book on the Central Intelligence Agency , one of the reporters lawyers said Thursday , " the New York Times reports .
Philip Shenon 's article continues , " The subpoena was delivered last week to the New York law firm that is representing the reporter , James Risen , and ordered him to appear before a grand jury in Alexandria , Va. , on Feb .
7 . Mr. Risens lawyer , David N. Kelley , who was the United States attorney in Manhattan early in the Bush administration , said in an interview that the subpoena sought the source of information for a specific chapter of the book ' State of War . ' "
According to the paper , " The chapter asserted that the C.I.A. had unsuccessfully tried , beginning in the Clinton administration , to infiltrate Irans nuclear program . "
" We intend to fight this subpoena , so well likely be engaging in some sort of litigation ,  Risen 's attorney said .
" Jim has adhered to the highest traditions of journalism .
He is the highest caliber of reporter that you can find , and he will keep his commitment to the confidentiality of his sources . "
Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis said the paper " strongly supports Mr. Risen and deplores what seems to be a growing trend of government leak investigations focusing on journalists , particularly in the national security area . "
The information on the CIA and Iran 's nuclear program was never published in the Times .
Mathis would not say why it had not been .
The Justice Department would not comment on the work of the grand jury that issued the subpoena , citing a pending investigation .
Risen and Times colleague Eric Lichtblau won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting for their disclosure of the Bush administration 's wiretapping program .
In 2005 , former New York Times reporter Judith Miller was jailed for nearly three months for refusing to identify a confidential source during an investigation into the disclosure of the name of a covert CIA agent .
Miller testified after her source , I. Lewis Libby Jr. , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , waived Miller 's pledge of confidentiality .

Pope backs surge of exorcism squads ' to fight the Devil head on ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday February 5 , 2008

Print This Email This The Vatican has never given up belief in the reality of demonic possession , but the practice of actual exorcisms has waned over the last few centuries .
Now , however , the Vatican 's chief exorcist has revealed that Pope Benedict XVI takes the problem very seriously and is " setting up exorcism squads to deal with the rampant growth of Satanism . "
Father Gabriele Amorth is both the senior exorcist of the diocese of Rome and the founder of the International Association of Exorcists .
He has condemned the Harry Potter novels as containing " the signature of the Prince of Darkness " and recently warned that diabolical influences can reach even into the Vatican .
Amorth told IBN that " the action of the Devil is a lot more widespread than in the past , not because he has more strength , but because he is given more space . "
He went on to complain that these days " prists and bishops know nothing about the subject .
...
They believe in the Devil , but they do n't believe much in the actions of the Devil , so they prefer to send everyone to psychiatrists . "
Pope Benedict , who " is said to be a firm believer in the existence of evil , " has called for hundreds of priests to be trained as exorcists and made available to every Bishop .
" Thank God there is a pope who wants to fight the devil head on , " Amorth told IBN .

Tax avoidance by large companies and wealthy individuals costs the Government £ 25 bn a year , the equivalent of £ 1,000 for every working person in Britain , according to research published today .
The wealthy avoid tax worth £ 13bn while the country 's largest firms escape tax worth £ 12bn , according to the study commissioned by the Trades Union Congress .
The report concluded that Britain 's top 50 companies pay corporation tax at 22.5 per cent , far below the official rate of 30 per cent , by using a range of measures to manage the amount of tax due .
Richard Murphy , a tax specialist , estimated that the real tax paid by corporations was falling by 0.5 per cent year – indicating that major firms are becoming more and more effective at avoiding tax .
Mr Murphy 's report , based on studying hundreds of company reports and trawling through data from HM Revenue and Customs , said that wealthy people saved £ 3.2 bn in tax by turning conventional income into investment income , which is taxed at a lower rate , or by shifting income to family members on lower tax bands .
Another £ 3.8 bn in tax was lost by moving transactions out of the country .

Union leaders stressed that tax - avoidance measures were wholly legal , but urged ministers to close loopholes to make real tax payments reflect headline tax rates .
The report , published the day after the oil giant Shell announced record profits of £ 13.9bn , comes after the Institute of Fiscal Studies warned that the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , needed to raise taxes by £ 8bn to control public sector debt .
The TUC called for a new minimum tax rate for all those earning more than £ 100,000 a year to limit the scope for tax planning by the wealthy , and said that all capital gains on assets held for less than a year should be charged ordinary income tax .
Union leaders also called for a new anti-avoidance principle in tax rules , to make it easier to curb corporate tax planning .
Brendan Barber , the TUC 's general - secretary , said : " There is mounting concern at the growing gap between the super - rich and the rest of society but , so far , there have been few practical proposals to do anything about it .
" Our strong view is that the proceeds should be used to properly fund public services .
We recognise the argument at this difficult economic time for boosting the income of low and middle Britain through tax cuts .
This is not the politics of envy but the economics of fairness .
" It is all about getting the rich and powerful to understand they must play by the rules , not look for ways round them .
Most people think we have a progressive tax system , but it has now been hollowed out by so many loopholes and allowances that too much tax is now voluntary for the rich . "
The Confederation of British Industry said businesses were within their rights to manage their taxes .
Ian McCafferty , chief economic adviser , said : " Businesses paid £ 130bn in tax last year and have seen this bill rise sharply since 2003 to help pay for public services .
" Legitimate tax planning – undertaken by companies that operate globally – should not be confused with so - called ' tax avoidance ' .
" Outdated ' tax the rich ' proposals simply risk harming successful companies who create jobs and wealth for people in this country , as well as driving successful individuals overseas . "

As deadline looms , Revenue site crashes
The beleaguered bosses of HM Revenue & Customs suffered another embarrassment yesterday when their online tax returns service crashed hours before the deadline for filing the forms .
The Revenue was forced to offer a 24 - hour extension .
Tax returns have to be filed by 31 January , with an automatic £ 100 fine for those who miss the deadline : last year some 940,000 taxpayers were hit by the penalty .
A Revenue spokesman said : " HMRC takes any disruption of service very seriously and to reflect this no one who files electronically or by paper by midnight Friday 1 February will face a penalty . "
The Revenue 's online tax services have suffered a series of breakdowns , with problems affecting the pay - as - you - earn system .
The department is also still reeling from the loss of computer discs containing millions of families ' child benefit details .
Angela Beech , senior tax partner at the accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg , said : " It is becoming clear that the Revenue is not geared up to properly deal with the challenges it faces . "

The derivative of f(x ) at point a is the slope of the tangent line at point a or .
Allow me to explain .
As seen in the picture above , a secant line is a line that passes through two points of a function and a tangent line touches only one .
The function to find the slope of a secant line that passes through is where h is the change in x or .
This is simply the slope formula , , modified .
Taking the limit as h approaches 0 means that the would “ become zero ” , so the line would only pass through that one point .
That is a tangent line .
The picture above should help make it clearer .
It illustrates using the derivative formula to find the slope of the tangent line at x=1 on .
The red line is the secant line as h approaches zero from the left ( values of h are - 3 , - 2 , and - 1 ) .
The blue line is the secant line as h approaches zero from the right ( values of h are 3 and 2 ) .
The purple line is the tangent line ; it touches the function at only one point .
Now I will show you how it is done algebraically .
I have written it out since I believe that is easier to understand .
The first thing I do is replace f( x ) with its value replacing x with x + h in the first term .
I then multiply everything out so I am left with a polynomial .
The ‘s and 5 ‘s cancel out .
Now it is possible to cancel out an h in each term .
After doing so , I plugged in zero for h to leave me with the derivative - 2 x .
The derivative only tells you the slope of the tangent line , not the equation .
Since you know the slope of the line and a point on the line , it is not difficult to find the equation of the tangent line , g(x ) in this case .
There are many tricks and shortcuts to finding the derivative of a line .
The derivative formula is usually the most difficult .
Things to remember :
The derivative of is .
A derivative of the derivative yields the second derivative or .
The derivative of y is written as .
In the next two posts I will delve into some of the shortcuts to finding the derivative of a function and why derivatives are useful .
A Jewish couple 's bid to take a tax deduction they say the Internal Revenue Service reserves only for members of the Church of Scientology is getting a friendly reception from a federal appeals court , increasing the possibility of a ruling that could create a tax break for taxpayers of many religions who pay tuition to religious schools .
During arguments on the case this week , three judges who ride the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals expressed deep skepticism of the IRS 's position that the way the agency treats Scientologists is irrelevant to the deductions the Orthodox Jews , Michael and Marla Sklar , took for part of their children 's day school tuition and for after - school classes in Jewish law .
" The view of the IRS is it can unconstitutionally violate the Constitution by establishing religion , by treating one religion more favorably than other religions in terms of what is allowed as deductions , and there can never be any judicial review of that ? "
Judge Kim Wardlaw asked at the court session Monday in Pasadena , Calif .
" That is not at all what I said , " a Justice Department lawyer representing the IRS , Ellen Delsole , said .
" That 's the bottom line , " Judge Wardlaw and a colleague on the panel , Harry Pregerson , both replied .
" This does intrude into the Establishment Clause , " Judge Wardlaw added .
The case stems from an agreement the IRS reached with the Church of Scientology in 1993 to end more than a decade of lawsuits , audits , and other enforcement actions involving the tax agency , Scientology entities , and church leaders .
The church paid $ 12.5 million , while the IRS agreed to drop arguments that Scientology , which was founded by L. Ron Hubbard , was not a bona fide religion .
At about the time of that deal , the IRS agreed to allow Scientologists to deduct at least 80 % of the fees paid for " religious training and services . "
The Sklars took similar deductions for religious education on their returns for the early 1990s , without challenge by the IRS .
However , the IRS rejected their deductions for 1994 and beyond .
The 1993 pact between the IRS and the Scientologists was memorialized in a 72 - page " closing agreement , " which was published by the Wall Street Journal in 1997 .
However , the IRS has never acknowledged the accuracy of that document , and when the Sklars ' attorney , Jeffrey Zuckerman , sought it from the agency , the IRS refused to turn the document over .
Mr. Zuckerman also subpoenaed the agreement and other records from the Church of Scientology and its president , Reverend Heber Jentzsch .
The tax court judge who handled the case , John Colvin , quashed the subpoenas without explanation .
Ms. Delsole told the appeals court that the agreement with the Scientologists must be kept confidential for privacy reasons .
" That 's getting into the private taxpayer business of another taxpayer , " she said .
The government lawyer asserted that the Sklars were not " similarly situated " to the Scientologists because the couple was seeking to deduct fees related to basic education for children and not the kind of training Scientologists undergo .
" How do we know that ? " Judge Wardlaw asked , according to a recording of the hearing .
" You tell us you do n't know anything either , but you read the Wall Street Journal , " Judge Pregerson said to Ms. Delsole .
She said that even if the benefit for Scientologists went too far , the solution was not to give it to " one taxpayer and one more religion . "
" That 's your best argument : two wrongs do n't make a right , " the third judge on the case , Ronald Leighton , said .
He called the agency 's refusal to explain its agreement with the Scientologists " a frustration that is hard to get beyond . "
Ms. Delsole warned the court that the IRS would have difficulty resolving tax disputes if it could be forced to justify those deals in cases involving other taxpayers .
" Every person who can find out about it from any other religious group is going to come in and want the same thing and that would really tie the IRS 's hands , " she said .
Members of racial minorities could also claim taxpayers of other races got better deals , the government lawyer said .
" That 's the sort of thing that would flow from the idea that the IRS can't settle and keep this confidential , " she added .
Mr. Zuckerman rejected that idea .
" If the IRS were saying white people were entitled to a certain deduction and black people were not , why would it be such a parade of horrors for the courts to come in and say the government may not act that way ? " he asked .
The court made no immediate ruling , but an attorney who represents the Church of Scientology , Monique Yingling , said she was surprised by the judges ' statements that data on the church 's deal with the IRS was needed for the Sklars ' case .
" There 's a lot of information already in the public record about this question , " she said .
" I do n't know that there 's any need for any additional information . "
Ms. Yingling said the 1993 deal merely ensured parity for Scientologists under tax law .
" They are not getting any kind of special treatment , " she said .
Ms. Yingling said the training Scientologists can deduct is not the same as religious education .
" The use of the word ' training ' in Scientology is not analogous to education , " she said .
" It 's just another way of advancing spiritually in Scientology . "
Mr. Zuckerman said that alleged distinction is precisely what he wants to explore in the court case .
" You need to get a factual record on that , then you can make your argument , " he said .
The Canadian National Post looks on with mild horror as American linguists report on the growing trend in the American south to use " Canadian " as a masking euphemism for black people , so that white racists can say socially inappropriate things without tipping listeners off about the cancer in their souls .
Last August , a blogger in Cincinnati going by the name CincyBlurg reported that a black friend from the southeastern U.S. had recently discovered that she was being called a Canadian .
" She told me a story of when she was working in a shop in the South and she overheard some of her customers complaining that they were always waited on by a Canadian at that place .
She did n't understand what they were talking about and assumed they must be talking about someone else , " the blogger wrote .
" After this happened several times with different patrons , she mentioned it to one of her co-workers .
He told her that ' Canadian ' was the new derogatory term that racist Southerners were using to describe persons they would have previously referred to [ with the N - word . ] "
A similar case in Kansas City was reported last year on a Listserv , or electronic mailing list , used by linguistics experts .
A University of Kansas linguist said that a waitress friend reported that " fellow workers used to use a name for inner-city families that were known to not leave a tip : Canadians .
' Hey , we have a table of Canadians … .
They 're all yours . ' "

One of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta , often translated as no-self .
This teaching is a stumbling block for two reasons .
First , the idea of there being no self does n't fit well with other Buddhist teachings , such as the doctrine of kamma and rebirth :
If there 's no self , what experiences the results of kamma and takes rebirth ?
Second , it does n't fit well with our own Judeo - Christian background , which assumes the existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition :
If there 's no self , what 's the purpose of a spiritual life ?
Many books try to answer these questions , but if you look at the Pali canon — the earliest extant record of the Buddha 's teachings — you wo n't find them addressed at all .
In fact , the one place where the Buddha was asked point - blank whether or not there was a self , he refused to answer .
When later asked why , he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice impossible .
Thus the question should be put aside .
To understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta , we first have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered , and how to interpret his answers .
The Buddha divided all questions into four classes : those that deserve a categorical ( straight yes or no ) answer ; those that deserve an analytical answer , defining and qualifying the terms of the question ; those that deserve a counter - question , putting the ball back in the questioner 's court ; and those that deserve to be put aside .
The last class of question consists of those that do n't lead to the end of suffering and stress .
The first duty of a teacher , when asked a question , is to figure out which class the question belongs to , and then to respond in the appropriate way .
You do n't , for example , say yes or no to a question that should be put aside .
If you are the person asking the question and you get an answer , you should then determine how far the answer should be interpreted .
The Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him : those who draw inferences from statements that should n't have inferences drawn from them , and those who do n't draw inferences from those that should .
These are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddha 's teachings , but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine , we find these ground rules ignored .
Some writers try to qualify the no-self interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal self or a separate self , but this is to give an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put aside .
Others try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that there is no self , but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside , one is drawing inferences where they should n't be drawn .
So , instead of answering " no " to the question of whether or not there is a self — interconnected or separate , eternal or not — the Buddha felt that the question was misguided to begin with .
Why ?
No matter how you define the line between " self " and " other , " the notion of self involves an element of self - identification and clinging , and thus suffering and stress .
This holds as much for an interconnected self , which recognizes no " other , " as it does for a separate self .
If one identifies with all of nature , one is pained by every felled tree .
It also holds for an entirely " other " universe , in which the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness — one 's own or that of others — impossible .
For these reasons , the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as " Do I exist ? " or " Do n't I exist ? " for however you answer them , they lead to suffering and stress .
To avoid the suffering implicit in questions of " self " and " other , " he offered an alternative way of dividing up experience : the four Noble Truths of stress , its cause , its cessation , and the path to its cessation .
Rather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other , he said , one should recognize them simply for what they are , in and of themselves , as they are directly experienced , and then perform the duty appropriate to each .
Stress should be comprehended , its cause abandoned , its cessation realized , and the path to its cessation developed .
These duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understood .
If you develop the path of virtue , concentration , and discernment to a state of calm well - being and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths , the questions that occur to the mind are not " Is there a self ?
What is my self ? " but rather " Am I suffering stress because I 'm holding onto this particular phenomenon ?
Is it really me , myself , or mine ?
If it 's stressful but not really me or mine , why hold on ? "
These last questions merit straightforward answers , as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging — the residual sense of self - identification — that cause it , until ultimately all traces of self - identification are gone and all that 's left is limitless freedom .
In this sense , the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of no-self , but a not - self strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause , leading to the highest , undying happiness .
At that point , questions of self , no -self , and not - self fall aside .
Once there 's the experience of such total freedom , where would there be any concern about what 's experiencing it , or whether or not it 's a self ?
In today ’s society most of us read a considerable amount of information online on a daily or weekly basis .
Whether you do business online , maintain a blog , read for your job , or just read for pleasure , I ’m sure you could benefit from retaining more of what you read .
The internet is a vast source of information that can be found and digested quickly , but how much can you really retain long - term ?
Here are ten helpful tips to try for yourself .
1. READ , RECITE , REVIEW
The three R ’s will help you to engage in active reading that can help to increase how much you retain .
Reciting refers to pausing periodically while you are reading to reflect on the information that ’s being covered .
Rather than rushing through the article , recite key points to let them sink in , and relate what you are reading to what you already know .
The reviewing process involves going back to re-read parts that you may have missed or not understood .
It also includes looking at the information as a whole and recognizing portions that relate to your purpose .
2. TRIM THE FAT
You ’ll have a better ability to retain the important information that you ’re reading if you can cut out some of the unimportant stuff .
If you use an RSS reader , go through your subscription list and unsubscribe to any feeds that you really do n’t need .
Focus your reading on those sources that consistently provide you with the most valuable and relevant information .
3. TAKE ACTION
Most of us tend to remember things more accurately if we have a personal experience that helps us to understand and remember .
When you read something that you know will be useful to you , implement what you have learned as soon as possible and you ’ll give yourself a personal experience to go along with the information that you have read .
4. READ AT TIMES WHEN YOU CAN FOCUS
All of us have certain times of the day that are better than others for reading , retaining , and learning .
If you allocate your most productive time to reading you ’ll be able to have a sharper mindset and the material will get your full attention .
Daily routines and schedules also influence your ability to retain .
Read at times when you are not in a rush .
Do n’t force yourself to read at times that do n’t allow you to give retention a shot .
5. BE AWARE OF VISUAL CUES
Writers use visual cues such as bold text , italics , lists , charts and graphs to cause certain content to stand out to you .
Pay attention to these cues and use them to understand the structure and find the most important pieces of information .
Visual cues can be especially helpful when scanning over content or reviewing after you have read .
Not using the cues will lead to a lack of focus and decreased retention as the key points will not stand out .
6. MAP WHAT YOU ARE READING
Mapping involves a few basic steps that can drastically increase the retention rate of your reading .
The first step is to understand your purpose .
Know what it is that you want to learn or gain from reading .
The second step is to pull out key words and phrases .
The third step is to focus only on the information that matters to your purpose .
With mapping you can achieve more in less time and retain more because less important details wo n’t be hogging your memory .
7. PRINT OUT PAGES OF PARTICULAR INTEREST
Sometimes the best way to keep something for future use is simply to print it out and file it away .
Having a well - organized filing system can be a big help when you go back to look for specific information .
For non-technical people that are n’t into online bookmarks , this is a realistic solution .
Additionally , just reading something from paper rather than from the monitor can make a big difference for some people in terms of retention .
8. TAKE NOTES
Note taking is a common practice in a classroom setting or at seminars and conferences , but very few people take notes while reading online .
Why ?
It ’s probably not natural to most of us when reading online , but note taking has several benefits .
First of all , the action of writing down the key points of an article will help to reinforce those ideas .
Second , notes give you a way to go back and make use of information in the future .
Note taking can also be combined with the filing system mentioned above .
9. OUTLINE THE ARTICLE
If there is a particular article containing a good bit of information that you want to understand and remember , take a pen and paper and jot down an outline of the article as you read .
Writing the outline will help you to use an active reading technique that will increase retention , plus it will help you to understand and identify the relationship between key points of the article .
10 . USE A BOOKMARKS MANAGER LIKE DEL.ICIO.US
As you ’re surfing through the web you ’re bound to come across certain pages and websites that you know you will have a use for in the future .
Rather than relying on your memory to make your way back to this content , use a bookmarks manager ( like del.icio.us ) to store all of your bookmarked pages online in one place .
Simply using a bookmarks manager is n’t enough .
You also need to be careful to accurately tag the page so that you will easily be able to find it later .
When you go back to del.icio.us to find what you ’re looking for , tags are probably the easiest way to browse through your bookmarks .
Use tags consistently to mark the same types of pages and you ’ll save yourself some time and headaches in the future .
Canada publicly declared a 2 degree C rise in the planet ’s temperature “ unacceptable ” but it is putting all of its resources at the Bali climate change conference into wrecking the process said Hans Verolme , director of WWF ’s Global Climate Change Programme .
“ What they are doing here will will get us 4 degrees C ” of global warming , said Verlome at a press conference today from Nusa Dua on the island of Bali , the site of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) conference running until Dec. 14
Anything above two degrees scientists term “ dangerous ” .
Indeed , even at 2 degrees the IPCC says we have just a 50 - 50 chance of avoiding dangerous climate change .
Canada and Japan seem to be playing the US card of doing nothing he said .
And yet on Monday Dec 3 , Environment Minister John Baird made a speech in Canada ’s House of Commons : “ a rise of 2° in the Earth ’s temperature as a result of human activity contributing to global warming , simply put , is unacceptable . ”
“ I do n’t understand Canadian politics , ” said Verolme .

A Boulder County man who killed a kitten that was chewing on his ailing wife ’s oxygen tube has pleaded guilty in return for a deferred sentence that requires him to comply with conditions set by a judge .
Charles Kenneth Corwin , 57 , pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated cruelty to animals .
Boulder District Court Judge D.D. Mallard will set the conditions — based on recommendations from probation officers — when Corwin is sentenced May 15 .
If Corwin fulfills the conditions for a period of two years , the case will be dismissed , said Carolyn French , spokeswoman for the Boulder County district attorney ’s office .
Corwin told police he bashed the cat ’s skull repeatedly against a book case and threw it out the door of his trailer after finding the animal biting the oxygen tube on Dec. 11 .
His son , Charles Corwin Jr. , became angry after learning that Corwin had killed the cat and pulled a knife on his father , Corwin later told deputies .
Boulder County deputies came to the trailer and arrested Corwin Jr. on suspicion of threatening his father with a knife .
Corwin Jr. bonded out of jail .
Two days later , Corwin Jr. shot himself to death in the bathroom of the trailer .
Deputies questioned Corwin more closely about the cat ’s death and arrested him after his son ’s suicide .
After the arrest , Emily Busick , who identified herself as Corwin ’s daughter , wrote a letter defending him to Channel 7 News .
“ Charles did not originally plan to injure the cat , merely remove it from the oxygen tube that was keeping his wife alive , ” Busick wrote .
“ Think about the punishment he has already endured , ” Busick wrote .
“ Charles had to see his barely 21 - year - old son be carted away in a body bag .
Not only that , but he was left to clean the bathroom where the death occurred . ”

A new study estimates that more than 1 million Iraqis have died because of the war in Iraq since the US - led invasion of the country in 2003 .
Data compiled by London - based Opinion Research Business ( ORB ) and its research partner in Iraq , the Independent Institute for Administration and Civil Society Studies ( IIACSS ) reveals a fifth of Iraqi households lost at least one family member between March 2003 and August 2007 due to the conflict .
The study based its findings on survey work involving the face - to - face questioning of 2,414 Iraqi adults aged 18 or above , and the last complete census in Iraq in 1997 , which indicated a total of 4.05 million households .
Respondents were asked how many members of their household , if any , had died as a result of the violence in the country since 2003 , and not because of natural causes .
" We now estimate that the death toll between March 2003 and August 2007 is likely to have been in the order of 1,033,000 , " ORB said in a statement .
The margin of error for the survey was 1.7 per cent , making the estimated range between 946,000 and 1.12 million fatalities .
The highest rate of deaths throughout the country occurred in Baghdad , where more than 40 per cent of households had lost a family member .
According to a July 2007 estimate by the United States , Iraq 's population is around 27 million .
The country has been racked by conflict since the March 2003 invasion , which deposed dictator Saddam Hussein , with United Nations estimates putting the number of displaced people from the conflict at more than four million , nearly half of which have fled to neighbouring countries .
A small number of those refugees have begun returning to Iraq .
Earlier this month , the Iraqi Red Crescent said around 20,000 arrived from Syria in December , suggesting an improved security situation .

Indian Victims Relate Horror of Kidney Theft
The victims of an illegal racket say they woke up to find their kidneys missing .
GURGAON , India , Feb. 1 , 2008  --
As Mohammad Salim Khan gained consciousness , he found himself in an unfamiliar house with a stranger in front of him wearing a surgical mask and gloves .
" What 's happened to me ? " Khan ( through an interpreter ) said he asked the man , because he could not move his limbs .
" Your kidney has been removed , " the man said .
" How will I live ? "
Khan asked , shocked at the information .
Khan , 33 , said that he was taken to the three - story house where the illegal surgery took place by men who offered him construction work .
Khan explained all of this while lying in a bed in the isolation ward of the Gurgaon Civil Hospital , located on the outskirts of Delhi .
His extreme story is similar to those of the two men in the beds on either side of him -- Shakil Ahmed , 28 , and Naseem Mohammad , 25 -- the same men who were in the room with him when he woke up from his surgery .
Victims of organ theft recovering at Gurgaon Civil Hospital
For laborers like Khan , days often begin at a central gathering spot where men approach them with manual labor opportunities .
And it was at one of these spots where all three victims were offered work for 150 rupees ( about $ 4 ) a day .
Then all three men -- on varying dates over the past two weeks -- were taken to a house and kept there at gunpoint for several days .
Surgical masks strewn about a lot near the house
Bizarre as the story sounds , the three men all said that at first they were not suspicious of what was happening .
For Mohammad , much of the experience -- aside from being held at gunpoint -- rang true to what he had been offered initially : free food and housing .
And the lack of work for a few days seemed all right with him because he was told he would still be paid .
Mohammad Salim Khan , 33
Eventually , the three men said , they were each brought individually to the house with a hidden state - of - the - art operating room .
Tests , likely to determine their blood type , were also administered .
The men said they were given shots that made them pass out and they woke up to excruciating pain and scars that wrapped around their thin waists .
After Khan awoke and was assured by the masked man that he was medically fine , he was told he would be killed if he ever spoke about the surgery .
" If you tell anyone that your kidney has been removed at this very place or if you tell anyone that your kidney has been removed at all , there is a man who is following you who will shoot you , " Khan said he was told .
Shakil Ahmed , 28
When asked if he believed that a man was going to follow his every move for the rest of his life , Khan said , " If someone can forcibly take my kidney out of me , they could also kill me . "
A few hours after Khan 's conversation with the stranger , police raided the house - turned - operating - theater to find the three victims , along with two other men who were next in line for kidney removals .
Khan said that before the police raid two servants helped him dress , warned him of the impending arrival and then fled the scene .
Police also busted another nearby house where an American couple was staying .
The victims were brought to the hospital , where they underwent medical testing .
" The MRIs all say that the surgery has been done , the kidney has been removed and the way the surgery has been conducted and the precision of the surgery all point to the professionalism of the operating surgeon , " said Dr. S.P. Bhanot , 33 , a surgeon at Gurgaon Civil .
Police said that if they had not conducted the raid , then Joy and Susan Mathew of Hawthore , N.Y. , would have been the beneficiaries of a scam in which unsuspecting victims -- mostly poor laborers from a region five hours northeast of the capital -- were promised jobs , then taken to a private house and forced at gunpoint to sell their kidneys .
The Americans traveled to India hoping to circumvent the long waiting list for a kidney transplant they faced in the United States .
Naseem Mohammad , 25
Although the three victims said they did not sell their kidney or know about the scam in advance , many of India 's poor have willingly sold their kidneys -- generally receiving about 50,000 rupees , or $ 1,300 in exchange for the organ , according to police .
Other victims , who said they received " hush " money only after waking up from the illegal surgery , received between $ 1,280 and $ 2,560 , police said .
Wealthy clients paid about $ 30,000 to receive the kidneys , police said .
Authorities say the mastermind behind the scam is Dr. Amit Kumar .
Mumbai police have been chasing Kumar -- also known as Dr. Santosh Raut -- since 1993 , when he allegedly ran an illegal kidney racket there , too .
He has been arrested several times but has managed to continue his involvement in the illegal trade of organs , police said .
More than 600 people are believed to have had their organs removed by the doctor who does not have a license to perform surgery .
Dr. Amit Kumar , aka Dr. Santosh Raut
On this most recent racket , Kumar allegedly worked with his brother , who is also wanted by authorities .
A third doctor accused of being involved in the scam is under arrest and cooperating with authorities .
Five foreign tourists , including the two Americans , were found in what police described as a " luxury guest house " owned by the doctor Saturday awaiting kidneys .
There was a waiting list of some 40 foreigners from at least five countries .
Thursday police arrested four people accused of being connected to the case , including a nurse who authorities say worked on the illegal surgeries .
Manjit Ahlawat , Gurgaon Joint Police Commissioner
But police still do not know the doctor 's whereabouts , which is why they need the help of Americans , they said .
" We wanted to know how [ Mathew ] came in contact with this doctor , and what brought him here and how much money he was to pay for this purpose , " Gurgaon Joint Police Commissioner Manjit Ahlawat said .
" Maybe he thinks he may get into trouble if he answers those questions .
That is not the reality .
We are there to help him out and we just want to know the truth . "

There are often times I feel like the loneliest Ron Paul supporter on earth .
We ’re already a forsaken lot , castigated as we are , called kooks , conspiracy mongers , racists , bigots , and ( worst of all ) , delusional dreamers living in a fantasy world .
Plus , we ’re mean - spirited and greedy !
Yet , here I am , an Orthodox Jew , living in Israel , in the dread “ occupied territories ” no less , and I feel even lonelier than most .
Just what am I doing casting my lot with this motley group ?!
I have a problem .
I tend to call things as I see them .
I fondly remember mocking in disgust , along with my then fellow conservatives , at the way then - President Clinton ’s supporters blindly and fawningly followed and supported him .
We are n’t like that , we thought smugly .
We think for ourselves .
I proudly voted for George W. Bush in 2000 .
I will never forget as I watched the election returns live , and it became clear that victory hinged on Florida .
No problem , I thought to myself .
Bush ’s lead in Florida was increasing throughout the night , with a 50,000 - vote spread .
Suddenly , within a span of less than an hour , that lead shriveled to …well , you all know the rest .
I ca n’t say I was n’t warned about Bush prior to the election .
I started reading LRC and WND many months before .
Both web sites called him on his bipartisan liberalism .
Bush himself did indeed promote a very liberal agenda .
At the time , I thought he was just making empty promises to appear “ moderate . ”
In fact , Bush probably has the greatest record of keeping his promises of any president in American history .
There are only two promises I can actually think of that he broke : campaign finance reform , which he promised to veto ; and a “ humble foreign policy , ” which supposedly 9/11 changed .
Although the events of 9/11 were outrageous and inhuman , I knew exactly what the consequences would be vis–vis the government response , and I was concerned , if not a little frightened .
When the USA PATRIOT act surfaced scant weeks after the event , my break came with my fellow conservatives , who would have gone ballistic had Clinton pushed for passage of such a heinous piece of legislation during his administration , a 9/11 - style event or not .
Those same people , who joined me in mocking Clinton ’s followers , now became those followers and blindly and fawningly supported Bush ’s efforts to get the act passed .
There was no turning back after that .
Fast - forward to the build - up to the war in Iraq .
We who lived in Israel were not clamoring for war , despite what many people in America think .
It is very sobering to receive instructions to unpack and prepare your ( and your children ’s ) government - issued gas masks just in case the unthinkable might happen .
Those who support American intervention in Iran ( to “ protect ” Israel or otherwise ) should consider that .
Even though I would consider myself a political junkie I largely sat out the 2004 election .
I honestly could n’t care less whether Bush or Kerry won , and people were quite surprised by my attitude .
I was shocked when Joseph Farah of WND , after pointedly not endorsing anyone in the 2000 campaign , actually endorsed Bush .
Nonetheless , I succeeded in basically ignoring the campaign .
Being a long - time reader of LRC , I was somewhat familiar with Ron Paul .
I occasionally read his regular articles on the site , and my own beliefs were often in sync with his .
I knew he was “ Dr. No , ” the “ most honest man in Congress ” ( as John McCain once said ) .
When he declared his candidacy early last year , I did n’t think much of it .
I actually thought it was a waste of time .
His ideas , which were largely my ideas too , were just too extreme to get any traction .
Other than reading about the occasional straw poll victory I ignored him .
I ’m not sure what changed my mind .
I think it might have been the third - quarter fundraising results , but I suddenly got very interested in Paul ’s campaign last October .
With the November 5th money bomb , everything changed .
Since then , I have engaged several close friends and family members in discussion about Dr. Paul and his candidacy .
All are conservative or libertarian , and all continue to oppose him and believe he ’s a racist crank who would be bad for Israel .
It is those two charges I would like to address .
The issue of the published newsletters bearing Dr. Paul ’s name are neither here nor there .
I ’ve been accused by one of my friends of what I detest exceedingly , that is , blindly following someone and ignoring fatal flaws in that person .
I think the newsletter issue gives people who already dislike Paul a reason to continue their hostility .
I ’ve seen a number of broadcasts and read a number of quotes .
Let ’s look at this in perspective .
Not one person has accused Dr. Paul of actually writing the inflammatory material .
At worst , he exercised poor judgment in allowing his name to be attached to these newsletters without any oversight .
He has apologized for this .
What more can we ask ?
It is unfortunate that it happened , and it is an albatross , but after a lot consideration , I do n’t think it is a fatal flaw .
To have someone so strenuously reject the PC blame game is actually refreshing .
If Dr. Paul loses , at least he ’ll lose with dignity and keep the movement alive .
The writing itself is very inflammatory , but only sometimes descends to the level of outright offensiveness .
Even then , the intent seems to be provocative , that is , to arouse controversy and attract attention .
That is besides the point because with thirty years of material to back him up , it is so obviously not written in Dr. Paul ’s hand .
Most of Dr. Paul ’s supporters who accept the above now ask him to name names .
He says he does n’t know who wrote the actual content .
Okay , they ’ll say , but he does know who edited the newsletter .
The easy thing for him to do would be to name the names he could and move on .
Except that those who expect him to name names will ever actually be satisfied with just that .
This is an opportune time to inject a little of my background into the conversation .
Jewish law considers gossip - mongering to be a grievous sin .
Gossip - mongering is spreading true statements with malicious intent or even without intent but that might cause even slight embarrassment .
The Talmud says that causing a person public embarrassment is akin to shedding blood .
Remaining silent in spite of the immense pressure to give in is thus the courageous and correct thing to do .
Related to the above is the insinuation that because Dr. Paul has attracted a following that includes strange and even loathsome characters , he must himself share those traits with these people .
Because of his strong beliefs in freedom of expression he limits his criticism to the beliefs of these people , and not the people themselves .
He does acknowledge that they do n’t help his campaign , but obviously that is never good enough for those who purport to have the authority to declare what is acceptable for the delicate ears of the American people to hear .
This condemnation by association ( of these people with Ron Paul , not vice versa ) is reprehensible .
Especially by Orthodox Jews who know a thing or two about our history .
At the very start of our nationhood , the Exodus from Egypt , the Torah records ( Exodus 12:38 ) that a “ mixed multitude ” ( “ erev rav ” in Hebrew ) left with the Jews .
This was no small group .
It probably numbered over one million people ( most commentaries place the total number of Jews at about three million ) .
The Talmud is replete with references to this group of hangers - on and opportunists , who knew a good thing when they saw it .
They were a disparate lot of quacks and undesirable elements who have been the bane of Jewish history to this very day .
The book of Esther ( 8:17 ) records that after the Jewish people ’s victory over Haman and his followers , many gentiles saw the ascendancy of the Jews and once again , cleaved to them , falsely claiming to be Jews .
Finally , when King David was on the run from King Saul , a persecuted fugitive , he attracted , but did not seek out a following .
“ They gathered to him  every man in distress , every man with a creditor , and every man embittered of spirit  and he became their leader . ”
( I Samuel 22:2 ) Does this not sound like the riff - raff of society ?
Imagine what respectable people said when they saw the famous David , slayer of Goliath , son - in - law of the King , with these kooks !
He did n’t distance himself from them , he became their leader !
Are we really going to condemn a man because of people he has no control or influence over , a few of whose very values are antithetical to his own ?
For shame .
The second complaint is that a Paul administration would be bad for Israel .
The number of statements Dr. Paul has made in support of Israel , way before he even considered his current candidacy really strains the credibility of the claim .
There are a number of issues here .
First , aid to Israel .
It has been obvious for a long time that Israel does not need this aid .
Israel ’s GDP per capita is at European levels and rising .
The aid itself is a form of corporate welfare in that it must be spent in America .
It comes with many strings attached .
It allows the government to avoid sorely needed economic reforms .
Along with the aid Israel receives , potential or actual enemies receive several times more .
That aid does n’t just allow the recipient nations to avoid reforms , it actually props them up and allows them to continue to maintain a bellicose stance against Israel ( this certainly includes Egypt , with whom Israel has a peace treaty in place ) .
When the entire world condemned Israel , including President Reagan on down in America , Dr. Paul supported Israel ’s right to act in its own self - interest ( and preemptively , I might add ) in its bombing of the Osirak reactor in Iraq .
He had absolutely nothing to gain by taking this position , and nothing to lose by following the herd in its condemnation of Israel .
America has imposed its will on Israel for decades .
President Eisenhower forced Israel to withdraw from the Sinai after the 1956 war turning a military victory into a political defeat .
According to Wikipedia , in 1973 , the American Secretary of State , Henry Kissinger directly ordered Golda Meir , the Prime Minister of Israel to not strike Egypt and Syria preemptively , despite growing evidence that they planned an attack .
Had Israel struck first , it would not have received “ so much as a nail ” in arms , a serious threat .
The first President Bush famously , and insultingly , through his proxy , Secretary of State James Baker , told Premier Shamir to call the public White House phone line when he was serious about peace .
In the aftermath of the first Gulf War , America most decidedly imposed its will on Israel by forcing it to participate in the Madrid conference .
It influenced the outcome of the Israeli elections by turning down the request for loan guarantees ( in principle the loan guarantees are unconstitutional , but Bush declined to reject the request on such lofty terms ; it was rank interference in Israel ’s internal affairs that drove the decision ) .
In the run-up to the 1996 election between Shimon Peres and Binyamin Netanyahu , President Clinton overtly favored Peres .
Clinton also imposed heavily on Netanyahu during the Wye Plantation negotiations .
When the government fell as a result , he overtly favored Ehud Barak and even sent in his campaign team , including James Carville , to help .
After the second Intifada started in 2000 , first Bush , and then Clinton , imposed heavily on Israel to restrain its response until the casualties became so overwhelming that the Israeli government finally had no choice but to respond .
Even then , America prevented Israel from achieving an overwhelming victory .
However , the American relationship with Israel is more dangerous than most people even understand .
It was n’t Clinton , however , who initiated or imposed the Oslo process or Camp David negotiations on Israel .
And the current Bush president , despite his many faults , has maintained a relatively hands - off stance regarding Israeli action .
What should be a concern is not what a President Paul might do , but what an Israeli government does do now .
Since Oslo , governments of Israel , left and right , have adopted dangerous and even suicidal policies detrimental to the security and survival of the state .
The government then drafts America , often reluctantly , into supporting these policies , and imposes them on an unwilling public , claiming that if something goes wrong , America will protect Israel .
America basically gave Israel a free hand to wage the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006 .
Only when it became clear that victory , which should have been Israel ’s , was not going to be quick or decisive , did it step in with an imposed cease - fire .
I want to add parenthetically here that when all of Israel rallied around Olmert in support of the war in Lebanon , one lone dissenter had the courage to say that he was against the war , that the entire goal of the war was not victory , but to give legitimacy to Olmert ’s “ convergence ” plan ( as Olmert referred to withdrawal from the rest of the disputed territories ) .
His name is Moshe Feiglin .
That lone voice was the subject of universal condemnation .
Several days later , Olmert confirmed everything Mr. Feiglin said .
I mention him here because he is the Israeli equivalent of Ron Paul .
When the war ended in a stalemate ( that is , a loss for Israel ) a month later , people were astounded that the mighty Israeli army could n’t defeat a bunch of pipsqueak terrorists .
Everyone saw that America “ imposed ” a settlement , but few saw the big picture : that the government of Israel did as it did , knowing that America would step in and save the day .
In economic terms , this is called “ moral hazard . ”
It means making bad decisions assuming someone will protect you from the consequences of those decisions .
The people of Israel need to understand that they ca n’t assume America will be there always when needed , and with that due consideration , need to elect leaders they think will properly lead the country in its best interests .
This is a point made over and over again by Congressman Ron Paul .
Ron Paul would treat the state of Israel with the respect and honor it deserves .
It is up to the people of Israel to choose leaders who act honorably and respectfully .
If the people of Israel instead elect craven and corrupt leaders who sell out the country ’s interests , do they then have the right to expect America to save Israel from its own mistakes ?
As a practising Jew , I know better than to rely on flesh and blood .
As it says in the Book of Psalms ( 121:4 ) , “ The Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps . ”
To Ron Paul supporters in general :
Mishna Avot 2:6 says , “ In a place where there are no men , rise up and be a man . ”
If there is someone better qualified to accept the mantle of leadership , stand aside and let him do so .
But if not , if you are qualified , it is not just permissible , but obligatory for you to do so .
Dr. Paul did n’t seek this race .
He was reluctant .
He was skeptical .
He knew it would get ugly .
He knew about his skeletons .
Yet when his supporters drafted him , he assessed the situation and saw there was no one else , and rose up and accepted the challenge .
Is he the ideal candidate for the job ?
Maybe not .
Is he too old ?
Possibly .
Is there anyone better prepared to run ?
No .
After the stinging fifth ( but not last ) place finish in New Hampshire , and the wide dissemination of the embarrassing old newsletters , I thought it was time to call it quits .
Dr. Paul has decided to continue the fight .
He has learned from his mistakes and grown from them .
His performance in the South Carolina debate shows that .
No longer will he let the media steer him off to irrelevant and mocking lines of questioning .
I ’m sure next time he ’ll be prepared when they pull a stunt like turning off his earpiece to make him look foolish .
As he said , not at all amused , “ make fun buddy . ”
What should we do now ?
Stop the infighting and the blame for transgressions decades in the past .
Do n’t let the mainstream media dictate the terms of debate and discussion .
Do n’t get sidetracked by irrelevant issues .
Now is not the time to get wobbly in the knees .
Pray for success .
Be grateful for the candidate we have , a decent and honest , and yes , flawed man .
Rally behind him .
Support him in this endeavor .
Dr. Paul , “ Champion of the Constitution , ” I support you .

The bad news just keeps rolling in for Oregon Republicans .
According to Harry Esteve at The Oregonian , it now turns out that the state Republican Party is $ 264,000 in debt and has an IRS lien for failure to pay payroll taxes .
Party officials blame the payroll tax problem on an " irresponsible employee " who has since been fired .
But clearly the party 's money issues go beyond that .
The fact is that the party is not alone .
House and Senate Republicans have also had trouble raising money and are being far outpaced by the Democratic majority .
The GOP is also having trouble recruiting candidates , both for legislative and statewide office .
About the only bright spot for Republicans is that they now have a real shot at winning the 5th Congressional District since Rep.
Darlene Hooley , D - Ore. , announced her retirement this month .
I do n't know what the turnaround experts would recommend , but the Republicans clearly need some strong leadership that can mobilize the party .
Or I suppose they can wait and hope that the voters tire of one - party rule from the Democrats .

There is no mistaking the excitement on the four - year - old boy 's face as he swims alongside a beluga whale many times his size .
And the whale seems to be enjoying the company , too .
The boy , named Yang Yang , will ride his playmate bareback to entertain the crowds between the sailing events at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing .
Yang Yang , who has been swimming since he was one , was chosen to swim with the five - year - old whale by staff at Qingdao Polar Ocean World in China 's eastern Shandong Province .
Scroll down for more ...
They first appeared in public together during the country 's National Children 's Day in the summer and proved such a success that it was decided to make them an Olympic attraction .
The boy 's parents think he is one of the luckiest in China , but others might disagree , bearing in mind the country 's reputation for pushing young athletes to extremes .
Yang Yang is one of about 280 million children in China - representing about one - fifth of the child population of the world .

The whale 's wild peers , however , are an endangered species .
There are fewer than 80,000 beluga whales left in Arctic waters , with St Lawrence , Cook Inlet , and Alaskan belugas classified as endangered .
The recently completed Qingdao Polar Ocean World is home to more than 10,000 ornamental fish , as well as white whales and polar bears - and is one of the largest polar marine animal parks in the world .

In multiple media reports over the past two weeks , the US Army has professed its love for the penguin .
The Army eventually intends to move from a Windows - based infrastructure over to Linux for its new , roughly $ 200 bn weapons program .
But the Army has largely been prepping new Linux - friendly weapons , vehicles , and devices before the completion of a software network to connect them to its existing Windows - based infrastructure — or blithely , putting the chariot before the warhorse .
When the Army began development of its next - gen hardware ( dubbed Future Combat Systems , or FCS ) , they turned to Boeing and SAIC to develop the operating system rather than basing the software on its established Blue Force Tracking .
Blue Force is a Windows - based satellite tracking system designed by Boeing rival Northrop Grumman .
It was used in combat in Afghanistan in 2002 and later in Iraq .
Both the development of the FCS project and Blue Force are currently being funded at the same time .
In 2008 the Army budgeted $ 3.1 bn to the FCS program and $ 624 m for Blue Force Tracking .
And while it seems both systems are being embraced by the Army , Boeing 's OS and Blue Force may not share the sentiments with each other .
FCS is going Linux .
" Boeing and the Army said they chose not to use Microsoft 's proprietary software because they did n't want to be beholden to the company , " reports The Washington Post .
" Instead , they chose to develop a Linux - based operating system based on publicly available code . "
That potentially presents a major problem for the first brigade of Linux - based FCS vehicles expected to be introduced in 2015 .
Linux - based systems have a limited ability to communicate with Microsoft - based systems .
And interoperability issues are n't something you want to deal with in a war zone .
According to the US Army online pub , Defense News , they 'll first try to patch things up using Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
" Red Hat 5 will link Linux with Microsoft and allow FCS forces to link with other brigade combat teams , " an Army official told Defense News .
" This will be an interim solution because over the long haul , eventually all of the Army 's networks will be Linux - based . "
For a long - haul migration from Microsoft to Linux — the Army does n't seem to be so sure what it will do .
So they 're bringing some 70 programmers , engineers and other IT professionals to Washington to brainstorm in four " Battle Command " summits .
The first two summits were held in September and November , with two upcoming sessions in February and April .
According to Defense News , the Army says there has been " progress " in outlining time lines for the integration .
Works for us . ®

Australian scientists are trying to give kangaroo - style stomachs to cattle and sheep in a bid to cut the emission of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming , researchers say .
Thanks to special bacteria in their stomachs , kangaroo flatulence contains no methane and scientists want to transfer that bacteria to cattle and sheep who emit large quantities of the harmful gas .
While the usual image of greenhouse gas pollution is a billowing smokestack pushing out carbon dioxide , livestock passing wind contribute a surprisingly high percentage of total emissions in some countries .
" Fourteen per cent of emissions from all sources in Australia is from enteric methane from cattle and sheep , '' said Athol Klieve , a senior research scientist with the Queensland Government .
" And if you look at another country such as New Zealand , which has got a much higher agricultural base , they 're actually up around 50 per cent , '' he said .
Researchers say the bacteria also makes the digestive process much more efficient and could potentially save millions of dollars in feed costs for farmers .
" Not only would they not produce the methane , they would actually get something like 10 to 15 per cent more energy out of the feed they are eating , '' said Mr Klieve .
Even farmers who laugh at the idea of environmentally friendly kangaroo farts say that 's nothing to joke about , particularly given the devastating drought Australia is suffering .
" In a tight year like a drought situation , 15 per cent would be a considerable sum , '' said farmer Michael Mitton .
But it will take researchers at least three years to isolate the bacteria , before they can even start to develop a way of transferring it to cattle and sheep .
Another group of scientists , meanwhile , has suggested Australians should farm fewer cattle and sheep and just eat more kangaroos .
The idea is controversial , but about 20 per cent of health - conscious Australians are believed to eat the national symbol already .
" It 's low in fat , it 's got high protein levels it 's very clean in the sense that basically it's the ultimate free range animal , '' said Peter Ampt of the University of New South Wales 's institute of environmental studies .
" It does n't get drenched , it does n't get vaccinated , it utilises food right across the landscape , it moves around to where the food is good , so yes , it 's a good food . ''
It might take a while for kangaroos to become popular barbecue fare , but with concern over global warming growing in the world 's driest inhabited continent , Australians could soon be ready to try almost anything to cut emissions .

How To Win $ 1000 By Writing A Short Poem
The Phoenix memorandum , along with the disclosure this week that President Bush was warned in August of the possibility that Al Qaeda might be planning hijackings , have been seized on by lawmakers as evidence that the government missed signals of the coming attacks .
Spokesmen for F.B.I. headquarters in Washington , as well as for its field offices in New York and Oklahoma City , which investigated individual flight schools over the years , had no comment on the issue .
Lewis Schiliro , who retired two years ago as the bureau 's assistant director in charge of its New York office , said in an interview that his agents had tried to follow up on information about the flight schools whenever possible .
But he said that while the F.B.I. worried that Al Qaeda might hijack commercial planes , '' never once did we really focus on the use of a plane as a weapon ' ' and that it would have been '' very difficult to connect the dots . ''
The F.B.I. did not alert other federal agencies about many of the results of its flight school investigations .
The Phoenix memorandum , in fact , was sent to the Central Intelligence Agency only in recent weeks .
The bureau 's failure to alert other agencies is expected to be a focus of Congressional investigations into intelligence failures before Sept. 11 .
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , a prominent critic of the F.B.I. and a senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee , said in a statement today that ''it 's clear the intelligence community had information about terrorist threats and hijacking years before the F.B.I. agent in Phoenix sent his warning memo -- that makes it even more indefensible that the F.B.I. failed to deal with the Phoenix memo last summer . ''
Law enforcement officials acknowledged that the F.B.I. never ordered a comprehensive investigation of flight schools before Sept. 11 , even as individual F.B.I. offices were gathering compelling evidence about links between students trained at the schools and Al Qaeda .
In response to the uproar after the disclosure of the August warning to Mr. Bush , White House officials insisted that they had no serious evidence last summer that Al Qaeda was considering a suicide hijacking .
Existing home sales showed a slight increase in February aided by a record drop in prices .
Trapped in foreclosure More Videos Special Report
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A record plunge in prices of existing homes produced only a modest increase in sales in February , according to the latest reading on the battered housing market by an industry trade group released Monday .
The National Association of Realtors reported that sales by homeowners rose 2.9 % in February to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.03 million , up from January 's reading of 4.89 million .
It was the first month - over - month rise of the annualized pace since July .
" These are signs that housing 's problems are being addressed , but I would n't break out the champagne yet , " said Northern Trust chief economist Paul Kasriel .
" We still have a ways to go . "
Though February 's pace beat economists ' expectations , sales last month were still down 23.8 % from a year earlier .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com expected the report to show existing home sales slowed to an annual pace of 4.86 million .
The median price of a home sold during the month fell 8.2 % to $ 195,900 from $ 213,500 a year earlier - the largest year - over - year price drop on record .
Before the start of the current housing slump , it had been 11 years since prices declined , when compared with the same period a year earlier .
" That 's a huge drop in prices , which is how you move the merchandise , " said Kasriel .
Sale prices have now fallen 15 % from their peak in July 2006 , and are down 14 % from June 2007 , when the most recent steady downturn began .
That brings the median price of existing homes sold down to May 2004 levels .
The median price of a single - family home dropped significantly as well , falling 8.7 % to $ 193,900 .
That was the largest drop in prices since the trade group began tracking them in 1989 .
The report is a sign that the price environment is weaker than the Realtors ' most recent forecasts .
Though NAR chief economist Lawrence
Yun said in a release that a " notable gain " in existing home sales is not expected until the second half of 2008 , the Realtors '
March forecast called for only a 6.3 % decline in housing prices in the first quarter , compared to a year ago .
NAR also forecast a median price of $ 200,500 for the first quarter .
Given the current environment , March sales would need a very strong showing , both in median prices and the pace of sales , to reach the Realtors ' forecast .
And though the drop in existing home prices helped bolster the average sales pace , the numbers were mostly boosted by an 11.3 % rise in sales in the Northeast , which actually saw a 0.4 % rise in median price .
But even as the median home price fell 13.4 % in the western part of the nation , home sales still dropped 1.1 % in that region .
The report , however , showed encouraging news regarding housing inventories , as the excess supply of homes on the market fell in January .
The Realtors estimated that there were 4 million homes available for sale , which represents a nearly 9.6 - month supply .
That was down from the 10.2 - month supply in December .
" There is a huge oversupply on housing , so builders have been cutting back dramatically in production of new houses , " said Kasriel .
" That 's exactly what has to happen to bring supply and demand back into the balance . "
Solution is part of a larger problem .
But the downturn in home building has hammered the results of the nation 's largest builders and has taken its toll on the economy as well .
Employment in the construction sector fell by 30,000 jobs in February , according to the most recent ADP National Employment Report .
The sector has shown a decline in every month since August 2006 , and has lost a total of 236,000 jobs since then .
Furthermore , plummeting home prices affect homeowners ' wealth , leading to lower consumer spending .
Sinking home value could also send some mortgage borrowers into foreclosure .
" As house prices fall sharply , that can force more people into default , especially those who bought late in the cycle who owe more on their houses than their homes are worth , " noted Kasriel .
What the Attorney General effectively has admitted by his testimony is the Bush administration cannot investigate itself .
Since what has been so obvious for the past seven years is now the official position of the Bush administration 's Justice Department , I think there must now be an independent special prosecutor appointed and tasked with investigating the authorization and use of torture by the Bush administration .
Will the Democratic leadership in Congress rise to meet this latest slap in the face of America by the Bush administration ?
Dan Eggen writing in the Washington Post story observes :
Mukasey 's remarks were a direct rebuff to demands from many leading Democrats this week that the Justice Department open a criminal probe into the CIA 's use of waterboarding , an interrogation technique that simulates drowning in an attempt to force information from a prisoner .
The statements also appear to conflict with his testimony in the Senate last week , when Mukasey said on several occasions that a special U.S. attorney 's probe into the CIA 's destruction of videotapes could be expanded to include a probe of interrogation tactics shown on the tapes .
Mukasey sticking his middle finger up to the Democrats in Congress and saying anything , possibly lying under oath , to help the Bush administration squirm away from Congressional oversight .
According to CQ Politics , Mukasey also denied Conyer 's request for past legal opinions on waterboarding made by the Department of Justice .
CQ
Politics notes :
Mukasey ’s refusal could tee up another constitutional showdown over committee access to administration documents , depending on how far Conyers decides to push it .
Will Chairman Conyers and Speaker Pelosi roll over and let their tummies be scratched again by the Bush administration ?
Or will this time , the oversight bark become bite ?
So far , the Democratic - controlled House has been more or less toothless .
According to CQ Politics :
Mukasey said he would not give the committee the memoranda because they were classified .
After Conyers pointed out that the committee members have top secret security clearances , Mukasey said " the opinions relate to a past program that simply ca n’t be disclosed in that fashion . "
So another big ol ' fuck you to Conyers , Pelosi , the House Democrats , and the American people .
Will Conyers and Peloisi do something about it this time ?
Gore wo n't endorse , CNN says RAW STORY

He would be " the most prominent Democrat yet to take a side in the presidential election , but two sources close to Al Gore tell us not to expect the former vice president to endorse either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama any time during the primary season , " CNN 's Jessica Yellin reports .
Yesterday , The Washington Post said if Clinton or Obama won Gore 's endorsement , it would be the largest endorsement in the bag yet .
" But there 's is no sign that the environmental oracle is ready to plunge back into the gritty world of presidential politics , " the Post 's Dan Balz wrote about Gore .
Excerpts from Yellin 's post :
The sources say Gore talks with both Clinton and Obama , and is on good terms with both .
But with Sen. John Kerry and Bill Clinton both aligned to a candidate , Gore has a role to serve as the neutral elder statesman in the party .
If an agreement needs to be struck between Clinton and Obama down the road , Gore is in position to be the likely facilitator of that discussion .
Gore also will want to work closely with whoever wins the nomination to promote an environmental agenda .
As for two other major Democrats yet to endorse a candidate : sources close to both Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi say neither individuals have endorsement plans .
The intelligence came from an exotic variety of sources : there was the so - called Laptop of Death ; there was the Iranian commander who mysteriously disappeared in Turkey .
Also in the mix was video footage of a nuclear plant in central Iran and intercepts of Iranian telephone calls by the British listening station GCHQ .
But pivotal to the US investigation into Iran 's suspect nuclear weapons programme was the work of a little - known intelligence specialist , Thomas Fingar .
He was the principal author of an intelligence report published on Monday that concluded Iran , contrary to previous US claims , had halted its covert programme four years ago and had not restarted it .
Almost single - handedly he has stopped - or , at the very least , postponed - any US military action against Iran .
His report marks a decisive moment in the battle between American neoconservatives and Washington 's foreign policy and intelligence professionals - between ideologues and pragmatists .
It provided an unexpected victory for those opposed to the neocon plans for a military strike .
The report , the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , which represents the consensus of the 16 US intelligence agencies , gave President George Bush one of his most difficult weeks since taking office in January 2001 .
Fingar 's findings were met in many Washington offices occupied by foreign policy and intelligence professionals not only with relief but with rejoicing .
They had lost out in the run-up to the war in Iraq in 2003 , but they are winning this one .
A backlash is under way ; with the neocons being joined by even moderate foreign policy specialists who claim the report seriously underestimates the threat posed by Iran .
Senate Republicans are planning to call next week for a congressional commission to investigate the report .
Senator John Ensign , a Republican , said : " Iran is one of the greatest threats in the world today .
Getting the intelligence right is absolutely critical . "
Flynt Leverett , a former CIA analyst and former National Security Council adviser in the Bush administration , was among those celebrating this week , and praised Fingar and his colleagues .
" We seem to have lucked out and have individuals who resist back - channel politics and tell it how it is , " he said .
" That is what the CIA and other agencies are supposed to do . "
He continued that Fingar and one of his co-authors , Vann Van Diepen , national intelligence officer for weapons of mass destruction , had opposed the war in Iraq .
" They both felt the intelligence was misused in the run-up to the Iraq war .
The conservatives are now attacking them , saying they are taking their revenge , " Leverett said .
" It is not mutiny for intelligence officers to state their honest views . "
Fingar , Van Diepen and Kenneth Brill , a former US ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , were able to put out what they regard as an objective assessment because those occupying senior roles in the Bush administration had changed .
Paul Wolfowitz , John Bolton , Douglas Feith and Donald Rumsfeld have given way to those who oppose war with Iran , including Robert Gates , the defence secretary and former CIA director , and the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice .
Only the vice - president , Dick Cheney , remains to advocate military strikes against Iran .
Wolfowitz , out of work since resigning from the World Bank earlier this year , has been invited back into the administration by Rice as an adviser on WMD , but that is an act of pity for an old mentor , not a shift in power to the neocons .
Joseph Cirincione , author of Bomb Scare : The History and Future of Nuclear Weapons , also welcomed the report , saying : " What is happening is that foreign policy has swung back to the grown - ups .
We are watching the collapse of the Bush doctrine in real time .
The neoconservatives are howling because they know their influence is waning . "
The report is a disaster for Bush 's Iranian policy .
Although he still refuses to take the military option off the table , it is harder to give the order to go to war .
It also makes it harder for the US to persuade Russia and China to back tougher economic sanctions against Iran .
Bush and Cheney might have tried to block publication but feared it would leak , leading to damaging charges of cover - up and the manipulation of intelligence .
" It was not likely to stay classified for long , anyway , " Cheney told Politico , the Washington daily devoted to politics .
The " howling " of the neocons that Cirincione spoke about began within hours of the report 's publication .
Bolton , who remains close to Cheney , appeared on CNN complaining about the authors without naming them .
In the comment section of the Washington Post on Thursday he wrote : " Many involved in drafting and approving the NIE were not intelligence professionals but refugees from the state department . "
He accused the officials , who he said had held benign views of Iran 's nuclear intentions five or six years ago , of presenting these same policy biases as " intelligence judgements " .
The Wall Street Journal , the editorial pages of which have long been aligned with the neocon agenda , went straight on to the attack within a day of the report 's publication , expressing doubt in the officials and their conclusions .
It quoted an intelligence source describing Fingar , Van Diepen and Brill as having reputations as " hyper- partisan anti-Bush officials " .
Bush has said repeatedly that the US will not allow Iran to secure a nuclear weapons capability .
Air strikes were becoming an increasingly likely option , even though opposed by the US state department , the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies .
As of last spring , American deployments in the Gulf had been completed , ready should the order be given .
A European official close to the discussions , who is copied in to key memos relating to Iran , spoke in the summer as if an attack was a given .
He said that the war was containable only as long as the Iranians did not strike back .
Vincent Cannistraro , a former CIA head of counter - terrorism , said Bush had been building up the anti-Iran rhetoric to justify the military option : " There was a set of contingency plans updated over the last year and a half .
The intent was air strikes to destroy the nuclear programme to the extent that it could be done .
Is it possible to destroy 100 % underground nuclear facilities ?
No , it is not .
Could they set it back 10 years ?
Yes . "
Iran 's covert programme can be traced back to the mid-1980s when the country was at war with Iraq and fearful that the then Iraqi leader , Saddam Hussein , might secure a nuclear weapon .
The programme involved design , ballistic delivery systems and uranium enrichment ; the NIE concluded in 2005 that it was continuing .
In July that year US intelligence officials showed IAEA officials an alleged stolen Iranian laptop with thousands of pages relating to nuclear weapons experiments .
It was nicknamed the Laptop of Death - it is still not clear whether it was genuine
Fingar and his colleagues have gone back over the material and subjected it to a higher level of scrutiny .
They took the same data but reached different conclusions .
They also had some new material .
Cannistraro said everyone was pointing towards General Ali-Reza Asgari , a former deputy defence minister , who disappeared in Turkey in February .
But he insisted Asgari had been a long - term agent run by the West who has since been debriefed and given a new identity .
" It is not a single source , " said Cannistraro .
" It is multiple : technical , documents , electronic . "
Cheney , though his position is weakened by the NIE report , is due tomorrow to give a TV interview in which he will insist that the danger posed by Iran has not diminished .
He told Politico the cause for concern was Iran 's civilian development of highly enriched uranium , which would be relatively easy at a later date to switch to making a nuclear weapon .
Foreign policy pragmatists are pressing for the US to open direct talks with Iran .
This is unlikely , but what this week has meant is that Bush has lost one of the pretexts for launching a new war in the 13 months he has left in office .
Christopher Dawson grew up in Seattle , back in the days of pre-antitrust Microsoft , coffeeshops owned by something other than Starbucks , and really loud , inarticulate music .
He escaped to the right coast in the early 90's and received a degree in Information Systems from Johns Hopkins University .
While there , he began a career in health and educational information systems , with a focus on IT in public health .
This focus led him to several positions at Johns Hopkins , a couple - year stint in private industry , 5 years teaching high school math and technology , 2 years as the technology director for his local school district , and 2 years as Vice President of Business Development for WIzIQ , a virtual classroom and learning network provider .
Most recently , he has focused on writing , consulting , and advocacy around the smart use of technology in the classroom and education reform .
A liberal dose of freelance writing about technology for SMBs helps pay the bills and support his growing hobby farm / soapbox for sustainable living and agriculture .
He lives with his wife , five kids ( yes , 5 ) , 2 dogs , a flock of chickens , and a hateful cat in a small town in north - central Massachusetts .
Anatoly is vice - president of a campus atheist group that meets at Wilfrid Laurier University , a public school in Ontario , Canada .
The goal of the “ Laurier Freethought Alliance ” ( LFA ) is : “ to promote science , freedom of inquiry , skepticism , and a good life without the need for superstition or religious belief . ”
Sounds reasonable , no ?
For whatever reason , it has taken nine months for a school representative to get back to the leaders about the LFA becoming an “ officially recognized ” campus group .
Groups that are “ officially recognized ” get perks that include free meeting space , potential grant money for events and activities , etc .
The school ’s response to the request : “ No . ”
They ca n’t be an officially recognized campus group .
Why not ?
Here ’s the email from the school representative ( emphases mine ) :
While the Campus Clubs department understands the goals and visions of your organization , they are not compatible with the guidelines of what may be approved and incorporated into our department .
While the promotion of reason , science and freedom of inquiry are perfectly legitimate goals , what is most in question in regards to your club ’s vision is the promotion of “ a fulfilling life without religion and superstition “ .
While this university is indeed technically a secular institution , secular does not denote taking an active stance in opposition to the principles and status of religious beliefs and practices .
To be clear , this is not meant to say that the promotion of science and reason are illegitimate goals .
But due to the need to respect and tolerate the views of others , the Campus Clubs department is unable to approve a club of this nature at this time .
If you wish to adjust and rethink your club ’s application and vision , you may resubmit a revised proposal at any time .
You ’ve got to be &%* $ing kidding me .
This means that religious groups ( like Campus Crusade for Christ ) get recognition from the campus , but the atheist group will get none .
It also implies that religious groups are tolerant of each other while the atheist group is not .
( “ If you do n’t believe what we do , you ’re going to Hell for eternity ” is apparently the epitome of tolerance . )
Sounds like a clear case of discrimination against atheists .
Anatoly adds this :
We suggested both a revision and a meeting with them .
We ’ll see how this turns out but I wanted to let the freethought blogging community in on it and ask those who had previous experience founding freethought groups if they had any such problems and how they can be resolved .
I do n’t see what needs to be revised … but the bigger concern is just getting approved by the school .
Hopefully , this was just ignorance on the part of one school representative that can be quickly corrected .
If not , though , I ’m sure there are plenty of atheist lawyers who can offer Anatoly some good advice …
*** Update ***: Anatoly provides some more details here .

Senator John McCain has been in full spin mode over his surge in Iraq and lying about Iran 's involvement in the U.S. occupation , and on Monday 's Countdown , Keith Olbermann talks with IAVA 's < corrected >
Paul Rieckhoff about another whopper from the aging , war mongering GOP presidential candidate .
During a campaign appearance in California , Senator McCain made a bold statement about the War on Terror that would have undoubtedly driven the wingnuts blind with anger and rage had it been uttered by a Democrat :
Download Download
" For the first time I 've seen Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus in agreement .
And that is , the central battleground and the battle against al Qaeda is in Iraq today , and that 's what bin Laden is saying and that 's what General Petraeus is saying -- and that 's what I 'm saying . "
Senator McCain certainly got one thing right ; Osama bin Laden relishes the idea of the U.S. being bogged down in Iraq for the next hundred years and continuing to serve as a recruiting tool for al Qaeda .
The Bush - McCain surge is barely holding on by a thread and even in areas that were not part of the surge , such as Basra in the southern part of the country , where the president is expected to ask Britain to lead a NEW surge of troops in to quell a Shiite civil war that is raging out of control .
Dick Cheney was reported to have said : " So ? They Volunteered . "
Insects are a rich source of inspiration for engineers developing innovative new materials .
Many , including moths and butterflies , have anti-reflective eyes that enable them to see in low light .
Some have iridescent wings for camouflage and signalling , such as the wing covers of metallic - like beetles .
‘ We ’ve found for the first time ever that we can not only make the iridescent structures found in nature with conventional engineering , but we can also culture cells to make them for us , ’ said Professor Andrew Parker , zoologist at the Natural History Museum , and lead researcher .
‘ So rather than developing complicated and expensive engineering techniques , we can let nature do the hard work . ’
MARIETTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A judge Monday sentenced two women dubbed the " Barbie Bandits " and a teller who helped them rob the bank where he worked .
This photo of the so - called " Barbie Bandits " made the pair a hot topic of water cooler conversation last year .
Ashley Miller , convicted of theft and drug distribution , was sentenced to the maximum of 10 years .
She has to serve two years behind bars , with the remainder on probation .
She also has to pay at least $ 2,500 in restitution .
Her co-defendant , Heather Lyn Johnston , who pleaded guilty to robbery and drug use charges in August , was sentenced to 10 years probation with community service , a minimum $ 2,000 fine and $ 2,500 in restitution .
Benny Herman Allen III , who at the time of the February 27 , 2007 , robbery was a teller at the Bank of America in Acworth , Georgia , also was sentenced to the 10 - year maximum .
He 's required to serve five years behind bars and pay $ 2,500 in restitution .
Watch footage from court »
Miller and Johnston earned the " Barbie Bandits " nickname after police released bank video they said showed them laughing and joking behind fashionable sunglasses before handing a holdup note to the teller .
Investigators said Johnston and Miller , who worked as dancers at an Atlanta - area strip club , planned to split the $ 10,000 they stole with Allen , the teller who accepted their demand and handed over the money , and another defendant .
Herman met the young women through convicted felon Michael Darrell Chastang , who faces sentencing Tuesday for his role in the heist .
On March 2 , 2007 , Chastang , Miller and Johnston led police on a short car chase not far from the Six Flags Over Georgia theme park outside Atlanta and were apprehended .
According to arrest warrants , police found marijuana in the car and ecstasy pills on Miller .

“ We were dealing with acceptance and adaptation , and both had to do with the fact that we were not part of the moneyed elite , ” Mr. Kakugawa said .
Mr. Kakugawa , who spent seven years in and out of prison for drug offenses beginning in 1996 , said he pressured Mr. Obama into drinking beer .
But Mr. Obama did not smoke marijuana during the two years they spent time together even though it was readily available , he said , adding that he never knew Mr. Obama to have done cocaine .
“ As far as pot , booze or coke being a prevalent part of his life , I doubt it , ” Mr. Kakugawa said .
He had graduated , however , by the time Mr. Obama was in his junior and senior years , when he wrote that he most frequently used marijuana and cocaine “ when you could afford it . ”
Mr. Obama describes a scene during that period where , in the meat freezer of a deli , he watched someone named Micky  “ my potential initiator ”  pull out “ the needle and the tubing , ” apparently to shoot up heroin .
Alarmed , Mr. Obama wrote that he imagined how an air bubble could kill him .
Neither Mr. Kakugawa or the others interviewed for this article who knew Mr. Obama at Punahou recalled hearing that story from him .
During his freshman year at Occidental , Mr. Obama and his dormitory mates would congregate around a couch in the hallway of their floor while stereos blasted songs by bands like The Rolling Stones , Led Zeppelin , The B - 52’s and The Flying Lizards .
The conversations at Haines Hall revolved around such topics as the Soviet Union ’s invasion of Afghanistan that year , President Carter ’s proposed revival of draft registration and the energy crisis .
Mr. Obama displayed a deft but unobtrusive manner of debating .
“ When he talked , it was an E. F. Hutton moment : people listened , ” said John Boyer , who lived across the hall from Mr. Obama .
“ He would point out the negatives of a policy and its consequences and illuminate the complexities of an issue the way others could not . ”
He added , “ He has a great sense of humor and could defuse an argument . ”
Mr. Obama seemed interested in thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche , Sigmund Freud and Jean - Paul Sartre , whom he studied in a political thought class during his sophomore year .
The professor , Roger Boesche , remembers Mr. Obama as very serious and not shy about disagreeing .
Mr. Boesche also has memories of him at a popular eatery on campus .
“ He was always sitting there with students who were some of the most articulate and those concerned with issues like violence in Central America and having businesses divest from South Africa , ” he said .
“ These were the kids most concerned with issues of social justice and who took classes and books seriously . ”

There is something fundamentally sad about a bad restaurant , especially one where the people who toil there — from the overworked chef to the hapless waiter — are trying so hard .
Perhaps it provokes a realization of the failures we often make of our once - promising lives .
We all had potential once , but look where we are now .
And in many cases , it 's not for lack of trying .
Instead , we 're faced with the fact that our best may simply not be good enough .
These were the thoughts I had at the Thomas Street Bistro as a depressing blob of cream cheese , speckled with desiccated salmon and surrounded by six Ritz crackers , whispered to me about my own mortality .
The Thomas Street Bistro is less like a restaurant and more like the home of a friend who fancies himself a cook .
Six tables crowd into what would be the living room ; the newly painted walls are adorned with artwork that yearns to look Mediterranean and tries way too hard for a certain carefree joie de vivre .
Instead of a cosmopolitan French brasserie , the room reminded me of my great - aunt 's stifling parlor .
Mismatched china and paper napkins complete the picture of a dinner party gone wrong .
The Thomas Street Bistro offers six main courses , all of which come with the soup of the day , an appetizer plate , and dessert .
As one of the owners , a friendly Frenchman from Toulouse , explained the menu , I had further misgivings .
The spaghetti with chorizo ( $ 10.99 ) sounded like something you 'd eat in summer camp , the kitchen was out of the beef strips in red wine and orange juice ( $ 15.99 ) , and the " salmon fish " ( $ 15.99 ) just flat - out scared me .
So we chose the pineapple chicken ( $ 13.99 ) and the bistro 's signature dish , a Moroccan lamb and couscous tagine ( $ 19.99 ) .
After we ordered , the owner / chef ( who was also filling in as waiter that evening ) warned us that he was a bit behind and he hoped we were n't in a hurry because we were going to be there " a long time . "
He was n't kidding .
After an hour and a half , we 'd gotten through a decent lentil soup and grazed on a buttery tahini and some damp feta with fresh tomatoes .
And then our waiter brought out a " free appetizer " he described as follows : " It 's salmon , smoked , from Alaska .
With cream cheese .
Sorry . "
I 'm sure he was referring to the time it was taking to prepare our main courses , but to me his sorrow seemed to run deeper .
And though I could commiserate with the failure , I could n't get over the fact that on this cold night we had actually left our warm house , which was stocked with all sorts of tasty treats , and ventured into what was essentially a stranger 's home for a well - intentioned , but poorly cooked meal .
Caught between tears and laughter , I ate a Ritz cracker .
The entrées came , as I feared they would ( I was slipping into a delirious depression by this time ) .
My wife sawed away at her pineapple chicken to little avail , while I fixated on the one flaccid spear of asparagus sitting next to what she described as a " kind of salty " pile of white rice .
Meanwhile , my lamb and couscous tagine had the look of the Sahara to it and was correspondingly arid .
Despite a hint of complex spiciness in the couscous , the lamb itself was overcooked , tough , and tasting more of the refrigerator than the fertile fields .
We pushed the food around our plates , trying in vain to make it seem like we 'd eaten more than we had , before asking sheepishly for the rest to be boxed up .
Though dessert comes with every meal , when told it would take " some time " for it to be ready , we muttered apologies , paid the bill , and walked out into the rain .
Out on the street , I wondered :
Why did I feel so guilty , so demoralized ?
I think now it was the pathos of the place .
I go out to dinner to revel in the fleeting , golden , liminal moment when I am responsible for nothing more than appreciating the bounty of this world .
All this light and sound and flavor .
I love pretending , even just for a few hours , that it will never end .
The Thomas Street Bistro did not allow me that fantasy .
Instead , this meal reminded me of our very limited capacity for transcendence .
In the spirit of fair play ( and with a certain amount of trepidation ) , I revisited the Thomas Street Bistro a few days later for lunch .
Remembering how kind the owner seemed , how anxious to please , I committed myself to experiencing lunch with a completely open mind .
Unfortunately , this blind optimism was short - lived .
When I arrived , the place was dark and empty .
The soup of the day turned out to be a bowl of fresh iceberg lettuce , tomatoes , and avocados drowning in oil and vinegar .
And the entrée ( $ 7.99 ) , those beef strips that had n't been available before , consisted of gristly chunks of meat in a sweet but overly salty sauce .
I was about to describe the accompanying mushrooms and carrots as " good , " but then realized they were simply less bad — the whole meal had the feeling of an average meal in a school cafeteria .
I left , again sorry for the owner , who does seem to be a nice guy .
Something was different this afternoon , though .
An epiphany perhaps .
Life is far too transitory to eat bad food and feel depressed .
So I went for a walk , already looking forward to dinner .
NOTE : This is a review of a restaurant that just opened .
We 'll probably send a reviewer back after it's been open a while , as things often change in a new restaurant 's first months .
I am a geek .
I read science fiction and I watch anime .
While I ’m not remotely fluent , I can speak a few words of Klingon and Elvish , and I think it ’s totally cool that some people take the time to make their own chain mail .
I read Harry Potter , His Dark Materials , a number of Xanth novels , and both the Chronicles of Narnia and Lord of the Rings / The Hobbit .
I play Dungeons & Dragons and am a Dungeon Master .
I ’ve designed my own role - playing game using a ShadowRun - based system and have been role - playing since spring 1992 .
I would have played in junior high and high school , but everyone else was too cool for role - playing games .
I ’m 35 and still love playing with LEGO , ie LEGO scale modeling .
I buy my children Brio and Thomas the Tank Engine train track and bridge accessories so I can build bigger and taller interlocking bridges just to have them Godzilla - ed by my toddler son 30 seconds after he discovers them the next morning .
I ’m an electrical engineer working in the aerospace industry , and I ’ve worked in both tape storage and telecommunications .
I have a Master ’s degree in optics and communications and yet I do low - noise analog circuit design for a living .
I chose electrical engineering as an undergrad because it ’s close to one of my hobbies – quantum mechanics – but I can actually make a living as an electrical engineer .
In my better moments , I also try to be both a journalist and a speculative fiction author on the side .
I have , at last count , four science fiction novels percolating around in my head and presently no opportunity to write them .
Three of them are a trilogy , and I ’ve already mapped out the basic plot of all three novels .
And I have more short stories in my head , and on my hard drive , than I can count easily .
I ’m a blogger and I run one of the better , if presently a bit dated and poorly maintained , Bubblegum Crisis anime fansites on the web .
I also play sysadmin for both of my sites , my wife ’s Tupperware site , and Scholars & Rogues .
And in my primary school days , I was routinely ignored , mocked , verbally and physically abused by my peers , and despised .
I was smart , and I had the unmitigated gall to exercise my intellect .
I set the curve on 6 of 8 college prep biology exams my sophomore year of high school – and the teacher , who himself despised smart kids , had the audacity to post my name – and score – each time .
I attended a high school where , if you were smart , you were nothing .
Popularity came from sports and / or student government .
All else was crap , and not only did the students make you feel like shit if you were n’t an athlete , so did the teachers , the administrators , and the parents .
I only earned respect after six years of running track – and sucking at it bad enough that I only ever came in better than last twice , although one of those times resulted in a hairline fracture in my elbow .
Having the guts to stick it out with the good athletes for six years when many of the “ cool ” kids dropped out because it was too hard earned me the respect of people whose respect I actually craved .
But it took six years of sports to get it .
High grades would n’t have done it .
Playing my trumpet in the orchestra , band , or marching band would n’t have done it .
Only sports .
And my school was not the only one like this .
The world needs more people just like me .
But our schools , and our culture at large , ca n’t handle that fact .
Even now , when being a geek is supposedly cool , it ’s not .
Because geeks are different .
Geeks do n’t mind not conforming .
And our culture wants homogeneity , not non-conformists .
Just look at all the Wal * Marts .
The Home Depots .
The McDonalds .
The Toys - R - Us-es .
The Japanese have a saying – the nail that sticks up gets hammered down .
I have a saying too – the squeaky wheel gets the grease gun .
I am proud of who I am , even though my own culture despises me .
Even as my own culture cannot exist without me .
I am a geek .
Hear me squeak .

I have heard from someone I consider to be a very reliable source that during one of several visits to the post - Katrina disaster area in Mississippi , George W. Bush was ' drinking like a fish ' on Air Force One .
Supposedly the source was invited onto Air Force One by Bush and soon after entering the plane Bush promptly began drinking beer and offered the man one which he turned down .
The man ( who is a staunch republican ) spent a fairly long time on the plane talking with the president and he was somewhat appalled to see the president " drinking like a fish " in the middle of the ongoing crisis .
He said Bush kept on talking and talking ad nauseum while consuming several beers .
Finally the man had to interrupt the president telling him , " Sir I 'm sorry but I have work to do so I am going to have to leave " at which point they shook hands and he left .
Now I am not going to reveal my source as he already told me he would deny it if confronted with the accusations so I have no ' proof ' but I personally believe the story is true .

Scientology Abuses eBay's VeRO Program to Practice Religious , Price Discrimination
By the time Bill ( not his real name ) left the Church of Scientology a few years ago , he had amassed quite a collection of Scientology material — mostly books , tapes , e-meters .
But ex-members of Scientology ( especially staff members ) find themselves in a difficult spot in this regard when they leave Scientology : their books , tapes , and e-meters are only valued by Scientologists , who , quite inconveniently , are strongly discouraged ( read : disallowed ) from communicating with ex-members — as any ex-Scientologist will tell you .
Not surprisingly , he turned to eBay , where a Scientologist buyer can remain blissfully unaware that his seller is a declared suppressive person .
But every time he attempts to sell his e-meter on eBay , the listing is removed within hours by the Church of Scientology , which claims that the listing violates their intellectual property rights .
See screenshots of the auctions while they were up here [ update ; personal info redacted ] and here , and respective “ Invalid Item ” eBay pages here and here .
And it ’s not just Bill — I ’ve watched numerous e-meter listings from other sellers removed before they even receive a bid .
If you ’re uninitiated to eBay , you ’d probably think that for each of these removals , the Church of Scientology informs eBay of the violation of its rights , eBay considers the merits of their argument , and then only then does eBay yank the listing .
But that ’s not what happens at all .
Instead , eBay effectively deputizes Scientology , which logs into eBay and removes the listings itself .
The mechanism that permits the Church of Scientology ( and others ) such broad access and discretion is called the Verified Rights Owner ( “ VeRO “ ) Program .
Membership in VeRO is obtained simply by submitting a form to eBay explaining that you are an Intellectual Property rights holder .
It should come as little surprise that VeRO members routinely overreach , as the cost of challenging a listing removal is almost always prohibitive .
( See my paper on this subject here , and see the brave husband and wife exception to this rule here . )
The VeRO Program makes a great deal of sense for some types of listings — counterfeit Rolexes and Gucci handbags appear on eBay with such frequent regularity that those companies would be hard pressed to handle these trademark violations any other way .
But Bill ’s e-meters ( and the e-meters other ex-Scientologists have attempted to sell on eBay ) are not counterfeits and do not violate the Church of Scientology ’s trademarks , patents , or copyrights .
Some sellers have even included the serial number found at the bottom of each e-meter in their listings in order to authenticate them .
There is no source confusion , as every seller whose e-meters have been removed have made it clear that they took the photo of the e-meter , and that they are not affiliated with the Church of Scientology .
Patent law does n’t prevent the resale of patented items , and patent law barely covers e-meters anyway , the first having run out years ago and the 2000 patent only covering “ improvements ” on the “ Quantum ” e-meter .
And copyright law barely applies here — all of the listings I ’ve observed have been originally written , for one thing , and regardless , Scientology ( from what I can gather ) has only issued VeRO complaints under patent and trademark bases .
In short , the Church of Scientology is at least constructively aware that the e-meters being listed on eBay are authentic , and so have no basis under trademark — or under any other intellectual property basis , for removing these listings .
What ’s actually going on here is that Scientology is abusing eBay ’s VeRO program , knowingly alleging Intellectual Property violations that clearly do n’t exist , so that they can limit the secondary market for e-Meters , controlling both the price and who can get them .
It should n’t shock anyone that Scientology is trying to limit ( if not eliminate ) the secondary marketplace for e-meters , since they have a strong motivation to control the price on e-meters from their own production line ( they update to a newer more expensive model every few years ) , and a strong motivation to control to whom they ’re sold .
The economic motivation should be clear enough — Scientology does n’t want what few members it has being exposed to a secondary market because it would undermine their monopoly on a prohibitively expensive and infrequently purchased item .
Scientology ’s other motivation for wanting to be the only game in town is intrinsically cultish — it has long perpetuated the idea that e-meters should never be used outside of the auspices of the Church .
In other words , not only should Scientology be the sole sale source , but it should also be able to dictate every element of the post - sale environment — who can use it , how it can be used , etc .
If e-meters are being sold on eBay , it does n’t know the purchaser and ca n’t therefore control how and by whom it ’s used .
Indeed , the warning label at the bottom of each e-meter demonstrates the kind of control to which I ’m referring .
The need for a label came about after the FDA took offense at Scientology ’s claim that the e-meter retained medical benefits ; the court eventually agreed with the FDA and mandated a disclaimer , which has morphed from the original into the following :
By itself , this meter does nothing .
It is solely for the guide of Ministers of the Church in Confessionals and pastoral counseling .
The Electrometer is not medically or scientifically capable of improving the health or bodily function of anyone and is for religious use by students and Ministers of the Church of Scientology only .
( emphasis added )
But if the Church of Scientology has no real legal basis by which to remove eBay listings of e-meters , why would it assert , under penalty of perjury ( as it must do to use eBay ’s VeRO program ) , that it has “ good faith belief ” that the listing they are removing constitutes an infringement ?
It ’s a roll of the dice no doubt , but the odds are in its favor that Bill — like almost anyone else similarly situated — will not sue to have the listing restored , litigation being profoundly cost prohibitive , especially against the Scientology litigation machine , even where the item removed could have sold for up to $ 5,000 .
But Bill and the other similarly afflicted sellers are not without a legal basis for a complaint .
It ’s possible to argue that Scientology is engaging in price fixing , tortious interference with a contract , misrepresentation , perjury , unfair competition , discriminatory business practices , and religious discrimination , to name a few off the top of my head .
Scientology ’s intellectual property rights in its e-meter stop well short of being able to prevent a secondary market from existing , but eBay ’s VeRO program permits them to essentially do just that .
This is not a new development — it ’s been going on for nearly 8 years , as this Slashdot story shows .
But it ’s high time eBay did something about it .
We all have a vacuum cleaner story .
It might not be as dramatic as my friend Lisa Foote 's , whose family ferret was successfully removed from an Electrolux attachment by emergency greasing .
It might not be as heartwarmingly odd as my husband 's , whose best friend at the age of 4 was " Vac , " the second - hand Hoover he took everywhere with him – including the car .
But for most of us , the family vacuum cleaner was more than a major purchase ; it was a family fixture .
Repaired and re-repaired , it was rarely thrown away .
All that has changed , says John Huling , hero of three generations of my own family 's vacuum cleaner stories and an emblem of a dwindling breed – the vacuum repairman .
" The mentality of people has changed ....
It 's easier to go buy a vacuum cleaner than it is to take it to a repair shop , " laments Mr. Huling , who closed his doors last week after more than 50 years in the business of repairing vacuum cleaners .
He claims to have been edged out by multiple forces , including inaccessibility of parts , changes in manufacturing , and what he describes as today 's " throwaway " culture .
On a recent morning , he reminisced with me as he made his final sales and fixes .
Judging from the steady stream of patrons seeking last minute advice and wishing him well , I 'm not the only one feeling bereft .
" I 'm gonna be up the creek , " clucks a woman with a German accent , coddling an ancient Electrolux bearing an array of Huling 's repair stickers – evidence of a decades - long relationship .
" He does n't cheat you , " she says , elaborating on the number of times Huling stopped her from buying a new vacuum in favor of repair .
Huling nods matter - of - factly .
" I 've found it 's easier to just tell it like it is , and then you do n't have to wonder , ' What did I tell that person last week ?
Did I tell them they needed to buy a new one ?
The big companies want to sell you a new one ....
A guy in a shirt and tie shows you a nice , new $ 300 machine so you take out your ... credit card and pay for it . "
Huling , who never took credit cards , allowed customers caught without cash or check to pay him later .
" I only got stung once , for 12 bucks . "
He sighs as a woman comes in with a new machine .
Politely referring her elsewhere , he confides , " It 's a piece of junk , speaking technically ... that [ machine ] was made by the company that made the best vacuum cleaner that was ever made and then they switched to plastic . "
The way he utters the word leads me to ask about the evils of plastic .
His excited cadences take me back to childhood visits when – dislodging socks or Barbie clothes from a clogged hose – he'd counsel my mother on the need for careful attention .
" You ca n't fix half the new vacs , " he says .
" Everything 's plastic now , even the lever that releases the handle that you have to step on every day ....
They snap off .
By the time I order the parts and charge labor to repair it , you do n't want to do it .
I 'm just waiting for them to tell me they can't fix my car someday ! "

When the first motorized upright vacuum cleaner was patented by William Hoover in 1908 , each screw and bolt was replaceable , says Robert Kautzman , an Albertus , Penn. , historian and owner of the largest private vacuum cleaner collection in the US .
The original Hoover upright was made of wood and tin but closely resembles today 's uprights in design – including its fan motor and horsehair roller brush , he explains .
Advertised in magazines as a more sanitary , convenient cleaning mode than outdoor carpet beating , 300 Hoovers were sold the first year .
Within a decade , names such as Royal and Eureka had helped bump annual sales to 300,000 .
" This is all the more remarkable when you consider that only 10 percent of American households had electricity , " marvels Mr. Kautzman .
" There were no wall plugs either .
The cord had to be plugged into a light bulb socket . "
By the 1930s , he says , a significant reduction in the weight and cost of a machine made it more practical .
Though vacuums were " widespread " by the 1950s , he says , it was a significant purchase , motivating careful maintenance and repair .
By the late 1980s some manufacturers had reduced the machine to seven component plastic parts , says Kautzman , whose virtual museum – vachunter .com – displays his 1,500 machines , dating back as far as the crank models of the 1860s .
Plastics reduced costs for manufacturers but made the machines difficult to take apart , he says .
[ They ] work as well as the old ones and they 're cheaper .
[ But ] they 're not as durable and you can't repair them . "

Huling 's hunched shoulders straighten and his downtrodden expression lightens for a moment as he points out a favorite Electrolux in his dusty window : " That vac will be around long after we are .
It 's 30 years old .
Some of them along the corner here are 40 years old .
There 's no vac made today that 's going to be here 40 years from now . "
Motioning to his continually ringing phone , he says , " This lady 's calling me now because she can't get in during my hours . "
Huling says he can't compete with mall hours to accommodate today 's frantic schedules .
" I need to sit , " says the next in line – an elderly woman who perches on a stool in front of the counter .
She 's in search of a bag for her vacuum cleaner , whose model number she 's forgotten .
" Was the machine yellow ? " asks Huling .
Even before she answers in the affirmative , he has retrieved a special bag from a high shelf .
He refuses payment , and the woman sums up what this man has meant to her : " I could come down and say , ' This is my problem .
What do I do ? ' "
This is a question Huling , who has been fixing things ever since discovering his aptitude in an eighth grade " manual training " class , has been asking himself recently .
" Working with my hands ... that 's all I ever did , " he says .
" I could figure anything out . "
While attending Wentworth College in Boston , he worked for a watch hospital , but opened his own repair business in 1953 .
Huling 's wife , Theresa , has helped out in the shop during recent budget - cutting years .
She , and the seven children they raised a block away , are the reason behind his chosen profession : " I could name my hours ... so when the kids were growing up , if one of my sons was in a play , I could break for a couple of hours and go over . "
Now , he says , with a rueful smile , " My kids are all more loaded than I am .
But they also get up every morning at 6 o'clock and go to work , which I could never do . "
Though he does n't regret his career choice , he admits he 's envious of his children 's retirement plans .
His oldest son recently retired as a trombonist for the Washington National Symphony and the others work in what he describes as corporate settings .
He has known for a long time that he would n't be handing down the family business .
• • •
Before the morning is over , Huling offers advice to the mother of an asthmatic child and spends a good amount of time with a man who has inherited a vacuum from his mother .
Huling demonstrates how to remove the power brush wound around with shag carpeting .
This leads to a story about a customer whose son purposely sucked up his mother 's throw rug every time he was asked to vacuum .
A blizzard is reportedly blowing in , so Huling decides to close shop early .
I stall – not ready to face a future devoid of one man 's affection for the beauty of well - made machinery .
Before leaving the musty , memory - filled store , I ask what has been most satisfying for him : repairing machinery or helping people .
Without hesitation he answers , " The person that I fix things for usually appreciates it .
The machine does n't care whether it 's fixed or not .
A vac is a vac . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. death rate from cancer has continued a steady decline that began in the early 1990s but it will still kill a projected 565,650 Americans this year , the American Cancer Society said on Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The death rate from lung , colorectal , prostate , breast and other cancer types fell in 2005 , the most recent year for which figures were available , but not as much as in 2003 and 2004 , the group said .
The actual number of cancer deaths rose .
The cancer death rate for men has fallen by 18.4 percent since peaking in 1990 and for women has fallen by 10.5 percent since peaking in 1991 .
Cancer is the No. 2 cause of death in the United States , behind heart disease .
The declines are driven by improved treatment and screening methods as well as progress toward prevention such as declining smoking rates , according to American Cancer Society researcher Ahmedin Jemal , who helped write the report .
The society estimated there will be 1,437,180 new cancer cases -- 745,180 in men and 692,000 in women -- in 2008 in the United States , as well as 565,650 cancer deaths -- 294,120 among men and 271,530 among women .
It said 559,312 people died of cancer in 2005 , compared with 553,888 in 2004 .
The number of deaths rose even as the rate dropped because the U.S. population grew more than the death rate fell in 2005 .
“ The increase in the number of cancer deaths in 2005 after two years of historic declines should not obscure the fact that cancer death rates continue to drop , reflecting the enormous progress that has been made against cancer during the past 15 years , ” American Cancer Society Chief Executive Officer John Seffrin said in a statement .
An illustration of the slowing decline in the death rates can be seen in colorectal cancer .
The death rate from colorectal cancer fell by about 3 percent in 2005 from 2004 , after falling by 6 percent in 2004 from 2003 .
Declines in death rates for lung and prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women were also smaller in 2005 than in the prior two years .
Lung cancer cases are falling in men and appear to be leveling off in women after rising for decades , the group said .
The overall death rate in 2005 was 184 cancer deaths per 100,000 people .
The cancer death rate fell by about 1 percent in 2005 from 2004 after falling by about 2 percent in each of the previous two years , Jemal said .
Had the cancer death rates remained at the peak levels recorded in the early 1990s , an estimated 534,500 more Americans would have died since then , the group said .
" Easily Administrable " Human Rights Violations

You might think , if you did n't work in the music business , that famous artists stand to make mad cash from popular albums on iTunes and other digital storefronts .
Sadly , that 's not the case , and Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke has spent the last week calling out the labels for it .
He recently told BBC Radio 4 that " the big infrastructure of the music business has not addressed the way artists communicate directly with their fans .
In fact , they seem to basically get in the way .
Not only do they get in the way , but they take all the cash . "
Yorke said the same thing in a widely - quoted recent interview with David Byrne .
His advice to young artists in that piece was , " Do n't sign a huge record contract that strips you of all your digital rights , so that when you do sell something on iTunes you get absolutely zero .
That would be the first priority . "
He went on to say that selling the new album , In Rainbows , directly to fans made the band more money from digital distribution than " all the other Radiohead albums put together , forever . "
It 's a common complaint from artists .
" Weird Al " Yankovic noted on his web site last year that " I actually do get significantly more money from CD sales , as opposed to downloads , " though he seemed a bit puzzled about why this was the case .
" This is the one thing about my renegotiated record contract that never made much sense to me .
It costs the label NOTHING for somebody to download an album ( no manufacturing costs , shipping , or really any overhead of any kind ) and yet the artist ( me ) winds up making less from it .
Go figure . "
The labels do " go figure , " of course , and they 've spent decades coming up with figures that lower artists ' royalty percentages .
( If you want to get a general sense of how this works with physical distribution , the Future of Music Coalition has a nice explanation of many standard contract features and how they affect artists . )
Digital downloads should make many of the standard industry deductions irrelevant ( such as breakage and production costs ) , but the whole issue is complicated by the fact that many contracts did n't included any provisions for digital download sales when they were signed .
Radiohead 's Yorke complained in the Wired article that " EMI was n't giving us any money for digital sales .
All the contracts signed in a certain era have none of that stuff . "
Artists today are savvier about the need to protect their download royalties , but the rate of return is still quite low .
Such contractual agreements have taken on a special importance this holiday season as major - label CD sales tanked by 20 percent from the same time period in 2006 .
Such a sudden collapse may be indicative of a real tipping point to digital , and it means that artists who sign with record labels need to pay special attention to their downloadable royalties .
Services like TuneCore and CD Baby now make it possible to get music up on iTunes and other services for low fees , and artists can maintain all their rights .
The deals do n't cover marketing or recording costs , of course , but with computer equipment and home studios driving the cost of recording into the ground , more bands could find that it makes little sense these days to aspire to a major - label contract .
Of course , if you 're Radiohead , the built - in publicity makes a direct - to - fans model much easier than if you 're , say , the " Free As In Beer " out of Dayton , Ohio .
So how many copies did Yorke & Co. move with their experiment ?
Yorke is n't telling , though he does dismiss as absurd the 1.2 million album guesstimate that has been floating around .
And the band knows that it can't stay all - digital yet ; a CD release of In Rainbows is planned as well .
( Update : the disc came out on January 1 in the US . )
How to Read a Book June 24 , 2007
Roscoe , N.Y .
Back in my Junior
High days we were shown a short 60s - era film called something like How to Read a Book .
I do n't remember too much about it except at one point Little Johnny is reading a book in a library and comes across a word he does n't know .
Rather than walk over to the dictionary stand , he keeps reading .
But then the word pops up again and again , and he soon realizes that knowing the precise meaning of that word is crucial to his understanding of the text .
When Little Johnny finally consults the dictionary , he finds out his original guess was wrong and he now has to re-read several pages of the book .
What I recall most from that film is not the lesson that you should look up every word you do n't know , but that you need to make a judgment call on a word - by - word basis .
Sometimes you can guess and often you 'll be right .
But sometimes you need to look it up .
This conflict creates a tension between the dual dangers of interrupting your reading and not understanding your reading , and there is no single rule that applies in all cases .
It 's been about four decades since I saw that little movie , and in those years technology has made many activities easier than ever .
But reading books is not one of them .
Reading books has actually become much harder .
What 's worse , people are now trying to " enhance " the reading experience in ways that will actually make reading books even more difficult !
Reading a book requires a tranquil mind , yet it is not a passive activity .
Reading requires a certain amount of determination and concentration to stick with the text and not let your mind wander .
Minds tend to wander on their own , but what makes reading more difficult is the presence of distractions , and one of the byproducts of our technologies is a massive increase in distractions .
( The types of book I am talking about here include works of fiction and non-fiction such as history , biography , philosophy , sociology , etc. Certain books — books on juggling , playing the oboe , or programming , for example — require some kind of active participation that accompanies the reading .
This blog entry is not about those books .
Nor is it about reference books .
The books I 'm referring to here are the type that have traditionally been read sequentially in stretches of an hour or multiple hours without frequent interruptions . )
Here 's some advice for successfully reading a book :
You need to stay focused , so try to avoid distractions .
Avoid multitasking .
Avoid task switching .
Turn off the TV .
Shift positions occasionally so you do n't get cramps or backaches .
Do n't get too comfortable or you might fall asleep .
( Interestingly , many of these same rules apply to having sex , except that you can read a book with a cat in your lap . )
While reading , it helps to keep a small dictionary nearby if you think you 'll need it .
But stay away from the computer , even if your intent is just " to look up a little something in Google . "
Because as soon as your attention turns from the book to the computer , you 're no longer reading .
Now you 're browsing , and it's an entirely different activity .
From Google you go to Wikipedia , and then some link in the Wikipedia article , and since you 're at the computer anyway you might as well check your email , and your RSS aggregator , and eventually , perhaps , you go to Amazon , where you leave a review complaining that the book you bought is boring and " just did n't hold my attention . "
It is best to read a book not at the same desk as your computer , but in a different room entirely , and in a chair or couch without a Wi-Fi'ed notebook tucked underneath .
If you find yourself consulting the computer too much anyway , turn it off .
I mean it :
When reading most books , there is absolutely no reason to " check an article in Wikipedia " every page or two .
If while reading the book you come across things you want to look up later — for example , a bibliographic reference for an old book that you might want to check on abe.com — keep a pad and pen nearby , or use those wonderful Post - it flags that 3 M sells .
At the very least , you should try to give the author of the book a little bit of respect :
Writing books is much harder than reading them .
If it 's a good book you 're trying to read , the author has spent a lot of time arranging the material in the book into a coherent progression and logic .
Do n't interrupt the flow .
As for actually reading a book on the computer screen , I 'd recommend against it , particularly if what you really want to do is read the book .
Print the book out and take the pages into the next room to read .
Or you might want to consider buying one of those pre-printed copies that book publishers make available at a nominal cost .
I continue to be astounded that some people — intelligent people , well - meaning people , even people in the book - publishing industry — are actually proposing that we merge books and computers in various ways .
Obviously dealing with an electronic text gives you some advantages over a printed text :
You can perform searches , for example , or add " tags , " or get access to various levels of information .
But does it enhance actually reading the book in any way ?
Not that I can see :
Any real " value " that is added to a book ( such as hyperlinks ) actually takes you away from reading the book to doing something else !
Enhancing a book does n't add value .
It merely adds easier and more immediate distractions .
This week 's buzz in the publishing industry involves a demo at O'Reilly 's TOC Conference of a printed book that lets you obtain more information about certain words or concepts without leaving the book or the page .
It looks pretty cool — rather like electronic footnotes — and as far as it goes , it 's fine .
Such a book would have helped Little Johnny in that movie I saw 40 years ago .
But that 's not as far as this device will go .
The more information that 's added , the more the text is padded with extraneous fat .
And then someone will get the brilliant idea to add Wi-Fi to the thing , and now the book has become a browser and the actual text of the book has become secondary to the entire experience .
From the book you 'll even be able to link to an online game based on the book that the publisher has posted on their web site .
Why read when you can play ?
Book publishers are obviously perceiving a real problem : People are buying and reading fewer books .
The publishers suspect this problem results from not keeping up with current technology .
They believe that integrating books and computers in various ways will help solve that problem .
But the real problem is that people can no longer find sufficient undistracted time to read a book .
The contemporary barrage of distractions is too seductive , with the result that many people are out of practice reading books .
They 've simply lost the skill .
Everybody still reads , of course , but only in online chunks of 250 - 500 words .
It 's a lot of reading , but it 's nothing like reading a book .
I do n't know what the real solution is .
( I do n't know how to stop war or eliminate poverty either . )
But merging books and computers in various ways is not a solution .
It only makes the problem worse .
Books themselves do n't need enhancing .
Anybody ever hear that sometimes less is more ?
I wondered .
It was early 2000 then .
There were many places I would have rather been , frankly .
Over the preceding years I had learned slowly that John lied consistently ; I also had learned that he lied with purpose .
You will remember John for his other political ploys , for instance inventing with Drudge the rumor that Sidney Blumenthal beat his wife .
They lied in depositions , too , when Blumenthal hit them with a law suit .
It was during Project Arkansas that John first floated the story about the Black Love Child .
He told me the story one day when he called to chat .
Because he called so frequently and always had a story that he told me not to repeat I had begun to wonder about his motives .
John Fund is a member of that group of NeoCon pundits and pontificators who act like arrested 11 year olds .
But applying the rules of war to activities that are intended to promote peace is simply ugly and unworthy of any civilized individual .
I had known John for around twenty years at that point .
When you know someone well you learn to listen to the expressions on their face ; words can lie but people , very unintentionally , do tell us the truth despite themselves .
Soon after that very informal dinner John was chased under his desk at the Wall Street Journal by John McCain .
McCain had just suffered the defeat of the primary in South Carolina due to the rumor that he had a black love child .
John , not particularly original , recycles rumors .
John Fund was the political operative qua journalist who inserted the rumor where it would do the most good .
The rumor hit the mill just before the primary ; too late for McCain to respond , soon enough to work .
There are many ways to cheat ; the gig to write the book on elections was a consolation prize because John had been rejected for a job as Bush Speechwriter .
The mention of the book and the look on John 's face told me that there was an agenda ; this was not just a book .
Then , I did not understand .
With time all things change .
The book , “ Stealing Elections , ” was written as cover for plans already in motion .
When did those Diebold Machines have their software installed ?
Who wrote it ?
We really need a time line here .
When his book hit the market John was disappointed that it did not get more of the same kind of treatment that routinely is accorded to Ann Coulter 's vitriolic offerings .
But he was supposed to have finished it several years before , so what could he expect ?
Disinformation tools have deadlines .
Diebold Machines , purged lists , a book that positions election fraud as committed primarily by Democrats ;
When you put the means for stealing in place in advance it is no accident .
This corporate strategy , intended to cement the control of their markets so that America becomes one big company town , is theft on a scale that boggles the mind .
The means for stealing elections have multiplied over the years .
No new technology is left unplumbed for its possibilities for ensuring the corporations their continued stream of income .
John and his cadre of pundits and media personalities , for instance Sean Hannity , simulate popular opinion .
Their think tanks , like Cato , are to persuade us to accept their ideas .
They are paid a lot , so they must know , right ?
When the Rockefellers were stealing elections in NY using the old machines it was just business as usual .
To control the legislation and policy of government you must control who takes office .
Therefore , if you have the money you find all the means for doing just that .
In the years since Rockefeller laid out the game plan by which corporations have colluded with government to nail Americans in place as ' consumers ' without real choices , forced to subsidize the costs for developing technology that is then handed over to those same corporations , some things have changed .
Now , there are ever more ways that elections and the ballot can be manipulated .
Last year an old friend of mine , Gene Rose , a journalist for 30 years , who had always voted Democrat found he had been purged when he tried to vote in the primary .
He had never missed voting until that day .
That same year Mrs. Marilyn Blankenship found that her Diebold Machine in Texas refused to leave the X next to the Libertarian candidate she wanted to receive her vote .
It magically flew over to the sleazy Republican .
Through the 90s the same NeoCons found that it was wise to eliminate that awkward possibility that a candidate that was not on ' their team ' would win by beginning before the primary to make sure that both candidates were acceptable to them .
Primaries are cheaper to fund .

In the comments of my How to Get More Bookmarks and Better Links article Lucy Dee asks :
I ’m having difficult assessing how “ bookmarkable ” content is any different from authority content in general .
Yes , bookmarkable content is “ optimized ” and you want to “ get a second look ” but that ’s not far off from pillar content that a good blogger would write otherwise .
I guess what I ’m missing is , what * distinction * to make it “ bookmarkable ” ?
Or is there one at all ?
It ’s a great question .
How do you separate “ Authority Content ” from “ Bookmarkable Content ” ?
Further to that , another question I was asked lately us what is the difference between “ Pillar Content ” and “ Flagship Content ” .
First we need to define “ Bookmarkable ” versus “ Authority ” .
Authority , Bookmarks and Bait
There is no versus , actually .
You can have either , both or neither .
Authority content provides value for the reader in a way that builds the profile of the author , but it is not a given that they will gather bookmarks .
Think of Seth Godin , he posts small , thoughtful articles usually .
You can read and understand those posts very quickly and do not really ever need to return to them .
Over time a blog that consistently puts out such information will grow links steadily , and it will grow a loyal following , but they might not get the big landslide of links that a Flagship article might .
You get the love but not necessarily the links and bookmarks .
Along the same lines I could post an article here that is funny , sexy , provocative or offbeat and entertain so much I get a ton of links and bookmarks , but my authority needle will not have shifted a millimeter from where it was before .
Diggbait will get you a spike in traffic but not improve your brand or create loyal visitors .
Certain types controversial linkbait can get you a ton of links but damage your reputation .
Pillars and Flagships
Now the difference between Pillar Content and Flagship Content .
Pillar Content is a phrase coined by Yaro Starak who describes it as :
A pillar article is usually a tutorial style article aimed to teach your audience something .
Generally they are longer than 500 words and have lots of very practical tips or advice .
This article you are currently reading could be considered a pillar article since it is very practical and a good “ how - to ” lesson .
This style of article has long term appeal , stays current ( it is n’t news or time dependent ) and offers real value and insight .
The more pillars you have on your blog the better .
Again , an article can be both Pillar and Flagship , and that is where the confusion lies , as it is not exactly clear what the difference is .
The way I would put it is to picture Pillar Content as being the foundation of your blog .
The pillars support the structure .
If you launch with a good , strong foundation , everything you build on top of it will also be strengthened .
If you are launching a blog about a breed of dogs then you might want to have pillar articles about where to find your puppy , the first few days of dog ownership , training and obedience , feeding , insurance , etc .
All good , valuable , useful stuff which over time will contribute greatly to your authority .
Yes , if you follow my optimization tips from my previous post you will be able to make it bookmarkable too !
Flagship Content takes the concept a notch further .
As well as being valuable , it builds its own momentum and delivers targeted visitors back to you .
It works as an ambassador for your blog and for your brand .
Flagship Content is content that represents you in the most positive light .
It ’s an authority builder .
When I think of Yaro now I often think of his Blog Profits Blue Print ebook .
I ’m sure there are those among you who originally found me through my free Killer Flagship Content ebook .
Brian ’s example would be his Copywriting 101 series .
If you are a keen digital photographer I have no doubt you have read David ’s Strobist Lighting 101 .
Viral versus Flagship
Someone asked me if I thought the DoshDosh Technorati Favorites campaign was Flagship Content .
While I am sure this did contribute greatly to the massive momentum and success of Makis blog , I think the exchange is viral rather than Flagship .
It certainly had the effect of adding authority in the respect of “ social proof ” ( getting into the top favorites places the blog amongst the a - list no matter how sneakily achieved , heh ) but it did not directly improve the brand .
Maki ’s content builds the brand , the favorites exchange created the momentum and awareness .
In fact , proving Yaro ’s concept , you could say Maki ’s blog is stuffed full of pillar content , you just need to look at the blogs sidebar to see that .
The Content Value Ladder
So in my mind there is :
Filler content –
The me - too stuff that many blogs copy and paste from press releases and other blogs .
Good , original content – Anything that delivers on the blogs promise in an original and valuable way Authority building content – Content that positions the blogger as an authority in the niche Pillar content – A blogs solid foundation of resource posts and tutorials Flagship content – Articles and reports that go above and beyond , creating significant value in a way that draws in readers for years to come
Conclusion
Could I be wrong ?
Certainly , I ca n’t speak for Yaro !
You have to make up your own mind , but that is never a bad thing .
The point is not the definitions but the intentions .
How can you consistently create the most compelling , remarkable and viral content that provides significant reader value and builds your brand ?
If you can answer that it wo n’t matter what you call it 🙂
Last week , we found out that Apple had decreased its iPod and iPhone orders , a move which analysts suggested was due to an expectation of lower demand for those products in the coming months .
Many people thought that the recent production cuts were it , but it appears Apple is bracing itself for an even worse spring .
According to MacRumors , FBR Research analyst Craig Berger is reporting that Apple has made further production cuts , this time including notebooks .
Previously , Berger believed that Apple was forecasting a 50 percent decline in iPod and iPhone sales this quarter , but the company now seems to be predicting a 60 percent drop .
As a result , iPhone and iPod orders are being cut , particularly orders for the iPod touch .
The production cuts have finally reached the MacBook as well , as Apple has reportedly cut orders of the laptops due to internal forecasts of a 50 percent sales decrease .
These further production cuts do n't bode well for the current quarter .
There is another possibility , though : perhaps the production cuts are due to new products , such as the larger iPhones and iPod touches and the MacBook Air .
We 'll have to wait for some further production and / or sales numbers to determine what effect the new products are having .
But even with the new product introduction , Apple probably wo n't have a rosy March quarter .

あたりを見てちょうだい。
特に、会場に は 「テンプレートって知らなーい」って人が2,3人いたのでテンプレートについてちゃんと説明したかったのですが、いかんせん時間が足りなすぎでした。テンプレートをまじめに語ると本が一冊書けてしまうので、端折りました。当然、ここでも端折ります。
上述のリンク先とかを見るか、テンプレートをまじめに語った本を一冊読んでくだせえ。
とりあえず、おいらのFizzBuzzコードwithC++テンプレートを読むに当たって、次の点だけでもおさえておくと理解が早く進むかも。
操作すべき対象は型（クラス,構造体etc...）であり、クラス（構造体）テンプレートは関数である たとえば、f( x , y ) =G( P( x ) , Q(y ) ) な関数は次のように書けます。 template < class X , class Y > struct F { typedef Q<Y > q ; typedef typename G < P < X > , q >:: ev ev ; } ; ev*1というtypedefされたメンバ型があるけど、これを参照するとテンプレートがインスタンス化されます。このテンプレートのインスタンス化は即ち関数Fの評価に相当し、インスタンスが評価値となります。テンプレートは実際に使うまでインスタンス化されないので、evを参照するタイミングを適切に設定すると、遅延評価もできます。 部分特殊化( partial specialize ) を使うと分岐が書ける 部分特殊化とはなんぞやという解説はしません。とりあえず次のコードを見てください。 template < class C , class E1 , class E2 > struct IF { typedef typename E1 :: ev ev ; } ; template < class E1 , class E2 > struct IF < FALSE , E1 , E2 > { typedef typename E2 :: ev ev ; } ; この定義に対し 、 IF < foo , T1, T2 >:: ev としたとき 、fooがFALSE 以外だとT1の評価値が、FALSEだとT2の評価値がIF
の評価値になるのね。これはまさに分岐。実際の実装にはもうワンクッションの工夫が必要だけど、とりあえずそれは実コードを見てもらえればいいです。
さて、C++はオブジェクト指向言語ですが、ここでやっていることは関数プログラミングです。Lispとかでのプログラミング経験があるとかなり有利！
ついでに言うと、C++テンプレートはチューリング完全であることが分かっているので、理論上は全てのアルゴリズムが計算可能なのです*2。
さて、これを踏まえてFizzBuzzをやります。
Asks for ' Precinct - by - Precinct Reconciliation ' of Poll Rosters to Begin Accurately Accounting for Tens of Thousands of Non-Partisan Voters Who Cast Machine - Unreadable Ballots
Brad Friedman Byon 2/18/2008 , 6:18 pm PT
California Sec. of State Debra Bowen wants Los Angeles County 's acting Registrar of Voters , Dean Logan , to check the poll rosters of thousands of precincts in order to help accurately count tens of thousands of currently uncounted ballots cast in the Super Tuesday Democratic Primary .
As The BRAD BLOG pointed out last week , tens of thousands of currently uncounted ballots cast by Non-Partisan voters who chose to cross over and vote in the Democratic Primary , but who failed to ink in a second bubble meant to instruct voting machines to count the ballots as Democratic votes , can be counted accurately , as per the voters ' intent , if Logan bothers to check those poll rosters .
Bowen , who sent a 3 - page letter [ PDF ] to Logan after our article pointed out that he was simply wrong , in his own report [ PDF ] to the County Supervisors , when he claimed that it was " impossible " to determine the intent of the voters on those ballots .
It 's not , and Bowen clearly seems to understand that , as evidenced by both her letter to Logan and comments she made last Friday on Northern California National Public Radio affiliate KQED , where she said she was " shocked " to hear that the debacle had happened in several elections previously ...
Bowen said Friday that she was " shocked " to hear that L.A. County 's " Double Bubble " ballot had been used before , and , as we confirmed in an earlier report today , which showed that the county 's former Registrar of Voters , Conny McCormack , who designed the ballot , failed to do anything to correct the problem , despite uncounted Non-Partisan ballots rates of some 40 % in previous elections .
" No one could have predicted this , " McCormack told the LA Times today , in her best imitation of Condoleeza Rice , despite the fact that the problem was perfectly predictable .
The paper also indicated today that officials at the Registrar 's office knew of the problem months ago , well before McCormack abruptly vacated her post , just over a month before Election Day .
" I certainly was n't aware of this , " the Secretary commented on KQED 's Forum program last week .
" The ballot design is done down at the county level , " she said , adding " I was shocked to hear it , frankly . "
She concurred with us , however , that most of the county 's thousands of currently uncounted ballots can be counted , and counted accurately .
" A visual inspection of these ballots , alone , will not tell us which primary and which candidate the voter intended to cast a ballot in , " Bowen correctly pointed out on Northern California 's National Public Radio affiliate station on Friday .
We had made the same point earlier in the week , while explaining that the dearly departed McCormack 's insane ballot design specified use of the same line of bubbles for recording votes in both the Democratic and American Independent Party Primaries on Non-Partisan ( NP ) ballots given to voters who were registered as Decline - to - State ( DTS ) .
An examination of the precinct poll rosters , however , will likely offer the information needed to count virtually every ballot 100 % accurately to the voter 's intent .
Bowen concurs .
" I 've asked Los Angeles County to do a precinct - by - precinct reconciliation of the roster that is used when voters sign in , " Bowen told KQED , following up with an example of how the procedure might work once the poll rosters are examined .
Poll workers had been directed to cross out NP and write - in either DEM or AI next to the voters ' names when they asked to vote in one of the open primaries .
" Let 's say that there are five Decline - to - State voters in a particular precinct , and they all asked for Democratic Party ballots " Bowen explained , " This would not be surprising .
I do n't think we had a lot of people requesting American Independent Party ballots .
If that happens , and in that same precinct you find the five Decline - to - State voters did not fill in the bubble [ specifying which party 's primary the ballot should be counted in ] , it is then safe to assume that they all intended to vote in the Democratic Primary because you did n't have anyone request an American Independent Party ballot in that precinct . "
" I think if Los Angeles County does that , " she continued , echoing the point we 've been trying to make noise about since last week , " they may well be able to count many of these otherwise uncountable ballots . "
But what of those precincts where there were Non-Partisan voters who chose to cross over and vote in the AI Primary ?
Though Bowen agrees with us , that the number of such ballots is likely incredibly small , she also points out an important provision of the California Election Code in her letter to Logan .
She writes that " Elections Code section 15154 ( c ) does not permit the acceptance of a ballot in which the choice of the voter is impossible to determine , " before quoting , as Logan did in his report to the County Supervisors , from the sub-section of that provision :
If for any reason the choice of the voter is impossible to determine , the vote for that office shall not be counted
In almost every case , however , if the poll books are examined , it will not be impossible to determine the choice of the voter .
Last week we pointed out several options which are available for counting the vast majority of the currently uncounted ballots accurately .
In the case of precincts where there are no NP - AI voters specified in the poll roster , all NP ballots without a Dem or AI bubble filled in , but with a Presidential choice on them , can safely be presumed to be votes in the Democratic Primary , as Bowen confirmed .
They can , and should , be counted immediately .
Where there may be one NP - AI voter or more recorded having voted at the precinct , but fewer correctly - bubbled NP - AI ballots , we had offered two different options last week which would have counted almost every single ballot accurately , while vastly reducing the current miscount rate ( all of the currently uncounted votes have been miscounted as " undervotes , " as of now , even though they were not undervotes ) to almost 0 % .
The first option was to simply count all such ballots as Democratic Primary votes , given the low number of NP - AI crossover voters over all .
Though there would be a small error -rate with such a method , the electronic machines used to count ballots in L.A. County and elsewhere , routinely have an " acceptable " error - rate that is already as high or higher .
The other option was to count them all as Democratic ballots , but then reduce each candidate 's tally by a mathematically statistical proportion based on the number of NP - AI cross -over voters at the particular precinct .
However , given the law quoted by both Logan and Bowen , pointing out that " if for any reason the choice of the voter is impossible to determine , the vote for that office shall not be counted , " we 'll give the benefit of the doubt , and point you instead to a far simpler , and fail - proof suggestion sent to us by a BRAD BLOG reader just after we 'd posted our article last week .
Her suggestion assures that every vote counted will be known to have been 100 % accurately counted , beyond a shadow of any legitimate doubt :
You may have thought of this , but to count the votes in precincts where there are AI crossovers , you simply take the count for the democratic candidates and reduce EACH candidate 's vote count by the number of AI voters .
That will ensure that no AI vote goes to a Democrat .
Sure enough , though that plan would lead to a minuscule handful of potentially uncounted Democratic votes , the plan would otherwise work , and should be instituted , without delay , by acting Registrar Logan .
Particularly as the deadline for final certification of results at the county level is quickly arriving .
Results must be certified locally , and then sent to the SoS within 28 days of the election held on February 5th .
One last point worth reiterating , with all of the above in mind ...
Article II of California 's state constitution has a new provision added overwhelmingly by the voters via Proposition 43 , on March 5 , 2002 , in response to the Presidential Election debacle in Florida .
The line added to the constitution by voters states clearly : " A voter who casts a vote in an election in accordance with the laws of this State shall have that vote counted . "
No " laws of this state " were violated when voters failed to fill in the " Double Bubble " on those Non-Partisan ballots , as per the confusing and ridiculous scheme ( not a law , or part of the state Election Code ) courtesy of the Los Angeles County Registrar .
Furthermore , California 's Election Code , Section 19001 , states that all code requirements " shall be liberally construed so that the real will of the electors will not be defeated by any informality or failure to comply with all of the provisions of the law . "
So Mr. Logan , enough excuses .
It 's time to count the damned votes .
All 100,000 of them , if that 's what needs to be done to ensure the voices of Los Angeles County voters are heard .
What say we put the voters first for a change ?

Confusion Reigns , Legal Challenges Loom as Hundreds of Thousands Votes May Not be Counted Due to Maddeningly Confusing Ballot Design , Procedures
The US sub - prime mortgage crisis has led to plunging property prices , a slowdown in the US economy , and billions in losses by banks .
It stems from a fundamental change in the way mortgages are funded .
Traditionally , banks have financed their mortgage lending through the deposits they receive from their customers .
This has limited the amount of mortgage lending they could do .
In recent years , banks have moved to a new model where they sell on the mortgages to the bond markets .
This has made it much easier to fund additional borrowing , But it has also led to abuses as banks no longer have the incentive to check carefully the mortgages they issue .
THE RISE OF THE MORTGAGE BOND MARKET
In the past five years , the private sector has dramatically expanded its role in the mortgage bond market , which had previously been dominated by government - sponsored agencies like Freddie Mac .
They specialised in new types of mortgages , such as sub - prime lending to borrowers with poor credit histories and weak documentation of income , who were shunned by the " prime " lenders like Freddie Mac .
They also included " jumbo " mortgages for properties over Freddie Mac's $ 417,000 ( £ 202,000 ) mortgage limit .
The business proved extremely profitable for the banks , which earned a fee for each mortgage they sold on .
They urged mortgage brokers to sell more and more of these mortgages .
Now the mortgage bond market is worth $ 6 trillion , and is the largest single part of the whole $ 27 trillion US bond market , bigger even than Treasury bonds .
HOW SUB - PRIME LENDING AFFECTED ONE CITY THE SUB - PRIME CRISIS IN CLEVELAND Sub - prime lending Black areas Foreclosures ( repossessions ) Deutsche Bank properties
For many years , Cleveland was the sub - prime capital of America .
It was a poor , working class city , hit hard by the decline of manufacturing and sharply divided along racial lines .
Mortgage brokers focused their efforts by selling sub - prime mortgages in working class black areas where many people had achieved home ownership .
They told them that they could get cash by refinancing their homes , but often neglected to properly explain that the new sub - prime mortgages would " reset " after 2 years at double the interest rate .
The result was a wave of repossessions that blighted neighbourhoods across the city and the inner suburbs .
By late 2007 , one in ten homes in Cleveland had been repossessed and Deutsche Bank Trust , acting on behalf of bondholders , was the largest property owner in the city .
THE CRISIS GOES NATIONWIDE Sub - prime lending had spread from inner-city areas right across America by 2005 .
By then , one in five mortgages were sub - prime , and they were particularly popular among recent immigrants trying to buy a home for the first time in the " hot " housing markets of Southern California , Arizona , Nevada , and the suburbs of Washington , DC and New York City .
House prices were high , and it was difficult to become an owner - occupier without moving to the very edge of the metropolitan area .
But these mortgages had a much higher rate of repossession than conventional mortgages because they were adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) .
The payments were fixed for two years , and then became both higher and dependent on the level of Fed intereset rates , which also rose substantially .
Consequently , a wave of repossessions is sweeping America as many of these mortgages reset to higher rates in the next two years .
And it is likely that as many as two million families will be evicted from their homes as their cases make their way through the courts .
The Bush administration is pushing the industry to renegotiate rather than repossess where possible , but mortgage companies are being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of cases .
THE HOUSING PRICE CRASH
The wave of repossessions is having a dramatic effect on house prices , reversing the housing boom of the last few years and causing the first national decline in house prices since the 1930s .
There is a glut of four million unsold homes that is depressing prices , as builders have also been forced to lower prices to get rid of unsold properties .
And house prices , which are currently declining at an annual rate of 4.5 % , are expected to fall by at least 10 % by next year - and more in areas like California and Florida which had the biggest boom .
HOUSING AND THE ECONOMY
The property crash is also affecting the broader economy , with the building industry expected to cut its output by half , with the loss of between one and two million jobs .
Many smaller builders will go out of business , and the larger firms are all suffering huge losses .
The building industry makes up 15 % of the US economy , but a slowdown in the property market also hits many other industries , for instance makers of durable goods , such as washing machines , and DIY stores , such as Home Depot .
Economists expect the US economy to slow in the last three months of 2007 to an annual rate of 1 % to 1.5 % , compared with growth of 3.9 % now .
But no one is sure how long the slowdown will last .
Many US consumers have spent beyond their current income by borrowing on credit , and the fall in the value of their homes may make them reluctant to continue this pattern in the future .
CREDIT CRUNCH
One reason the economic slowdown could get worse is that banks and other lenders are cutting back on how much credit they will make available .
They are rejecting more people who apply for credit cards , insisting on bigger deposits for house purchase , and looking more closely at applications for personal loans .
The mortgage market has been particularly badly affected , with individuals finding it very difficult to get non-traditional mortgages , both sub- prime and " jumbo " ( over the limit guaranteed by government - sponsored agencies ) .
The banks have been forced to do this by the drying up of the wholesale bond markets and by the effect of the crisis on their own balance sheets .
BANK LOSSES
The banking industry is facing huge losses as a result of the sub - prime crisis .
Already banks have announced $ 60 bn worth of losses as many of the mortgage bonds backed by sub - prime mortgages have fallen in value .
The losses could be much greater , as many banks have concealed their holdings of sub - prime mortgages in exotic , off - balance sheet instruments such as " structured investment vehicles " or SIVs .
Although the banks say they do not own these SIVs , and therefore are not liable for their losses , they may be forced to cover any bad debts that they accrue .
BOND MARKET COLLAPSE
Also suffering huge losses are the bondholders , such as pension funds , who bought sub - prime mortgage bonds .
These have fallen sharply in value in the last few months , and are now worth between 20 % and 40 % of their original value for most asset classes , even those considered safe by the ratings agencies .
If the banks are forced to reveal their losses based on current prices , they will be even bigger .
It is estimated that ultimately losses suffered by financial institutions could be between $ 220bn and $ 450bn , as the $ 1 trillion in sub - prime mortgage bonds is revalued .

query regarding the uncountability of irrationals
I was discussing infinity with one of my students , and introduced him to the idea of countability as a way of thinking about the size of sets .
We start with set of natural numbers , { 1 , 2 , 3 , ...}.
We can then ask the basic question : " Are there more natural numbers than even numbers ? "
In our normal way of looking at finite sets , it is obvious that there are more natural numbers , since all of the even numbers are contained in the natural numbers .
However , the mathematical notion of countability says that there are actually the SAME number of even numbers as natural numbers , because we can arrange a one - to - one pairing , where 1--> 2 , 2--> 4 , 3--> 6 , etc .
For each even number , there is a natural number , and vice versa .
Therefore , the size of the sets is the same .
( For those of you with problems with this definition , I think it 's fair to say that this mathematical notion of " equal sizes " is useful for certain purposes ; you may go on thinking that the set of natural numbers is larger . )
We then discussed whether there were more rational numbers ( any number that can be expressed as m/n , where m and n are natural integers and n does n't equal 0 ) than natural numbers .
With a little thought , it can be shown that there is a way of matching them up one - to - one .
I then asked whether irrational numbers , such as pi , e , square roots of various integers , etc. - numbers that when written in decimal form do not terminate or repeat - can also be matched up one - to - one with the natural numbers .
We did n't get the chance to go over Cantor 's diagonal argument , but I got to thinking about whether it could be done .
Now , since it is well accepted in mathematics that it * cannot * be done - and this acceptance has been corroborated in numerous proofs - there are some clear problems with my approach .
Anyway , here it is :
To write all the irrational numbers down in some kind of systematic way ( thereby leading to a one - to - one correspondence with the natural numbers ) , do the following :
0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 ... 0.9
1.0 ... 1.9 ... 9.9
0.01 , 0.02 , ... 0.10 , 0.11 , ...0.19 , ... 0.99 , 1.00
1.01 , 1.02 ... 9.99 .
10.1 , 10.2 ...
10.9 , 10.01 , 10.02 ... 10.99
... 99.99
I 'm not even sure if I 've captured it properly here , but the basic idea is to go up on either side of the decimal point , taking turns and being careful to write each number down .
It 's clear that in this method , you are going to be able to write down every terminating decimal number .
In writing down my ' proof ' , it became clear to me that you never really write down any infinite string of decimals , and so you never write down even one irrational number .
Yet you are able to write any arbitrarily long rational number ( though you never complete writing a repeating decimal expansion ) , so in some sense it feels to me that all the numbers will be there .
The diagonal argument hinges on having all of the numbers listed , and then changing one of the digits in each of the numbers to create a new irrational number that 's not on the list .
Yet if it 's impossible to write down even one irrational number , to what extent does it make sense to say you can do that ?
Why does n't it make just as much sense to say that this process of writing down every number expressible as a decimal will eventually ( whatever that means ) write down every number , including the repeating decimal expansions of rational numbers like 1/3 and even those with non-repeating non-terminating decimal expansions that are infinitely long ?
WASHINGTON  Defying a veto threat from President Bush , the House of Representatives voted Thursday to prohibit waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency against high - level prisoners from Al Qaeda .
The 222 - to -199 vote , largely along party lines , sends the legislation to the Senate , where passage is less certain .
The measure , part of the intelligence authorization bill , would restrict all American interrogators to techniques included in the Army Field Manual , which prohibits the use of physical force .
In a statement this week , the White House said the president would veto the bill , as a ban on harsh interrogations “ would prevent the president from taking the lawful actions necessary to protect Americans from attack in wartime . ”
The vote took place as the House Intelligence Committee pressed for more information about videotapes of interrogations of two men suspected of being operatives for Al Qaeda in 2002 and the destruction of the tapes in 2005 .
In a surprising reversal for the Boeing Company , the Pentagon on Friday awarded a multibillion - dollar contract for refueling tankers to a partnership between Northrop Grumman and EADS , the European parent of Airbus .
The deal , which puts a critical United States military contract into the hands of foreigners , at least in part , calls for spending up to $ 40 billion on the first phase of a multidecade program to replace the nation ’s aging aerial tanker fleet , which dates back to the Kennedy and Eisenhower era .
The fleet , which now numbers about 535 refitted Boeing 707’s and DC - 10 ’s is one of the largest but oldest fleets of jets in the world .
Yet the tanker planes are essential to keeping Air Force and allied fighter jets , bombers , cargo planes and other military aircraft in the air when on critical missions far from airports where they can land to refuel .
And replacing these tankers  essentially flying gas stations that offload their fuel in mid-air  has been the Air Force ’s top priority since 1996 , when the government first proposed acquiring new planes .
Eventually , the contract is expected to be valued at $ 100 billion , as the Air Force spends the next several decades acquiring new tankers at a rate of about 15 a year .
It is expected that nearly 400 new refueling planes will be needed .
Yet for more than a decade the Air Force ’s effort to modernize the fleet has been thwarted by global politics , Washington scandals and an aggressive attack by Senator John McCain , now the presumptive Republican nominee for president .
DICKENS , Tex .
PAUL SLOUGH may have worked as a cowboy growing up in this tiny town in northwest Texas , but soldiers who served with him were stunned to hear he had been accused of acting like one as a Blackwater security guard in Iraq .
“ I went on 20 to 30 missions with Paul .
You could always depend on him , ” said Jeremiah Thompson , recalling his tour of duty with Mr. Slough in Iraq for the Texas National Guard .
“ He was always careful .
He was always professional .
I never knew him to break the rules of engagement . ”
Today , Mr. Slough , 28 , is at the center of a federal investigation into the Sept. 16 shooting deaths of 17 Iraqis in Baghdad by a convoy of Blackwater security guards .
Authorities have refused to talk about the inquiry , except to say it has focused on one guard , identified only as “ turret gunner No. 3 . ”
Through a review of case documents and interviews in Texas and Washington , The New York Times identified the gunner as Mr. Slough , a former infantry soldier who joined Blackwater Worldwide after his dreams of joining the Army Special Forces were quashed by recurring problems from an old football injury .

1 Realize that the basic idea behind every multiplayer video game is basically the same .
Whether you are shooting Nazis or scoring touchdowns , you need to be able to see everything that is going on around you .
Learning maps helps with this , but the best way to maximize your view of the field of play is to have " shifty eyes " .
You do n't need to keep looking at your character ; trust me , they will be there when you look back at them .
Look around .
Watch for people sneaking up behind you or trying to move around to the side .

Take a few hours to learn all the power - ups , the location of items , and how to do special moves and combos .
Being able to do even one complicated move could be the difference between victory and button - mashing defeat .

3 Learn the rules .
There lots of clearly stated , observable , or calculable rules that have a bearing on play .
A good example is weapon balance in Halo games .
It takes exactly 8 Battle Rifle shots to the body to kill an opponent with depleted shields and full armor in Halo 2 .
These little nuances are the most important part of building a strategy quickly in the middle of a game .

Only attacking an opponent will leave you vulnerable .
Likewise , only defending will prevent you from ever defeating anyone .
Sometimes , it is good to hide or run away , even though it might be more fun to try to pull off that amazingly difficult winning move .

Be tricky .
If the " expected " thing to do would be to run right in the front gate , then do the unexpected , try finding a side entrance or laying a trap , unless the unexpected is expected , then you do the expected and walk through the front gate !

9 Crunch the numbers .
Learn how much damage you do with each hit in a set amount of time , and how many hits you can get off safely whether it be ammo in your gun or punches from your fighter .
Learning your DPS ( damage per second ) is crucial when you want to get good with a game .
It is the difference between playing more defensively when you 're weaker or full out aggression when you can " Tank n' Spank " your way to victory .

Have that really strong attack that takes a couple seconds to pull off ?
While that single attack might be impressive and flashy it is n't the optimal way to play .
Weaker but quicker attacks may not be flashy on their own , but they will be a lot easier to chain together .
The look on your enemies face will be worth it when you have them " Perma- stunned " .

Just learning what the mechanics are is n't all of it .
You need to learn every single detail of the game .
Have an attack that missed your opponent , but it seemed like it hit ?
He might have learned that he has some invulnerability frames during that time , or you might not realize that FPS you 're playing is " hit - scan " rather than projectile based .
Mastering these under the hood mechanics will surprise your friends and make every game you play an entirely different experience .

While you might end up with the highest score at the end of the round , it takes no skill to get in a tank and blast away ; it does not make you a GOOD player , just a lame one .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Pentagon is projecting that when the United States troop buildup in Iraq ends in July there will be about 8,000 more troops on the ground than when it began in January 2007 , a senior general said Monday .
Lt. Gen. Carter Ham , head of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters that by July the troop total was likely to be 140,000 .
There were 132,000 troops there when President Bush approved orders to send five more Army brigades to Iraq to improve security and avert civil war .
General Ham also announced that the Pentagon believed that United States force levels in Afghanistan would be at 32,000 in late summer , up from about 28,000 now .
The current total is the highest since the war began in October 2001 , and 3,200 more marines are scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan this spring .
It had been widely expected that some support troops sent to Iraq with the five extra brigades would need to remain , even after July .
But until now it was not clear what the number would be .
“ Campaigns have been buying advertising on television for 40 - plus years now ; they ’ve only been buying ads on the Internet for three or four years , ” said Mindy Finn , director of Mr. Romney ’s online strategy .
“ It ’s more uncharted territory , and everyone ’s trying to figure it out . ”
Television is still the primary means by which the campaigns reach voters by the millions , and even now , Internet advertising makes up a small fraction of the candidates ’ advertising budgets .
But campaign strategists say the Internet provides unrivaled opportunity to draw volunteers and donations for mere pennies , through Web sites that often make their interests and affiliations clear .
( The campaign of Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , knows , for example , it is talking to veterans when advertising on Military.com . )
Still , the Romney campaign had not expected its banners to appear on FanFiction .
net , whose users have seen thousands of “ Romney for President ” ads while using the site to write their own plots about their favorite fictional characters — or read the work of others , including pornographic scenes between Harry Potter and Hermione Granger .
And Mr. Romney ’s aides said they did not know their ads had run on Gay.com or FanFiction .net .
Mr. Romney is not the only presidential candidate still finding his way online .
Earlier this year , Senator Barack Obama , Democrat of Illinois , removed an advertisement from an Amazon.com screen dedicated to the book “ The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , ” which has upset Jewish groups who view it as anti-Semitic — learning it was there only when contacted by The New York Sun .
A former aide to Mr. McCain said he was surprised to see his candidate ’s ads appear on the liberal Huffington Post Web site .
Last week an ad for Rudolph W. Giuliani , the former New York mayor who is trying to overcome conservative suspicion in the race for the Republican presidential nomination , showed up on a liberal blog , DailyKos .
LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) - Nearly half of Britain ’s National Health Service ( NHS ) maternity units had to turn away women in labor last year because they were full , figures showed on Thursday .

Furthermore , a shortage of facilities or staff led to almost one in 10 of these units closing more than 10 times .
One closed 28 times , while another was forced to shut its doors 39 times .
The figures , collected by the opposition Conservative Party under the Freedom of Information Act , showed large maternity units were more likely to be forced to close than smaller ones .
Shadow Health Secretary Andrew Lansley blamed the government ’s policy of closing small maternity units in favor of larger ones for the situation , arguing it “ flew in the face of common sense ” .
“ Women do n’t want to have to travel miles to give birth , ” he said .
“ And they certainly do n’t want to have to travel even further because they ’re turned away by the hospital of their choice . ”
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( RCOG ) said 400 extra consultants are needed in England and Wales .
Maternity units are being put under additional pressure because of the growing birth rate , increased numbers of obese women giving birth -- who require extra care -- and the rise in the number of women in their 40s becoming pregnant .
Richard Warren , RCOG honorary secretary , said : “ It is imperative to ensure that maternity units are appropriately staffed and resourced to meet the demands that the service requires . ”
The Royal College of Midwives said : “ The vast majority of women do not need medical intervention , and midwife led services in smaller units or at home may be the best option for them . ”
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said : “ It is difficult to precisely predict when a mother will go into labor and sometimes , at times of peak demand , maternity units do temporarily divert women to nearby facilities .
“ When this does happen it is often only for a few hours and to ensure mother and baby can receive the best care possible . ”
Of the 147 NHS Trusts that provide maternity services , 103 provided figures .
Of these , 42 percent reported having closed or having been forced to divert women to another site at least once last year because of capacity problems .
The headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , located across from Lafayette Park in Washington , is a limestone structure that looks almost as majestic as the Supreme Court .
The similarity is no coincidence : both buildings were designed by the same architect , Cass Gilbert .
Lately , however , the affinities between the court and the chamber , a lavishly financed business - advocacy organization , seem to be more than just architectural .
The Supreme Court term that ended last June was , by all measures , exceptionally good for American business .
The chamber ’s litigation center filed briefs in 15 cases and its side won in 13 of them – the highest percentage of victories in the center ’s 30 - year history .
The current term , which ends this summer , has also been shaping up nicely for business interests .
I visited the chamber recently to talk with Robin Conrad , who heads the litigation effort , about her recent triumphs .
Conrad , an appealing , soft - spoken woman , lives with her family on a horse farm in Maryland , where she rides with a fox - chasing club called the Howard County - Iron Bridge Hounds .
Her office , playfully adorned by action figures of women like Xena the Warrior Princess and Hillary Rodham Clinton , has one of the most impressive views in Washington .
“ You can see the White House through the trees , ” she said as we peered through a window overlooking the park .
“ In the old days , you could actually see people bathing in the fountain .
Homeless people . ”
Conrad was in an understandably cheerful mood .
Though the current Supreme Court has a well - earned reputation for divisiveness , it has been surprisingly united in cases affecting business interests .
Of the 30 business cases last term , 22 were decided unanimously , or with only one or two dissenting votes .
Conrad said she was especially pleased that several of the most important decisions were written by liberal justices , speaking for liberal and conservative colleagues alike .
In opinions last term , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer and David Souter each went out of his or her way to question the use of lawsuits to challenge corporate wrongdoing – a strategy championed by progressive groups like Public Citizen but routinely denounced by conservatives as “ regulation by litigation . ”
Conrad reeled off some of her favorite moments : “ Justice Ginsburg talked about how ‘ private - securities fraud actions , if not adequately contained , can be employed abusively . ’
Justice Breyer had a wonderful quote about how Congress was trying to ‘ weed out unmeritorious securities lawsuits . ’
Justice Souter talked about how the threat of litigation ‘ will push cost - conscious defendants to settle . ’ ”
Examples like these point to an ideological sea change on the Supreme Court .
A generation ago , progressive and consumer groups petitioning the court could count on favorable majority opinions written by justices who viewed big business with skepticism – or even outright prejudice .
An economic populist like William O. Douglas , the former New Deal crusader who served on the court from 1939 to 1975 , once unapologetically announced that he was “ ready to bend the law in favor of the environment and against the corporations . ”
Today , however , there are no economic populists on the court , even on the liberal wing .
And ever since John Roberts was appointed chief justice in 2005 , the court has seemed only more receptive to business concerns .
Forty percent of the cases the court heard last term involved business interests , up from around 30 percent in recent years .
While the Rehnquist Court heard less than one antitrust decision a year , on average , between 1988 and 2003 , the Roberts Court has heard seven in its first two terms – and all of them were decided in favor of the corporate defendants .
Business cases at the Supreme Court typically receive less attention than cases concerning issues like affirmative action , abortion or the death penalty .
The disputes tend to be harder to follow : the legal arguments are more technical , the underlying stories less emotional .
But these cases – which include shareholder suits , antitrust challenges to corporate mergers , patent disputes and efforts to reduce punitive - damage awards and prevent product - liability suits – are no less important .
They involve billions of dollars , have huge consequences for the economy and can have a greater effect on people ’s daily lives than the often symbolic battles of the culture wars .
In the current Supreme Court term , the justices have already blocked a liability suit against Medtronic , the manufacturer of a heart catheter , and rejected a type of shareholder suit that includes a claim against Enron .
In the coming months , the court will decide whether to reduce the largest punitive - damage award in American history , which resulted from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 .
What should we make of the Supreme Court ’s transformation ?
Throughout its history , the court has tended to issue opinions , in areas from free speech to gender equality , that reflect or consolidate a social consensus .
With their pro-business jurisprudence , the justices may be capturing an emerging spirit of agreement among liberal and conservative elites about the value of free markets .
Among the professional classes , many Democrats and Republicans , whatever their other disagreements , have come to share a relatively laissez - faire , technocratic vision of the economy and are suspicious of excessive regulation and reflexive efforts to vilify big business .
Judges , lawyers and law professors ( such as myself ) drilled in cost - benefit analysis over the past three decades , are no exception .
It should come as little surprise that John Roberts and Stephen Breyer , both of whom studied the economic analysis of law at Harvard , have similar instincts in business cases .
This elite consensus , however , is not necessarily shared by the country as a whole .
If anything , America may be entering something of a populist moment .
If you combine the groups of Americans in a recent Pew survey who lean toward some strain of economic populism – from disaffected and conservative Democrats to traditional liberals to social and big - government conservatives – at least two - thirds of all voters arguably feel sympathy for government intervention in the economy .
Could it be , then , that the court is reflecting an elite consensus while contravening the sentiments of most Americans ?
Only history will ultimately make this clear .
One thing , however , is certain already : the transformation of the court was no accident .
It represents the culmination of a carefully planned , behind - the - scenes campaign over several decades to change not only the courts but also the country ’s political culture .
II .
The origins of the business community ’s campaign to transform the Supreme Court can be traced back precisely to Aug. 23 , 1971 .
That was the day when Lewis F. Powell Jr. , a corporate lawyer in Richmond , Va. , wrote a memo to his friend Eugene B. Snydor , then the head of the education committee of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
In the memo , Powell expressed his concern that the American economic system was “ under broad attack . ”
He identified several aggressors : the New Left , the liberal media , rebellious students on college campuses and , most important , Ralph Nader .
Earlier that year , Nader founded Public Citizen to advocate for consumer rights , bring antitrust actions when the Justice Department did not and sue federal agencies when they failed to adopt health and safety regulations .
Powell claimed that this attack on the economic system was “ quite new in the history of America . ”
Ever since 1937 , when President Franklin D. Roosevelt threatened to pack a conservative Supreme Court with more progressive justices , the court had largely deferred to federal and state economic regulations .
And by the ’60s , the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren had embraced a form of economic populism , often favoring the interests of small business over big business , even at the expense of consumers .
But what Powell saw in the work of Nader and others was altogether more extreme : a radical campaign that was “ broadly based and consistently pursued . ”
To counter the growing influence of public - interest litigation groups like Public Citizen , Powell urged the Chamber of Commerce to begin a multifront lobbying campaign on behalf of business interests , including hiring top business lawyers to bring cases before the Supreme Court .
“ The judiciary , ” Powell predicted , “ may be the most important instrument for social , economic and political change . ”
Two months after he wrote the memo , Powell was appointed by Richard Nixon to the Supreme Court .
And six years later , in 1977 , after steadily expanding its lobbying efforts , the chamber established the National Chamber Litigation Center to file cases and briefs on behalf of business interests in federal and state courts .
Today , the Chamber of Commerce is an imposing lobbying force .
To fulfill its mission of serving “ the unified interests of American business , ” it collects membership dues from more than three million businesses and related organizations ; last year , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , the chamber spent more than $ 21 million lobbying the White House , Congress and regulatory agencies on legal matters .
But its battle against the forces of Naderism got off to a slow start .
In 1983 , when Robin Conrad arrived at the chamber , the Supreme Court was handing Nader and his allies significant victories .
That year , for example , the court held that President Reagan ’s secretary of transportation , Andrew L. Lewis Jr. , acted capriciously when he repealed a regulation , inspired by Nader ’s advocacy , that required automakers to install passive restraints like air bags .
In 1986 , the chamber supported a challenge to the Environmental Protection Agency ’s aerial surveillance of a Dow Chemical plant .
The chamber ’s side lost , 5 - 4 .
But eventually , things began to change .
The chamber started winning cases in part by refining its strategy .
With Conrad ’s help , the chamber ’s Supreme Court litigation program began to offer practice moot - court arguments for lawyers scheduled to argue important cases .
The chamber also began hiring the most - respected Democratic and Republican Supreme Court advocates to persuade the court to hear more business cases .
Although many of the businesses that belong to the Chamber of Commerce have their own in - house lawyers , they would have the chamber file “ friend of the court ” briefs on their behalf .
The chamber would decide which of the many cases brought to its attention were in the long - term strategic interest of American business and then hire the leading business lawyers to write supporting briefs or argue the case .
Until the mid-’80s , there was n’t an organized group of law firms that specialized in arguing business cases before the Supreme Court .
But in 1985 , Rex Lee , the solicitor general under Reagan , left the government to start a Supreme Court appellate practice at the firm Sidley Austin .
Lee ’s goal was to offer business clients the same level of expert representation before the Supreme Court that the solicitor general ’s office provides to federal agencies .
Lee ’s success prompted other law firms to hire former Supreme Court clerks and former members of the solicitor general ’s office to start business practices .
The Chamber of Commerce , for its part , began to coordinate the strategy of these lawyers in the most important business cases .
At times , the strategic calculations can be quite personal .
Because Supreme Court clerks have tremendous influence in making recommendations about what cases the court should hear , Conrad told me , having well - known former clerks involved in submitting a brief can be especially important .
“ When Justice O’Connor was on the bench and we knew her vote was very important , we had a case where the opposition had her favorite clerk on the brief , so we retained her next - favorite clerk , ” she said with a laugh .
“ We won . ”
In our conversation , Conrad was especially enthusiastic about Maureen Mahoney , a former clerk for Chief Justice Rehnquist and one of the top Supreme Court litigators who coordinate strategy with the chamber .
When Mahoney agreed in 2005 to represent an appeal by the disgraced accounting firm Arthur Andersen , which was convicted in 2002 of obstructing justice by shredding documents related to the audit of Enron , few people thought the Supreme Court would take the case .
“ The climate was very anti-Enron , ” Mahoney told me , “ and it was viewed as a doomed petition . ”
Mahoney rehearsed her Supreme Court argument in a moot court sponsored by the chamber .
( “ She was absolutely dazzling , ” Conrad recalls . )
On April 27 , 2005 , Mahoney stood calmly before the justices and delivered one of the best oral arguments I ’ve ever seen at the Supreme Court .
She argued that because Arthur Andersen ’s accountants had followed a standard document - destruction procedure before receiving the government ’s subpoena , they could n’t be guilty of a crime ; they were n’t aware what they were doing was criminal .
The Supreme Court unanimously agreed and reversed the conviction , 9- 0 .
The Arthur Andersen case is a good example of how significantly the Supreme Court has changed its attitude about cases involving securities fraud – and business cases more generally – from the Warren to the Roberts era .
In a case in 1964 , the court ruled that aggrieved investors and consumers could file private lawsuits to enforce the securities laws , even in cases in which Congress had n’t explicitly created a right to sue .
In the mid-1990s , however , Congress substantially cut back on these citizen suits , and the court today has shown little patience for them .
Mahoney says she sees her victory in the Arthur Andersen case as significant because it applied the same principle in criminal cases involving corporate wrongdoing that the court had already been recognizing in civil cases : namely , “ refusing to create greater damage remedies or criminal penalties than Congress has explicitly specified . ”
She describes the case as “ a very important win for business . ”
This term , the Supreme Court has continued to cut back on consumer suits .
In a ruling in January , the court refused to allow a shareholder suit against the suppliers to Charter Communications , one of the country ’s largest cable companies .
The suppliers were alleged to have “ aided and abetted ” Charter ’s efforts to inflate its earnings , but the court held that Charter ’s investors had to show that they had relied on the deceptive acts committed by the suppliers before the suit could proceed .
A week later , the court invoked the same principle when it refused to hear an appeal in a case related to Enron , in which investors are trying to recover $ 40 billion from Wall Street banks that they claim aided and abetted Enron ’s fraud .
As a result , the shareholder suit against the banks may be dead .
III .
In addition to litigating cases before the court , the Chamber of Commerce also lobbies Congress and the White House in an effort to change the composition of the court itself .
( Unlike many other government officials , the justices themselves are not , of course , subject to direct corporate lobbying . )
The chamber ’s efforts in this area were inspired by Robert Bork ’s thwarted nomination to the court in 1987 .
Business groups were enthusiastic about Bork – not because of his conservative social views but because of his skepticism of vigorous antitrust enforcement .
“ In reaction to the Bork nomination , it struck us that we did n’t even have a process in place to be a player , ” Conrad said .
So the chamber set up a formal process for endorsing candidates after their nominations .
The process was designed to be bipartisan ; and the chamber has encouraged Democratic as well as Republican presidents to appoint justices .
Nominees are evaluated solely through the prism of their views about business .
“ We ’re very surgical in our analysis , ” Conrad said .
After the election of Bill Clinton , for example , the chamber endorsed Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who in addition to her pioneering achievements as the head of the women ’s rights project at the A.C.L.U. had specialized , as a law professor , in the procedural rules in complex civil cases and was comfortable with the finer points of business litigation .
The chamber was especially enthusiastic about Clinton ’s second nominee , Stephen Breyer , who made his name building a bipartisan consensus for airline deregulation as a special counsel on the judiciary committee ; and who , as a Harvard Law professor , advocated an influential and moderate view on antitrust enforcement .
During Breyer ’s confirmation hearings his sharpest critic was Ralph Nader , who testified that his pro-business rulings were “ extraordinarily one - sided . ”
Another critic , Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio , said that the fact that the chamber was the first organization to endorse Breyer indicated that “ large corporations are very pleased with this nomination ” and “ the fact that Ralph Nader is opposed to it indicated that the average American has a reason to have some concern . ”
The chamber ’s imprimatur helped reassure Republicans about Breyer , and he was confirmed with a vote of 87 to 9 .
“ Frankly , we did n’t feel like we had anyone on the court since Justice Powell who truly understood business issues , ” Conrad told me .
“ Justice Breyer came close to that . ”
The Breyer and Ginsburg nominations also came at a time when liberal as well as conservative judges and academics were gravitating in increasing numbers to an economic approach to the law , originally developed at the University of Chicago .
The law - and - economics movement sought to evaluate the efficiency of legal rules based on their costs and benefits for society as a whole .
Although originally conservative in its orientation , the movement also attracted prominent moderate and liberal scholars and judges like Breyer , who before his nomination wrote two books on regulation , arguing that government health - and - safety spending is distorted by sensational media reports of disasters that affect relatively few citizens .
Since joining the Supreme Court , Breyer has also been an intellectual leader in antitrust and patent disputes , which often pit business against business , rather than business against consumers .
In those cases , many liberal scholars sympathetic to economic analysis have applauded the court for favoring competition rather than existing competitors , innovation rather than particular innovators .
“ The court deserves credit for trying to rationalize a totally irrational patent system , benefiting smaller new competitors rather than existing big ones , ” says Lawrence Lessig , an intellectual - property scholar at Stanford .
Clinton ’s nominations of Ginsburg and Breyer may have been welcomed by the chamber , but with the election of George W. Bush , the chamber faced a dilemma .
Ever since the Reagan administration , there had been a divide on the right wing of the court between pragmatic free - market conservatives , who tended to favor business interests , and ideological states - rights conservatives .
In some business cases , these two strands of conservatism diverged , leading the most staunch states - rights conservatives on the court , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , to rule against business interests .
Scalia and Thomas were reluctant to second - guess large punitive - damage verdicts by state juries , for example , or to hold that federally regulated cigarette manufacturers could not be sued in state court .
As a result , under Conrad ’s leadership , the chamber began a vigorous campaign to urge the Bush administration to appoint pro-business conservatives .
When it came time to replace Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor , the candidate most enthusiastically supported by states - rights conservatives , Judge Michael Luttig , had a record on the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that some corporate interests feared might make him unpredictable in business cases .
( “ One of my constant refrains is that being conservative does n’t necessarily mean being pro-business , ” Conrad told me . )
The chamber and other business groups enthusiastically supported John Roberts , who had been hired by the chamber to write briefs in two Supreme Court cases in 2001 and 2002 .
At the time of Roberts ’s nomination , Thomas Goldstein , a prominent Supreme Court litigator , described him as “ the go - to lawyer for the business community , ” adding “ of all the candidates , he is the one they knew best . ”
When Roberts was nominated , business groups lobbied senators as part of the campaign for his confirmation .
The business community was also enthusiastic about Samuel Alito , whose 15 - year record as an appellate judge showed a consistent skepticism of claims against large corporations .
Ted Frank of the American Enterprise Institute predicted at the time of the nomination that if Alito replaced O’Connor , he and Roberts would bring about a rise in business cases before the Supreme Court .
Frank ’s prediction was soon vindicated .
“ There was n’t a great deal of interest in classic business cases in the last few years of the Rehnquist Court , ” Carter Phillips , a partner at Sidley Austin and a leading Supreme Court business advocate , told me .
In 2004 , Judge Richard Posner , a founder of the law - and - economics movement , argued that the Rehnquist Court ’s emphasis on headline - grabbing constitutional cases had politicized it , and called on the court to hear more business cases .
The Roberts court has unambiguously answered the call .
As Phillips told me , Roberts “ is more interested in those issues and understands them better than his predecessor did . ”
IV .
Exactly how successful has the Chamber of Commerce been at the Supreme Court ?
Although the court is currently accepting less than 2 percent of the 10,000 petitions it receives each year , the Chamber of Commerce ’s petitions between 2004 and 2007 were granted at a rate of 26 percent , according to Scotusblog .
And persuading the Supreme Court to hear a case is more than half the battle : Richard Lazarus , a law professor at Georgetown who also represents environmental clients before the court , recently ran the numbers and found that the court reverses the lower court in 65 percent of the cases it agrees to hear ; and when the petitioner is represented by the elite Supreme Court advocates routinely hired by the chamber , the success rate rises to 75 percent .
Faced with these daunting numbers , the progressive antagonists of big business are understandably feeling beleaguered and outgunned .
“ The fight before the court is generally not an even one , ” said David Vladeck , who once worked for the Public Citizen Litigation Group and now teaches law at Georgetown .
“ There ’s us on one side , with a brief or two , and industry on the other side , with a well - coordinated campaign of 10 or 12 briefs , with each one written by a member of the elite Supreme Court bar that address an issue in enormous depth . ”
He added , ruefully , “ You admire their handiwork , but it ’s frustrating as hell to deal with . ”
To gauge the degree of the frustration , I recently paid a visit to Ralph Nader , a few weeks before he announced his most recent campaign for president of the United States .
It was a surprise to find that his office , the Center for Study of Responsive Law , shares an address in a grand building with the Carnegie Institution for Science .
But the office itself , reassuringly , is buried on the ground floor , where Nader received me at a conference table surrounded by file cabinets stuffed with faded back issues of Mother Jones and The Nation .
Nader was uncontrite about his 2000 run against Al Gore – which is often credited with helping George W. Bush win the presidency – and he insisted that because Clinton appointed justices like Breyer , Gore would have done the same .
“ Breyer has n’t been worse than I feared , because I had real concern when he was nominated , ” Nader told me .
He conceded that , like Breyer , Democratic justices appointed by President John Kerry would presumably have been better on civil rights and liberties than John Roberts and Samuel Alito .
Nevertheless , he disparaged Breyer as a “ deregulation quasi- ideologue ” who was able to weave a “ tapestry of illusion ” in his arguments by dealing in abstractions .
The main casualty of the 2000 run , Nader said , is that he is no longer collaborating with America ’s trial lawyers .
They would ordinarily be his natural allies in representing consumer interests , but they donated heavily to Gore ’s campaign .
After 2000 , the trial lawyers “ have been vitriolic , ” Nader explained .
He blames them for not using their money to help counteract the influence of the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups before the federal courts .
In part as a result of their stinginess , he said , his colleagues at Public Citizen are underfinanced and worn down .
“ There were some lawyers who left Public Citizen because they got tired of losing , ” he said .
“ Everyone is desperately trying to hold on to whatever issues are left , and then they become demoralized and discouraged . ”
Thirty years after the Chamber of Commerce founded its litigation center to counteract his influence , Nader all but conceded defeat in the battle for the Supreme Court .
With the decline of economic populism in Congress , the weakening of trade unions and the rise of globalization , the political climate , he lamented , was passing him by .
“ I recall a comment by Eugene Debs , ” Nader said , looking at me intensely .
“ He said : The American people live in a country where they can have almost anything they want .
And my regret is that it seems that they do n’t want much of anything at all . ”
Nader chuckled quietly and shook his head .
“ I say ditto . ”
V .
If there is an anti-Nader – a crusading lawyer passionately devoted to the pro-business cause – it is Theodore Olson .
One of the most influential Supreme Court advocates and a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush , Olson is best known for his winning argument before the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore in 2000 .
But Olson has devoted most of his energies in private practice to changing the legal and political climate for American business .
According to his peers in the elite Supreme Court bar , he more than anyone else is responsible for transforming the approach to one of the most important legal concerns of the American business community : punitive damages awarded to the victims of corporate negligence .
Punitive damages – money awarded by civil juries on top of any awarded for actual harm that victims have suffered – are designed to penalize especially egregious acts of corporate misconduct resulting from malice or greed , and to deter similar wrongdoing in the future .
In the 19th century , courts generally demanded a clear assignment of fault in cases where victims sued for injuries caused by malfunctioning products .
It was hard for plaintiffs to recover in personal - injury cases unless the corporation was obviously at fault .
But in the 20th century , in liability cases involving a rapidly expanding class of potentially dangerous products like cars , drugs and medical devices , courts increasingly applied a standard of “ strict liability , ” which held that manufacturers should pay whether or not they were directly at fault .
The animating idea was that manufacturers were in the best position to prevent accidents by improving their products with better design and testing .
They and their insurance companies ( rather than society as a whole ) would shoulder the costs of accidents , thus giving them an incentive to make their products safer .
Encouraged by Ralph Nader ’s book , “ Unsafe at Any Speed , ” published in 1965 , courts began to see car accidents as predictable events that better car design could have prevented .
In 1968 , for example , a federal court held that car manufacturers could be sued for failing to make cars safe enough for drivers to survive crashes , even if the driver was at fault for the crash .
A series of well - publicized awards in the 1980s and ’90s culminated in the largest punitive damage award in American history the $ 5 billion levied against Exxon after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 .
This was hardly typical : the median punitive award actually fell to $ 50,000 in 2001 from $ 63,000 in 1992 .
Nevertheless , critics like Olson claimed that multimillion - dollar punitive - damage verdicts were threatening the health of the economy .
They resolved to fight back on several fronts .
In his first Supreme Court argument , in 1986 , Olson set out the broad contours of his argument : for most of English and American history , private litigants were entitled to be compensated for whatever damages they suffered , including pain and suffering , but any public wrongs like the failure of American business to make cars safer by adopting air bags should be addressed by legislation or regulation , not by the courts .
Olson decided that his clients deserved not just a lawyer who could argue a case but a lawyer who could change the political culture .
“ You had to attack it in a broad - scale way in the legislatures , in the arena of public opinion and in the courts , ” he told me recently .
“ I felt the business community had to approach this in a holistic way . ”
He set out , in lectures and op - ed pieces , to publicize especially egregious examples .
The poster child for punitive - damage abuse , widely derided in TV and radio ads paid for by the business community , was a New Mexico grandmother who , in 1994 , was awarded $ 2.7 million in punitive damages when she scalded herself with hot McDonald ’s coffee .
Consumer advocates countered that she had originally asked for $ 20,000 for medical expenses , which McDonald ’s refused to pay , and the award appeared to have the effect of persuading McDonald ’s to serve its coffee at a safer temperature .
Nonetheless , the campaign to vilify plaintiffs ’ lawyers has been effective enough that the American Association of Trial Lawyers recently changed its name to the fuzzier American Association for Justice .
The business community made other inroads against punitive damages .
Corporations financed campaigns against pro-punitive - damage state judges who had been elected with the assistance of large contributions from plaintiffs ’ lawyers .
The business community also helped persuade more than 30 states to either impose caps on punitive - damage awards or direct substantial portions of the awards to be paid into special state funds .
In 1996 , it helped persuade the Republican Congress , led by Newt Gingrich , to pass legislation that would cap punitive - damage awards in product - liability cases in every state court in the country .
But in 1996 , President Clinton , with what must have been perverse pleasure , vetoed the bill on the grounds that it violated principles of federalism and states rights to which conservatives claimed to be devoted .
Thwarted by Clinton , and unable to persuade Congress to override the veto , opponents of punitive damages turned their attention back to the Supreme Court , looking for a victory they were unable to win in the political arena .
Here , they were remarkably successful .
As late as 1991 , the court had refused to impose limits on a large punitive - damage award .
But in a case in 1996 , the court held for the first time that punitive - damage awards had to be proportional to the actual damage incurred by the plaintiff .
The case involved a man who said he was deceived by BMW when it sold him a supposedly “ new ” car that was , in fact , used and had received a $ 300 touch - up job .
The court , in a 5 - 4 opinion , overturned a $ 2 million punitive - damage award as “ grossly excessive . ”
In 2003 , the court clarified what it meant : a single - digit ratio between punitive damages and compensatory damages was likely to be acceptable .
Last year , the business community watched with anticipation as Roberts and Alito revealed their views about punitive damages .
The case involved the estate of a heavy smoker who sued Philip Morris for deceitfully distributing a “ poisonous and addictive substance . ”
A jury had awarded the estate $ 821,000 in compensatory damages and $ 79.5 million in punitive damages – a ratio of about 100 to 1 .
In a 5 - 4 opinion written by Breyer , the court held that it was unconstitutional for a jury to use punitive damages to punish a company for its conduct toward similarly affected individuals who are not party to the lawsuit .
This spring , the court will decide the Exxon Valdez punitive - damage case , which many consider the culmination of the business community ’s decades - long campaign against punitive damages .
In 1989 , the Exxon Valdez tanker , whose captain had a history of alcoholism , ran into a reef and punctured the hull ; 11 million gallons of oil leaked onto the coastline of Prince William Sound .
A jury handed down a $ 5 billion punitive - damage award .
After the verdict , Exxon began providing money for academic research to support its claim that the award for damages was excessive .
It financed some of the country ’s most prominent scholars on both sides of the political spectrum , including the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and Cass Sunstein , a law professor at the University of Chicago .
( Sunstein says he accepted only travel grants , not research support , from Exxon ; and Kahneman stresses that the financing had no influence on the substance of his work . )
In a 2002 book , “ Punitive Damages : How Juries Decide , ” Sunstein studied hundreds of mock - jury deliberations and concluded that jurors are unpredictable and often irrational in punitive - damage cases .
Jury deliberations , he found , increase the unpredictability , as well as the dollar amount of the final awards .
Sunstein concluded that a system of civil fines determined by experts , rather than punitive damages determined by juries , might be more sensible .
When Exxon appealed the $ 5 billion verdict in 2006 , it was reduced by an appellate court to $ 2.5 billion .
The reduced verdict is once again being challenged as excessive .
Walter Dellinger , the lawyer now arguing Exxon ’s case before the Supreme Court , is no Republican activist .
Like Sunstein , he is one of the most respected Democratic constitutional scholars , as well as a former acting solicitor general for President Clinton .
Last month , in his argument before the court , Dellinger argued that because Exxon has already paid $ 3.4 billion in fines , cleanup costs and compensation connected with the Exxon Valdez spill , and because it did n’t act out of malice or greed in failing to monitor the alcoholic captain , additional punitive damages would serve no “ public purpose . ”
During the argument , Breyer noted that the $ 2.5 billion punitive damage award represents a less than 10 - to - 1 ratio between punitive damages and compensatory damages , which is in the single - digit range that the Supreme Court has considered acceptable in the past .
But Breyer also seemed concerned at other points that punitive - damage awards have not been routine in maritime cases like this one , and that the award might create “ a new world for the shipping industry . ”
Alito , who owns Exxon Mobil stock , did not participate , and because a tie would affirm the $ 2.5 billion punitive - damage award , the plaintiffs who are opposing Exxon need only four votes to prevail .
But whether Dellinger gets five votes , a significant triumph is already behind him : he persuaded the court to take the case in the first place .
VI .
Ted Olson and the Chamber of Commerce are n’t only trying to persuade the Supreme Court to cut back on large punitive - damage awards ; they ’re also arguing that consumers injured by dangerous or defective medical devices and drugs in some cases should n’t be able to file product - liability suits at all .
Because there is no national product - liability law that allows federal suits for personal injuries , consumers who are injured by , say , defective heart valves or artificial hips have to sue in state courts under state tort law .
By asking the Supreme Court to prevent injured consumers from suing in state court , the business community , supported by the Bush administration , is trying to ensure that these consumers often have no legal remedy for their injuries .
And the Supreme Court has been increasingly sympathetic to the business community ’s arguments .
In a Supreme Court case Olson argued in December , he stood before the justices and argued that the manufacturers of defective medical devices – like heart valves , breast implants and defibrillators – should be immune from personal - liability suits because the federal Food and Drug Administration had approved the devices before they were marketed and the manufacturers had complied with all federal requirements .
The case involved Charles Riegel , who had an angioplasty in 1996 during which the catheter used to dilate his coronary artery burst .
Riegel , who needed advanced life support and emergency bypass surgery , eventually sued the manufacturer of the catheter , Medtronic .
The company is colloquially referred to in the business community as “ the pre-emption company ” because of its practice of arguing that the Food and Drug Administration ’s “ premarket approval ” of its products pre-empts product - liability suits in state courts .
The lawyer representing Riegel ’s estate before the Supreme Court , Allison Zieve of Public Citizen , countered that Congress never intended to ban state product - liability suits when Senator Edward Kennedy sponsored a bill regulating medical devices in 1976 .
( Kennedy himself filed a brief in the case noting that he indeed intended no such thing . )
“ Lawyers think this is a close issue , but any time I talk to a nonlawyer about it , they ’re shocked , ” Zieve told me after the argument .
“ People think : of course , if somebody makes a defective product you can sue . ”
It ’s one thing to argue that the federal government ’s “ premarket approval ” of food , drugs and medical devices should pre-empt clearly inconsistent state laws and regulations .
After all , if states imposed safety requirements that conflicted with the federal standard , the resulting regulatory confusion would make a national ( and global ) market impossible .
But Olson ’s claim that federal regulation of medical devices and drugs should also pre-empt product - liability suits under state tort law is one of the more creative and far - reaching legal arguments of the business groups that litigate before the Supreme Court .
This type of argument arose out of the tobacco litigation of the 1980s and ’90s , which culminated in a $ 206 billion settlement paid by the top tobacco companies to a consortium of 46 state attorneys general in exchange for dropping tort suits against the companies .
The tobacco litigation began modestly : in 1983 , Rose Cipollone , a New Jersey woman dying of lung cancer , sued several of the country ’s largest tobacco companies for their failure to give adequate warnings about the dangers of smoking .
After spending tens of millions of dollars fighting the verdict , the companies decided to take their defense to the next level .
They argued that because the federal government required cigarette companies to have warning labels , tobacco companies could n’t be subject to tort suits in state courts .
Jury verdicts , they argued , are no less a form of regulation than laws explicitly adopted by state legislatures .
In a decision in 1992 , the Supreme Court endorsed part of the companies ’ argument .
The decision unleashed a torrent of similar “ pre-emption ” claims by the manufacturers of dangerous drugs , defective medical devices and cars without air bags .
And after the election of President Bush in 2000 , the business community ’s crusade was aggressively supported by the White House .
At the same time that the White House was scaling back on federal health - and - safety enforcement , it insisted that consumers should not be able to sue federally regulated industries in state court .
Bush appointed as the general counsel of the Food and Drug Administration a former drug - and tobacco - company lawyer named Daniel Troy .
With Troy ’s support , the F.D.A. reversed its position , held for 25 years , and argued for the first time that its premarket approval of medical devices should prevent injured consumers from bringing product - liability suits in state court .
After her Supreme Court argument in the Medtronic case , Zieve told me she was n’t sure what to expect .
Until the arrival of Chief Justice Roberts , groups like Public Citizen had found that they had a better chance of winning pre-emption cases before the Supreme Court than in the lower courts .
But during the first two years of the Roberts Court , the justices had decided two pre-emption cases in favor of the corporate defendants .
The trend has continued .
On Feb. 21 , the Supreme Court handed Zieve a crushing defeat : an 8 - 1 opinion immunizing the makers of defective medical devices from product - liability suits .
The lone dissent was written by Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who objected that Congress could not have intended such a “ radical curtailment ” of state personal - injury suits when it regulated medical devices in 1976 .
Ginsburg , who is devoted to liberal judicial restraint , has consistently opposed efforts to second - guess punitive - damage awards or expand federal pre-emption .
I called Zieve soon after the Supreme Court issued its opinion , and she sounded shocked .
“ It ’s really unfathomable to me , ” she said .
“ I was n’t sure that this was a business - friendly court , but now I ’m finding it harder not to view it that way . ”
Zieve said that , as a result of the decision , “ I think the industry will keep unsafe devices on the market longer and be slower to improve products . ”
In the eyes of advocates like Zieve and Public Citizen , the public is now caught in a Catch - 22 : at the very moment that agencies like the F.D.A. are being strongly reproved by critics – including the agency ’s own internal science board – for being unwilling or unable to protect public health , the court is making it harder for people to receive compensation for the injuries that result .
On rare occasions , the Roberts Court has held that the Bush administration ’s deregulatory efforts circumvent the will of Congress – like the 5 - 4 decision last year holding that the Environmental Protection Agency acted capriciously when it adopted a rule that said it had no legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases .
But by and large , the Supreme Court defers to agencies that refuse to regulate public health and safety .
“ The industry has a lot of money , and they can routinely hire the biggest names in the biggest firms , while we ’re doing it on our own , ” Zieve told me .
“ We do n’t charge anything – we ’re free .
It did n’t cost $ 250,000 to get us to write the brief . ”
VII .
The Supreme Court is unlikely to reconsider its pro-business outlook anytime soon .
Nevertheless , there are several currents in American political life that run counter to the court , even if they may not be strong enough , or suitably directed , to reverse it .
There are , for example , economic populists in both political parties – John Edwards Democrats and Mike Huckabee Republicans , to cite just two types – who express concern about growing economic inequality and corporate corruption , and blame unchecked corporate power for America ’s escalating economic problems .
These populists tend to be from the working and middle classes rather than the professional classes , and their numbers may be growing .
In recent Pew surveys , 65 percent of Americans agreed that corporations make excessive profits – the highest number in 20 years .
Moreover , about half the country now asserts that America is divided on economic lines into two groups – the “ haves ” and “ have nots ” – up from only 26 percent two decades ago .
And the number of Americans who view themselves as “ have nots ” has doubled to 34 percent today from 17 percent in 1988 .
Responding to pressures from this demographic , a Democratic Congress – bolstered by states - rights conservatives – might well try to pass legislation to counteract the court ’s recent decisions barring product - liability suits for defective medical devices .
What about the executive branch ?
It seems unlikely that John McCain , if he were elected president , would push back against the court : he has already pledged to appoint “ judges of the character and quality of Justices Roberts and Alito , ” rather than justices more devoted to states rights , like Scalia and Thomas .
As for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , both have sounded increasingly populist notes in an effort to attract union and blue - collar supporters , ratcheting up their attacks on corporate wealth and power , singling out the drug , oil and health - insurance industries and promising to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement .
But despite their rhetoric , it is not clear that either candidate would actually appoint justices any more populist than Bill Clinton ’s nominees .
“ I would be stunned to find an anti-business appointee from either of them , ” Cass Sunstein , who is a constitutional adviser to Obama , told me .
“ There ’s not a strong interest on the part of Obama or Clinton in demonizing business , and you would n’t expect to see that in their Supreme Court nominees . ”
Still , the possibility does exist .
If the economy continues to decline and blue - collar voters end up being crucial in the election , a Democratic president might appoint an economic populist to the Supreme Court as a kind of payback .
Earlier this month , on the campaign trail in Ohio , Obama mentioned Earl Warren , who served as governor of California before becoming chief justice , as a model of the kind of justice he hoped to appoint .
“ I want people on the bench who have enough empathy , enough feeling , for what ordinary people are going through , ” Obama said .
He praised Warren for understanding that segregation was wrong because of the stigma it attached to blacks , rather than because of the precise nature of its sociological impact .
Appointing a former politician to the court would almost certainly introduce a more populist element : the Supreme Court that in 1954 decided Brown v. Board of Education included , in addition to a former governor , three former senators , a former Securities and Exchange Commission member and two former attorneys general .
( By contrast , the Roberts court is composed of nine former judges . )
Whatever happens in November , Robin Conrad says the Chamber of Commerce is prepared to lobby as hard as ever for the appointment of pro-business justices .
“ If we do have a Democrat president , and that president has opportunities to nominate to the court , ” she said in our meeting as I glanced at her Hillary Clinton action figure , “ we want to be able to express ourselves and work with that president . ”
Regardless of how many justices retire in the next presidential term , Conrad is confident that , having helped to transform the Supreme Court in less than 30 years , she and her colleagues can assure American business of a sympathetic hearing for decades to come .
When I told Conrad that Ralph Nader told me that lawyers were leaving Public Citizen because they were tired of losing , she achieved a look of earnest concern .
“ I hope if they feel they ’ve lost , ” she said , “ they lost for a good reason – not because they ’ve been overpowered or muscled by the big , bad business community , but they ’ve lost because reason won . ”
Conrad looked at me squarely , and then added , “ I guess if Ralph Nader wants to say we did him in ” – she paused to weigh her words – “ so be it . ”

Hepatitis C infection is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( malignancy involving lymphatic tissue ) of 20 percent to 30 percent , and a three - fold increase in the risk of another type of lymphoma , according to a study in the May 9 issue of JAMA .
The prevalence of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) is estimated at 1.6 percent of the U.S. population .
It is more common among U.S. military veterans who use the Veterans Affairs ( VA ) medical system , in which approximately five percent of veterans are infected with HCV .
HCV infection causes liver cancer and cirrhosis , and may also increase the risk of other tumors .
Previous studies have been too small to adequately assess these risks , according to background information in the article .
Thomas P. Giordano , M.D. , M.P.H. , of Baylor College of Medicine and the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Houston , and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study to test the hypothesis that HCV infection is associated with increased risk for malignancies of the blood and blood - forming tissues , related disorders , and thyroid cancer .
The study involved patients from U.S. Veterans Affairs health care facilities from 1997 - 2004 and included 146,394 individuals infected with HCV , and 572,293 not infected with HCV .
The research examined the risks of hematopoietic malignancies ( relating to the formation of blood cellular components ) , related lymphoproliferative precursor diseases ( referring to the proliferation of the bone marrow cells that give rise to lymphoid cells ) , and thyroid cancer .
There were 1,359 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , 165 cases of Waldenström macroglobulinemia ( a low grade lymphoma ) , 551 cases of cryoglobulinemia and 320 cases of thyroid cancer .
" We found a small but significant 20 percent to 30 percent increase in the risk of NHL [ non-Hodgkin lymphoma ] , including all subtypes , and an almost three - fold increased risk of the low - grade lymphoma subtype Waldenström macroglobulinemia in persons with HCV infection , " the authors report .
Low - grade lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly .
HCV infection was also associated with an increased risk of nonmalignant plasma cell disorders .
" We demonstrated that infection precedes development of these outcomes , and that the risk in individuals infected with HCV is consistently increased , with over five years of follow - up , " the authors continue .
The study found no significantly increased risk for other hematological malignancies .
The risk for thyroid cancer was not increased .
" Although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown , it is possible that screening of individuals infected with HCV could identify early stage lymphoproliferative conditions suitable for early intervention strategies , including chemoprevention trials on premalignant disease .
Future epidemiological and pathophysiological studies are needed to further explore the relationship between HCV and NHL , " the authors conclude .

Plantronics
In the perfect utopia that exists only inside my head , all cell phones and MP3 players incorporate A2DP , also known as stereo Bluetooth .
As a result , they 're all compatible with stereo Bluetooth headsets like the Plantronics Voyager 855 , which CNET rated 8/10 , and which Newegg currently has on sale for $ 57.99 , shipped .
That 's a pretty big savings over the $ 149.95 list price .
During business hours , the Voyager 855 functions as a fairly standard headset , albeit one with a cool sliding boom mic .
When you want to get your groove on , you just connect the second earpiece and presto : stereo earbuds .
Once you 've experienced the ecstasy of walking around with your phone in your pocket and music piping wirelessly into your head , you 'll never go back to corded headphones .
Just make sure your phone supports A2DP .
Many models do , but for some reason it's not available on all handsets ( cough Palm Centro cough ) .
And it 's pretty much AWOL on MP3 players , which mystifies me because ( as I may have mentioned ) wireless earbuds rawk .
Anyway , I 've used the Voyager 855 myself , and while I like the noise - canceling nature of the earbuds , I agree with CNET 's reviewer that sliding the boom mic does kill the fit .
Still , music sounds great , and $ 57.99 is less than you 'd pay for many non-stereo headsets .
And now , back to my personal utopia , where my 60 GB iPod touch supports A2DP .

Tucker refrains from calling Clinton ' vaginal - American ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

Print This Email This MSNBC's Tucker Carlson stopped himself from calling Democratic presidential frontrunner Sen. Hillary Clinton a " vaginal - American " in a discussion about how the candidate 's gender will impact her chances in the 2008 presidential primaries .
He also weighed in with his opinion that voters making their choice on the basis of gender " should n't be allowed to vote . "
" This is an amazing statistic .
94 percent of women say they'd be more likely to vote if a woman were on the ballot , " Carlson had said of a new poll from the Clinton camp .
" I think of all the times I 've voted for people just because they 're male ... we 've got some more genitalia , he 's getting my vote . "
" You did n't have a choice all those times you were voting , " responded guest Eugene Robinson of the Washington Post .
" When firsts happen they are significant .
They say something about the society -- how far its come and where it is . "
Later in the segment , the host asked if his guests thought that " people who are voting on the basis of gender solidarity ought to be allowed to vote in a perfect world ? "
" Of course they should n't be allowed to vote on those grounds , " he said , answering his own question .
" That 's moronic .
I 'm sorry , I know I 'm going to get bounced off the air for saying it but it 's true . "
Acknowledging that part of the female voting block 's support for Clinton is " loyalty to the Clintons , " Carlson added that the candidate was unfairly using her gender to garner votes .
" The Hillary campaign relentlessly pushes the glass ceiling argument , " he said .
" You should vote for her because she 's a woman -- they say that all the time . "
" At least call her a vaginal - American , " said conservative guest Cliff May , who heads the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies .
" Is that the new phrase ? " Carlson asked .
" I do n't think I can say that . "
" You should n't say that , " Robinson assured him .
The host later asked how , specifically , Clinton would differ from a male president .
" How is she going to be a different president if she 's a woman ?
I just do n't get that , " he said .
" I do n't think she will be , " said Robinson .
" But I think it will be significant if a woman is elected President of the United States , as it would be significant if an African American were elected ... it says something about the country . "
The remarks were first reported by Media Matters , which includes a full transcript of the segment at its website .

WASHINGTON 
The auction for rights to a highly valuable swath of the nation ’s airwaves will begin Thursday and is expected to include multibillion - dollar bids from the nation ’s two biggest wireless phone companies , Verizon and AT&T , as well as Google .
Although industry executives and analysts agree that Google is unlikely to win any licenses , the company already has an invaluable victory : in setting the auction rules , the Federal Communications Commission has forced the major telephone companies to open their wireless networks to a broader array of telephone equipment and Internet applications .
The radio spectrum licenses , which are to be returned from television broadcasters as they complete their conversion from analog to digital signals in February 2009 , are as coveted as oil reserves are to energy companies .
They will provide the winners with access to some of the best remaining spectrum  enabling them to send signals farther from a cell tower with far less power , through dense walls in cities , and over wider territories in rural areas that are now underserved .
And the licenses are on the auction block just as it is becoming obvious to industry players and investors that wireless broadband is rapidly becoming the next big thing , the mobile Internet .

The Senator beer was named by drinkers after Barack Obama
The close battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to secure the Democratic nomination for the US presidency is captivating many across the world .
The charismatic Illinois senator is drawing big crowds at campaign rallies in a phenomenon known as Obamamania .
Kenya , where Senator Obama 's father came from , is not immune from this either , but here , another Obama is riding on the crest of a wave .
This one , though , comes in the form of a brown bottle and is called Senator beer .
In many slums and low income areas , people who find beer too expensive often resort to cheap home brews .
But these potent drinks which include traditional spirits known as chang 'aa have on a several occasions proved lethal .
Some consumers have died and others have been blinded .
It 's believed brewers spike the beer with deadly additives .
So one brewery , East African Breweries Limited ( EABL ) , spotted a market opportunity for a cheap beer that is also safe .
The result : Senator Keg beer , known simply by drinkers as " Obama " .
The beer became an instant hit when it was launched in 2004 at about the same time as Barack Obama was elected as senator of Illinois .
Fears of alcoholism
The product has proved as popular as the US senator in the intervening years , but with more beer for less money there are fears it could contribute to a rise in alcoholism in Kenya .
EABL 's Corporate Affairs Director Ken Kariuki rejects this .
He says that normally poorer people are consuming drinks with an alcohol content of around 40 % .
By contrast Senator beer is only 6 % .
Barack Obama could be the first black president of the United States
" So you are almost forcing a responsible consumption of alcohol , only this time you 're packaging the product in a more affordable and hygienic manner , " Mr Kariuki explains .
But others are worried that cheap beer can create more alcoholics .
Dr Frank Njenga , chairman of the National Campaign against Drug Abuse , says more needs to be done to tackle alcohol abuse .
" Alcohol problems require the intervention by all the players , chief of which is the government through its agencies and also those in the industry , " he says .
Dr Njenga , who is also a prominent psychiatrist in Nairobi , says everyone must work together to combat the rising trend of alcohol consumption .
Certainly bar owners are not complaining .
On a good day , John Kameta , who owns the Bro Jimmoh bar in Nairobi , can make up to $ 100 from sales of Senator beer .
" With the high cost of living , people from across all income brackets are turning to Obama beer each evening , " he says .
So what do Kenyans make of the new liquid Obama ?
" I like the way it is served - from a jug , instead of a bottle .
Most people think you get a larger serving from a jug , " one devotee told me .
So while the outcome of the US elections may not matter as much in Kenya as it does in America , here every visit to the local watering hole is a vote of confidence in their Obama .
New TF2 PC Maps , Achievements and ' Large Scale ' Gameplay Shift Within 2 Months
Update : Valve 's Robin Walker has clarified that the new maps will definitely hit the PC , but are undecided for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Team Fortress 2 , which are only available in The Orange Box .
Original Story :
Two new maps for Valve 's Team Fortress 2 will hopefully arrive within the next two months , the studio has informed Shacknews .
One of the new arenas is a remake of Team Fortress Classic 's Badlands map , with an emphasis on more vertically - oriented gameplay due to the presence of control points on towering spires .
" Our estimate is that both these maps should be out within the next 2 months , " Valve employee Robin Walker told Shacknews .
" We expect to ship other new content before that . "
That other content includes the forthcoming Medic achievement pack , which will add several new achievements for the Medic as well as a significant gameplay tweak for the class .
" It 's a large scale modification to the core of the game , " Walker hinted .
" It 'll debut in a limited fashion through the Medic first , but it 'll be affecting all classes eventually . "
" We 're really looking forward to the community reaction , " he continued .
" We 're really excited about where TF2 will be going over the next year . "
For further details on the new Team Fortress 2 map , check back with Shacknews early next week for our hands - on impressions .
In addition , there are some brief TF2 Badlands impressions in the latest Shacknews ShackCast .
Unfortunately for TF2 maps.net user Buster Charlie , today 's news comes hot on the heels of his recently announced Badlands remake .
US warns citizens to keep clear of Guantanamo protests

I received a fairly disturbing message from the US Embassy in Brussels yesterday , a high - importance mass email warning all American citizens in Belgium not to go near a small Amnesty International demonstration that is happening this afternoon .
It ’s so unbelievable , I produce it here :

20080110 Warden Message – Demonstrations – January 10 , 2008
Spontaneous demonstrations take place in Belgium from time to time in response to world events or local developments .
We remind American citizens that even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possible escalate into violence .
American citizens are therefore urged to avoid the areas of demonstrations if possible , and to exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations .
American citizens should stay current with media coverage of local events and be aware of their surroundings at all times .
Upcoming demonstration information follows :
According to Belgian police , a demonstration is scheduled to take place on Friday , January 11 , 2008 on rue Guimard , across from the U.S. Embassy , between 2:30 – 4:00 PM .
The demonstration is being organized by Amnesty International to protest against Guantanamo prison .
The demonstration will encompass approximately 100 protestors .
American citizens are urged to avoid the area if possible and to exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations .
This Warden Message expires on January 11 , 2008 .
For the latest security information , Americans living and traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Department of State ’s Bureau of Consular Affairs Internet website at http://travel.state.gov, where the current Worldwide Caution and Consular Information Sheet for Belgium can be found .
Up - to - date information on security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll - free in the U.S. and Canada or , for callers outside the U.S. and Canada , a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444 .
These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time , Monday through Friday ( except U.S. federal holidays )
The U.S. Embassy in Brussels can be reached at +32-2-508.21.11 ; the after hours emergency number is the same ; the fax number is+32-2-513.04.09 .
The Embassy ’s web site , which includes consular information and the most recent messages to the American community in Belgium , is found at http://brussels.usembassy.gov.

It ’s hard to identify the most absurd part of this .
Is it the warning of a “ spontaneous demonstration ” that is planned ahead of time ?
Is it the idea that demonstrations occur spontaneously in Belgium , where nothing happens without dozens of meetings and extensive negotiations ?
Or is it that they are frightened of a small Amnesty International protest ?
Maybe it ’s the “ Importance : High ” tag on the email that takes the cake ?
My Belgian friends and colleagues are rightly offended .
Belgium is one of the most peaceful countries in the world , ranked 11th in the Global Peace Index ( compared to the US ’s 96th place ranking ) .
There has n’t been a seriously violent demonstration here since probably the 1960s .
It can be a bit dangerous crossing the streets in Brussels sometimes , but an Amnesty protest ?
Please .
One friend asked if US Embassy staff in Brussels are now receiving danger pay for this difficult posting .
It is just incredible the US Embassy put this out at all .
They are telling their own citizens to keep clear of a protest against Guantanamo , which is probably the most vivid symbol of the appalling disregard for human rights the US Administration has had since 9/11 .
And now we ’re even told not to freely assemble to protest our government ’s Constitution shredding ?
Though only half - American , I am completely embarrassed by this .
11 January marks the sixth anniversary of the first detainees being sent to Guantanamo , and demonstrations are happening outside other US embassies in other countries .
If Belgium is anything to go by , all US embassies are urging US citizens not to join these protests .
Of course , consumed by primary fever , the US media are probably going to miss the Guantanamo anniversary altogether .
Too bad .
It ’s a good opportunity to examine how conflict has been used to justify the serious erosion of human rights in recent years .
The depressing thing is , developments have gone so far that the government can now put out a disturbingly absurd statement , and no one takes any notice because the disturbingly absurd has become commonplace .

When I first got started programming I was shocked by the cluelessness of some of the Comp Sci grads that trickled through as interns and entry level coders .
A couple were really brilliant , but some never really got up to speed .
How could it be that I , with no real training , was coding circles around these guys on the job– even with only my very small amount of experience ?
Well , one answer to that is that the smart Comp Sci grads were probably all somewhere else doing much more interesting work ( and making more money ) than what I got stuck with in doing crappy business apps .
Another answer is that I was learning a single tool 24/7 and using it to accomplish the sort of things my corporate masters wanted me to do .
But Computer Science classes are not vocational training for that kind of work , so do n’t make the mistake of assuming that it should prepare people for it .
David Chisnell spells this out for us in a recent article :
“ A lot of dissatisfaction with computer science comes from the misplaced expectation that a computer science graduate will be a good programmer .
Such a graduate should have been exposed to at least half a dozen languages , but wo n’t necessarily have done anything particularly complicated with those languages .
She almost certainly wo n’t have any kind of deep understanding of the standard library available for a given platform .
This kind of comprehension comes only with experience .
She may have picked it up from other jobs or open source work , but not from her degree . ”
“ Computer science and software engineering are very different disciplines , and a lot of people seem to confuse the two .
Software engineering teaches the process of developing software , in terms of both tools and processes .
A computer science course briefly touches on these topics , in the same way that a materials physicist may learn something of mechanical engineering .
This does n’t make a computer scientist a software engineer , any more than it makes a physicist the best candidate for building a bridge . ”
For all the time and money you spend getting your degree , I sure hope you bypass the kind of creeps us “ street programmers ” run into when we ’re first getting our start .
You know … the sort of people that think the answer to everything is to waltz through the internet picking up pirated copies of somebody else ’s gigantic business application … .
Once you get established , you are still stuck with the terror of out - of - control development way too often .
At best you ’ll be stuck working with people that refuse to make tools to help them do their jobs– they ’re just always under the gun .
“ The shoemaker ’s children have no shoes , ” they blithely say .
Bob Warfield reiterates what ’s going on in these kinds of companies :
“ Many times what has happened is a company started out with a great idea and some knowledge of the domain .
They built a piece of software that is a very literal embodiment of their view of the domain .
So long as the whole domain and all the customers fit their view , life is good .
However , for most non-trivial ( i.e. interesting market size ) domains , nobody knows the whole domain .
You learn as you go .
Customers throw curve balls .
If the only way to adapt to that is to either keep adding tons of features to the software , or do expensive custom work on each deal , that ’s way too much friction to scale .
A domain specific language makes it possible to maneuver a bit at low cost and give customers what they want . ”
There are many ways to kill projects .
Easily , the number one killer is going to be scope creep .
( The most depressing sort is going to be scope creep caused by management that want a completely new system and then incrementally force you to make it just like their old system . )
Well … scope creep would n’t be that bad .
It ’s unanticipated shifts of scope that occur in a direction that ’s orthogonal to anything you ever anticipated .
Teams will implement awful hacks to keep a client happy enough to keep the money coming in .
Then , boom !
Their money dries up and you ’re suddenly dealing with people in a different region that have subtly different industries that they focus on .
And your team ca n’t adapt to the new needs fast enough to either swing the sale or keep them happy enough to stay with you .
There are few things more depressing than the pain of failure .
One of those things is– surprisingly – the pain of success … .
What do you do when you ’ve got lots of clients running your software– but they ’ve all got different versions and different modifications done to it ?
Untrained “ street programmers ” can get this far with luck and hard work , but they ( and their companies ) cannot grow beyond this point without developing tools to help them write their tools .
To do that , they need some serious Computer Science know - how .
And that ’s the bitter irony : the hell of real world development has , on the surface , little to do with what goes on in the Computer Science classroom .
But , to solve the problems we face here , we need the help of people that understand the implications of what gets taught there .

There has been a recent flurry of news articles that have made the conjecture that the Ron Paul campaign or his supporters are in possession of a botnet and are using it to generate spam emails for the candidate .
I have been in the business of computer technology for a long time and have good friends in the IT security business and we have discussed this at length .
Cui-bono ( who benefits )
I find it far more likely that this botnet spam attack is not the design of the Paul campaign or any of its supporters .
It is far more likely that this is the release of a first round of direct cyber attack against the Ron Paul campaign .
I base this opinion on the fact that the attack is becoming clearly targeted at the youtube videos of Ron Paul .
Youtube links to his videos are beginning to be inserted into the the body of these spam message and as a direct result the video's are being pulled by youtube for violation of their terms of use policy .
Source : http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/10/more-on-ron-pau.html
This attack method can do far more harm than good for the Ron Paul campaign .
I have consulted with some experts that I highly respect and they indicate that the likely source for the botnet attack is a paid operation originating from Eastern European or Asian organized crime organizations so I would venture that someone from another campaign that has some connections ordered this attack .
I expect that after these attackers have used this method to remove the best google and youtube videos touting the Ron Paul campaign , that the attack method will change and will then go after other key components of the campaign 's online strength such as the Web 2.0 communities .
These utilities will likely be spammed and the organizations using the applications will be banned from their use .
This is nefarious and demonstrates the kind of tactics that the establishment could use to serve their interest in stopping the advance of Ron Paul and the Revolution for freedom that he is leading as well as his Presidential bid .
I can only hope that the Ron Paul online army has some equally talented cyber warriors that can help stop this attack before it is ramped up even further .
It 's not the first time we 've seen diesel touted as a solution for more efficient vehicles , but Loremo AG 's new eponymously - titled vehicle may just have all of 'em beat -- if it can live up to its claims , that is .
According to the vehicle 's designers , in addition to diesel , they relied on engine efficiency , low weight , and minimal drag to boost the fuel - efficiency , which they say could top out at lofty 150 miles per gallon .
With numbers like those , it should come as no surprise that Loremo's also entered the car in the Automotive X - Prize competition but , unlike most of the other entrants , this one will apparently actually be available to the general public relatively soon .
That 'll supposedly come sometime next year , with Europeans the first in line to get their hands on the vehicle for the relative bargain price of € 15,000 ( or $ 22,000 ) -- a redesigned North American version is then set to follow a year later .
As if that was n't enough Loremo's also promising a spiffier 3 - cylinder GT version that 'll run you $ 30,000 , and both hybrid and fully electric versions , although those are only described as " in the works . "
The Historical Origins of Africa ’s Underdevelopment
Nathan Nunn
Slavery , according to historical accounts , played an important role in Africa ’s underdevelopment .
It fostered ethnic fractionalisation and undermined effective states .
The largest numbers of slaves were taken from areas that were the most underdeveloped politically at the end of the 19th century and are the most ethnically fragmented today .
Recent research suggests that without the slave trades , 72 % of Africa ’s income gap with the rest of the world would not exist today .
Africa ’s poor economic performance is one of the largest puzzles in growth and development economics .
A large literature has emerged trying to explain the source of Africa ’s growth tragedy .
See for example Easterly and Levine ( 1997 ) , or Sachs and Warner ( 1997 ) .
African historians have documented the detrimental effects that the slave trades had on the institutions and structures of African societies .
Historical evidence from case studies show how the slave trade caused political instability , weakened states , promoted political and social fragmentation , and resulted in a deterioration of domestic legal institutions .
Between 1400 and 1900 , the African continent experienced four simultaneous slave trades .
The largest and most well - known is the trans - Atlantic slave trade where , beginning in the fifteenth century , slaves were shipped from West Africa , West Central Africa , and Eastern Africa to the European colonies in the New World .
The three other slave trades -- the trans - Saharan , Red Sea , and Indian Ocean slave trades -- are much older and predate the trans -Atlantic slave trade .
During the trans - Saharan slave trade , slaves were taken from south of the Saharan desert and shipped to Northern Africa .
In the Red Sea slave trade , slaves were taken from inland of the Red Sea and shipped to the Middle East and India .
In the Indian Ocean slave trade , slaves were taken from Eastern Africa and shipped either to the Middle East , India or to plantation islands in the Indian Ocean .
In a recent paper , I explore empirically whether these detrimental effects of the slave trades can explain part of Africa 's current underdevelopment .
1
I do this by first constructing estimates of the number of slaves taken from each country in Africa between 1400 and 1900 .
The estimates are constructed by combining data of the number of slaves shipped from each African port or region with data from historical documents reporting the ethnic identities of slaves taken from Africa .
If the slave trades are partly responsible for Africa 's current underdevelopment , then looking across countries within Africa , one should observe that the parts of Africa that are the poorest today are also the areas from which the largest number of slaves were taken in the past .
My research shows that this is indeed the case .
The countries from which the most slaves were taken ( taking into account differences in country size ) are today the poorest in Africa .
This can be seen in figure 1 , which shows the relationship between the number of slaves taken between 1400 and 1900 and average real per capita GDP measured in 2000 .
As the figure clearly shows , the relationship is extremely strong .
As well , the relationship remains robust when many other key determinants of economic development are taken into account .
An alternative explanation for the relationship is that the parts of Africa from which the largest number of slaves were taken were initially the most underdeveloped .
Today , because these characteristics persist , these parts of Africa continue to be underdeveloped and poor .
My research examines this alternative hypothesis by testing whether it was in fact the initially least developed parts of Africa that engaged most heavily in the slave trades .
I find that the data and the historical evidence suggest that , if anything , it was the parts of Africa that were initially the most developed , not least developed , that supplied the largest number of slaves .
I also use instrumental variables to identify the causal effect of the slave trade on economic development .
As instruments , I use distances from each country to the locations of the demand for slaves as instruments to estimate the causal effect of the slave trades on economic development .
The instrumental variables estimates confirmed the OLS estimates , suggesting that increased extraction during the slave trades resulted in worse economic performance .
Although much research remains to be done before we have a clear and deep understanding of exactly how and why the slave trades have been so detrimental for economic development , my initial analysis of the data is consistent with historic accounts suggesting that the slave trades impeded the formation of broader ethnic groups , leading to ethnic fractionalisation , and that the slave trades resulted in a weakening and underdevelopment of political structures .
The countries from which the largest numbers of slaves were taken are also the areas that had the most underdeveloped political structures at the end of the 19th century , and they are also the areas that are the most ethnically fragmented today .
Using the estimates of the impact of the slave trades on economic development , I am able to provide an estimate of how much more developed Africa would be if the slave trades had not taken place .
The average per capita income level of the countries in Africa is $ 1,834 , measured in 2000 .
This is significantly lower than the income for the rest of the world ( which is $ 8,809 ) , and it is even much lower than the income of other developing countries ( which is $ 4,868 ) .
2
Conclusions
According to my calculations , if the slave trades had not occurred , then 72 % of the average income gap between Africa and the rest of the world would not exist today , and 99 % of the income gap between Africa and the rest of the underdeveloped world would not exist .
In terms of economic development , Africa would not look any different from the other developing countries in the world .
This finding is striking .
These results may not be the final and definitive explanation for the origins of Africa ’s severe underdevelopment , but they do provide very strong evidence that much of Africa ’s poor performance can be explained by its history , which is characterised by over 400 years of slave raiding .

Why Do n’t Sports Teams Use Randomization ?
A Guest Post
Here ’s the latest guest post from Yale economist and law professor Ian Ayres .
His past posts can be found here and here .
In a recent post , I mentioned that when playing poker , I use my watch as a crude random number generator to tell me when to bluff .
While there are lots of sports in which it ’s best to play a somewhat random strategy , that does n’t mean that every possible play is equally likely .
But it does mean , for example , that when it ’s third - and - 2 in football , the offense wants to have some possibility of passing to keep the defense honest .
Levitt and others have tested the degree to which professional tennis and soccer players are successful at playing randomized strategies .
But it remains a mystery to me why coaches do n’t have random number generators ( any laptop would do ) to help them pick the next pitch in baseball , or the next play they will call in football .
Norv
Turner would pick the probability of running or passing , and then let the computer decide which it would be .
But an even bigger puzzle is why teams do n’t exploit the other powerful use of randomization .
To my knowledge , no sports team in the history of humankind has ever run a random control trial to figure out which strategies work the best .
( I make this extravagant claim in hopes of provoking you all into providing some counterexamples . )
Randomized studies are the gold standard of medical testing , and they ’re now the hottest thing in Internet ads .
Want to know whether your Web banner for beer should say “ Tastes Great ” or “ Less Filling ” ?
Run a randomized test in which half the people see one and half the people see the other at random , and then sit back and watch whether one ad generates more sales .
I ran just this kind of test on Google Adwords to help choose the title of a book ( shameless pitch ) I was writing .
When I started writing it , I loved the title , “ The End of Intuition . ”
But in a randomized test , “ Super Crunchers ” had a 63 percent higher click - through rate .
So why do n’t sports teams run ( more ) randomized experiments ?
The Boston Red Sox are famous for relying on number crunching to gain a competitive edge .
But why do n’t they proactively make some powerful data by creating randomized treatment and control groups ?
They could use their minor league teams , for instance , to figure out whether catchers or pitchers make better calls .
They could even have a randomized trial of randomization — they could randomly assign the pitches for half the at - bats to be called in the traditional way ( by the coach or the catcher ) and the other half could be called by a random strategy established in advance .
It would be a double - blind study , because neither the pitcher nor the hitter would need to know which system called the pitch .
If it turned out that the random strategy reduced the batting average of your opponents , that would be pretty strong evidence that it was a better strategy .
Or you could run an experiment to find out whether football teams should go for it more often on fourth down .
Economist David Romer has crunched numbers to suggest that professional football teams should go for it fourth down a lot more than they currently do .
His proposed optimal strategy is summarized in the following graph , found at the end of his paper :
Amazingly , the data suggests that if it ’s fourth down and your team has the ball on the opponent ’s 33 - yard line , you should go for it even if you have 9 yards left for a first down .
NFL coaches have resisted Romer ’s advice ( though Pulaski Academy has started acting on it ) .
But this is another area in which a little randomized testing could go a long way to help figure out what works .
There are thousands upon thousands of college and high school games , but we collectively go for decades without figuring out whether simple changes in strategy could really produce better outcomes .
If you know of any randomized tests of sports strategy , please let me know .
And if you are a coach and want to run a test , feel free to contact me .
I ’d be happy to help design and evaluate a test .
More and more ISP's are limiting and throttling BitTorrent traffic on their networks .
By throttling BitTorrent traffic the speed of BitTorrent downloads decrease , and high speed downloads are out of the question .
The list of ISP ’s that limit BitTorrent traffic , or plan to do so is growing every day , and according to the BBC , the ‘ bandwidth war ’ has begun .
Are you not sure if your traffic is being throttled Check the list of bad ISP’s .
But there is a solution .
Encrypting your torrents will prevent throttling ISP ’s from shaping your traffic .
I will explain how to enable encryption in Azureus , uTorrent , and Bitcomet , the three most popular torrent clients .
What does encryption Do ?
The RC4 encryption obfuscates not only the header but the entire stream .
This means that it ’s very hard for your ISP to detect that the traffic you are generating comes from BitTorrent .
Note that RC4 uses more CPU time than the plain encryption or no encryption .
It is however harder to identify for traffic shaping devices
How can I do this ?
This is different for all clients ; check the setting for your favorite client below .
Azureus
1. Go to : Tools > Options > Connection > Transport Encryption
2. Check the ‘ require encrypted transport ’ box .
3. Choose RC4 in the ‘ minimum encryption ’ dropdown box
note that RC4 uses more CPU time than the plain encryption or no encryption .
It is however harder to identify for traffic shaping devices
4 . You can choose to tick the ‘ Allow non-encrypted outgoing connections if encrypted connection attempt fails ’ box .
This will ensure compatibility with clients that are not using encryption .
However , it makes it easier for your ISP to detect BitTorrent traffic .
I recommend that you try to tick this box first .
If you are still not getting proper speeds untick it
5 . Tick the ‘ Allow non-encrypted incoming connections ’ box
That ’s it , your BitTorrent traffic is encrypted now .
Bitcomet
1. Go to : Options > Preferences > Advanced > Connection
2. Go to : ‘ Protocol encryption ’
You can choose between ‘ auto detect ’ and ‘ always ’ .
Auto detect will give you more connections but offers less protection against traffic shapers .
I would recommend to try auto detect first , if that does n’t increase your speeds you need to switch to always
That ’s it , your BitTorrent traffic is encrypted now .
uTorrent
1. Go to : Options > Preferences > BitTorrent
2. Go to ‘ Protocol encryption ’ , you can choose between ‘ enabled ’ and ‘ forced ’ .
‘ Enabled ’ will give you more connections but offers less protection against traffic shapers .
I would recommend to try ‘ enabled ’ first , if that does n’t increase your speeds you need to swich to ‘ forced ’ .
3. Ticking ‘ Allow legacy incoming connections ’ allows non ecrypted clients to connect to you .
This improves compatibility between clients but makes you more vulnerable to traffic shapers .
I would recommend to tick this box , but if that does n’t increase your speeds , untick it !
That ’s it , your BitTorrent traffic is encrypted now .
Good luck and happy torrenting
Identity
Theft is one of the worst things that can happen to your personal finances .
When someone assumes your identity they can ruin your credit score and destroy your financial reputation for years .
Identity theft is a growing crime , but there are some important measures you can take to avoid having your identity stolen .
How to Avoid Identity Theft
The Federal Trade Commission maintains an Identity Theft Awareness website that outlines three important steps for avoiding identity theft : Deter Identity Theft , Detect Identity Theft , and Defend Against Identity Theft .
Using these three steps can save you from an expensive and damaging experience .
Deter Identity
Theft
The first step and most effective way to prevent identity theft is to deter identity thieves .
Do n’t give thieves a way to get your personal or financial information .
This includes being vigilant with any personal and financial data .
These tips will help :
Secure your financial data under lock and key .
Do n’t carry your Social Security Card in your purse or wallet .
Shred , burn , or destroy old financial or personal documents when no longer needed .
Use secure computing methods to deter identity theft .
Use secure passwords and change them often .
Avoid Giving Information Over the Phone – Ex : Jury Duty ID Theft Scam
A new type of Identity Theft currently making the rounds deals with jury duty .
Thieves are identifying themselves as U.S. Court jury coordinators , and contacting people to inform them they have been selected for jury duty .
After informing the person they have been selected for jury duty , they ask to verify personal information over the telephone .
Of course , most people state they have never received a jury summons , and the “ jury coordinator ” asks to verify their name , address , birth date , and Social Security Number so they can cancel the arrest warrant that has been issued in their name .
They may also ask to verify credit card numbers .
This scam works on intimidation by threatening people with a fictitious arrest warrant .
Do n’t fall for it !
The court system will not ask you for your personal information .
If you receive a call like this , ask them for a phone number where you can call them back .
Then verify that information is the same as your local court .
If you receive a similar call , contact your local police station , and the FBI .
This scam has been verified by the FBI .
Avoid IRS Tax Scams and Identity Theft
There is a phishing scam going around purporting to be from the IRS .
In this e-mail , they inform the recipient they are entitled to refunds of $ 92.35 or some other amount due to a calculation error on a past tax return .
These e-mails are not from the IRS ; they are from thieves who are attempting to extract your personal information to steal your identity and rack up thousands of dollars in charges they will make on your credit .
In this e-mail example , recipients were advised to go to a link and enter their identifying information that would normally be on their tax form , ( i.e. , name , address , DOB , SSN , etc. ) in order to process their refund request .
This email is BOGUS .
The IRS never sends e-mails requesting personal information ; they always send letters advising the individual of a pending problem .
These scams always turn up with renewed force during tax season , when many recipients act without thinking .
Never enter your identifying information into a website without understanding exactly why you are doing it and where the information is going .
For these types of e-mails , it is best to NEVER click on the link in the e-mail .
Instead , type the url directly into the web address bar in your browser .
From the IRS website :
Phishing .
Phishing is a technique used by identity thieves to acquire personal financial data in order to gain access to the financial accounts of unsuspecting consumers , run up charges on their credit cards or apply for new loans in their names .
These Internet - based criminals pose as representatives of a financial institution and send out fictitious e-mail correspondence in an attempt to trick consumers into disclosing private information .
Sometimes scammers pose as the IRS itself .
In recent months , some taxpayers have received e-mails that appear to come from the IRS .
A typical e-mail notifies a taxpayer of an outstanding refund and urges the taxpayer to click on a hyperlink and visit an official - looking Web site .
The Web site then solicits a social security and credit card number .
In a variation of this scheme , criminals have used e-mail to announce to unsuspecting taxpayers they are “ under audit ” and could make things right by divulging selected private financial information .
Taxpayers should take note :
The IRS does not use e-mail to initiate contact with taxpayers about issues related to their accounts .
If a taxpayer has any doubt whether a contact from the IRS is authentic , the taxpayer should call 1-800 - 829-1040 to confirm it .
The IRS also gives information on how to report suspected tax fraud activity .
Detect Identity
Theft
The next step is to detect identity theft if it has occurred .
The more quickly you discover identity theft , the easier it is to limit the damage to your credit and the easier it is to get the situation resolved .
Monitor your credit report and look for errors .
Everyone is eligible for 1 free credit report per year from each of the three major credit bureaus – Equifax , Experian , and TransUnion .
You can order these free credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com .
The most effective way to monitor your credit is to stagger your free credit reports and get a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus every 4 months .
Here are several ways you can detect identity theft :
Use an identity theft protection company to monitor your credit reports , scores , and financial accounts .
( See trial offers below ) .
Use a credit monitoring service to monitor your credit reports .
Receiving unexpected bills for items you did not purchase .
Calls or letters from bill collectors or creditors for items you did not purchase .
No longer receiving expected bills .
Denials of credit when you should be qualified .
You should make it a habit to review your financial statements on a monthly basis and get into the habit of getting your free credit reports .
Identity theft monitoring offers :
The following commercial identity theft monitoring companies offer free trials and discounts :
Credit Karma – free service to monitor your credit reports .
– free service to monitor your credit reports .
GoFreeCredit.com – 30 day trial offer .
These offers may help you prevent , discover , and repair identity theft problems .
Defend Against Identity
Theft
If you notice any outward signs of identity theft , take action immediately !
The first step is to place fraud alerts on your credit reports .
Then take the following actions :
Review your credit reports carefully to determine where the security breach occurred .
Close accounts that have been tampered with , or that you suspect may have been accessed fraudulently .
Report the theft to the Federal Trade Commission .
File a police report where the theft took place .
Most creditors will want proof that a crime has been committed .
You can also place a credit freeze which will prevent anyone from opening new accounts in your name .
This will not stop them from using accounts which have already been opened , which is why it is important to close any account that has been tampered with .
Special steps should be taken to help protect children against identity theft .
Protect Yourself Against Different Identity Theft Methods
Thieves are a clever bunch , and can get quite creative when it comes to finding ways to separate you from your hard - earned cash .
These are several of the methods criminals use to steal your identity :
Phishing : a high - tech scam that uses e-mail or websites to deceive you into disclosing your credit card numbers , bank account information , social security number , passwords , or other sensitive information .
How to protect yourself : Companies will never ask for sensitive information via e-mail .
Never click on links in suspicious e-mails ; instead , type the url into the address bar .
Espionage :
The act of obtaining , delivering , transmitting , communicating , or receiving information about the national defense with an intent , or reason to believe , that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage if any foreign nation .
How to protect yourself :
In this example , you can consider yourself the United States , and the national defense is the protection of your personal and financial information .
Espionage would be equivalent to identity theft – or any attempt to obtain your personal information to use against you or to benefit someone else .
Defend your personal information as you would defend your life .
Hacking : Illegally accessing other people ’s computer systems for destroying , disrupting , or carrying out illegal activities on the network or computer systems .
How to protect yourself : Hackers will attempt to access your personal information to steal your identity , or simply to cause destruction to the system .
This could stem from an attack on your personal computer or a commercial computer system that harbors your information .
The best method of preventing this is to maintain up to date firewall and anti-virus measures and scan all downloads and executable files before opening them .
Malicious Logic : Hardware , software , or firmware capable of performing an unauthorized function on an information system .
How to protect yourself : Examples of malicious logic include AdWare , SpyWare , Trojan Horses , Keyloggers , and other similar programs designed to record information or cause damage to your system .
The best method of preventing this is to regularly scan your hard drive for these programs , maintain up to date anti-virus measures , and scan all downloads and executable files before opening them .
Social Engineering : A euphemism for non-technical or low - technology means – such as lies , impersonation , tricks , bribes , blackmail , and threats – used to attack information systems .
For example , an unauthorized person who attempts to gain passwords by posing as a service technician with an urgent access problem .
How to protect yourself :
The majority of identity thieves know the criminal responsible for stealing their identity .
Often , their information is stolen by people piecing together bits of their information until they are able to gather enough information that they can assume their identity to apply for credit , take out loans , write checks , and otherwise ruin your financial well - being .
Always safeguard your personal information around everyone – neighbors , friends , co-workers , and even family members .

Keep Your Sensitive Documents Safe
All things being equal , a thief will go after a soft target before they go after a hard target .
So take precautions at home and away from home .
Keep Confidential Documents Under Lock and Key
You want to ensure your important documents are locked up and not easily accessible by anyone but you .
This includes all your important paperwork , such as your :
Tax documents and records
Financial paperwork – credit cards , bank account numbers & statements , investment statements , etc .
Identity papers such as birth certificates , wedding certificates , professional licenses , and passports
And it should go without saying , but if you keep a lot of cash at home , you should hide it safely .
Tips to Stay Safe from Cyber Crime
If you enjoy shopping online , you can get some great deals , save time , and avoid frenzied crowds during the holidays .
However , making purchases with the convenience of an Internet connection is n’t without risks .
If someone steals your debit or credit card number , they can go on a shopping spree until you wise up , report the fraud , and change your account numbers .
If an identity thief nabs your Social Security number they can open up new accounts or loans in your name , buy expensive stuff , and leave you with past due bills and a botched credit report .
Tip # 1 : Shop Using a Secure Connection
Be sure to secure your wifi signal at home , and only use secure wifi when away from your home .
Try to avoid logging into your financial or other important accounts over an unsecured wifi signal .
It ’s better to either do this from home , or to log in using a VPN ( virtual private network ) .
When you go online in a public place , like a coffee shop or library , remember that hackers who share the Wi-Fi connection can track the websites you visit and what you type .
That ’s why it ’s dangerous to make online purchases or enter any private information on an unsecure connection .
Instead , do your shopping from a secure connection at home .
Another option is to make purchases using your mobile phone — or to tether a device to your phone — because mobile data is encrypted , which makes it much safer than a public Wi -Fi connection .
Tip # 2 : Purchase from Trusted Web Sites
When you find something you want to buy online , consider the reputation of the website .
If you ’re unfamiliar with the company or are n’t sure if it ’s safe , do n’t make a purchase just because the price is low .
Also , do n’t follow a link in an email to an online store because it could be controlled by a cyber- criminal who simply wants your confidential data .
Type the website address directly into your browser to make sure you ’re going to the right site .
Tip # 3 : Use Unique Passwords
Strong passwords are a requirement for secure computing .
If you need to create an online account to make a purchase from a website , be sure to create a new , unique password .
As tempting as it is to use the same password over and over for all your online accounts , it ’s very dangerous .
A thief who steals one password puts all your accounts at risk .
I recommend using a password manager to create and store strong passwords that have no easy way of being guessed .
Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters , numbers , and symbols .
Also be sure not to use a word that can book looked up in the dictionary .
Password examples :
Terrible – Password
Better ( but still not great because it is close to a dictionary word ) – [ email protected ] $ $ wo3d
Best – # [ email protected ] ) ( #%[ email protected ]
Tip # 4 : Look for Data Encryption
Once you load up a web site ’s shopping cart , make sure that you enter your personal data , like your address and credit card number on an encrypted web page .
Encryption is a security measure that scrambles your information while it ’s in cyberspace and requires a key to unscramble it on the receiving end .
You ’ll know a web page is safe when the “ http ” in the web address changes to “ https ” ( the “ s ” stands for secure ) .
Also , look for a locked padlock icon on the page that you can click for additional security information .
Tip # 5 : Use a Credit Card
When you make online purchases , always use a credit card instead of a debit card .
Credit cards offer much more protection if someone steals your number and makes fraudulent purchases without your knowledge .
If you ’re uncomfortable entering your credit card number on a website , do n’t swear off online shopping .
Some card issuers offer virtual credit cards , which are designed to be used online in place of your real credit card number .
A virtual card has a temporary number that can only be used once or with a specific merchant , so a criminal would be out of luck if they stole it .
You can also use a virtual credit card number , which allows you to shop online without exposing your credit card number to vendors .
Tip # 6 : Review Your Account Statements
It ’s important to review each of your bank and credit card account statements at least once a month .

As you all know by now , I am currently teaching the Scheme programming language to my 2nd year students as a means to master the functional programming paradigm .
I started four weeks ago with a general introduction on programming paradigms and on the necessity to at least know the most important ones in order to become a decent programmer .
As my students had already studied imperative and object - oriented programming become coming to my class , I offered them to teach functional programming ( using Scheme ) , logic programming ( using Prolog in principle ) and scripting ( using Ruby ) .
This first lecture can be downloaded here .
The following week , I introduced Scheme by putting a lot of accent on the evaluation of expression and the definition of simple ( mathematical functions ) .
The lecture , which is available here , was followed by a lab sheet where the students were introduced to DrScheme and were asked to write a number of simple functions ( like fahrenheit -> celcius ) .
The next lecture was on recursion and I focussed on a number of mathematical functions like factorial , fibonacci , square root using Newton ’s successive approximation etc .
I spent some time introducing the concept of tail - recursion to them as well as the tail - recursion optimization that Scheme has to do .
As an example , this :
( define ( o+ n m )
( cond ( ( zero ? m ) n )
( else ( o+ ( add1 n ) ( sub1 m ) ) ) ) )
runs in constant space ( i.e. there are no recursive function calls at runtime ) even though it is expressed recursively .
During the lab , the students implemented and traced a number of recursive functions ( using the tracing facilities found in MzScheme ) .
They implemented o+’s friends , o- , o* , o/ , o^ , o= , o< and o > ( corresponding , of course , to our usual + , - , * , / , ^ , = , < and > ) using tail - recursion so that they run as quickly as possible .
The last lecture which I had last Friday was on pairs and lists , the most fundamental compound data structures found in Scheme .
I introduced them to car and cdr and showed them a number of fundamental algorithms acting on lists ( like length ) .
During the lab , I asked the students to implement a simple database of students and marks and this is inspired by what I read in Practical Common Lisp .
My observations
My lectures have been cool up to now .
The students are lively and responsive to my jokes and “ parentheses ” .
The labs also are going on nicely with students who are really learning new things and having fun in the process .
It ’s too early to say whether they ’ll become better programmers eventually but I feel they are on the right track …
What We Like Uses five stages of filtering
Easy to install
Many say water tastes very clean What We Don't Like Takes up a lot of space under the sink
A highly efficient system , and also an attractive option , the filtering system is designed to be placed under the sink but can also be placed in a basement or attached garage with the water routed to the sink for easy dispensing with the included faucet .
Along with the typical lead and other heavy metals , bacteria , and chlorine , this removes as many as 1,000 different unwanted contaminants from the water .
The CDC notes that no filter can eliminate all contaminants , and many are specialized .﻿﻿
To know what contaminants need to be removed , certified labs can test water from private wells or cisterns , but it ’s easier for consumers who get water from their city because a Consumer Confidence Report is sent annually with your water bill .
This filtering system uses five separate stages of filtering to remove 99 percent of contaminants .
It has a sediment filter , two stages of carbon filters , a reverse osmosis filter , and a coconut fiber filter .
Filters need to be changed at different intervals ; the first three last 6 - 12 months while the two stages can last 2 - 4 years .
Installation is designed to be a DIY project , but specialized tools may be required to install the faucet if there is n’t already a hole drilled in the sink or counter that can accommodate the new faucet .
Still , most reviewers like that the installation instructions were very clear and that the system was relatively quick and easy to install .
Post columnist compares ' Christianized ' GOP to hypocrisy of KKK Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday December 19 , 2007

The GOP 's clamor to identify itself as a party of Christian piety has failed to include some key elements of the faith -- namely Christian principles , according to a Washington Post columnist who says modern Republicans recall the hypocrisy of the Ku Klux Klan .
" As Christians across the world prepare to celebrate the birth of Jesus , it 's a fitting moment to contemplate the mountain of moral , and mortal , hypocrisy that is our Christianized Republican Party , " writes the Post 's Harold Meyerson , who is also executive editor of The American Prospect .
" My concern is n't the rift that has opened between Republican political practice and the vision of the nation 's Founders ... it's the gap between the teaching of the Gospels and the preachings of the Gospel 's Own Party that has widened past the point of absurdity ... "
That gap , according to Meyerson , is particularly visible when it comes to GOP stances on torture .
" Virtually the entire Republican House delegation opposed the ban on waterboarding , " he writes .
" Among the Republican presidential candidates , only Huckabee and the not-very - religious John McCain have come out against torture , while only libertarian Ron Paul has questioned the doctrine of preemptive war . "
But the columnist says that the issue of illegal immigration most profoundly highlights what he believes is a vast disconnect between Republicans ' proclaimed faith and their real - world policy positions .
" The Bible is n't big on immigrant documentation , " he continues .
" ' Thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him , ' Exodus says the Lord told Moses on Mount Sinai , ' for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt . ' "
Yet , Meyerson writes , " the distinctive cry coming from the Republican base this year is n't simply to control the flow of immigrants across our borders but to punish the undocumented immigrants already here , children and parents alike . "
Beliefs of the universally Christian membership of the Ku Klux Klan were similarly at odds with Bibilical teaching , he says .
" We 've seen this kind of Christianity before in America .
It 's more tribal than religious , and it surges at those times when our country is growing more diverse and economic opportunity is not abounding , " the column continues .
" At its height in the 1920s , the Ku Klux Klan was chiefly the political expression of nativist Protestants upset by the growing ranks of Catholics in their midst .
It 's difficult today to imagine KKKers thinking of their mission as Christian , but millions of them did . "
Concludes the columnist , " The most depressing thing about the Republican presidential race is that the party 's rank and file require their candidates to grow meaner with each passing week .
And now , inconveniently , inconsiderately , comes Christmas , a holiday that could n't be better calibrated to expose the Republicans ' rank , fetid hypocrisy . "

Mughniyeh was wanted in connection with a series of attacks
Mughniyeh is widely believed to be behind a wave of Western hostage - taking in Lebanon during the 1980s .
He had been in hiding for years and was high on US and Israeli wanted lists .
The Israeli prime minister 's office later issued a statement rejecting " the attempt by terror groups to attribute to it any involvement " in the killing .
Mughniyeh , in his late 40s , is variously described as special operations or intelligence chief of Hezbollah 's secretive military wing , the Islamic Resistance .
Correspondents say his death is a significant blow to Hezbollah , which battled Israel in the 2006 Lebanon war , and its Iranian and Syrian backers .
Neighbourhood in shock
Syrian police kept media and other onlookers well away from the scene of the overnight blast in the well - to - do Kafar Soussa district .
With all pride we declare a great jihadist leader of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon joining the martyrs
Hezbollah's Manar TV
Notorious ' terror mastermind '
" Scores of police and intelligence officers rushed to the site .
People in the neighbourhood are shocked , " said one resident quoted by Reuters news agency .
" We saw security officers hauling the body away , " said one witness quoted by Reuters news agency .
Hezbollah - owned Manar TV in Beirut announced the death saying : " With all pride we declare a great jihadist leader of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon joining the martyrs ... the brother commander hajj Imad Mughniyeh " .
" After a life full of jihad , sacrifices and accomplishments ... he died a martyr at the hands of the Israeli Zionists , " it quoted a Hezbollah statement saying .
Later , the Syrian government confirmed Mughniyeh had been killed and said investigations were still underway to find the perpetrators .
IMAD MUGHNIYEH
Born southern Lebanon 1962 Indicted for 1985 hijack of TWA airliner Accused of involvement in 1990s Buenos Aires bombings On FBI Most Wanted list since 2001
Who are Hezbollah ?
" Syria , which condemns this cowardly terrorist act , expresses condolences to the martyr family and to the Lebanese people , " Interior Minister Bassam Abdul - Majeed said in a statement .
Iran also condemned the killing , praising Mughniyeh as a martyr and describing the attack as " yet another brazen example of organised state terrorism by the Zionist regime " .
Hezbollah said a funeral service would be held in its stronghold in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Thursday .
The city has been tense ahead of a mass rally also on Thursday to commemorate three years since the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri .
There have been repeated clashes between supporters of the pro-Western government and the opposition , which includes Hezbollah .
High - profile attacks
Hezbollah was founded in 1982 by a group of Shia Muslim clerics after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon .
It has emerged in recent years as a major political and military force in Lebanon , after military successes against Israel .
Shia militants who went on to become members are thought to have planned some of the most high - profile kidnappings and attacks of the 1980s , including the 1983 suicide bombings in Beirut that killed hundreds of US and French service personnel .
Mughniyeh was among several suspects indicted in the US for the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner in which a US Navy diver was killed .
Israel believes he was involved in planning the 1992 bombing of Israel 's embassy in Argentina in which 29 people were killed , and the blast at a Buenos Aires Jewish centre two years later that killed 95 .
The Israeli government , which has been accused of a series of assassinations of its enemies in various countries over the years , stopped short of an outright denial that it had killed Mughniyeh .
HAVE YOUR SAY
As a Syrian citizen , I have the right to be scared that Israel could bomb many sites inside the country Khalil , Syria
" Israel rejects the attempt by terror groups to attribute to it any involvement in this incident , " Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's office said in a statement .
Israel was still investigating all reports as they emerged , it added .
But a former head of Israel 's Mossad secret service , Danny Yatom , called the killing " a big achievement for the free world against terrorist organisations . "
A spokesman for the US state department , Sean McCormack , described Mughniyeh as a " cold - blooded killer , a mass murderer and a terrorist responsible for countless innocent lives lost " .
" The world is a better place without this man in it , " he added .
" One way or another he was brought to justice . "
And if , say , there 's a scandal or illness among the two remaining Republican candidates ahead of Paul in delegates , he 'll be in a pretty good political position for the convention in St. Paul .
But Wednesday he struck a different note .
" I will stay in as long as my supporters want me to , " the Texas congressman promised CNN .
" And I say as long as the number of volunteers continues to grow , and the money comes in , and there are primaries out there , and they want me to be involved , I am going to stay involved . "
His vocal online supporters have been less evident , effusive and at times abusive in the last couple of weeks .
But now they have reason to refocus themselves too .
The 72 - year - old , 10 - term Republican congressman has just vowed to continue his current campai gn for the Republican presidential nomination .
There 's been some confusion in recent days since Paul sounded like he was , in effect , withdrawing to refocus his political efforts on a well - funded House primary challenger in his home Texas district near Houston on March 4 .
tonight in records of the Federal Election Commission ?
Of all the Republican candidates left in the field at the end of January none other than Ron Paul had the most cash in hand -- some $ 6 million .
And , like a true conservative , Paul reported not a penny in debt .
So he 's got the money to keep his campaign going , despite being at loggerheads on many issues with fellow GOP candidates .
And more funds flowing in each day from his loyal followers , despite being largely ignored by the major media , being barred by Fox News from a debate and receiving short shrift in speaking time there .
That 's not likely to have much impact in the actual GOP voting , which Sen.
John McCain has almost wrapped up .
Paul has been drawing in the single - digits recently , getting 5 % of the Wisconsin vote and 7 % in Washington state this week .
He did score a couple of second place finishes , including the Nevada and Montana caucuses , and beat Rudy Giuliani in Iowa and Fred Thompson in New Hampshire .
But his new re-affirmation of an active candidacy will be exciting news for hundreds of thousands of his diverse supporters scattered about the country in some 1,400 meet - up groups that demonstrate for him and raise money in numerous imaginative ways , including hotties 4 Ron Paul pin-up calendars .
Their devotion and noticeable online enthusiasm had waned in recent weeks after Paul forced Mitt Romney from the race and then spent more time in his own district .
Starting last summer the seemingly spontaneous assembling of hundreds of thousands of Paul supporters , many new to politics , has been one of the more remarkable aspects of the current political season .
Although the major media have consistently treated him as a fringe candidate , Paul has raised more money recently and outlasted several more famous Republican competitors once given a good chance of winning the nomination .
In December , the Paul campaign broke the online one - day fundraising record by taking in $ 6 million and made Paul the most successful GOP fundraiser in the fourth quarter with nearly $ 20 million in donations .
And he was the only Republican candidate to increase his take during each quarter of 2007 .
So far this quarter , Paul 's website reports in excess of $ 6 million more in donations , which the candidate said he would use to drive what he called a movement .
In the CNN interview he portrayed the movement of Democrats , Republicans and Libertarians disaffected with large government and foreign entanglements as unstoppable , although mathematically the 2008 nomination is beyond their reach .
Paul , a former ob - gyn who recently drew a crowd of 1,400 at North Texas University , said he was overwhelmed by possible congressional candidates who could form a bloc of strict constitutionalists in Congress and carry the movement on beyond the unsuccessful 2008 nomination struggle .
But although he refuses to endorse McCain , Paul also continues to reject the possibility of a third - party run .
Paul said students he talked with " hear other candidates talking change and they know it 's the same old stuff over and over again .
There 's no difference with the other candidates .
They know it 's going to take time .
But as I travel , I find something very significant going on around the country .
They know we need to turn this country around . "
" I could n't stop this movement if I tried , " he added .
Then , noting Fidel Castro stepping down from Cuba 's leadership , Paul repeated his call for an end to the U.S. trade embargo on that country .
" Fifty years of the embargo have n't worked , " he said .
" This is a wonderful opportunity to undermine communism . "

List of People to be Friends with
Doctor / Pharmacist :
Cops :
A lawyer :
an accountant
Someone in the black / gray market :
Currency broker :
Gun dealers :
Artisan / Craftsman :
Collector :
Machinist :
Farmer / rancher :
Gov. Employee :
This has been on my mind for a while now , and whenever I thought about how long the list would be , I got tired before starting so I never got around to do it .
But I guess it is important , it does make life easier , and it may make the difference in other , more critical matters .
The list has no particular order of importance , though everyone can well imagine that some “ contacts ” are more critical than others .
When the word “ survivalist ” is mentioned , most people imagine the bearded hermit living in the middle of nowhere , caressing his shotgun while he giggles like a lunatic .
Or at the other end of the spectrum , some guy tightly winded up , that cant keep a normal conversation for 5 minutes without talking about the latest conspiracy theory , such as the relationship between Area 51 … Illuminati … Teletubbies … Ok , so no .
You need to be an outgoing person , someone that knows how to make acquaintances , if not friends .
You do n’t need to be best buds , you wont be giving away your daughter for crying out loud , all you need is to be nice enough so as to be able to ask for a favor if you ever need one , and be ready to do the same in return .
Should be pretty obvious .
You need someone that you can trust for health matters .
But try going a bit further .
You may one dat need something more than the average patient ( doc relationship .
Ask about his / her weekend , how the kids are .
Again , you are n’t looking for a best friend , just to knock down the barrier in case you ever have to ask for a favor , ask for some extra subscription meds , antibiotics .
Having a good relationship with someone that can get you meds is something you should try working on right now , at the very least try to be in good terms with the pharmacist guy .
The guy in the pharmacy near by will sell me almost everything , even without a doctor ’s note .
It ’s also important to have a good relationship with a doctor in case you need to ask for help during weekends , holydays , getting his / her cell number , etc .
You need them to know what ’s going on , sometimes stuff that does n’t get spread through the news to avoid panic , or simply because of censorship .
You ’ll know what ’s really going on in your neighborhood by talking to your local police .
You need to be in good terms with them so that they respond fast during emergencies , watch over your house with at least a bit of extra interest .
If you end up shooting in self defense , a cop friend in your district may save you a LOT of trouble .
I know of a case where it made the difference , in an attempt of robbery , a switchblade next to the downed bad guy ’s body …yup , you definitely need a cop on your side .
Hey , when you need one you ’ll need him bad .
Have a good one and his number always handy .
Try droppingto the mix to .
He can save you a lot of money .
And when things start getting either hard to find or too expensive , he ’s the guy you ’ll want to speak with .
Someone that buys and sells different currencies or precious metals .
I have 3 guys from which I buy / sell .
When one tries to screw me over , I go to the other one , that way none of them things he ’s got me tied , so I always end up getting a more or less fair deal .
These guys buy and sell pesos , Euros , USD , reales ( Brazil ) gold , silver , and even jewelry gold , having market values for all of them .
Pretty similar to the previous one .
I have couple with whom I deal most often .
I deal with the one that gives me the best deal , but I try to distribute the shopping as well as I can , to keep the “ friendship ” up , so I ’ll know of any good deals either one has to offer , the kind that only “ customers ” get to know of .
Found some pretty cool stuff thanks to that .
To help you on various projects .
Hopefully it will be someone that works well with steel , leather , cordura , and plastic .
He can fix gear for you , make equipment up that you might have thought of , or designed yourself .
Sometimes you need a bit of extra leverage , and it ’s work you wont want to do yourself .
Believe me , it ’s pretty hard to collect when almost ½ the country is broke .
So this is n’t just a Hollywood thing , you ’ll need a good collector for doing businesses , specially collecting rent .
Do n’t go for the aggressive maniac , you need someone that is persuasive , gets your money , but wont hurt the person in the process .
You need him healthy to keep on paying , and to avoid legal problems .
A bit similar to the Craftman , but the machinist specializes on precise metal work .
You ’ll need him for gun accessories , help with projects , etc.
Someone that can get you fresh food if it starts getting scarce , or find you good deals during the good times .
Yes , it ’s like sleeping with the enemy , but someone that knows the ways of the “ Dark Side ” can save you from a lot of trouble , save you from otherwise month / year long waiting periods , just to mention one .
How to make “ friends ” ?
Try being friendly generally speaking .
I ’m a naturally quiet person , I do n’t like talking much with strangers , just not that kind of person .
But I saw it for the flaw that it was , and I ’ve been working hard in changing that .
Try to understand that not everyone thinks like you ( specially if you are a prepper / survivalist ! )
So try speaking their language , bite your tongue whenever you want to say things such as “ That ‘s the most sheepish piece of brain washing crap I ’ve ever heart ” .
I find myself avoiding saying that many times a day , but it ’s important to be able to fit .
I ’m getting pretty good results lately when I offer to take people shooting .
Its good for making bonds , those that are interested later appreciate it after you take them .
You “ converted ” someone and maybe made a friend / contact , so it ’s a dobule plus .
Anyway , this list is pretty short and missing a lot , but you get the idea .

Olmert says Israel wo n't invade Gaza
CALL FOR CALM
Hawkish members of the Israeli Cabinet favor a full - scale invasion of northern Gaza and the assassination of Hamas political leaders
AP
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ruled out a large - scale invasion of Gaza , despite demonstrators from a battered town protesting in front of his office after a boy lost a leg in a Palestinian rocket attack .
" Anger is not an operational plan , " Olmert told his Cabinet at its regular Sunday session , but Israel 's top diplomat warned it will be impossible to reach a peace agreement under these circumstances .
Along with clamoring for a full - scale invasion of northern Gaza to take over the areas where militants have been launching the rockets , there were calls from the Cabinet for assassinating Hamas political leaders and to wipe out a Gaza neighborhood .
The serious injury to eight - year - old Osher Twito in the battered town of Sderot galvanized Israeli outrage .
" He loves playing soccer , but he will never play again , " Osher 's mother , Iris Twito , wailed on Channel 2 TV .
" How can he play now with no leg ? "
Cabinet Minister Meir Sheetrit fumed , " We must take a neighborhood in Gaza and wipe it off the map , " after warning citizens to flee .
At nightfall on Sunday , about 20 Israeli army vehicles rolled into northern Gaza , where most of the rockets are fired , witnesses said .
The military called the operation " routine . "
In an exchange of gunfire at the border , a Palestinian militant was killed .
Later , Israel targeted a rocket squad in an airstrike , the military said .
No casualties were reported .
Late on Sunday , Palestinians fired a rocket at Israel , only the second of the day , compared to dozens in the previous days .
In a public statement at the beginning of the weekly Israeli Cabinet meeting , Olmert said the surge in Palestinian rocket attacks is a response to Israel 's own military strikes , claiming that 200 Gaza militants have been killed in recent months " as a result of initiated , aggressive , planned and comprehensive activity " by the Israeli military and security .
As the demonstrators from Sderot approached his office , Olmert declared , " anger is not an operational plan . "
Instead , he said , " We must act in a systematic and orderly fashion over time . "
Olmert indicated that Israel might target Hamas political leaders .
" We will continue to reach all the responsible terrorists , including those who dispatch and operate them , " he said .
On his way to Germany for talks later on Sunday , Olmert called for patience .
" There is no solution of one operation or one bomb , " he said .
" It takes time . "
Up to now , Israeli military strikes have been aimed at rocket squads and militant leaders .
In 2004 , however , Israel killed the founder of Hamas and his successor in two airstrikes four weeks apart .
Hamas overran Gaza in June , expelling forces loyal to moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
Gaza 's Hamas government is headed by Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh , deposed by Abbas after the takeover .
Abbas named a new government that effectively rules only the West Bank .
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , who heads Israel 's negotiating team with Abbas ' government toward a peace accord , said such an agreement would be impossible as long as Hamas rules Gaza and foments violence .
" There is no hope for any kind of peace or the vision of the Palestinian state which includes the Gaza Strip without real change on the ground , " Livni said .
In recent months , Israel has augmented its military strikes with economic sanctions on Gaza , cutting back fuel supplies and sharply restricting the entry of other goods through Gaza crossings it controls .
On Thursday , it cut about 1 percent of the electricity it supplies to the territory in an effort to pressure Hamas to stop the rocket barrages .
Residents said rolling blackouts in Gaza last between eight and 12 hours a day .
Gas station owners refused to accept Israeli fuel shipments , saying they covered only a third of their needs .
Aid workers said on Sunday the Gaza City power plant was working at full capacity but had no fuel reserves .
Vice Prime Minister Haim Ramon said Israel should not make do with symbolic power cuts .
" If they fire a rocket , then there should be no electricity , or water or fuel " that day , he said .

This story starts with the NHS and two young doctors .
One young doctor was a working in a hospital in East London and he had been working there for a few years .
The doctor was still quite young ; he was just a few months ’ shy of this 30th birthday .
As he was working in the Accident and Emergency ward , he worked very long hours and rarely had time to eat , let alone go out and meet people .
Similarly , the other doctor was working in South London and being in her late twenties , she was a similar age .
She too was working in a hospital , but had gone into surgery .
Her hours were very erratic and long , much like working in A&E .
Both doctors were looking for a partner and happened to find Elite Singles around the same time .

Suffering from lessee ’s remorse ?
In the past , making an early exit from a car lease was about as easy as getting out of jail free .
Now a handful of websites are offering restless consumers a chance at freedom while also providing an option for those who want to lease but are n’t happy with the terms their local dealerships are offering .
Two leading lease transfer sites -- LeaseTrader.com and Swapalease.com -- operate somewhat like the online car - selling services that have become common in recent years .
Sellers ( the leaseholders ) list their vehicles in a searchable database .
Buyers ( who assume the lease ) contact the sellers directly .
Assuming that a deal can be struck , such sites help usher the lease transfer process through the finance company , collecting fees from both parties .
“ For the person getting out of the lease , it ’s the best thing since sliced bread , ” said Joanne Helperin , who follows the trend for auto website Edmunds.com .
“ Until now they were just stuck . ”
LeaseTrader cites a recent study estimating that nearly half of the current 17 million vehicle leaseholders in the U.S. want to get out of their leases early .
Changing circumstances , such as the arrival of a new child or a sudden drop in income , can saddle people with a leased vehicle that is suddenly too small or too expensive .
It ’s no accident that an article about lease transfers appeared recently in Pregnancy magazine .
( Out with the Miata -- in with the minivan ! )
And lease transfer sites are reporting a rising tide of users who are caught in the housing crisis and can no longer afford their monthly lease payments , or who want to unload vehicles with lousy fuel economy ratings .
“ We are hearing from our clients that they ’re looking to get out of their vehicles because of economy - related issues , such as home foreclosures , ” said Scot Hall , head of operations at Cincinnati - based Swapalease .
The number of gas - guzzling sport utility vehicles listed on their site is also on the rise .
Lease transfers can benefit the person assuming the lease as well , Helperin said .
They can save money by leasing a vehicle without making a down payment , or they may be looking to assume a lease with only a year or two remaining -- a much shorter term than dealers typically offer .
“ When I get out of my lease later this year I may go shopping for a short - term lease that I want to assume , ” she said .
Jason Mehrvarz , owner of GDI Computer Consulting in Van Nuys , turned to LeaseTrader after his bank told him it would cost $ 50,000 to get out of the four - year lease on his wife ’s 2006 Range Rover SUV .
Within six weeks he transferred the lease to a buyer in Sherman Oaks .
He replaced the Land Rover with a leased 2008 Mercedes - Benz ML350 SUV , reducing his monthly lease payment from $ 970 to $ 580 .
The total cost in fees was less than $ 400 .
“ It was a very positive experience , ” Mehrvarz said .
“ I would absolutely do it again . ”
He especially liked LeaseTrader ’s policy of pre-certifying buyers by means of an initial credit check , helping to weed out folks who were just kicking tires .
“ That means I ’m not getting contacted by the whole world , ” Mehrvarz said .
“ I ’m getting contacted by someone who has gone through at least one filter . ”
The lease transfer sites stress that their transactions are not subleases .
A transfer must be approved by the bank or auto finance company that handled the original lease , and in most cases the new leaseholder assumes all liabilities associated with the lease .
The costs to users are fairly modest .
On LeaseTrader ’s site , which has 20,000 to 25,000 listings , sellers pay $ 79 to list their vehicle for an unlimited time .
Both parties pay an additional $ 150 when a transaction is completed .
Swapalease , which lists about 11,600 vehicles , charges about $ 50 for a basic listing , and an additional $ 95 ( to be paid by the seller ) if a transaction is completed .
On both sites , shoppers can browse for free , but must pay a nonrefundable fee to contact sellers .
( Swapalease charges around $ 35 for 45 days ; LeaseTrader charges about $ 40 for 60 days . )
There are other costs as well .
Assuming the lease of a car located far away means hiring a vehicle inspector ( typically $ 100 to $ 200 ) and a transport service ( which can cost more than $ 1,000 , depending on the distance . )
Both sites will connect buyers with firms that provide those services .
Users of both sites , however , have complained on online consumer forums about finding a car they want and paying the upfront fee , only to discover that the vehicle is no longer available .
Sergio Stiberman , chief executive of LeaseTrader , said his site has worked to improve the timeliness of its listings , and vehicles that are in the process of being transferred are now clearly marked .
He noted that good deals go fast -- often within the 24 hours that it takes LeaseTrader to perform a credit check and activate a buyer ’s account .
Although Swapalease has been around since 1999 and LeaseTrader since 2000 , the practice is just beginning to gain traction .
( Online data trackers such as comScore do n’t even have a separate category for measuring visitors to lease trading sites . )
Leasing transfer companies had to overcome initial resistance from the auto and finance companies , which traditionally have shown little inclination to let customers out of car leases .
Nissan Motor Co. , which also makes the Infiniti brand , said it still would n’t allow lease transfers .
( The ban affects only leases handled through the carmaker ’s in - house financing arm .
Leases handled by banks or independent finance companies are n’t affected . )
Honda Motor Co. allows lease transfers , but only on a case - by - case basis , the company said .
Audi allows transfers on a restricted basis , according to lease transfer sites .
With auto sales soft , automakers are aggressively pushing sweet lease offers on new cars , and lease terms are getting shorter .
For those reasons , some dealers argue that consumers may be better off shopping for a new leased vehicle than assuming the lease on a used one .
At Fletcher Jones Motorcars in Newport Beach , the biggest Mercedes - Benz dealer in the country , typical lease terms now run from 27 to 33 months , said Garth Blumenthal , general manager .
And the monthly payments are often lower than they were on 48 - month leases a few years back , he said .
But even those shorter terms can’t match the needs of some of Swapalease ’s customers .
“ We have people who swap leases because they want to drive an SUV in the winter , ” Hall said , “ and a convertible in the summer . ”

Back in August , [ h1 kari ] presented an analysis of the A5 crypto spec used in GSM systems .
Almost all GSM conversations in the US and Europe are encrypted using this standard .
At the time they were still in the planning stages of building their rainbow table of shift register states .
Today we heard an update on the progress .
The whole space is 2^58 in size and would take a standard PC 33,235 years to calculate .
Not being patient people they built a box containing 68 express card based FPGAs .
Each one is capable of doing 72 billion operations per second .
So far they ’re one month into the 3 month process .
Once the table is completed any person can crack a GSM conversation in 30 minutes using 1 FPGA and the 2TB table .
They do have plans for building an optimal system that would be based on solid state drives and 16 FPGAs that should do the crack in just 30 seconds .
It definitely raises ethical issues .
It 's a defenseless child , being shaped and " mullded " into a life knowing nothing other than the mullet .
It will only be a few years before this poor child ends up just another another category in Mullet Junky .
* It also must be said that the Infantullet is the rarest , purest form of the mullet .
It is rare for a child under the age of 1 to have an entire head of hair , much less a full - blown mullet .
ONE of the unresolved — and rather bitter — disputes in evolutionary biology is between the creeps and the jerks .
The creeps ( so dubbed by the jerks ) think that evolutionary change is gradual .
The jerks ( so dubbed by the creeps ) think it happens in sudden jumps that are separated by long periods of stasis .
Probably , both are true .
Work done a couple of years ago by Mark Pagel of Reading University , in England , suggests that about a fifth of evolutionary change happens jerkily at around the time new species form .
The rest creeps in gradually over the millennia .
Species , however , are not the only things that evolve .
Languages do too .
And in the current edition of Science , Dr Pagel and his colleagues publish evidence that they do so in a way which looks intriguingly similar to what happens in species .
There was already some historical evidence for this .
The English of Geoffrey Chaucer ( born in the 14th century ) , for example , is incomprehensible to modern laymen , whereas that of William Shakespeare ( born in the 16th ) is not only comprehensible but held by some to be a model .
Dr Pagel , however , wanted to examine the question systematically and to include languages with no literary history in his analysis .
To do so he looked at three well - studied parts of the linguistic family tree : the Bantu languages of Africa , the Indo - European group from Eurasia and the Austronesians of the Pacific .
In all three cases it is pretty clear how the branches connect up , even if it is not always obvious when particular splits occurred .
Dr Pagel did not , however , need to know that .
He only needed to know the shape of the tree .
That was because his hypothesis was that if linguistic evolution is jerky , the jerks will happen at the points where languages split — the equivalent of species splits in biological evolution .
The way to test that is to track back along the branches leading from each existing language , and count the number of splits on each path before you get to the common ancestor of all .
His hypothesis turned out to be correct .
Languages are formed not , it seems , by a gradual drifting apart of two groups who no longer talk to each other , but by violent rupture .
Around a third of the vocabulary differences between modern Bantu speakers arose this way , around a fifth of the differences between speakers of Indo - European languages , and around a tenth of the Austronesians .
That compares with around a fifth for biological species .
All this suggests that the formation of both languages and species is an active process .
For species , adaptations to novel environments and the need to avoid crossbreeding with those on the other side of the split are both plausible hypotheses .
For languages , the explanation may be a cultural rather than biological need to distinguish populations .
As Noah Webster , the compiler of the first American dictionary , put it : “ as an independent nation , our honor [ sic ] requires us to have a system of our own , in language as well as government . ”
In other words , if you do n't speak proper , you ain't one of us .
On Monday of this week , I began an experiment .
I stopped looking up Ruby and Rails information in my PDF of the second edition of Programming Ruby and in the excellent on - line documentation for Rails .
Every time my fingers twitched to do a search , I reached for an actual dead - tree book instead .
Not one of those quick references designed for looking things up , but a book where the author actually teaches the material .
I have been looking things up using the stone - age technology of a good index .
And then I ’ve been reading actual explanations , not just copying code snippets off the ‘ net and pasting them into my programs .
…
It ’s Friday afternoon and neither you nor I want to slog through a heavy essay , so let ’s just flip right through the pages of metaphors and anecdotal examples from my own experience .
Imagine for a moment that there were a number of really insightful remarks , a few good quotes from other bloggers or authors , and a couple of great code samples .
Since we ’re in a hurry , let ’s jump right to the end : … So in conclusion , if you just want to get something done quickly without gaining a fuller , deeper understanding , by all means use a cheat sheet .
But if you want to actually learn more about what you ’re using , the next time you need to look something up , do n’t go to the cheat sheet , Do n’t Google it .
Look it up in an actual book like The Ruby Way or its equally informative companion The Rails Way .
It may take a moment longer , and you ca n’t copy and paste .
But a good book contains far more than an explanation of what to do .
It shows how it works , when to do that , and why it works that way .
A good book is going to answer a question you did n’t know needed to be asked .
It ’s tough for a busy programmer to find time to read books from cover to cover and learn the material .
But every time you need to look something up , you have a golden opportunity to research the material instead of cheating the answer .
Use those opportunities to learn :
That knowledge is going to make you a better programmer .
In the first Jurassic Park movie , the vicious velociraptors were depicted as scaly beasts .
But by the third instalment , these dinosaurs sported a crest of feathers .
That decision appears to have been on the right track , with a team of US scientists reporting the first direct evidence the turkey - sized , meat - eaters had feathered forearms .
While it has been thought the non-flying velociraptors would have feathers , proof has been difficult to find , because feathers are not usually preserved in fossils .
You say he does n't like to talk .
Does he like to read ?
Start with picture books ( mice might be a good topic but chicken or fish would also work ) and reward him for each page he completes .
You could write a personal note on each page to see if he 's paying attention .
You should probably wait to start the lesson until he has been awake for 10 minutes , if this is possible .
I 'm assuming he stays awake that long at least once in a while .
When President Nixon was in his pre-Watergate heyday , he ordered the FBI and the CIA to electronically monitor the private behavior of his domestic political adversaries .
Shortly after Nixon resigned , investigators discovered hundreds of reports of break - ins and secret electronic surveillance .
None of it was authorized by warrants , and thus all of it was illegal .
But it had been conducted pursuant to the president ’s orders .
Nixon ’s defense was , “ When the president does it , that means that it is not illegal . ”
He made that infamous statement in a TV interview years after he left office , but the attitude espoused was obviously one he embraced while in the White House .
He , like his present - day successor , rejected the truism that the 4th Amendment of the Constitution , which prohibits the government from conducting electronic surveillance of anyone without a search warrant issued by a judge based on probable cause of a crime , restrains the president .
In response to the abuses during the Nixon administration , Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA , in 1978 .
The law provides that no electronic surveillance may occur by anyone in the government at any time under any circumstances for any reason other than in accordance with law , and no such surveillance may occur within the U.S. of an American other than in accordance with the 4th Amendment .
The 4th Amendment was written in response to the Colonial experience whereby British soldiers wrote their own search warrants , thus literally authorizing themselves to enter the private property of colonists .

The amendment has been uniformly interpreted by the courts to require a warrant by a judge ; and judges can only issue search warrants after government agents , under oath , have convinced the judges that it is more likely than not that the things to be seized are evidence of crimes .
This standard of proof is called probable cause of crime .
It is one of only two instances in which the founders wrote a rule of criminal procedure into the Constitution itself , surely so that no Congress , president or court could tamper with it .
FISA also created the bizarre , constitutionally questionable procedure in which federal agents could appear in front of a secret court and , instead of presenting probable cause of a crime in order to obtain a search warrant , would only need to present probable cause that the target of the warrant was an agent of a foreign government .
The foreign government could be friendly or it could wish us ill , but no illegal or even anti-American behavior need be shown .
Subsequent amendments to this statute removed the “ agency ” requirement and demanded only that the target be a person physically present in the U.S. who was not born here and is not an American citizen , whether working for a foreign government or not .
The FISA statute itself significantly -- and , in my opinion , unconstitutionally -- lowered the 4th Amendment bar from probable cause of “ crime ” to probable cause of “ status . ”
However , in order to protect the 4th Amendment rights of the targets of spying , the statute erected a so - called wall between gathering evidence and using evidence .
The government cannot constitutionally prosecute someone unless it has evidence against him that was obtained pursuant to probable cause of a crime , a standard not met by a FISA warrant .
Congress changed all that .
The Patriot Act passed after 9/11 and its later version not only destroyed the wall between investigation and prosecution , they mandated that investigators who obtained evidence of criminal activity pursuant to FISA warrants share that evidence with prosecutors .
They also instructed federal judges that the evidence thus shared is admissible under the Constitution against a defendant in a criminal case .
Congress forgot that it cannot tell federal judges what evidence is admissible because judges , not politicians , decide what a jury hears .

Then the Bush administration and Congress went even further .
The administration wanted , and Congress has begrudgingly given it , the authority to conduct electronic surveillance of foreigners and Americans without even a FISA warrant -- without any warrant whatsoever .
The so - called Protect America
Act of 2007 , which expired at the end of last week , gave the government carte blanche to spy on foreign persons outside the U.S. , even if Americans in the United States with whom they may be communicating are spied on -- illegally -- in the process .
Director of National Intelligence J. Michael McConnell told the House Judiciary Committee last year that hundreds of unsuspecting Americans ’ conversations and e-mails are spied on annually as a consequence of the warrantless surveillance of foreigners outside the United States .
So where does all this leave us ?
Even though , since 1978 , the government has gotten more than 99 % of its FISA applications approved , the administration wants to do away with FISA altogether if at least one of the people whose conversations or e-mails it wishes to monitor is not in the U.S. and is not an American .
Those who believe the Constitution means what it says should tremble at every effort to weaken any of its protections .
The Constitution protects all “ persons ” and all “ people ” implicated by government behavior .
So the government should be required , as it was until FISA , to obtain a 4th Amendment warrant to conduct surveillance of anyone , American or not , in the U.S. or not .
If we lower constitutional protections for foreigners and their American correspondents , for whom will we lower them next ?

Today ’s piece is written by Mark Gaberman , a writer on “ Jeopardy . ”
There are 61 blue boxes available to play in one game of “ Jeopardy ! ” .
We make 230 shows a year — that ’s 14,030 boxes that 8 of my friends and I have to fill .
I have learned things about Queen Victoria that I never really wanted to know .
Some information about car repair that I have since forgotten .
Morgan Freeman has spoken words in celebrity clues that I wrote for him .
He was God , you know .
At least twice .
I love to fill in those blue boxes .
I ’ve had Alex Trebek rap Snoop Dogg ’s “ Gin and Juice ” — he had his mind on his money and his money on his mind that day .
Did a category called “ Death and Texas ” just because I liked the title ( and finding stuff about people dying and / or getting killed in Texas turned out to be remarkably easy ) .
I ’ve learned about Jean Sibelius , and word to the wise , if you see “ blah blah blah this Finnish composer blah blah blah … ” , Jean Sibelius might not be your worst guess .
Well , at least if I wrote it .
I ’m just not that up on my Finnish composers .
I think for any writer , there is an indescribable thrill at having your words come to life onscreen .
For the 9 of us , those words are literally on the screen itself for everyone to see .
I ’ve been with the show for a decade now — 7 years as a writer , I ’m one of the newbies — and I still ca n’t wait to see how my categories will play during that day ’s shooting .
I know the others feel the same way about their material , too .
It never gets old .
Until one tanks .
Contrary to what some may believe , we are n’t out to stump the players .
Challenge ‘em to the limit , you bet , but to us , a 3 - contestant deadball basically means we failed to get even one of them to where we thought they could go .
Oh , the horror that is the triple stand - and - stare .
The eternity that is the few seconds between the time Alex finishes reading a clue and the head - scratching , how the hell do they expect us to know that ?
reaction it gets from the contestants .
Then , DOOTDOOTDOOT !
The merciful sound that ends their suffering and then has Alex saying something like , “ ooo , sorry , we were going for Slovenia .
Slovenia .
Select ! ”
Maybe I reached way too far and used Kurt Bevacqua in a clue instead of an easy Babe Ruth , just because I thought it was funny that Tommy Lasorda said Kurt Bevacqua could n’t hit water if he fell out of a bleeping boat .
Or perhaps these 3 particular players were n’t quite ready for an entire category of “ to Heloise and back ” .
Another 3 might have been all over it .
Luck of the draw there .
Or maybe they just never knew that Fitzgerald wrote “ The Great Gatsby ” .
Nah , they should ’ve known that .
That one would probably just make me mad .
That , however , is the beauty of our game .
I get just as floored as anyone who watches the show if that butcher from Boise knows that obscure fact I discovered about Pushkin .
Baffled if that insurance agent from Des Moines does n’t know Lincoln was president during the Civil War .
Positively mind - boggled when that lawyer from Pensacola does n’t put enough on a Daily Double with an opportunity to go ahead , late in the game ( you ’d be amazed how often betting like that happens .
Trust yourselves , folks !
No guts , no “ Jeopardy ! ” glory ! ) .
But the fact that I helped create all that …it ’s a feeling I really miss , and one that I look forward to experiencing again soon .
I love to go to work each day .
To see my friends .
To learn something new .
To try and be creative and contribute to something a lot of people seem to enjoy .
To actually get paid to do it .
I love to fill in those blue boxes .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures rallied to a new closing high above $ 100 a barrel Wednesday , extending their record - breaking run after minutes confirmed the Federal Reserve 's willingness to slash rates further .
Crude oil for March delivery rose 73 cents to finish at a new record closing high of $ 100.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Earlier in the session , the March contract , which expired today , hit a record all - time high of $ 101.32 a barrel .
" The momentum was with the bulls after yesterday 's incredible run , " said Phil Flynn , vice president of futures brokerage Alaron Trading .
" The Fed minutes were a reason to buy , " Flynn said .
" When the market saw that the Fed was still talking about cutting interest rates , that was a cue to buy oil . "
Crude for April delivery , the new front - month contract , finished unchanged at $ 99.70 a barrel .
“ ' The Fed minutes were a reason to buy .
When the market saw that the Fed was still talking about cutting interest rates , that was a cue to buy oil . ' ” — Phil Flynn , Alaron Trading .
" There was a little bit of a short squeeze in the March contract , " Flynn said .
" April did n't go along for the ride at the end . "
The Federal Reserve confirmed that it is willing to do more to help the economy find its footing , but warned that nagging inflation worries may necessitate swift rate hikes once growth resumes , minutes of the latest meetings released Wednesday show .
This is only the latest version of a bifurcated message the Fed has been delivering to markets since it began cutting interest rates last August : at the same time it has cut rates because of downside risks , the central bank feels compelled to note that the stubbornly high level of inflation cannot be ignored .
See The Fed .
On Tuesday , crude oil surged 5 % to close above $ 100 a barrel for the first time , amid speculation about OPEC moves , and after an explosion at a Texas refinery raised concerns about supply .
" It is important to note that in addition to soaring energy prices , we also had explosive rallies in base and precious metals , all this occurring despite a less - than - inspiring U.S. macro backdrop , " said Edward Meir , analyst at MF Global , in a research note .
" This tells us that fund money is being channeled into the commodity space on perceptions that these investments will do better over the course of the year , " Meir said .
The benchmark gasoline contract rallied more than 4 % to a historic high on Tuesday , advancing as a Texas refinery was forced to shut down .
Alon USA Energy Inc. ALJ said Monday 's explosion and fire at its Big Spring refinery temporarily suspended production .
The company also said it will look into what caused the blast .
" Baffling as the current rise is , it is best to let the rally run its course , " Meir said .
" Funds may be driving prices higher for now , but such sentiment is fickle and could turn quickly . "
Another build in crude stocks expected
The Energy Department will release weekly data on U.S. petroleum inventories on Thursday , a day later than usual because of the Presidents Day holiday .
Analysts surveyed by Platts expect a rise of 3.2 million barrels in crude supplies in the latest week , a build of 1 million barrels in gasoline supplies and a decline of 1.7 million barrels in distillate inventories .
A backlog of barrels caused by a two - day closing of the Houston Ship Channel and Mexican ports should clear and keep crude stocks on a seasonal building trend , Platts said .
Over the past five weeks , crude stocks have increased by more than 18 million barrels , but inventories at Cushing , Okla . , the key delivery point for Nymex crude , have actually declined by 597,000 barrels to 17 million barrels , Platts said .
" This latest rally comes against a broad softening of the fundamental outlook for oil prices : inventories are actually continuing their seasonal build pattern , while demand fears quite rightly persist , " said James Neale , an analyst at Citigroup , in a note Wednesday .
The latest surge in prices is " driven principally by a sharp uptick in fund flows into oil and other commodities in response to the latest wave of rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve -- a factor which is hard to measure in the near term as data on open interest positions tends to be somewhat backwards looking , " Neale said .
Also on Nymex , March reformulated gasoline ended down 1 cent at $ 2.59 a gallon and March heating oil dropped 1 cent to end at $ 2.75 a gallon .
March natural gas fell 2 cents to $ 8.96 per million British thermal units .
Believe it or not , Chicago policeman Thaddeus Martyka is n't the first cop to chase down a crook with the help of a Segway , but nevertheless , the two - wheeled wonder is to thank for yet another arrest .
Whilst patrolling the streets and enjoying the summer breeze , the officer heard shots fired and decided to wheel over and see what the commotion was all about .
Sure enough , the baddies were found scurrying away from the scene of a crime , and while one suspect managed to escape , the other was n't so fortunate .
Purportedly , the Segway reached a top speed of 12.5 mph , which proved plenty fast to capture ( and likely humiliate ) at least one of the ill - willed individuals .

Six examples of the rich diversity of 67 strong gravitational lenses found recently by Hubble .
One of the best tools astronomers have to glimpse thedistant universe is a technology that nature invented .
Cosmic magnifyingglasses called gravitational lenses help scientists zoom in on far - away scenes theycould never spot otherwise .
In a recent survey of a section of the universe , researcherscounted 67 new gravitational lenses , leading them to believe there are nearlyhalf a million similar lenses in the rest of the universe .
" Gravitational lenses amplify the signal , " said PeterCapak , an astronomer at California Institute of Technology who worked on thestudy .
" It 's like a second telescope in front of your telescope .
We cansee things that are much fainter than we can normally see . "
These natural telescopes are created when massive objectsdistort the space - time around them through the strength of their gravitationalpull , causing light to bend as it travels through the warped space .
If a gravitationallens lies between us and a distant object , then the image of the object wesee can be distorted and magnified .
In the rare case that a gravitational lens is perfectlyaligned between Earth and a distant object , " typically you can get atleast a factor of 10 ? 50 magnification , " said Jean - Paul Knieb , an astronomerat Laboratoire d?Astrophysique de Marseille , France , leader of the study .
The effect was predictedin the 1930s by Einstein 's general theory of relativity , and was first observedin 1979 .
The 67 newly discovered lenses are caused by large galaxies , although clusters of galaxies often produce strong gravitational lenses too .
A team of astronomers used the NASA / ESA Hubble SpaceTelescope , along with follow - up observations from the ground , to image a 1.6 square degree field of sky ( about nine times the area of the full Moon ) ingreat detail .
The researchers then pored over the images by eye to spot thetell - tale circular warping signatures of gravitational lenses .
In addition to giving scientists a better idea of how manygravitational lenses are out there , the discovery will help researchers studythe spread of darkmatter around the galaxies causing the lenses .
" The main thing the gravitational lenses do for us isthey allow us to study the mass distribution in individual galaxies , " Capak told SPACE.com .
" A lot of the mass is contained in darkmatter .
We want to understand how the dark matter is distributed . "
By analyzing patterns in the warping of space - time caused bythe gravitational lenses , the scientists hope to gain a better understanding ofthe structure of galaxies .
" You can think of the lenses as glass beads , " Capaksaid .
" If you hold up a glass bead and look thorough it , it distorts thepicture behind it .
The shape of the glass bead is what 's causing the differentdistortions .
The shape of the mass distribution in galaxies is distorting thebackground in different ways . "
ここしばらく、あちこちで講演の機会がある度に「ブログを書こう」と呼びかけまくっている僕ですが、そうしたときに僕は、「できれば職業上の専門性に特化したブログを書こう」と話しています。そのように話す理由は、専門性に特化したブログを書いていれば、それが実名のものであれ匿名のものであれ、自分自身のポートフォリオとして機能するうえ、職業上の有意義な人脈が得られる可能性があるからです。
しかし僕のこのブログ、一部には職業上の専門性に触れる記述も存在するものの、全体としてみれば雑多なテーマを扱っていて、何かに特化したような内容ではありません。なぜ僕は、人には職業上の専門性に特化したブログを書くことを勧めているにもかかわらず、自分では雑多なテーマのブログを書いているのか？
その理由 は 「雑多なテーマのブログは儲かるから」です。とは言っても、これには少し説明が必要ですよね。順を追って説明しましょう。
1. 前提
まず前提として、ブログにアフィリエイトなりAdSenseなりを貼り付けていて、いくらかの収入があることが必要です。別にそれ（アフィリエイト）自体で儲かっている必要はありません。いくらかの収入があればいいのです。その収入の目安は、個人事業者なら少しでも収入があればよく、サラリーマンなどの被雇用者の場合なら年間20万円以上あればOKです。
個人事業者などの就労形態を採っているか、または被雇用者であっても年間20万円以上のアフィリエイト収入（副収入）がある場合、所得税の確定申告を自分で（または税理士さんに任せて）する必要があります。つまり、ブログから収入があり、所得税の確定申告が必要な場合、ブログを書くことは事業活動であるとみなされるわけです。すると、ブログを書くための取材費用に該当する支出を、事業のための経費として計上することができます。
2. 必要経費について
ブログ運営のための支出が経費として計上できるというのは、実に素晴らしいことです。
例えば自営業者の場合ですら、本来の仕事には関係のない内容の書籍を購入した場合、これはポケットマネーで決済され、損金として経費に計上することはできません。しかし、ブログでその本のレビューを書いて、Amazonアソシエイトのリンクでも張ったとしたら、どうでしょう？
その書籍代金は立派な経費ですよね。
少し極端なことを言えば、旅行に行った場合、そのことをブログに書いて、AdSenseの広告収入が発生したとします。するとどうでしょう、その旅行のために支払った費用というのは、旅費交通費として経費に計上できる、というわけです。同じように、高級レストランで食事をして、そのレビューを書いたものがアフィリエイトやAdSenseの収入につながった場合なども同様でしょう。
その他にも経費として認められそうなものをざっと挙げると、プロバイダ料金やインターネット回線費用（通信費）、デジカメ代やパソコン代（低額のものは消耗品、高額のものは減価償却）などのほか、参加したセミナーの費用（会費）、懇親会（交際費）などなど、ブログで扱うために必要となったすべての支出が、全部ではないにしろ経費として認められる可能性があるのです。
3. なぜ儲かるのか？
ここでの要旨は、雑多なテーマのブログを書くことによって直接的に儲かる、という話ではなく、節税効果によって間接的に儲かる、ということです。所得税や住民税などの算出のベースになるのは、申告所得額ですが、この所得を圧縮することができれば、つまり節税になる、というわけです。
趣味の本を買ったり、プロバイダ代や電気代を払ったり、デジカメやiPodなどのガジェット類を買ったり、旅行したり、外食したり、映画を見たり、などということは、誰でも普通にすることですし、通常であればこれらは家計からの支出になります。しかしこれらを確定申告の際に経費として計上し、所得から差し引いた場合、実質的には同じだけの支出があるにもかかわらず、税金は安くなるのです。
ざっと計算しても、今までポケットマネーで支払っていた支出のうち、年間で100万円程度を経費に計上した場合、およそ40万円程度は儲かる（所得税と住民税が減免される）、というわけです。無視できる金額じゃないですよね？
しかも、投資したものが必ず収益につながるとは限らない、というのは通常の事業でも同様ですので、アフィリエイトがそんなに収益を生み出していなかったとしても、経費を使うことは可能なわけです。
4. この方法が画期的な理由
上述のような節税方法は、個人事業者や会社経営者であればそれほど難しいことではなく、程度の差はあれ誰でもやっていることです。しかし、サラリーマンなどの被雇用者の場合、節税対策といえば積立型の生命保険や個人年金を利用するくらいがせいぜいで、趣味にお金を使うことで節税する、などということは通常あり得ないことでした。
しかし、この方法なら被雇用者でも節税が可能です。この意味では非常に画期的だと言えるでしょう。（ただし会社が副業を認めている必要がありますし、サラリーマンをしながらアフィリエイトで年間20万円の収入を得るというのは、そう簡単なことではないかもしれませんが）
また、個人事業者や会社経営者なら、何のハードルもなく、今すぐにでも強力な節税対策を始めることができます。
5. 使用上の注意
こんなことを言っておいてアレですが、僕だってすべての支出を経費に計上しているわけではありません。節度を持って、やりすぎない程度に抑えています。税務調査が入ったときに苦しい言い訳をするのは嫌ですからね。念のため、グレーな部分については税理士の先生に相談もしています。まあ、それでも、かなりの節税になっているのは間違いないんですけど。
何にしても、この方法を実行するのであれば、万が一のことも考えて、問題の起きにくいように、自重すべきところは自重しておくべきでしょう。アフィリエイトに関する税務署の対応というのは、まだ完全には整備されていないと聞いています。つまり、今後どうなるかわからない、というわけです。場合によっては税理士の先生に相談するなどして、計画的なご利用をおすすめします。
The police and the Tories today demanded the reclassification of cannabis as a class B drug as the home secretary insisted she had yet to make a decision on the matter .
Assistant Chief Constable Simon Byrne , the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) spokesman on cannabis , said that his organisation supported a return to a Class B classification " quite unequivocally " .
Police chiefs say that their experience on the streets and the increase in cannabis farms makes the case for a return to a tougher law on cannabis , which was downgraded from a class B to class C drug in 2004 .
" It is a very interesting debate and there are a wide variety of opinions which we respect , but the bottom line from a police point of view is that since reclassification four years ago we have seen a significant rise in cannabis farms , which point to increasing use of organised crime in this particular market ; that 's a worry for us , " Byrne told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" There has been confusion on the streets about whether cannabis is legal or not which is fuelling public concern about how it is being policed . "
The shadow home secretary , David Davis , said that the Tories would reclassify the drug , supply treatment for offenders and toughen up border police to prevent drugs from being brought in to the country .
" Not only is cannabis a gateway to harder drugs and a major cause of crime , it has real and tragic consequences for the mental health of so many people , " he said .
But the home secretary , Jacqui Smith - who has admitted to past cannabis use when she was at university - was at pains to stress that a decision had yet to be taken .
In a letter , she assured the chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) that she had not already formed any conclusions about the classification of the drug .
The government advisory group was today starting a two - day evidence - gathering mission to investigate whether tougher penalties ought to be introduced for cannabis .
Along with examining the reclassification issue , the ACMD will hear new evidence on the latest trends in the potency of the cannabis available on Britain 's streets , research into the drug 's effects on mental health , and market research that looked at whether the public was aware of cannabis 's current legal status and the potential penalties for using the drug
Some members of the ACMD said that they would consider resigning if the government ignored their conclusions .
Cannabis was reclassified in January 2004 , making possession a largely non-arrestable offence , and placing it alongside some prescription anti-depressants and bodybuilding drugs .
Gordon Brown announced last July , within weeks of taking over as prime minister , that he would demand a new review of the drug 's legal position because of emerging evidence about its effects and reports that stronger strains of the drug were becoming available .
Once it was cocaine , speed or heroin , but now the fashion is for legal pills , washed down by spirits .
Last week 's news that actor Heath Ledger , right , died from an overdose of prescription tablets shed light on a startling new trend - misuse of over - the - counter pills now kills more Americans than illegal drugs .
Elizabeth Day in New York
Alex is a man who prides himself on sticking to routine .
He likes to start the day with a large cappuccino from Starbucks and to end it with a handful of anti-depressants washed down with vodka .
' It 's my treat after coming home from work , ' he says .
' I guess it just chills me out a little . '
In many ways Alex , 31 , is a typical well - heeled young New Yorker .
He works in finance , holidays in the Hamptons and enjoys partying at the sort of exclusive nightclubs where having your name on the guest list is a prerequisite to entry .
He also likes to get high on prescription drugs .
Tonight he is celebrating a friend 's birthday at Marquee , one of the city 's hippest nightspots .
The main bar , lined with leather banquettes , is cast in a shadowy half - light .
In the upstairs lavatory there is a small framed sign on the back of the door reminding guests the use of illegal drugs will not be permitted .
But Alex would not consider himself a drug abuser .
For him , those small white Xanax tablets on his bathroom shelves are simply a recreational accompaniment to the $ 15 Grey Goose vodka martini he has just been served .
And , what 's more , they 're entirely legal .
Over the past five years the United States has seen a ferocious increase in prescription drug abuse .
According to the 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health , 49.8 million Americans over the age of 12 have reported non-medical use of illicit drugs in their lifetime , 20.3 per cent of the population .
Among teenagers aged 12 - 17 , prescription drugs are second only to marijuana in popularity , and in the past 15 years there has been a 140 per cent increase in painkiller abuse .
It is the fastest - growing type of drug abuse in the US .
Even more worryingly , prescription drugs have made it on to the party scene as a legal , seemingly safe , way to recreate an illicit high .
Until last month this was a largely silent epidemic .
But the death of Heath Ledger , a regular at Marquee and other nightclubs , thrust it into the spotlight .
The 28 - year - old actor died from ' acute intoxication ' caused by an accidental overdose of anti-anxiety medication and prescription painkillers .
' Americans love to get pills for everything that ails them , ' says Dr Howard Markel , a professor of paediatrics and psychiatry at the University of Michigan .
' The misuse of those drugs has become one of the major health problems of our time . '
The UK has less of a prescription culture than the US , although many experts believe the advent of internet pharmacies means it is only a matter of time .
In the US , where pharmaceuticals are advertised on prime - time television , pill - popping has become normalised , a socially acceptable means of alleviating stress , sleeplessness or anxiety .
The most commonly abused prescription medications fall into three categories : opiate - based painkillers ( OxyContin and Percocet ) ; central nervous system depressants prescribed for anxiety and sleep disorders ( Valium and Xanax ) ; and stimulants , used to treat attention deficit disorders ( Ritalin and Adderall ) .
Within these categories , the pharmaceutical industry has provided a full set of substitutes for just about every illegal narcotic available .
Methylphenidate , the active chemical in Ritalin , targets the brain 's pleasure - producing centres in the same way as cocaine .
Antidepressants can act as serotonin - boosting ' uppers ' .
A few years ago OxyContin , an extremely powerful painkiller developed for cancer patients , became known as ' hillbilly heroin ' after an epidemic of abuse took root in poor rural communities .
Such mishandled drugs now kill 20,000 a year , nearly twice as many as 10 years ago .
Dependence on legal drugs is not a new problem - during the American Civil War morphine abuse was labelled ' the soldiers ' disease ' - but the practice of prescribing drugs has metamorphosed from a medical treatment of last resort to a way of life .
' The problem has been greatly worsened by the internet , and that affects all countries - including Britain , ' says Susan Foster , of the National Centre on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University , New York .
' As long as you have a credit card , anyone can log on and have potentially lethal drugs delivered to their door .
You do n't even need a prescription .
You have what 's called an " online consultation " where you are asked how old you are , how bad your pain is . '
The substances most commonly traded over the internet are tranquilisers such as diazepam and stimulants like Ritalin .
However , the most dangerous are the opiates , which include codeine and morphine .
The painkiller fentanyl can act like heroin and traffickers get hold of supplies by forging stolen prescriptions , breaking into pharmacies and stealing stocks or buying the drugs from patients who have been prescribed it .
Another opiate painkiller , buprenorphine - prescribed for heroin addicts trying to kick their habit - is peddled in countries as diverse as India , Iran , Finland and France .
From 2001 - 05 , the global consumption of buprenorphine more than tripled to 1.5 billion daily doses .
Doctors are woefully ignorant of the dangers ; a 2005 study by Casa found that 43.3 per cent of them did not ask about drug abuse when taking histories .
Even if they do , the seasoned drug abuser will go from one doctor to the next until they get the quantities they want - a practice known as ' doctor - shopping ' .
This was Jeana Hutsell 's experience .
A petite 35 - year - old from Canton , Ohio , with cropped peroxide blonde hair and square - framed glasses , Hutsell became hooked on Percocet , an opiate - based painkiller , when she was prescribed it 12 years ago after an operation for Crohn 's disease .
' I went to the doctor with abdominal cramps and he began writing me copious prescriptions , ' she says .
Within a year , her habit had escalated to 60 pills a day and she was sewing emergency stashes into the lining of her handbag .
' I felt they gave me personality .
They made me chattier , friendlier . '
Hutsell began forging prescriptions , sometimes walking into hospital casualty departments over the weekend and saying she had run out .
' I felt justified and safe because my doctor was giving them to me .
I was n't getting them on the streets - I was going to a pharmacy . '
Whereas illegal street narcotics - heroin or crack cocaine - are more likely to be used by the poorer socio-economic classes , prescription drugs have become the preserve of the rich .
In the privatised American healthcare industry , these pills do not come cheaply : an antidepressant like Wellbutrin can cost from $ 1,000 to $ 2,400 a year .
Wealthy individuals also enjoy the luxury of paying private physicians - known as ' script doctors ' - to provide them with prescriptions .
And often , because the drugs are viewed as performance - enhancers , they will be taken by those at the higher end of the social strata : by the college students and Wall Street traders .
In the 1980s cocaine was the glamour yuppie drug .
Now , the line of white powder is being overtaken by the little white capsule .
Phoenix
House is a tall , grey stone building on the Upper West Side , a former 19th - century hotel with mosaic - tiled floors in the hall .
The genteel appearance belies its gritty purpose : Phoenix House is a rehabilitation centre for drug and alcohol abusers , treating 6,000 people a day .
In recent years , such centres have seen a substantial increase in prescription drug admissions - some counsellors say that they account for 90 per cent of new patients .
Professor David Deitch , the chief clinical officer , does not want to use the word ' epidemic ' , but he concedes that ' the genie is out of the bottle ' .
' You see prescription drug abuse in the same circles that you saw cocaine abuse - the high - performing executive class .
They might have a big day , so they take some something to get to sleep .
Then they 'll take another pill the next morning to enhance their performance .
Then they 'll go out and use all kinds of drugs at a party , and then to recover from the party the next morning they 'll take a different pill .
It 's pervasive . '
Celebrities who have admitted their own struggles with prescription medication include Elizabeth Taylor , the talkshow host Rush Limbaugh , and Cindy McCain , the wife of the Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
More recently , there have been rumours that Britney Spears has been self - medicating .
The impact has percolated down to impressionable adolescents .
One of the most popular forms of recreation among high - school students is the ' pharm party ' .
Teenagers raid their parents ' medicine cabinets , then pool their resources .
' You throw your drugs into a bowl in the middle of the room , then people pick pills out and chase them with alcohol , ' says Susan Foster .
' We 've seen these internet recipe sites where you go online to find out how to mix drugs for a certain effect .
You can trade drugs online - in fact , at one college the students reported that they had a prescription drug trade forum on the university website . '
Markel tells the story of one of his patients , a 16 - year - old student called Mary , who liked to down a few tablets of OxyContin with a single shot of vodka .
She called the combination ' the sorority girl 's diet cocktail ' because it gave a stronger kick of inebriation with fewer calories than alcohol alone .
' There 's a cachet to this sort of drug abuse , encouraged by the Paris Hiltons and the Lindsay Lohans going into rehab , so it becomes a really cool druggy , party culture , ' Markel says .
' Now teenagers do n't want to smoke and drink , they want to take a pill because it 's so easy to get and some of them can really make you feel good . '
But it is easy to overdose on prescription drugs , partly because your consciousness is impaired and it can be difficult to remember how many you 've taken , and partly because mixing medication without specialised knowledge can produce fatally toxic results .
And however legal these drugs might be , their misuse carries the same consequences as illegal narcotics : the familiar , dispiriting tale of the addict losing their family , friends , job , home and , sometimes , their life .
After two years of Percocet addiction , Jeana Hutsell took stock of the wreckage her life had become : ' I was homeless , I did n't have a car , my family did n't like me .
I realised that I was the cause of all my problems .
That was the turning point . '
Others are not so lucky .
Randy Colvin , an abuser of Valium , Xanax and Percocet , died of a drug overdose on his 35th birthday .
' We tried to save him and we lost , ' says his older brother Rod .
' For 15 years we tried to get him into treatment and each time he would be in denial , he would be furious with us .
My mother and I even tried to get a court order so that he could be sectioned .
We did everything we possibly could .
Addiction is a family disease .
His death was very painful . '
For Heath Ledger 's parents , the grieving process is still in the rawest stages .
Their son cemented his fame for reasons that were nothing to do with his talent .
Instead he is for ever associated with a seedy death on the floor of a Manhattan apartment , just one more victim of the pill - popping epidemic that has become America 's secret illness .
Danger Zone
Painkillers
Popular brands include Nurofen and Solpadeine , which can prove addictive .
Anti-anxiety drugs
Tranquillisers have been involved in numerous recent fatal overdoses .
Sleeping tablets
Users can become dependent in just two weeks .
Ledger was taking Restoril .
Anti-depressants
Prozac withdrawal symptoms are common and can be physically painful .

Xanax is prescribed for generalised anxiety disorder , anxiety associated with depression and panic disorder , but it is not used for the treatment of depression .
The FBI sought approval to use its CIPAV spyware program from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in terrorism or foreign spying cases , THREAT LEVEL has learned .
Officials processing a Freedom of Information
Act request from Wired.com have turned up some 3,000 pages of FBI documents about the CIPAV , according to an FBI FOIA official .
They date back to at least 2005 .
Some 60 - 75 percent of them are internal e-mails .
Others are technical documents and legal filings .
Among the legal filings are affidavits submitted by the FBI in other criminal cases , and affidavits submitted to the secretive FISC , a court based in the Justice Department 's headquarters that approves surveillance orders and covert entries in cases involving national security , including terrorism probes .
The court was created by the 1978
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
FISC hearings are closed and the decisions secret .
As first reported by Wired.com , the software , called a " computer and internet protocol address verifier , " is designed to infiltrate a suspect 's computer and collect various information , including the IP address , Ethernet MAC addresses , a list of open TCP and UDP ports , running programs , operating system type and serial number , default browser , the registered user of the operating system and the last visited URL , among other things .
That information is sent covertly to an FBI computer in Quantico , Virginia .
The CIPAV then monitors and reports on all the target 's internet use , logging every IP address to which the machine connects .
The FBI 's use of the technology surfaced in July when Wired discovered an affidavit in an investigation into a series of high school bomb hoaxes in which the bureau traced the culprit using the program .
An FBI spokeswoman then invited Wired to submit a list of questions about the technology , but has n't gotten back to us .
While the FBI FOIA official did not remark on the quantity or details of the CIPAV affidavits , it 's likely the surveillance requests were granted Through the end of 2004 , the court approved 18,761 warrants , and rejected only five .
It approved 2,072 , in 2005 , and 2,181 in 2006 , rejecting none .
Five were withdrawn before a ruling .
In a rare published opinion in 2002 , the court accused the FBI and Justice Department of supplying " erroneous information " in more than 75 affidavits .
It 's unclear when Wired.com will see the FOIAed documents , and the FISC affidavits will almost certainly be withheld in their entirety .

Anderson Cooper has long traded on his biography , carving a niche for himself as the most human of news anchors .
But there 's one aspect of his past that the silver - haired CNN star has never made public : the months he spent training for a career with the Central Intelligence Agency .
Following his sophomore and junior years at Yale — a well - known recruiting ground for the CIA — Cooper spent his summers interning at the agency 's monolithic headquarters in Langley , Virginia , in a program for students interested in intelligence work .
His involvement with the agency ended there , and he chose not to pursue a job with the agency after graduation , according to a CNN spokeswoman , who confirmed details of Cooper 's CIA involvement to Radar .
" Whatever summer jobs or internships our anchors had in college could n't be less consequential , " she added .
He has kept the experience a secret , sources say , out of concern that , if widely known , it might compromise his ability to travel in foreign countries and even possibly put him at greater risk from terrorists .
" He does n't want to be any more of a target than he already is , " says one Anderson confidante .
On the other hand , as Bob Woodruff and others have learned , American journalists are already prime targets in the world 's conflict zones , and are typically accused of having CIA ties even where none exist .
And by not disclosing his training before now , Cooper has arguably made it into a potential issue .
" It creates the appearance of something smelly there , " says a former CNN official who knows Cooper .
( Particularly in light of the period Anderson spent studying Vietnamese at the University of Hanoi after college .
Soon after , Cooper apparently gave up his Bond fantasy to pursue a career in journalism — except for a brief period when he starred as host of ABC 's reality show , The Mole . )
According to the spokeswoman , Cooper told his bosses at CNN about his time with the agency .
But even if he had n't , says Walter Isaacson , who headed the network from 2001 to 2003 and is now president of the Aspen Institute , it 's not the sort of thing that would automatically require disclosure , since the stint was brief and far in the past .
" I think what he did was probably fine and cool , and I 've got no problems with it , " he added .
One thing that particularly impressed me about Jeffrey Gray was his well - informed scepticism about colour .
This must be a problem for people like you .
According to you what people take to be colour qualia are actually just reality : the real qualities or properties of real objects in the real external world .
If I can demonstrate that colours are not out there - that they 're in your head , or in some Platonic world , or some phenomenal realm - you 'll have to re-think , wo n't you ?
You realise , of course , that colour is not a property of physical objects themselves , but comes from the light they reflect or emit ?
You probably suppose , however , that each colour corresponds directly to the wavelength of the light in question .
Not so .
The actual wavelength varies tremendously according to the light falling on the object ; what colour you see depends to a great extent , not on the wavelength of the light coming from the object you 're actually looking at , but from a complicated comparison with the wavelengths coming from nearby objects .
This helps to ensure that ( within limits ) perceived colour stays constant in spite of varying light conditions : but if you isolate a coloured surface from the kind of clues provided by comparison with other surfaces , a colour can't be assigned to it at all - it just looks white .
I understand perfectly well that the colour vision system is complex , and that the brain infers colours from the available evidence through unconscious and largely involuntary processes .
So what ?
At the end of the day , colour is a property of objects - Gray himself concedes that colour vision is a fallible but practical guide to surface reflectance .
Colour is an interesting property of real objects - if it were imaginary , as you seem to think , how come the colour of objects is so consistent and such a good guide to various physical and chemical properties ?
Colour vision is useful enough to have evolved separately several times in different species - if it was n't telling us something real , how could it be so useful ?
Yes , yes - colour corresponds with real properties .
But colour itself is not in the external physical world .
It 's like those cases where a picture from a telescope or a microscope is given colours artificially to help show up the different substances .
The colours are not real , but they do help you understand more about what you 're seeing .
It turns out that all colour is more or less like that - yes , it 's helpful , but that does n't mean it directly reflects the physical reality .
After all , we only actually sense three different wavelengths .
Our eyes have cells which respond with different degrees of enthusiasm to three different colours : all the others are inferred from the ratios between the three .
A good thing , too , in a way , because otherwise colour photography would be a lot more difficult .
As it is , we can give the appearance of millions of colours just by different mixtures of red , green and blue .
If you think about it , though , this means that the way we see things is actually wrong .
To us , a combination of red wavelengths and green wavelengths looks the same as pure yellow wavelengths - but it is n't the same .
Compare sound , another wavelength phenomenon .
If I play middle C on the piano and the E above it at the same time , it does n't sound like D . But with vision , the wavelengths just get averaged out .
Part of the reason , of course , is that your ears do n't attempt to assign sounds to a precise location in space .
They can afford to have one accurate sensor ( a little hair - like thing ) for lots of different wavelengths .
But your eyes need to assign colour to a precise spot - so they can't crowd hundreds of different cells into that one small area of the retina .
All the same , it is possible to do a bit better , and some animals detect more than three different wavelengths .
Pigeons can do four , for example , so they actually see more colours than we do .
Now how do you cope with that ?
According to you , colours are real : but in that case pigeons somehow have a different reality ?
I do n't claim that our senses are perfect ; pigeons may see colour more accurately , certainly , but I absolutely deny that they see more colours , except in the trivial sense of being able to discriminate finer gradations .
They see the same spectrum we do ; just more clearly .
Ask yourself this : if we only sense three wavelengths , why do we see more than three colours ?
Of course , there can be an indefinite number of different mixtures of the three , but I think it 's obvious that the spectrum we see contains more than that - the full ROYGBIV seven .
You rightly pont out that a mixture of red and green light looks the same as pure yellow light : but if we can only sense the red and the green , why do n't they both look like mixtures ?
But they do n't .
They look like yellow : and yellow does n't look at all like any mixture or combination .
The spectrum is real , and our senses infer that reality and present it to us even though they can't detect it comprehensively .
That sounds borderline loony to me .
What about people who are red - green colour - blind ?
If our senses somehow manage to infer this Platonically real spectrum in spite of inadequate evidence , surely they should be able to see the full spectrum , too ?
And as for ROYGBIV - you 're actually going to defend the separate existence of indigo ?
Everyone knows that Newton stuck that one in just to make sure the number of colours was the mystical value seven .
Red - green colour - blind people do indeed see the full spectrum .
You do n't imagine that they look at a rainbow and find that the red or the green stripe is missing ?
They see both red and green - they just have difficulty telling which is which .
I do n't know about indigo particularly , but I think Newton was right about assigning seven colours to the spectrum .
Perhaps this is another case , like gravity 's action at a distance , where his mystical leanings allowed him to entertain ideas that orthodox scientists had an allergic reaction to .
Consider the analogy with sound .
Both are wave phenomena .
Sound comes in octaves , each with seven distinct notes .
When you get to the eighth note , it is a higher or lower version of the first one - C above or below middle C , say .
Now the basis of the octave is a doubling , or halving of the frequency , and that 's why the two notes sound the same .
If a wave comes along and twitches one of those little hairs you were talking about eight times a second , it matches up with a wave which twitches it four times or sixteen times .
The other notes on the scale come from slightly more complex ratios .
The Greeks knew all about this .
Now the visible spectrum is just the right length to provide seven notes out of an octave of light .
And that 's what we get .
So you maintain that the colours we see are the only possible colours ?
What about octarine ?
What 's that - an eight - legged citrus fruit ?
Octarine is Terry 's Pratchett 's imaginary eighth colour .
Obviously magic is involved in his case , but there has to be an octarine , does n't there ?
The mere conceivability of another colour shows that the spectrum is not an absolute reality .
It seems to me that , just as we can always encounter a completely new smell , there would always be scope for a new colour , if our eyes were able to develop new responses the way our nose presumably can .
But I do n't even need to rely on conceivability .
Some insects can see ultraviolet light , for example , and some snakes can see infrared .
They must assign to those wavelengths colours which we can't see , must n't they ?
Not at all .
Look at the way the spectrum forms a closed circle .
If we extended it downwards below red , we should simply get another , lower , violet .
Now I grant you that the ' lowerness ' would have to expressed in some way - possibly as ' warmth ' .
The colours of the visible spectrum are differentiated in terms of warmth , so perhaps the lower violet would appear distinctly warmer than the one we 're used to ( great scope for interior decorators ... ) .
I repeat , the spectrum is a reality .
You can call it a mathematical reality if that helps , but it 's real .
If we saw colour the way we hear pitch , all this would be obvious .
But the fact that we can't see colour harmonies or more than a single octave of colours means there 's never been any scope for a genius to come along and produce a regularised interpretation of the spectrum , the way J.S. Bach did for the musical scale .
I 'm simply amazed by all this .
But at least it is nice to hear you indulging in speculative phenomenology .
One of only a handful ever made .
This cart was for sale on eBay six months ago .
It was made in the 60s by Turbonique in Florida and used a fuel called Thermolene rocket fuel , a combination of nitromethane , propane and oxygen .
Since his arrest , friends have continued to post entries on his Web log ( www.alfarhan.org) on his behalf under a banner that reads “ Free Fouad ” and features his picture .
“ The issue that caused all of this is because I wrote about the political prisoners here in Saudi Arabia , and they think I ’m running an online campaign promoting their issue , ” the letter continued , saying that Mr. Farhan had been asked to sign a statement of apology .
“ I ’m not sure if I ’m ready to do that , ” he wrote .
“ An apology for what ?
Apologizing because I said the government is a liar when they accused those guys to be supporting terrorism ? ”
Ahmad al - Omran , a blogger and a friend of Mr. Farhan , said that Mr. Farhan had been the first Saudi blogger to be detained by state security .
The arrest created widespread anxiety among other Saudi bloggers and advocates , he said .
“ An incident like this has its effect , ” Mr. Omran said by telephone .
“ It ’s intimidating to think you might be arrested for something on your blog .
On the other hand , this means that these voices on the blogosphere are being heard .
But it ’s really sad that a blogger who is writing about important issues out in the open would get arrested , while there are extremists who call for violence and hate , and the government is not doing much . ”

Early API Standardization Attempts – Last year , a number of attempts were made by the ECMAScript language committee to standardize an API for JSON encoding and decoding , within the language .
A few API proposals were examined and discussed , most based upon Crockford ’s proposal , but no general consensus was reached .
Some general issues with the proposed API were brought forward ( similar to those mentioned in my previous post ) .
JSON2.js – Late last year Crockford quietly released a new version of his JSON API that replaced his existing API .
The important difference was that it used a single base object ( JSON ) instead of extending all native object prototypes ( booo ! ) .
Its revised API worked as such :
JSON.stringify ( {name : " John " , location : " Boston " } ) ; // => '{ " name " : " John " , " location " : " Boston " } ' JSON.parse ( '{ " name " : " John " , " location " : " Boston " } ' ) ; // => {name : " John " , location : " Boston " }
This version of JSON.js is highly recommended .
If you ’re still using the old version , please please upgrade ( this one , undoubtedly , cause less issues than the previous one ) .
Dispersion – Even with a newly - proposed API , criticism concerning the inclusion of JSON in the ECMAScript language came to a questionable conclusion .
Some implementors were n’t interested in including it , others were , and yet other could n’t decide on the final API or method names .
It was then decided that implementing JSON support in an ECMAScript implementation would be left up to the implementors themselves ( unless , of course , some other conclusion is arrived upon in the future ) .
Mozilla Implements Native JSON – Mozilla was the first to implement native JSON support within it ’s browser .
Note , however , that this is not a web - page - accessible API but an API that ’s usable from within the browser ( and by extensions ) itself .
This was the first step needed to implement the API for further use .
Here is an example of it in use ( works within an extension , for example ) :
var nativeJSON = Components.classes [" @mozilla.org/dom/json;1 " ] .createInstance ( Components.interfaces.nsIJSON ) ; nativeJSON.encode ( {name : " John " , location : " Boston " } ) ; // => '{ " name " : " John " , " location " : " Boston " } ' nativeJSON.decode ( '{ " name " : " John " , " location " : " Boston " } ' ) ; // => {name : " John " , location : " Boston " }
Web - accessible Native JSON –
The final , and most important , step is being worked on right now – a way to access native JSON encoding and decoding from web pages .
How it ’ll be accessible is up to some debate ( as having its naming conflict with an existing object would be a really bad thing ) .
Regardless , there should be something within the browser by the time the Firefox 3 betas wrap - up .
What ’s important about this is that it ’s really not a case of “ Oh well , guess we ’ll have to wait for other browsers to implement this . ”
Since this is a native implementation ( and , thus , very - very fast ) existing JSON encoding / decoding libraries can just check for the existence of this particular set of functions and use them directly – gaining a direct , and immediate , performance boost for Firefox users .
The same principle applies to features like getElements ByClassName , since they ’re available in normal JavaScript code , but are insanely fast when implemented directly by a browser .
Congressman Tom Lantos died before completing work to improve PEPFAR .
Some of his last words chided GOP ideologues , and could apply to some AIDS advocates who are running from a fight Lantos was eager to engage .
The nation mourns Congressman Tom Lantos ( D - CA ) , a Holocaust survivor who served in the House of Representatives for 28 years and who died Monday .
Lantos never caved in to forces of ideology , throughout his entire life , that suggested we should accept the politics of a few trying to claim power over many .
His life is a triumph of courage , personal and political , over ideology for the sake of raw power .
Lantos also understood bipartisanship meant working across party lines to achieve real and genuine compromise , as he did with Rep. Henry Hyde , the Chairman of Foreign Affairs when the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) was originally authorized and Lantos was in the minority .
When PEPFAR was passed , the " E " in it standing for " Emergency , " compromise was important .
But even then Lantos did not compromise principle , working to balance competing ideas to address an urgent situation .
The reauthorization of PEPFAR this year , while every bit as important , need not be seen as an " emergency " and should not fall victim to political " expedience . "
Democrats won a majority , in part , because voters are fed up with social conservative ideologues .
As such , the goal for PEPFAR reauthorization must be sustainable , workable programs that apply lessons from the first five years moving forward .
The final bill should honor the convictions of Chairman Tom Lantos .
In a press release four days before he died , Lantos chided ideological Republicans on the committee , including Rep. Chris Smith , Rep. Steve Chabot , and Rep. Mike Pence , saying ,
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Henry [ Hyde ] , God rest his soul , joined me and many of our colleagues five years ago in ensuring that a bipartisan bill became law by creating a $ 15 billion program that has saved countless lives in some of the poorest countries in the world .
That legislation included compromises on issues important to those of us who were then in the minority .
It is a shame that the current minority is failing to honor this spirit of compromise and is willing to endanger a valuable U.S. foreign policy program addressing one of the most serious health care challenges that humanity faces today .
But it is not only social conservative ideologues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee that should be called out .
It 's not just Wendy Wright from Concerned Women for America , or Pastor Rick Warren trying to be an Evangelical moderate but never far from conservative ideologues .
Some AIDS advocates seem too willing to appease , even though they know the scientific data , see the problems created by ideological politicians first - hand , and hear what public health experts around the world say :
PEPFAR 's 33 percent abstinence - only earmarks prevent wider success and should be eliminated ;
Failure to integrate reproductive health and HIV prevention endangers women and girls , failing to meet them where they receive health services , where the most could be done to prevent HIV .
This is especially true in macho cultures where females cannot negotiate sex or access contraception to protect themselves from disease ;
Local implementation of public health strategies , prevention and education efforts should not be dictated by politics , rather guided by people on the ground who know how to reach the most vulnerable populations ;
Family planning and contraceptive services , according to the World Health Organization , should be available through other health interventions to prevent mother - to - child transmission .
Despite gathering and promoting much of this data and working to promote better understanding of the AIDS pandemic , Bono 's Debt AIDS Trade Africa and the Global AIDS Alliance are suggesting that Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee give in to ideological demands of the far - right .
The bill is not even marked up or out of committee where less ideological Republicans can work with Democrats to strengthen the bill .
Tom Lantos ' last efforts before he died called for bipartisanship that can achieve real results , not appeasement .
Noting the mountains of evidence the World Health Organization and Institutes of Medicine have gathered in the first five years of PEPFAR , all encouraging a shift to longer term sustainability and emphasizing the importance of local implementation , Lantos said ,
Facts are driving the reauthorization of the Global HIV / AIDS program , not ideology .
The draft global HIV / AIDS reauthorization bill actually supports and increases the number or references to abstinence and faithfulness education as part of the integrated ‘ ABC ’ prevention approach .
Yes , it removes the 1/3 abstinence - only earmark , which was included in the 2003 law over strong Democratic objections , because that restriction has proven to be hampering the effectiveness of programs in the field .
Bipartisanship is not an end we should seek for political expedience , but a means to improving public health policy and making certain that PEPFAR experience , public health data , and science prevail so that good money does n't follow bad .
Continuing to support failed abstinence - only programs with 33 percent earmarks that tie the hands of cultures vastly different than ours , binding them to narrow social ideologies that even the vast majority of Americans do n't support , makes no sense .
Tom Lantos understood that , and so should Bono , DATA , the One Campaign and the Global AIDS Alliance .
This is the moment to fight for what 's right against ideologues who contributed to the spread of the AIDS pandemic for the first 25 years , and continue to stigmatize many .
Efforts by Democrats in Congress to improve PEPFAR based on proven scientific and public health methods , collected during the first five years of the program , should be strongly supported — especially by AIDS advocates — over the efforts of Republican ideologues that are trying to weaken the Lantos Bill .
More money on bad policies is not the way to confront this epidemic .
There is no reason to cave to ideologues like Chris Smith , Mike Pence and Steve Chabot in the name of bipartisanship – especially when it flies in the face of sound public health policies .
If the Democrats , working with moderate Republicans who will not ignore scientific and public health data , cannot produce a dramatically improved bill , it may be better to wait for the new President and Congress , and raise awareness of the failures of conservative ideologues between now and the November election .
PEPFAR money will continue to flow , and the chance for a better bill that can address problems on the ground will be vastly improved with a strong mandate for reality over ideology in the 2008 election .
Let the people who stand in the way of improving PEPFAR answer these questions :
1 . Why should n’t Congress act on the recommendation by the Institutes of Medicine and the Government Accountability Office to remove the requirement that at least 33 % of prevention funds be spent on abstinence - until marriage programs ?
2 . Under the current PEPFAR , countries have already asked to not have the abstinence earmark apply to them because it does not work .
Why not listen to local public health experts ?
3 . While there are a range of ways to prevent HIV , we know that in practicality none of them on their own are always effective , so is n’t there a moral obligation to make all the tools available to people ?
4 . Given the savings – in lives and in money – for full scale up of prevention efforts , would n’t it be prudent to promote every prevention tool and behavior change available in a way that meets a country ’s needs ?
5 . Who should be deciding what public health strategies work best in any country ?
6 . Do you believe people should be able to choose to use contraceptives ?
7 . Can you imagine that an HIV positive person may actually want to choose to not become pregnant and may live in a culture where women and girls cannot negotiate sex ?
8. Should PEPFAR money be targeted to the most vulnerable populations to stem the spread of AIDS , and should local public health officials be able to determine who is most vulnerable in their communities ?
9 . Some Members of Congress have had sex with people other than their spouses – should their spouses have the information and services to protect themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections ?
10 .
Should n't reality trump ideology when it comes to preventing disease ?
