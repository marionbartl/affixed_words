Eliot Spitzer has been caught using the power of his office to go after his enemies .
Wow , what a surprise .
Frequent readers of this blog will know I do n't think much of Spitzer , who tended to overreach his office all the way back to student government at Princeton .
What I found surprising , though , was this quote from the NY Times :
The report was a blow to Mr. Spitzer , a former prosecutor who came into
office less than seven months ago with a reputation for integrity and
who promised to bring a new ethical climate to Albany .
A reputation for integrity with whom ?
Mr. Spitzer , as attorney general , was a sort of liberal bookend to George W. Bush , consistently exceeding the limits of his authority to achieve some goal he argued trumped a narrow reading of the law .
His supporters , just as Bush 's do , justify his overreaching his office on the grounds that the ends justified the means , in Spitzer 's case the assault on various corporate and Wall Street firms liberals were frustrated that Washington would not pursue .
Critics like myself argued that many of his crusades were abuses of his prosecutorial office to pursue personal vendetta's and to generate headlines to position himself for a run for governor .
I would think that any reasonable definition of " integrity " when applied to an attorney general would include a respect for the letter of the law , something that even his supporters would probably admit Spitzer cast aside when he thought it was for a good cause .
The only interpretation of " integrity " I can come up with in the context of this article is that Spitzer had integrity in the past because his abuses of power were in pursuit of causes the author agreed with .
Look , this is the man that began supporting campaign finance limitations , which tend to support incumbents , starting the day after he became an incumbent .
This is the man who described himself as governor thus : " I
am a fucking steamroller and I 'll roll over you or anybody else " .
This is the man who involved the State of New York and the courts in a private compensation deal , just to burnish his populist credentials .
In the latter trial , he explicitly left prominent Democrats who had the most involvement with the deal alone and indicted side figures who were Republicans .
Tom Kirkendall has a much longer bill of particulars against Spitzer here .
During all the April Russian geeks were waiting for the iPhone from Apple to be released in Russia .
There were plenty of the signs : big billboards across the Moscow city made in Apple - style with the word “ iSoon ” in Russian and the date of April , 22st , 2008 , itunes - store .ru webdomain with the same ad and many more “ good signs ” for those who wanted the localized iPhone .
All the geek communities had a major buzz on this topic too .
But when the day X had come , it came out that they were all fooled .
It turned to be a virus ad campaign by …
Contex , the worldwide condom producer .
They decided to advertise in this way their new condoms …
There 's no two ways about it - this car is ugly as sin and as rough as a shipping pallet .
But that does n't matter because it gets 95 mpg .
Its owner , known only as " basjoos , " says he spent $ 400 building " Aerocivic " in his yard using things you can get at hardware and art supply stores .
That pretty much invalidates auto industry arguments about it being difficult and costly to build super fuel - efficient cars .
It also makes him a contender for the Automotive X - Prize , a $ 10 million challenge to build the first 100 - mpg car .
According to a thread over at Ecomodder.com , basjoos started with a 1992 Honda Civic CX that already got about 50 mpg or so .
He used aluminum , Coroplast and Lexan to improve the aerodynamics of the car , dropping the drag coefficient from 0.34 to 0.17 .
Although the car looks like it would be pushed all over the place , if not blow apart entirely , in a stiff breeze , basjoos claims it 's smooth to 90 mph and will top 100 mph .
He says it gets 95 mpg up to 65 mph before fuel economy begins to fall as speed increases .
Granted , the Civic is a lightweight car with a small engine and a lot of the improvement in basjoos ' fuel economy can be attributed to his hypermiler driving style .
But AeroCivic is still an impressive accomplishment , and Ron Cogan of Green Car Journal and GreenCar.com tells us automakers will be building cars a lot like it in order to meet the new 35 mpg fuel economy standard .
We 're trying to get ahold of basjoos to learn more about the car .
We 'll keep you posted .

Expansion of U.S. bases spurs Philippine resistance Published Mar 29 , 2008 10:53 AM
A category of semi-secret U.S. bases is vastly extending the Pentagon ’s military presence around the globe .
Innocuously called CSLs , for Cooperative Security Locations , these bases are a new , covert form of intervention .
The CSLs and other loose security agreements allow the Pentagon to set up facilities and structures , lease warehouses , and maintain roads , airstrips and seaports using a combination of private contractors and local forces .
The Pentagon maintains a network of military bases in about 70 countries .
But the new Collective Security Locations are being established in up to 100 other countries .
Senior Editor Adam J. Hebert wrote an article in the August 2006 Air Force Magazine online entitled “ Presence , Not Permanence ” that described the Pentagon ’s changing approach to its worldwide bases and its need , since the collapse of the Soviet Union , to reorganize and break out of its “ strategically obsolete Cold War straitjacket . ”
Hebert described how , with the closing of bases , such as in Iceland , the Air Force did n’t bring home large numbers of airmen but instead updated its basing structure with a series of new locations and temporary bases .
Asia Times online of June 1 , 2005 , reporting on an earlier background briefing by a senior official of the Defense Department , explained that the U.S. had been operating from “ 5,458 distinct and discrete military installations around the world .
...
We do n’t need those little pieces of property anymore . ”
The Commission on Review of the Overseas Military Facility Structure of the U.S. , also known as the Overseas Basing Commission , was established by Congress to conduct a thorough study on the global re-alignment of U.S. bases .
The commission defined a series of new basing arrangements .
The CSLs were supposedly envisioned as facilities with little or no permanent U.S. presence , maintained with contractor and / or host nation support .
They contain prepositioned equipment and are rapidly scalable and expandable .
The Overseas Basing Commission also defines Forward Operating Sites as places with prepositioned equipment that can host rotational forces and be a focus for bilateral and regional training .
Other categories , such as Forward Support Location , Preposition Site , and En Route Infrastructure , are defined as new base arrangements beyond the traditional Main Operating Base that has permanently stationed combat forces and command and control structures .
The expanding U.S. military presence throughout East , South and Central Asia appears to be focused on surrounding and attempting to isolate the growing influence of China .
The Pentagon also uses joint military exercises to exert overwhelming influence over the militaries of many smaller and developing nations .
Former U.S. Pacific Command head Admiral Thomas Fargo explained in March 2003 that relationships built through exercises and training are “ our biggest guarantor of access in time of need . ”
There are CSLs in Thailand , throughout South and Central Asia , and in Senegal , Africa .
Philippines example Growing popular struggles against the joint military exercises and the CSL bases in the Philippines may have an impact on anti-base struggles around the world .
For over 110 years the Philippines has been U.S. imperialism ’s prime military outpost and stepping stone to China and the Asian mainland .
U.S. bases in the Philippines enabled the U.S. military to control strategic sea lanes .
Philippine law has banned U.S. bases since a mass movement forced them out in 1992 .
Yet today 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed there and are in constant operation .
Under the Balikatan joint war exercises , the Pentagon is bringing in logistical equipment and building installations .
According to a Feb. 26 report from Foreign Policy in Focus , the number of troops , ships , equipment and infrastructure grows each year .
The year 2005 saw 24 joint military exercises involving U.S. and Philippine troops .
This grew to 37 scheduled exercises in 2006 — or one U.S. military exercise every 10 days .
“ Training missions ” and military exercises mean a continuing presence of U.S. troops in the Philippines .
It also comes with a special name : the Joint Special Operations Task Force - Philippines .
The JSOTF - P has been based in the Philippines for more than six years on an ongoing “ temporary training mission . ”
The U.S. stay has become open - ended and , as with the “ temporary ” CSL bases , its permanence is unofficial and unacknowledged .
Immediately after 9/11 Washington used as an excuse for the re-entry of its forces that the Philippines needed help in fighting a “ terrorist threat ” from a small , secretive armed group known as Abu Sayyaf .
The Manila Times of Aug. 27 , 2007 , reported that , “ Even as the United States denies plans to set up a military base in the Philippines , the American military is reportedly building a host of projects across Mindanao . ”
A Rand Corporation report prepared for the U.S. Air Force entitled “ Ungoverned Territories ” and available online summarizes U.S. military presence globally .
It highlights the Pakistan / Afghanistan border area , East Africa , West Africa , the Caucasus , the Venezuela / Colombia border and Mindanao Island in the Philippines .
The U.S. “ area of operations ” in the Philippines presently covers 8,000 square miles , including the entire island of Mindanao and surrounding islands .
Paying for occupation
In the Philippines and many other underdeveloped countries drowning in debt , the “ host ” country must pay for the U.S. military presence .
According to a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement , available online , that the Philippines signed with the U.S. in November 2002 , the Philippine government must supply the Pentagon with all the logistical support needed during the endless military and training “ exercises ” and “ other U.S. military deployments ” to maintain their forces in the region .
This Support Agreement lists everything from food and water to ammunition , spare parts and components , billeting , transportation , communication , medical services , operation support , training services , repair and maintenance , storage services , port services and construction of “ temporary structures . ”
Everything the U.S. used to supply for its own use at its former bases in the region , such as the giant Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base , is now to be provided by the impoverished Philippine government on an as - need basis .
The newsletter U.S. Intervention Watch , published by Initiatives for Peace in Mindanao in coordination with US Troops Out Now !
Mindanao Coalition , explains that the widely publicized U.S. humanitarian missions are really military operations and a cover for a permanent military presence .
“ The objective is not to provide health care to peasant farmers , but to secure U.S. economic interests in the Asia - Pacific by turning the Philippines into a base of operation .
This base will serve to protect U.S. multi-billion dollar investments and promote prospective commerce in the Philippines in oil , energy , minerals and plantations , keep an eye on the Malacca Straits where 25 percent of all globally traded oil passes , and threaten nearby China as its rise to global power continues , ” says the newsletter .
Massacre made in USA U.S. occupation troops bring attacks , massacres and rapes of the local civilian population .
According to a news article in Bulatlat , a weekly Philippine online news magazine , “ U.S. troops were present during the February 4 assault by combined Army and Navy elite forces on Barangay village , Ipil , Maimbung , Sulu , that killed eight non-combatants , including an Army soldier home on vacation . ”
Sulu ’s Governor Abdulsakur
Tan said : “ This is not the first time that the U.S. troops were reported to have taken part in Philippine military operations in Sulu . ”
He corroborated the U.S. role in an attack in early 2007 , when U.S. troops were supposedly doing “ road construction ” in the village of Barangay Bato - Bato , Indanan .
Temogen Tulawie , convener of the Concerned Citizens of Sulu and former Jolo councilor , said the latest massacre is part of a larger picture .
Starting in 2003 , Balikatan military exercises were held in Sulu .
This provoked waves of protest from the people , who still remember an historic massacre committed in 1906 when hundreds of Moro resistance fighters were gunned down by U.S. occupation forces .
Kawagib Moro Human Rights Organization and Suara Bangsamoro have filed a case before the U.N. Human Rights Council on the latest massacre .
The U.S. military presence is no longer covert in the Philippines .
A mass movement is paying growing attention and mobilizing against this new form of U.S. occupation .
As Initiatives for Peace and U.S. Troops Out Now !
Mindanao Coalition explained : “ Mindanao has a long history of resistance to colonization . ”

Inflated prices for sports events and pop concerts are nothing new .
The Disney Channel ’s “ Hannah Montana , ” 14 - year - old singer Miley Cyrus , made headlines this month with reports of brokers offering single tickets to her upcoming concert tour for as much as $ 3,000 .
At the upper end of the spectrum , premium seating for next year ’s Super Bowl is available for $ 75,000 .
Shakespeare at $ 1,700 a seat , however , is heady for L.A .
Yet single tickets are being peddled for more than $ 1,000 for the sole West Coast engagement of England ’s Royal Shakespeare Company in “ King Lear , ” starring Ian McKellen , to be presented at UCLA ’s Royce Hall for six performances beginning Friday .
Spending at “ Lear ” levels is rare for arts attractions .
The closest that L.A. comes may be such gala events as the Los Angeles Philharmonic ’s annual fundraising season opener , with a minimum of $ 1,500 per person .

The big draw this time is McKellen , widely regarded as one of the world ’s leading stage actors but far better known as the bearded wizard Gandalf in the Oscar - winning “ Lord of the Rings ” films .
The RSC ’s touring double bill , “ Lear ” and Chekhov ’s “ The Seagull , ” marks the first time he has performed with the company in 17 years .
The entire run of “ Lear ” at Royce Hall and most of the seats for the three “ Seagulls ” in which McKellen appears were sold out July 23 , the day that tickets went on sale to the public with a top price of $ 90 , according to David Sefton , executive and artistic director of UCLA Live , which is presenting the performances .
“ This is obviously the kind of problem that you want , ” Sefton said .
“ But it ’s to the point where you ’ve closed your waiting list and you know you ca n’t even accommodate all the people that are on that , so it is really sold out . ”

Tickets withheld by UCLA from the initial public sale until the theater ’s final seating allowance was determined -- after reconfiguration to accommodate the RSC productions -- are gone as well , he said .
Stubhub , a major online ticket marketplace , is now listing single orchestra seats to “ Lear ” at $ 936 to $ 1,706 ; balcony tickets start at $ 442 .
( McKellen ’s “ Seagull ” performances are going for a relatively paltry $ 325 to $ 548 . )
On EBay , where bidding for one pair of “ Lear ” tickets topped $ 800 , a pair of orchestra seats for the final show Oct. 28 has a starting bid of $ 3,000 , with a “ buy it now ” price of $ 3,500 .
“ There ’s nothing you can do to stop it , and it drives me insane , ” Sefton said .
“ I know they ’re going for $ 1,500 a ticket on Substub or whatever it ’s called . ”
The highest price actually paid for a pair has been $ 2,106 , said Stubhub spokesman Sean Pate , and the average price paid for a single ticket has been $ 708 .
The extremely limited number of seats on offer at the website has made the RSC shows “ a seller ’s market , ” he said .

The English troupe will conclude a three - city U.S. tour at Royce .
It also sold out at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York and the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis .
Spokeswoman Melodie Bahan of the Guthrie , where the last two “ Lears ” will be performed today and Sunday afternoon , said that after “ Lear ” sold out the first day that tickets were offered to subscribers there , single tickets were going for $ 800 on Craigslist .
“ But every day we ’ve had people lining up at the box office for cancellations , and we have been able to get them in , ” she said .
The last time she could recall such frenzied demand at the Guthrie was when Patrick Stewart of TV’s “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” and the “ X - Men ” films ( costarring McKellen ) headlined “ Who ’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? ” in 2001 .

McKellen was both flattered and self - effacing when he heard about the ticket prices for “ Lear ’s ” New York run .
“ The going rate for a ticket for ‘ King Lear ’ is approaching $ 3,000 for a single ticket on EBay , ” he said .
“ So -- well , of course , I do n’t take it personally .
I mean , it is the Royal Shakespeare Company doing ‘ King Lear ’ directed by Trevor Nunn .
I ’m in it , but I mean we ’re only here for a short period .
. . .
If we were n’t selling out , there would be something wrong .
Maybe nobody has [ paid that price ] .
Maybe these tickets do n’t actually get sold . ”
Word of the inflated prices elicited a wry observation from John Spokes , director of development for UCLA Live .
“ I ’m pretty sure every member of the Royce Center Circle , our major donor group , received the RSC tickets they wanted , ” he said .
“ Compared to online prices , the minimum membership of $ 500 is a pretty good deal . ”

UCLA Live has allotted its usual reduced student tickets for the RSC engagement -- “ everything we do has around 10 % allocation to students , to UCLA students first , ” Sefton said .
But student rush tickets wo n’t be offered , although he expects “ optimistic walk - ups ” may be accommodated .
“ You never know .
We might have a handful of releases , because there may be people who suddenly do n’t show , ” he said .
Sefton hopes that people who find they are unable to use their tickets will call the box office .
And , he pointed out , some tickets remain for the three performances of “ The Seagull ” that McKellen does not appear in .
“ As I keep saying to people , ” he said , “ it ’s still the Royal Shakespeare Company doing ‘ The Seagull . ’
Just because it ’s on Sir Ian ’s rest day does n’t mean it ’s not going to be a fantastic experience . ”

U.S. soldiers inspect the scene of a roadside bomb attack in Baghdad November 1 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Thaier al - Sudani
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Five U.S. soldiers were killed when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under small arms fire in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Monday , the U.S. military said .
The military said U.S. and Iraqi forces had secured the area following the incident , which was one of the deadliest attacks against U.S. troops in months .
There were no further details .
Iraqi army and police also reported that clashes had broken out in the Haysuma neighborhood , a known al Qaeda stronghold in eastern Mosul , Iraq ’s third - largest city 390 km ( 240 miles ) north of Baghdad .
The Mosul attack against the U.S. patrol takes to 36 the number of soldiers killed in Iraq this month , up from 23 in December but similar to levels in October and November .
Mosul has been in the spotlight after Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said on Friday that Iraqi forces were preparing for a “ decisive ” offensive against al Qaeda in Iraq to push the Sunni Islamist militants out of their last major urban stronghold .
Iraqi tanks and helicopters began arriving in Mosul with troop reinforcements on Sunday .
U.S. military officials on Sunday said their own operations around Mosul were continuing .
U.S. military commanders say al Qaeda , blamed for most serious bombings in Iraq , has regrouped in northern provinces after being squeezed out of the western province of Anbar and from around Baghdad during security crackdowns last year .

At a university lab in a Tokyo suburb , engineering students are wiring a rubbery robot face to simulate six basic expressions : anger , fear , sadness , happiness , surprise and disgust .
Hooked up to a database of words clustered by association , the robot -- dubbed Kansei , or “ sensibility ” -- responds to the word “ war ” by quivering in what looks like disgust and fear .
It hears “ love , ” and its pink lips smile .
“ To live among people , robots need to handle complex social tasks , ” said project leader Junichi Takeno of Meiji University .
“ Robots will need to work with emotions , to understand and eventually feel them .
Although robots are a long way from matching human emotional complexity , the country is perhaps the closest to a future -- once the stuff of science fiction -- in which humans and robots routinely live side by side and interact socially .

Robots are such a part of Japanese factories that they are sometimes welcomed on their first day at work with Shinto religious ceremonies .
Robots make sushi .
Robots plant rice and tend paddies .
There are robots serving as receptionists , vacuuming office corridors , spoon - feeding the elderly .
They serve tea , greet company guests and chatter away at public technology displays .
Now start - ups are marching out robotic home helpers .
They are n’t all humanoid .
The Paro is a furry robot seal fitted with sensors beneath its fur and whiskers , designed to comfort the lonely , opening and closing its eyes and moving its flippers .
For Japan , the robotics revolution is an imperative .
With more than a fifth of the population 65 or older , the country is banking on robots to replenish the workforce and care for the elderly .

In the last several years , the government has funded a plethora of robotics - related efforts , including about $ 42 million for the first phase of a humanoid robotics project , and $ 10 million a year from 2006 to 2010 to develop key robot technologies .
The government estimates the industry could surge from about $ 5.2 billion in 2006 to $ 26 billion in 2010 and nearly $ 70 billion by 2025 .
Besides financial and technological power , the robot wave is favored by the Japanese mind - set as well .
Robots have long been portrayed as friendly helpers in Japanese popular culture , a far cry from the rebellious and violent machines that often inhabit Western science fiction .

This is , after all , the country that invented Tamagotchi , the hand - held digital pets that captivated the children of the world .
Japanese are also more accepting of robots because the native Shinto religion often blurs boundaries between the animate and inanimate , experts say .
To the Japanese psyche , the idea of a humanoid robot with feelings does n’t feel as creepy -- or as threatening -- as it might in other cultures .
Still , Japan faces a vast challenge in making the leap -- commercially and culturally -- from toys , gimmicks and the experimental robots churned out by university labs like Takeno ’s to full - blown human replacements that ordinary people can afford and use safely .
“ People are still asking whether people really want robots running around their homes , and folding their clothes , ” said Damian Thong , senior technology analyst at Macquarie Bank in Tokyo .
Advertisement
“ But then again , Japan ’s the only country in the world where everyone has an electric toilet , ” he said .
“ We could be looking at a robotics revolution . ”
That revolution has been going on quietly for some time .
Japan is already an industrial robot powerhouse .
More than 370,000 robots worked at factories across Japan in 2005 , about 40 % of the global total and 32 robots for every 1,000 Japanese manufacturing employees , according to a recent report by Macquarie , which had no numbers from subsequent years .
And they wo n’t be claiming overtime or drawing pensions when they ’re retired .

“ The cost of machinery is going down , while labor costs are rising , ” said Eimei Onaga , chief executive of Innovation Matrix Inc. , a company that distributes Japanese robotics technology in the U.S .
“ Soon , robots could even replace low - cost workers at small firms , greatly boosting productivity , ” Onaga said .
That ’s just what the Japanese government has been counting on .
A 2007 national technology roadmap by the Trade Ministry calls for 1 million industrial robots to be in use throughout the country by 2025 .
A single robot can replace about 10 employees , the roadmap assumes .
That means Japan ’s future million - robot army of workers could take the place of 10 million humans -- or about 15 % of the current workforce .

“ Robots are the cornerstone of Japan ’s international competitiveness , ” Shunichi Uchiyama , the Trade Ministry ’s chief of manufacturing industry policy , said at a recent seminar .
“ We expect robotics technology to enter even more sectors going forward . ”
And localities looking to boost regional industry clusters have seized on robotic technology as a way to spur advances in other fields .
Robotic technology is used to build more complex cars , for instance , and surgical equipment .
The logical next step is robots in everyday life .

At a hospital in Aizu Wakamatsu , 190 miles north of Tokyo , a child - size white and blue robot wheels across the floor , guiding patients to and from the outpatients ’ surgery area .
The robot , made by start - up Tmsk , sports perky catlike ears , recites simple greetings , and uses sensors to detect and warn people in the way .
It helpfully prints out maps of the hospital , and even checks the state of patients ’ arteries .
The Aizu Chuo Hospital spent about $ 557,000 installing three of the robots in its waiting rooms to test patients ’ reactions .
The response has been overwhelmingly positive , said spokesman Naoya Narita .
“ We feel this is a good division of labor .
Robots wo n’t ever become doctors , but they can be guides and receptionists , ” Narita said .
Advertisement
Still , the wheeled machines had n’t won over all seniors crowding the hospital waiting room on a weekday morning .
“ It just told us to get out of the way ! ” huffed wheelchair - bound Hiroshi Asami , 81 .
“ It ’s a robot .
It ’s the one who should get out of my way . ”
“ I prefer dealing with real people , ” he said .
Another roadblock is money .
For all its research , Japan has yet to come up with a commercially successful consumer robot .
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. failed to sell even one of its pricey , toddler - sized Wakamaru robots , launched in 2003 as domestic helpers .
Advertisement
Though initially popular , Sony Corp .'s robot dog , Aibo , was sent to the scrap heap in 2006 , just seven years after its launch .
With a price tag of $ 2,000 , Aibo never managed to break into the mass market .
One of the only commercially successful consumer robots so far is made by an American company , IRobot Corp .
The Roomba vacuum cleaner robot is self - propelled and can clean rooms without supervision .
“ We can pretty much make anything , but we have to ask , what are people actually going to buy ? ” said IRobot CEO Helen Greiner .
The company has sold 2.5 million Roombas -- which retail for as little as $ 120 -- since the line was launched in 2002 .
Still , with the correct approach , robots could provide a wealth of consumer goods , Greiner stressed at a recent convention .
Advertisement
Sure enough , Japanese makers are catching on , launching low - cost robots like Tomy ’s $ 300 i-Sobot , a toy - like hobby robot that comes with 17 motors , can recognize spoken words and can be remote - controlled .
“ What we need now is n’t the ultimate humanoid robot , ” said Kyoji Takenaka , the head of the Robot Business Promotion Council .
“ Engineers need to remember that the key to developing robots is n’t in the lab , but in everyday life . ”

Man and machine live in harmony
From the Associated Press
Japan ’s love affair with robots could be said to be more than 300 years old .
Wooden wind - up dolls known as karakuri appeared as early as the 17th century .
Especially famous is a kimono - clad tea- serving machine considered one of the world ’s first “ robots . ”
It carried a bowl of tea on a tray from the host to the guest , waited patiently until the guest replaced the bowl and then returned to the host .

Based on Western gun- and clock - making technology , these robots were designed as helpers or crowd - pleasers .
That was long before Czech playwright Karel Capek ’s science - fiction drama , “ R.U.R. , ” introduced the word “ robot ” to the public at large in the early 1920s .
Capek ’s machines are at first happy to toil as laborers for their human creators , but stage a rebellion that triggers the end of the human race .
“ In Japan , where robots are the good guys in anime or comic books , people just do n’t feel as threatened by robots as they do in the United States or Europe , ” said Brian Carlisle , president of Precise Automation in Auburn , Calif . , and former head of the U.S. Robotic Industries Assn .
WASHINGTON  The U.S. Treasury will start sending tax rebate checks to Americans next week , ahead of its previous schedule , and aims to pump $ 50 billion into the U.S. economy by the end of May , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says .
" We will start a bit earlier .
We 're a little bit ahead of schedule , so we will start right on Monday with direct deposits , " Paulson told Reuters in an interview .
Previously , the Treasury had planned to begin tax rebate payments in early May as part of a $ 152 billion stimulus plan passed in February .
The checks had to wait until after the IRS processed the bulk of tax returns filed before April 15 .
But Paulson noted that the economy is facing stiff headwinds from high fuel prices and a protracted housing downturn , so the administration wants to rush funds to consumers to keep the economy from deteriorating further .
He said the distribution of rebate payments totaling more than $ 100 billion will be largely completed by the end of June , well before his previous goal of summer 's end .
More than 800,000 electronic payments will be sent to tax filers per day on Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday of next week , with an additional 5 million sent on Friday , May 2 .
" Close to 8 million people will get their stimulus payments next week , " he said .
" You add that to the incentives for business to make investments , we think that will give the economy a boost , upwards of 500,000 jobs , " Paulson added .
He said the economy had slowed down significantly , noting that " last quarter was a tough quarter , " with continued downside risks from housing and from financial market turmoil .

Dad says he felt weird sensation before microwaving baby Dad says he felt ' weird sensation ' before microwaving baby
GALVESTON — Joshua Royce Mauldin felt a " weird sensation " and lost control of his actions before placing his 2 - month - old daughter in a microwave oven , according to a video of his statement to police shown during his trial today .
" I felt a weird sensation , a crazy sensation , " Mauldin , 20 , of Warren , Ark. , said in the video of his interview with Galveston police Detective Holly Johnson .
At the direction of attorneys during her testimony , Johnson read from psychological evaluations done when Mauldin was a teenager in which he reports hearing voices that threaten to kill him if he does n't do what they want .
In the video shown to the jury on the fourth day of his trial on a charge of injury to a child , Mauldin said he felt like " a shell and a hot fire inside , right in your stomach .
At that point I had no control over my body .
" I could see what was going on , but I could n't do anything about it . "
Mauldin described how he tossed his daughter from one bed to another in a motel room on Seawall Boulevard after checking in with his family shortly after midnight on May 10 last year .
He told Johnson that after his wife , Eva , left the room , he punched his daughter in the groin , slapping his fist into his palm to show how much force he used .
He then put Anna Murphy into the motel room safe , then the refrigerator before placing her in the microwave for about 10 seconds .
Mauldin said he finally came to his senses and realized what he was doing .
" When I got control over my body , I freaked out , " he told Johnson .
" I would n't do that . "
He then says that most people would think he is crazy .
" Do you think you 're crazy ? " Johnson asks .
Mauldin replies , " No . "
Later in the video , Mauldin uses a Teddy bear to re-create the actions leading to Anna being placed in the microwave oven .
He said he gently folded her legs to get her in the oven and that she was facing him .
Mauldin later begins sobbing when Johnson hands him photos of Anna 's injuries .
He said he first told officials that Anna was sunburned during the drive from Arkansas , then concocted a story about spilling hot water on her while making coffee after being told that the burns could not have been caused by the sun .
He said he kept the truth from his wife for several days .
He also tells Johnson that he brought his wife , daughter , mother and younger brother to Galveston because he was called by the Lord to be a preacher .
" He told me to come here , " Mauldin says .
God had also shown him " signs , " he said .
Mauldin also said Galveston had more churches than Warren , giving him a better chance of getting a job as an assistant pastor .
After the video was shown , attorneys asked Johnson to read from Mauldin 's psychological records .
One of the records shows that his wife and mother tried to have him involuntarily committed less than a month before he took his family to Galveston .
Assistant District Attorney Xochitl Vandiver said the report indicated his wife and mother wanted Mauldin committed because he had taken up with another woman .
Johnson read from several reports in which Mauldin complains about voices that speak to him all day long and threaten to kill him if he fails to carry out their wishes .
One evaluation says that he can control the voices but will eventually lose control .
The reports , done by different doctors and clinics over several years , are sometimes contradictory in their evaluations .
Another report says he lied about hearing voices as an excuse to quit a football team .
Mauldin 's attorney , Sam Cammack III , has tried to cast doubt on whether Anna was burned in the microwave .
A state Department of Public Safety lab technician testified that Anna 's DNA was found in 10 places in the microwave oven .
Her DNA was not found in the safe or refrigerator .
The prosecution completed its case against Mauldin after the DNA testimony .
The defense began its case .
Anna received second - and third - degree burns to the left side of her face , left shoulder and left hand and forearm .
She underwent several skin grafts and is living with relatives in Brazos County .
Mauldin has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to injury of a child , which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment .
If found not guilty by reason of insanity , state District Judge Susan Criss could order him confined to a mental institution for life .

Well , OK , he did n’t say that explicitly .
But he did say it implicitly .
A basic logic lesson and please forgive me if you think I ’m talking down to you .
I ’m really not .
It ’s just that I ’m shocked at how many people , including McCain , do n’t seem to get logic .
If I say , “ All crows are black ” and I also say , “ That bird is a crow , ” then I ’m saying that that bird is black even if I do n’t say so explicitly .
On ABC ’s “ This Week with George Stephanopoulos ” on Sunday , April 20 , John McCain called William Ayers “ an unrepentant terrorist . ”
What was McCain ’s evidence ?
McCain said that Ayers “ was engaged in bombings which could have or did kill innocent peopleâ€ ¦ ”
So McCain is saying that someone who engages in bombings which could have killed or did kill innocent people is a terrorist .
Now consider what McCain did .
McCain flew a bomber , an A - 4E Skyhawk , over North Vietnam .
I do n’t know whether he actually dropped his bombs before being shot down .
But certainly he was engaged in actions that , if he had succeeded , could have killed innocent people .
Which makes McCain , in his own words , a terrorist .
Now McCain could argue that that ’s different because , as he said elsewhere in the interview , “ I had a reconciliation with the Vietnamese , when we normalized relations . ”
Did he apologize to them ?
He did n’t say .
If he did , that would make him a “ repentant terrorist . ”
Too bad Stephanopoulos did n’t challenge him .
最近ようやく初級プログラマーを卒業できた手応えのようなものを感じており、いよいよコードを読み書きするのが楽しくてしょうがない段階になってまいりました。
こういうとき、Rubyは初心者にもやさしいけど、上達すればどこまでも上のステージが用意されているような、まるで自然言語のようななめらかさ・しなやかさがあって、ほれぼれとします。デザインの美しいものに触れているときには人間はこんなにも幸せになれるのか、という感じですね。ときに、今回のブログネタは、デザインの悪いものに出会うとこんなにも気分が悪くなるのか、という話なのですが。
なお、新プロジェクトではデザイナーのクリスの勧めでHamlを使うことにしたり、アーキテクトのダニーの設計でJavascriptにPublish-Subscribe型の（つまり一対多の）コールバックのフレームワークを作ってみたり、ReallySimpleHistoryを使い、Ajaxでも「戻る」ボタンを使えるようにしたり、色々と新しいことに取り組んでいます。まだちょっと時間がかかってますが、春には面白いものを出せると思いますのでお楽しみに。
さて、そんなわけで毎日ひたすらコード書いてるとブログ書くネタがなくなるわけですが、先ほどたまたまこんな記事を見かけました。
ITmedia : 変形文 字「 CAPTCHA 」はもう無意味？
最近、機会あるごと にCAPTCHAはダメだということを強調し続けているのですが、この際きちんとブログに意見表明しておこうかと。
CAPTCHAの抱える問題とは、ようするに「強度を上げれば（読みにくくすれば）人間にも読みにくい」という単純かつ原理的な矛盾です。
本来、CAPTCHAはボットによる自動アカウント取得などを阻止する手段として、「ユーザにほんの少しだけ協力してもらう」というスタンスから出発しました。逆にいえば、これは100%サービス提供側の都合であって、ユーザにとってはどうでもいいことなのです。
ところが、自分の都合であるということを忘れたサービス提供者は調子に乗ってどんどん強度を上げ、偽陽性にイライラするユーザへの配慮を忘れ、まるでこれは「ユーザの当然の義務」であるかのようにふるまいはじめます。
これは、サービスを 「おもてなし」と捉える立場からは考えられない態度です。
最近ではとうとうGoogle検索でさえCAPTCHAを見るようになってきました。特定の状況下でこれがしょっちゅう出てイライラします。
まぁ、逆に考えれば、グーグルですらこの程度の対策しかできないのか、というのはかえって自信にもなりますが。
以下は 「では、他にどういう方法があるの？」という話。
結論から言うと、低い実装コストで、ほとんどのボットを排除でき、かつ正規ユーザの手を一切わずらわせない方法というのは、割とあると思います。
いくつかポイントがあります。
Javascriptを使う サーバだけが知る秘密情報を使う Javascriptを難読化 クライアント側の処理をサーバよりも高コストにする
上記は、コストパフォーマンスの高いものから順に挙げています。
まず、一番簡単で効果の高 い「 Javascriptを使う」について。
ターゲットとなるフォームに、以下のようなhiddenフィールドを追加して、
< input id =" token " type =" hidden " />
このフィールド にJavascriptを使って動的に値をセットします。
< script type =" text / javascript " > document.getElementById(' token ') .value = " Some secret " </ script >
そしてサーバ側ではこれがちゃんと送られているか判定。
これだけで、８割方の粗雑なボットは排除できます。CAPTCHAよりも何よりも、まずはこれをやってみましょう。
しかし、このままではルールが静的なので、その気になれば一瞬で対応できてしまいます。
そこで、次に 「サーバだけが知る秘密情報」を使って動的にします。ごく簡単な例として、ここでは時刻を用います。
< script type =" text / javascript " > document.getElementById(' token ') .value = ' Thu Feb 28 00:06:14 - 0800 2008 ' </ script >
この ' Thu Feb 28 00:06:14 - 0800 2008 ' というのは Ruby の Time.now の文字列表現そのままです。これを受け取るサーバ側では（以下Railsの例）
def verify_token t = Time.parse ( params [ : token ] ) rescue Time.gm(0 ) Time.now.between ?(t , t + 2.hours ) end
という感じのバリデータ（この場合、フォームが表示されてから2時間以内のsubmitしか有効でないとしています）を用意しておけば、夜間バッチ型のボットを防げるようになります。
さらに値 をSHA-1などでハッシュしてしまえば、ハッシュする前のデータが推測できず、リプレイ攻撃以外に手段がなくなります。
そうしたら次の段階は自明ですね。リプレイ攻撃を防ぐには、同じ値を二度使えないようにすればいいのです。
ただ、ワンタイムなnonceの管理は理屈は単純ですが実装コストが高いので、ここでは後回しにします。
次に検討したいの はJavascriptの難読化です。たとえば、私のこのブログのプロフィールページにメールアドレスが書いてありますが、実はあれはHTML上にテキストとしては書いておらず、Javascriptで組み立てて生成しており、ボットからは発掘しにくくなっています。
ソースはこんな感じ 。
< span id =" placeholder " ></ span > < script type =" text / javascript " > var a = document.createElement ( " a " ) ; var b = " golb_nnek " .match(/./g).reverse( ). join ( " " ) + String.fromCharCode(0x40 ) + " japan.cnet " + String.fromCharCode( 46 ) +" com " ; a.href = " :otliam " .match(/./g).reverse( ). join ( " " ) +b ; a.appendChild(document.createTextNode( b ) ) ; document.getElementById(" placeholder " ) .appendChild(a ) ; </ script >
読めば何やってるか理解できると思いますが、このスクリプトを実行した結果、生成され、離れたspanタグにDOMで挿入された内容がメールアドレスであるとボットが判定するのは結構大変です。この例はかなり平易ですが、evalを使ったり、工夫次第でいろいろと（ボットやボット作者への）意地悪ができるはずです。
よくあるメールアドレスを画像で表示するのと違って、ブラウザで表示すれば普通にクリックもできるしコピー＆ペーストもできますから、訪問者にやさしい。
これと同じアイデア をCAPTCHA的な用途にも応用できるでしょう。
しかし、究極的にはボットはブラウザの全ての機能を完全に再現する、というか、ブラウザのエンジンをそのまま使うようになるでしょう。こうなると、どんなJavascriptも解読されてしまうし、ブラウザを操作してる人間とまったく見分けがつきません。
しかし 、CAPTCHAのようなユーザの手をわずらわせるアプローチに走る前に、まだやれることがあるはずです。
それが最後の 「クライアント側の処理を高コストにする」です。
基本的な考え方はHashcash やTarpitと似ていますが、スパマーも一定の経済原則に沿って行動しているという事実を逆手にとる考え方です。
つまり 、Hashcashのように、一件処理するのに必要なクライアントサイドでのCPUの利用率を意図的に高めることでスパマーにとっての実行コストを上げたり、Tarpitのように、サーバサイドで意図的なI/O遅延を発生させてスループットを悪化させたりするということです。（後者はCometと同じく非同期で動作するイベント・ドリブンなウェブサーバが必要になるので簡単ではありませんが）
これにはもちろん、 「ユーザレベルでは遅いとは体感することができない」という制約条件が必要ですが、トータルでのコストを高めるのが目的なので、ユーザ一人あたりに乗せるコスト単価はそれほど大きくなくてもいいのです。
そもそも実行時リソースの要求が高いフルブラウザベースのボットを作り込むようなハイエンドなスパマーはコスト感覚にシビアなはずなので、かなり効果があるのではないかと思われます。
たとえば、上記コードの難読化にprototype.jsなどのライブラリのコードを積極的に使うのも一例です。外部jsファイルのインクルードはボットにとってもコストが高い処理なので、より高い排除効果が期待できます。
この 「クライアント側の処理を高コストにする」を達成する具体的な方法は他にも色々考えられると思いますので、どなたかいいアイデアを思いついたらぜひ教えてください。
さて、あれこれ書いてきましたが、一貫しているのは「ユーザ（人間）に負荷を与えるデザインは絶対にダメ」ということです。そこに手をつける前に、やれることはたくさんあるでしょう？ということが言いたかったのです。
うーんやっぱり長くなってしまった。

Campaigners in the US are attempting to delay the start - up of the world ’s most powerful particle smasher with a lawsuit claiming it could spawn dangerous particles or mini black holes that will destroy the entire Earth .
The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is nearing completion at CERN , the European centre for particle physics near Geneva , Switzerland .
Scientists hope it will begin operations in mid-July .
On 21 March , Luis Sancho , from Spain , and Hawaii resident Walter Wagner filed a lawsuit in Hawaii ’s US District Court against CERN and US contributors to the project demanding that they do not operate the LHC until they prove it is safe .
The US contributors named are the Department of Energy ( DoE ) , the National Science Foundation and Fermilab , an accelerator laboratory near Chicago .
The DoE and Fermilab will not comment on the case , insisting it is a legal matter to be dealt with by the Department of Justice .

The lawsuit ’s claims are “ complete nonsense ” , James Gillies , a spokesman for CERN , told New Scientist .
“ The LHC will start up this year , and it will produce all sorts of exciting new physics and knowledge about the universe , ” he said , adding : “ A year from now , the world will still be here . ”
Killer strangelets
The collider will simulate conditions less than a billionth of a second after the big bang , by smashing protons together at enormous energies .
Physicists hope to resolve long - standing questions , such as why particles have mass and whether space has hidden extra dimensions .
But Wagner and Sancho ’s court papers raise theoretical scenarios in which the LHC could create particles that gobble up the Earth , such as “ killer strangelets “ .
Strangelets are hypothetical blobs of matter containing “ strange ” quarks , as well as the usual “ up ” and “ down ” types that make up ordinary matter .
If a strangelet were stable and negatively charged , it might begin eating the nuclei of ordinary matter , converting them into strange matter .
Eventually the menacing chain reaction could assimilate our entire planet and everyone on it .
A 2003 safety review for the LHC found “ no basis for any conceivable threat ” .
It acknowledged that there ’s a small chance the accelerator could create short - lived , mini black holes or exotic “ magnetic monopoles ” that destroy protons in ordinary atoms .
But it concluded that neither scenario could lead to disaster .
That report and lay summaries of its findings are available on CERN ’s website .
An updated version of the safety assessment will soon be released , and physicists plan to discuss safety during a CERN open house on 6 April .
‘ Dangerous matter ’
Wagner raised similar concerns to those in the new court papers during development of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) at Brookhaven National Laboratory , New York State .
“ RHIC started running in 2000 and we ’re still here , ” says Gillies .
Besides , he adds , much higher energy collisions that those at the LHC frequently occur in nature , because cosmic ray particles zip around our galaxy at close to the speed of light .
The moon has undergone such collisions for 5 billion years without being devoured by a ravenous black hole or killer strangelet , he adds .
However , Wagner and Sancho describe CERN ’s safety reviews as “ perfunctory ” and say the cosmic ray argument may be misleading .
“ There is no question that should [ the ] defendants inadvertently create a dangerous form of matter such as a micro black hole or a strangelet , or otherwise create unsafe conditions of physics , then the environmental impact would be both local and national in scope , and quite deadly to everyone , ” their lawsuit claims .
A website appeals for funds to support their case .
Unconfirmed reports say that a magistrate judge has been assigned to the case for an initial conference on 16 June , and that Wagner intends to serve court papers to the federal government .
“ What we want to do is get this machine up and running , ” Gillies says .
“ We ’ll show people that the world is not going to disappear . ”

It 's the rare franchise that makes it to four films at all , so maybe just making it there is a badge of honor .
Or , maybe not .
The problem is each film in a superhero franchise has to keep topping the one before it , and by the time you reach film number four , it 's very hard to keep from straying into the ridiculous .
Therefore , by using Hollywood logic , if the previous film jumps the shark , the only way to repair the damage is by jumping the shark again , backwards , and continuing the series from a previous point , ignoring the movies that came in the middle .
For instance , Superman IV had the distinction of proving all the critics wrong who claimed that no superhero movie could be worse than Superman III .

It was bad enough that the studio shut down the Superman cash cow for almost two decades .
So Superman Returns required a reboot for casting if nothing else , since Christopher Reeve suffered his horrible accident and eventually died , and Margot Kidder ( Lois Lane ) was certifiably insane , probably from the horrors of working on Superman IV .
Also , actresses her age are generally not allowed to continue acting , so they replaced her with an actress young enough that , according to the film 's timeline , she would have been a teenager when the original film took place .
Thus not a single actor from the original four movies appeared in the fifth , other than Marlon Brando , who was brought back from the dead specially for this film .
The storyline presumably picks up sometime during the events from Superman II , specifically after Superman bonks Lois Lane ( the rules and physics for alien - superhero intercourse will have to be covered in another article ) .

Of course Superman IV did n't hold the title of worst superhero movie ever made for very long , as the fourth Batman film ( Batman and Robin ) came along to take the title , with the film makers trying to cram in so many villains , costumes and sets , the whole thing became a nightmarish mess .
Thus when it came time for the fifth film reboot , the decision was made to pretend the entire first four movies never , ever happened .
We guess what we 're saying is if they make Blade IV next year , run far , far away from the theater .
Then come back a few years later for the reboot .
Also ...
The fifth film reboot does n't only apply to superhero movies , though maybe it should .
The Rocky franchise got more and more inflated over the course of four films , culminating with Rocky , a legally retarded boxer , ending the Cold War .
Stallone tried to do a " back to its gritty roots " reboot ( twice ) but the results were less than Batman Begins .
And in case you thought there was no coming back from the fourth Karate Kid starring Hillary Swank , get ready for a Karate Kid reboot directed by Will Smith and starring his son Jaden .
Seriously .
If the pattern holds , we should be due for gritty reboots of the Die Hard and Alien franchises any time now .
Do n't let us down , guys .
Composite image by POLITICO Richardson has harsh advice for HRC
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , fresh off his endorsement of Barack Obama this week , suggested Sunday that Hillary Rodham Clinton should consider dropping out of the race if she trails in the delegate count and popular vote at the end of the primary process .
Appearing on “ Fox News Sunday , ” Richardson also decried the negativity in the Democratic primary , adding that John McCain is coalescing his support as the Republican presidential nominee while Obama and Clinton continue to attack each other .

Richardson , who served under President Bill Clinton as energy secretary and as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , also took what appeared to be a shot at his political patron .
When asked about Clinton confidante James Carville ’s comment that his endorsement was an “ act of betrayal , ” Richardson offered his own tough talk .
“ I ’m not going to get in the gutter like that , and that ’s symbolic of many of the people around Sen. Clinton .
They think they ’re entitled to the presidency , ” said Richardson .
“ It should n’t just be Bush - Clinton , Bush - Clinton , you know , what about the rest of us ... It ’s important we bring in a new generation of leadership . ”
Richardson ’s sharp criticism of the Clintons is especially striking because he often defended Hillary Clinton while he was still in the race — even in the face of sharp attacks from the other presidential contenders .
Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell , a leading Clinton surrogate , responded with his own questions about Obama ’s electability against McCain in the general election .
Rendell cited statewide polling from automated pollsters Rasmussen and SurveyUSA that shows Obama trailing McCain in New Jersey , Ohio , Florida and Missouri — and only running even in Massachusetts .
“ Our job is to nominate the candidate with the best chance to win , ” said Rendell .
“ Bill , does it bother you that Sen. Obama is behind in New Jersey and even in Massachusetts ? ” Rendell asked Richardson .
Hooverville
Herbert Hoover is making a comeback in today ’s political discourse .
On ABC ’s “ This Week , ” Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) invoked the nation ’s 31st president on several occasions , accusing the Bush administration of having a “ Herbert Hoover mentality ” in its lack of involvement in dealing with a stagnating economy .
“ Had the administration acted more pro-actively earlier , particularly about the housing crisis , we would n’t have gotten up to this point , ” said Schumer .
“ We ’ve learned over 100 years of economic history that smart , measured government involvement to try and deal with problems in the economy … makes a great deal of sense . ”
Sen , Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) , in response , blamed the Democratic - led Congress for offering too generous incentives to first - time homeowners , which he argued precipitated the current housing crisis .
“ It was Democrats in Congress who were pushing the lending institutions to get out there and lend more money , even to unqualified buyers … so that everyone could own a home , ” Kyl said .
“ And as a result , a lot of people took loans who could n't qualify . ”
Not to be outdone by Schumer , Kyl compared the Democratic leadership ’s opposition to certain free trade agreements to the prevailing protectionist mentality in the 1930s — even invoking the tax cuts of former President Calvin Coolidge .
“ It 's Senator Schumer and his Democratic colleagues who want to raise taxes , like Hoover did when he refused to allow the Coolidge tax breaks to stay in effect , ” said Kyl .
“ And they of course are opposing the free trade agreements that the president is trying to bring up . ”
Iraq War
Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb. ) , who briefly mulled an independent campaign for president , declined to endorse McCain for the presidential race at this point in time .
“ I 've obviously got some differences with John on the Iraq war .
That 's no secret , ” Hagel said on “ This Week . ”
“ Certainly does n't put me in Obama or Clinton 's camp .
But John and I have some pretty fundamental disagreements on the future of foreign policy . ”
Hagel continued his sharp criticism of the administration ’s handling of the Iraq war , despite the surge ’s reduction of violence , hewing closer to the views on Iraq held by Obama and Clinton .
“ What the surge was all about … was trying to buy time for the Iraqis .
They have not used that time very well , ” said Hagel .
“ I think we need a clear plan , and yes , withdrawal .
We 're going to have to start working our way out of this . ”
But on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation , ” Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) — just back from a trip to the Middle East with McCain — argued that the United States has turned the corner in Iraq .
He said that a premature withdrawal would be “ a complete disaster . ”
“ There have been major political breakthroughs .
Economically , oil revenues are up by 30 percent , inflation has gone from 66 to 5 [ percent ] , sectarian violence is down by 90 percent , our casualties are way down , ” said Graham .
“ We ’ve got a long way to go , but I believe the surge has worked on all fronts . ”
Sen. Jack Reed ( D - R.I. ) , echoing Hagel , said that the Iraqis have not “ gotten their political act together " and argued that a phased withdrawal would pressure the them to more quickly reach political reconciliation .
“ The longer [ the Iraqi government ] feels that we will take the lead , the longer they feel we will be there indefinitely … that sends the message you do n’t have to do anything that ’s tough . ”
Sewing up the Republican presidential nomination while the Democratic candidates continue to battle each other has given Senator John McCain a valuable commodity : time he can use to unite a fractured Republican Party , ramp up his lackluster fund - raising and transform his shoestring primary operation into a general election machine .
The lull will give the McCain campaign some breathing room , but it could have drawbacks as well .
Even Mr. McCain acknowledges that the tight , fierce Democratic race is likely to garner most of the news media ’s attention in the near term , eclipsing coverage of his campaign .
Mr. McCain said last week that he viewed the next couple of months as an opportunity to “ get our own house in order , ” and that he planned to use the time to travel overseas , roll out new policy proposals and deliver speeches .
His first order of business , though , will be an intense focus on raising money , with some 20 or 30 events a month .
His campaign was nearly doomed last summer by overspending and its failure to raise enough money to keep up , and it has continued to lag behind what Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois have received in contributions .
Through Jan. 31 , Mr. McCain brought in $ 55 million , compared with Mrs. Clinton ’s $ 138 million and Mr. Obama ’s $ 141 million .
And the Democratic candidates continue to raise money at a record pace .
Only later did a cruel system come into focus .
I see white men , gin and tonics on their breath , red meat on their plates , beneath the jacarandas of Johannesburg , sneering at the impossibility of desiring a black woman .

A racial divide , once lived , dwells in the deepest parts of the psyche .
This is what was captured by Barack Obama ’s pitch - perfect speech on race .
Slavery was indeed America ’s “ original sin . ”
Of course , “ the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow ” lives on in forms of African - American humiliation and anger that smolder in ways incommunicable to whites .
Segregation placed American blacks in the U.S. equivalent of that filthy African harbor .
It takes bravery , and perhaps an unusual black - white vantage point , to navigate these places where hurt is profound , incomprehension the rule , just as it takes courage to say , as Obama did , that black “ anger is real ; it is powerful ; and to simply wish it away , to condemn it without understanding its roots , only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races . ”
Progress , since the Civil Rights Movement , or since apartheid , has assuaged the wounds of race but not closed them .
To carry my part of shame is also to carry a clue to the vortexes of rancor for which Obama has uncovered words .
I understand the rage of his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , however abhorrent its expression at times .
I admire Obama for saying : “ I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community . ”
Honesty feels heady right now .
For seven years , we have lived with the arid , us - against - them formulas of Bush ’s menial mind , with the result that the nuanced exploration of America ’s hardest subject is almost giddying .
Can it be that a human being , like Wright , or like Obama ’s grandmother , is actually inhabited by ambiguities ?
Can an inquiring mind actually explore the half - shades of truth ?
Yes .
It. Can .
The unimaginable South African transition that Nelson Mandela made possible is a reminder that leadership matters .
Words matter .
The clamoring now in the United States for a presidency that uplifts rather than demeans is a reflection of the intellectual desert of the Bush years .
Office Rumors Blog – “ Better reading this than the insides of your eyelids ! ”
align = ” left ” DanceWater — Jonas Phillips was arrested on August 15 , 2007 for holding a sign on a sidewalk in Asheville , NC .
The sign said “ Impeach Bush & Cheney ” .
His story is here .
Finally today , his case came to trail at the Buncombe County Courthouse .
The District Attorney had offered to dismiss the charges for the court costs ( $ 120 ) last year , but Jonas Phillips declined .
It has been continued at least once since then .
I was unable to attend his prior court dates , but today I took a vacation day so I could be an eyewitness to this MOCKERY OF DEMOCRACY .
The lawyer for Jonas started by asking for the charges to be dismissed .
This was denied , after a long time that the judge spent reading some papers .
District Attorney Pressley said that Jonas was obstructing the sidewalk and obstructing the view on I - 240 , and she also claimed that about 10 to 15 other people had been charged with this offense over the years .
Jonas ’s attorney said that Jonas was being prosecuted for political speech .
The DA and the police officers who were involved in the case seemed to get off topic quite often .
Jonas was charged with obstructing the sidewalk , and they talked about how he was distracting drivers and running across the road .
They also claimed that Jonas was doing all this for attention , and that he was “ shaking ”  his sign over the freeway , which I thought was a fabrication , since Jonas would want people to read his sign and shaking it would make it hard to read .
Both officers admitted that they had to do some research to figure out what to charge Jonas with .
Jonas stated that he wanted “ eyes ”  to see his point of view and to counter the mainstream media .
He testified that one pedestrian did pass him while he was doing the freeway blogging , and while one officer was sitting in his patrol car at the time ( with his blue lights on and the roadway blocked ) , he did not see the pedestrian .
There was never any evidence that people could not pass on the five foot wide sidewalk while Jonas was out there .
Jonas ’ attorney kept making motions to dismiss , and they were denied .
We were thinking that we would be going on to an appeal process , up until the minute Judge Hill started talking .
The judge said that he was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Jonas had blocked the sidewalk or obstructed traffic , and Jonas was found NOT GUILTY .
There were about 30 local activists in the courtroom , and we cheered .
Jonas spent $ 750 on lawyer fees over the last seven months that this trial dragged on .
I know there are people on Daily Kos and other bloggers who helped Jonas out “ “ let me say THANK YOU from the Asheville activist community for all your support .
Next time I see the local DA , I am going to ask them why they are arresting people who are holding signs and why they think that is a good use of my tax dollars .
This will be cross posted on Daily Kos blog and Blue NC blog .

The Internet group ' Anonymous ' held protests outside Scientology centers in cities around the world on Sunday .
Video report from Boston
from Boston
The Internet group Project Chanology today held protests critical of the Church of Scientology .
The protests marked what would have been the 49th birthday of Lisa McPherson , who is claimed to be a victim of the Church of Scientology 's practices .
Lisa died in 1995 during a running of what Scientologists refer to as an Introspection Rundown , a procedure intended to help Church members deal with a psychotic or deeply traumatic event .
Protests were planned throughout the day in 14 countries and over 50 different cities .
The estimation of total protesters world wide for Feb. 10 , 2008 is 9,250 people .
Wikinews had correspondents at a number of protest locations to report on the events .
This article was updated throughout the day with reports from around the globe .

About 150 anonymous protesters turned out in Adelaide to protest the Church of Scientology .
Most wore masks , many also wearing suits or wigs .
A on - the - spot - word was created centered around a Scientologist present at the start of the protests .
' Infiltrator ' , AdelRAID also had an Anon attacked by a Scientologist trying to remove an Anon 's mask to take a photo of his face , who had his picture taken before and after the attack by many anons .

Video report from Boston
Protesters in Boston covered all four corners of the block surrounding the Church with 30 - 45 people on each side of the streets and corners .
Most protesters ranged from 18 to 25 years old .
Crowds soon swelled to numbers of about 250 .
The weather was of typical New England weather , where it quickly jumped from sunny weather at the start to slight drizzling rain then to a downpour and eventually a flurry that lasted about 15 – 20 minutes before dissipating .
However , even that did not drive the protesters away .
The protesters ' meet up spot was Trinity Church in Boston 's famed Copley Square right under the gaze of the John Hancock Building .
After congregating protesters proceeded down to the local Scientology church and began their picket .
An ex-Scientology member know as Larry Brennan showed up and said he applauded what " Anonymous " was doing .
Meanwhile , a camera watched the protest from the top floor of the Scientology church looking at the protesters gathered below .
Throughout the protest , each corner took turns shouting this chant " Religion !
Should !
Be! Free ! "
At the same time , cars honked in support for the protesters , including firemen of the Boston Fire Department and the Boston Public Works Department road sanding crew , along with various taxis .
Drivers were often encouraged to honk by the protesters .
Protesters gave pamphlets and leaflets to cars , pedestrians , and police officers .
According to the free daily BostonNOW , Rev. Gerard Renna of the Boston church referred to Anonymous as " a group of cyber - terrorists ... perpetrating religious hate crimes . "
It is estimated that 200 - 250 people attended in total .

The Brussels protest organisers decided to take things one step further than the " mask " dress code - and introduce a formal dress code of " Black , and Red Tie " .
Saturday saw the start of press coverage for the event with Dutch - language national paper De Morgen devoting four columns in their reporter section to the protest and events that led up to it .
Lisa McPherson , Tom Cruise , and John Sweeney were all covered along with images of the " Anonymous " advertising poster and the European Church of Scientology HQ in the Brussels city centre .
The protesters met up at Parc Royal metro station about 1 km away from the European H.Q. of the Church of Scientology and spent approximately an hour putting finishing touches to placards and cutting up leaflets , all under the watchful eye of a number of suspected Scientology " spies " equipped with cameras and cellphones .
Following closely the advice from police the group of approximately 30 marched to 91 Wetstraat where the Church H.Q. is in a subdued manner with banners and placards turned down .
As the group marched to their point where a static protest was permitted three film crews from Belgian TV ran round filming the group and walking backwards to interview those who were prepared to speak to the press .
Protesters came from as far afield as Luxembourg .
The police presence for the protest was fairly light , upon arrival at the protest site , 91 Wetstraat ( Rue De La Loi ) one van and three officers were parked outside the Scientology HQ , approximately 15 minutes later two other police cars had turned up - delivering the Brussels Central chief of police and another four officers to monitor the protest .
Instructions were given to protesters that they could not , under Belgian law , conceal their faces with masks , scarves or veils .
The signs in use by the protesters included a large " HONK ! " which whenever a passing motorist hit the horn roused a large cheer from the crowd .
Others read " Scientology kills " , " Religion is free , Scientology is not " , " XENU.NET " , " All your Thetans are belong to us " , " Hello Scientology , We are Anonymous " , and " Alien souls inhabit you " .
Some were crudely done handwriting , others had been made at the pre-protest meeting with stencils and spray paint .
A chant was started early on , and repeated a few times throughout the day , " Brainwash ! Brainwash !
Brainwash ! " , this could likely be heard by people within the Church H.Q. as a number of upper floor windows were open .
Leaflets were handed out to passers by and motorists as they stopped at the nearest set of traffic lights .
While highlighting that Christianity , Judaism , and Islam will freely give you details about their religion Scientology was starkly contrasted as " Ask a Scientologist about their texts , You will be answered .
After your check clears " .
The protest went off with no problems , although concern was expressed by some participants that they were not better allowed to conceal their identities .
This was made extra concerning with the belief that some of those taking photos from a distance were members of the Church cataloguing the protesters .

As many as 50 people turned up to protest the Church in cold weather and wind driven snow .
With temperatures ranging from 10 to just 15 degrees Fahrenheit and winds at nearly 45 miles an hour , protesters held signs and braved Mother Nature .
Some lost their signs in the wind a few times , but managed to swipe them back up before they got lost in the weather .
Among the protesters attending was Chuck Beatty , a former Scientologist of 27 years from the Sea Org in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
Several passing cars showed their support by honking , including a big red semi - truck tow truck .
The police were on scene to make sure protesters followed laws , but they were off duty officers hired by the Church because they " needed protection from Anonymous , " said O. Casillas of the Buffalo police Department .
Casillas also stated that protesters , " according to New York state law " , had to be at least 100 feet from the Church , but because of a fence , protesters were allowed to picket across the street from the Church .
Casillas also took a flier with the rules and regulations for protesters stating , " I can not take sides here , but the Church privately hired us . "
At least three members of the Church were seen photographing , videotaping , and counting anyone who was gathered outside the Church .
The protesters were not approached by any members of the Church .
Wikinews attempted to get a statement from the church , but Casillas stated that " the Church knew what organization [ I ] was from " and that " Wikinews was not welcome there [ at the Church ] . "
Wikinews recently published several stories and interviews that do not favor the Church and the officer 's quotes suggest the Church is aware of those articles .

The Chicago protest against the Church began slightly before 11:00 a.m. ( central time ) and concluded at roughly 4:30 p.m..
Upwards of 70 protesters gathered in support of the protest .
Though temperatures remained in the sub - zero range throughout the day ( 0 degrees Fahrenheit , - 22 wind chill ) , spirits remained high .
Participants handed out literature and held signs at the intersection of Lincoln , Wellington and Southport until roughly 2:00 p.m..
During that time , a nearby Catholic church dismissed , and numerous Church - goers welcomed the fliers .
Protesters garnered a multitude of honks from supportive motorists .
After 2:00 p.m. , the large group splintered into multiple travelling squads which navigated the Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighbourhoods until 4:30 p.m..
Protesters had to follow legal restrictions and the Church conducted the Centre 's counter - protest measures , such as blocking their windows and holding service from 11:00 a.m. straight through 6:00 p.m..

Approximately 200 people protested Scientology along Cleveland Street in Clearwater .
They were photographed by 20 - year - old Scientologist David Pendery , who seemed to believe that it was " unlawful to wear a mask and I wanted to document it . "
The Church also hired ten police officers to monitor the protest .
The protest was delayed by 30 minutes so the protesters would not interrupt a Presbyterian Church service . [ 4 ]
More than 100 people picketed on a street corner in front of the Dallas Church of Scientology .
Protestors held up signs with pictures of Lisa McPherson , who was a Dallas native .
" We want people to know we are raising awareness , and that is one of our main tools to fight Scientology , " said one masked protestor .
A few signs read " Honk if you hate Scientology " , and some cars could be heard honking their horns as they passed by .
Police were on the scene to ensure that the demonstration was peaceful .
The Dallas Church of Scientology released a statement regarding the group Anonymous , which read , " Using Scientology 's prominence , Anonymous hopes to garner more attention ...
Religious bigotry of any nature is deplorable and profoundly affects the entire community . "
Video from the event
Around 50 to 140 people turned up at the Church of Scientology centre in Edinburgh to protest .
As protesters were not allowed directly opposite the centre a small police presence was visible in order to control the crowd .
Banners with " Scientology Kills " were placed at the front of the protesters and chants gradually began to start as the day progressed .
Leaflets were handed out to members of the public passing by while people within the Church of Scientology were seen to be taking photographs from inside the church .
Access to the church was restricted during the protest , but several protesters made comment to a reporter from the Scotsman newspaper .
The Houston protest hosted an estimated 81 people .
Between 8 and 12 Houston police officers and staff were on site though , but stood and watched the protesters .
There were no reports of significant confrontation , though scientologists and protesters took photographs of each other .
A CW 39 cameraman was on site taking footage and conducting interviews .
Broadcast television reports of the protest were carried on KHOU CBS 11 and KHCW CW 39 later in the evening .

The first London protest took place outside the Church of Scientology HQ in Queen Victoria Street .
Upon arrival at 10:30 , approximately 50 people were in attendance .
This was complemented by a small team of police officers .
Members of the Church of Scientology were handing out flyers outside the HQ , with the protesters on the other side of the road .
Numerous members of the media , as well as tens of amateur photographers and videographers were in attendance .
By 11:00 , the number of protesters had grown to between 300 and 500 .
A variety of signs were on display , bearing such slogans as " Ron is Gone but the Con goes On " ( referring to L. Ron Hubbard , founder of Scientology ) and " $ cientology Kills " ( referring to the claims that the Church of Scientology extorts money from its members ) .
The police responded to this growth in numbers with riot vans , a large number of Community Support officers , and Police Horses , as well as a dog unit .
The protest at Queen Victoria Street was peaceful .
Members of Anonymous were respectful of Police orders .
Inside the building , security officers could be seen .
Members were seen videoing and photographing the protests from the upper windows of the HQ building , prompting responses from the crowd .
Signs were held saying " Honk if you hate Scientology " - causing a cheer from the crowd every time a car used the horn .
The infamous bright yellow " /b/ " van was seen driving past early in the protest .
At around 1:00 the protesters moved on towards Tottenham Court Road 's " Dianetics and Scientology Life Improvement Centre " , where the police presence was even higher , and crowd barriers were set up .
Half of Tottenham Court Road was closed for the demonstration , so a single - file line of traffic was all that flowed between the protesters ( of which a significant majority of the original number turned up ) and the Church of Scientology building .
Members of the Church of Scientology were handing out flyers , much like at Queen Victoria Street .
However , the crowd this time shouted for passers - by to " tear it up " - some of whom did .
Police reacted to those tearing up the material and throwing it down with the issue of a littering ticket .
This road was much busier than the previous one , and a large crowd gathered to look .
The crowd could be heard shouting " It 's a trap ! " when members of the public were offered free Stress Tests by the members of the Church of Scientology .
There were a number of minor incidents involving protesters ( who were quickly distanced by the majority crowd ) , but no major violations took place .
Estimates by Anonymous for the total numbers at the event range from 300 to 800 people , however the BBC and City of London Police report 200 people at the event .

At least 250 people attended the anti-Scientology protest in Los Angeles , California .
The protesters gathered in the morning at a central location and proceeded by subway to the site of the first protest , the Church of Scientology - Los Angeles .
For nearly two hours the protesters chanted " We are Anonymous " and other slogans , and responded with yells and upheaval to honking cars that were passing by .
The protest spread over two city blocks , and at one point the entire group of protesters circled the city block containing various Scientology buildings .
The protest then proceeded via subway to the Church of Scientology International building in Hollywood .
There the protesters continued chanting , and marched up and down the street .
A group of protesters unfurled a banner in sympathy with the death of Lisa McPherson , and the crowd sang the happy birthday song for her .
The protest continued for an additional couple of hours as the crowd moved to a former Scientology recruiting building and then to the street level of a major mall and tourist attraction , Hollywood & Highland .
After losing quite a few members the protest moved on to the front of the CNN building in hope of getting on news .
Security was high at all Scientology installations , with security officers blocking all entrances to Church buildings , patrolling on foot and bicycle , and most taking pictures or videos of protesters ( or even the Wikinews reporter ) .
No police intervention was observed , though at least one or two officers were present at most times .

A protest in Manchester took place outside the Church of Scientology centre located on Deansgate , with around 100 people protesting at its peak .
The protest was peaceful , with the protesters mainly sticking to waving banners and handing out flyers to passers - by .
Protesters respected a request from the police that they should leave the area by 3 pm in order to avoid blocking the area for patrons leaving the multiple bars along Deansgate at the end of the Manchester Derby ( a football match between Manchester United and Manchester City ) .
There was a minimal police presence at the event and the Church of Scientology centre was closed by the end of the protest .

The Scientology protest in New Orleans took place at 11:00 am CST .
There were 19 members of Anonymous that showed up to protest .
Everything went smoothly .
One police officer stopped by just to make sure that the crowd was demonstrating peacefully .
Many pictures and video was taken by the assembled group as well as pictures being taken by the few Scientologists that showed up .
One large woman drove incredibly fast to park behind the Scientology building at one point ( the church was closed before some protesters arrived ) and nearly hit two protesters .
She was later spotted snapping countless pictures from the second floor .
Over the course of the protests , about 5 cars ended up parked behind the building .
One bald man came out to attempt to harass some protesters and was labeled a " Level 12 Paladin " .
He left soon after .
Eventually the two most interesting subjects of the Church of Scientology appeared , and were initially perceived as standard passerby's .
When offered fliers the couple spat " What have you done ? " and " What are your crimes ? " at the protesters .
One donned a Scientology vest and stood in front of the building , while his minion walked around taking pictures 5 inches from their faces .
There was some sparse foot traffic in the area and handouts were given to people passing by .
A woman stopped by to talk to some Anonymous and stated that she had a family member who was trying to leave the CoS and was glad for the protests .
A man in a truck parked and got some fliers , promising to return .
About an hour later he arrived , wearing sunglasses and armed with a homemade sign , and joined the group .
An employee of the local newspaper , The Times Picayune , stopped to speak with Anonymous for a little while .
He stated that he was in the area on another story but was interested in finding out information about the protest .
The Anonymous answered his questions , gave him handouts , but refused to share any personal contact information with him .
Near the end of the protest the two Scientologists decided to walk off .

Approximately 60 people showed up to protest in front of the Scientology church in Phoenix , many wearing purple latex gloves and dressed in black suits .
Three Phoenix Police Department officers were present to keep control .
CBS 5 , Fox 10 , NBC 12 , The Arizona Republic and The East Valley Tribune came to interview the protesters and The Church of Scientology held a press conference where the official press release was read and no comments were made about the Phoenix protest .
The protesters read high level Scientology teaching that had been made public to Scientologists during the press conference and later in the day , with little visible success .

Several dozen protesters arrived across the street from the Scientology bookstore in South Side to protest , carrying signs and handing out flyers .
Protesters included many students , mostly hailing from Pitt and CMU .
Cars honked in support , though pedestrian traffic was a bit more sparse .
Two or three police officers kept an eye on protesters from inside the bookstore , but everything went smoothly .
As the high for the day was twenty degrees and with wind chill making it feel as though the temperatures were in the sub zeros ; the anons cut their protest to only about four hours .

The protest in Portland seemed to have had a leader ( or leader - like figure ) or two , and was lawful and very well organized .
There was always yelling , sometimes intense , whenever someone entered the church .
Some who entered did so smiling defiantly , some were hesitant and looked noticeably distressed .
Loud cheering erupted every time a passing by car honked ( estimated 1 out of 5 ) , this included even a Trimet bus .

8 people showed up and picketed in front of City Hall on the 2/10/2008 .
The reason why City Hall and not the traditional Church of Scientology is because San Antonio does not have a Scientology chapter .
This being the reason many of the protesters of San Antonio went to Austin to support their cause .
The protesters handed out fliers and held up informational posters and a " honk if you hate Scientology " poster .
Many of the cars honked including but not limited to the Via bus system , SAPD , SAFD , and churchgoers .

San Diego drew about 80 protesters , starting an hour later than most of the other worldwide protests .
The group started at the Horton Plaza shopping mall , and then moved on to the Church of Scientology building .
After demonstrating there , the group moved back to the shopping mall , positioning itself on eight street corners , handing out information , flyers , and speaking with concerned bystanders .
Not one , but two protesters dressed up as Xenu .
When 10 News showed up to cover the event , they refused to do an interview unless they could speak with a protester face to face .
When none of the protesters agreed to this condition , a compromise was reached .
A protester gave an audio interview for the station to use when putting together information about the protest .
After several protesters left , the protest moved back to the Church .
Police presence was constant , but at the time of dispersal at the end of the protest several members reported being followed by Scientologists .

A worldwide day of protests against the Church of Scientology has begun in Sydney after an agglomeration of protesters at 11 am in Hyde Park .
A crowd of about 200 turned out to protest against the Church and its alleged violations of human rights .
The group Anonymous , who organized the rally , were handing out fliers to passers - by , and led various anti-Scientology chants by the crowd .
The principal allegations made at the rally towards Scientology were the lack of freedom within the Church , and the excessive cost of their courses , which they believe does n't warrant tax - exempt status .
The Protest lasted until 1 pm at the Church of Scientology Office in Town Hall and from there partially disbanded .
The remaining protesters proceeded to the Scientology office in Broadway and started a lesser secondary protest lasting about 25 minutes .
The Church of Scientology was approached by the author for a response to the claims after the rally , but the church refused to comment .

The Toronto protest kicked off at 11:30 a.m. ( EST ) .
At least 300 attended the protest for the afternoon .
Despite the wind chill of - 22 at 11:00 and declining temperatures throughout the day , the protest was still robust at 2:00 .
The crowd later tapered down to fewer than 10 by 6:00 p.m..
One protester possessed a cap gun , however other protesters in his vicinity quickly pointed him out to the police , who confiscated it without charge .
A Church member was seen throwing rock salt at some protesters for a short period of time , but later went back into the Church .
Generally , the protest was peaceful and picketers were well behaved overall .
Police allowed protesters to stand right outside the Scientology building .
There were many people attempting to record the event with cameras , video cameras , and / or microphones , and several picketers were interviewed .
The chants sometimes included " Xenu ! " , which left some passersby confused about whether the protest was for or against Scientology .
However , the public was generally receptive to the protesters ' message , particularly earlier in the day .
Many cars passing by , especially taxis , honked in support , as did a fire truck and an ambulance .
Most people offered flyers during the first couple of hours took them , though later on people seemed to grow tired of them .
It was an enthusiastic , successful protest .

Over 200 people showed up and passed out pamphlets , chanted slogans , and covered the entire block at one point .
Scientologists tried to counter - protest by unfurling a " Scientology For Peace " banner at one point , but protesters with signs blocked the banner from view .
After 30 minutes , the Church took down their banner .
People from all over the area came to support the protest .
Vancouver Police sent a single cruiser on scene to monitor the situation , but after an hour it left without incident .
Another moment that should be noted is how after the crowd of protesters swelled from 20 - 200 participants within an hour , A van pulled up in the rear of the building where no protester was then present .
Some people took notice and went down to investigate .
What they saw was a number of church members piling boxes of documents and entire filing cabinets into the van .
They then soon drove off with it .
There were pictures taken of the van .
It was as if they anticipated a break - in to their office where demonstrators could 've seize documentation .
Church members , some in plain clothes and some wearing Church uniforms , videotaped protesters , tried to mingle with the protesters to disrupt the protest from within , and followed protesters away from the protest when they left .
About 20 people protested in front of the Scientology Center in Capistrangasse in Vienna 's 6th district .
At 12:30 , half an hour after the demonstration started , individuals claiming to be acting on government authority ordered the protest to disperse .
Owing to an issue concerning documentation the protestors decided to abandon the protest and dispersed peacefully .
At least 30 people showed up to protest the Church in Winnipeg .
The temperature in Winnipeg on February 10 was - 50 C with the wind chill .
Project Chanology states that people held signs stating , " Scientology destroys families , Why is [ Lisa McPherson ] dead ? " and even " Honk if you think Scientology is a cult . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Fear that a hobbled banking sector may set off another Great Depression could force the U.S. government and Federal Reserve to take the unprecedented step of buying a broad range of assets , including stocks , according to one of the most bearish market analysts .

Fear that a hobbled banking sector may set off another Great Depression could force the U.S. government and Federal Reserve to take the unprecedented step of buying a broad range of assets , including stocks , according to one of the most bearish market analysts .

That extreme scenario , which would aim to stave off deflation and stabilize the economy , is evolving as the base case for Bernard Connolly , global strategist at Banque AIG in London .
In the late 1980s and early 1990 ’s Connolly worked for the European Commission analyzing the European monetary system in the run up to the introduction of the euro currency .
“ Avoiding a depression is , unfortunately , going to have to involve either a large , quasi - permanent increase in the budget deficit -- preferably tax cuts -- or restoring overvaluation of equity prices , ” Connolly said on Monday .
“ If conventional monetary policy is not enough to produce that result , the government may have to buy equities , financed by the Fed , ” Connolly said .
Legal changes would be needed to give the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government the authority to buy stocks .
Currently the Federal Reserve can buy only debt issued by the Treasury , as well as U.S. agency debentures and mortgage - backed securities .
While Connolly already sees some parallels with the 1930s , he expects that a more pro-active central bank and government will probably help avert a repeat of that scenario today .
The build up of a credit bubble in recent years was similar to the late 1920s run-up to the Great Depression , he said .
Then , investors were very optimistic about new technologies , and stocks rose against a backdrop of low inflation , and a trend toward globalization .
There was even an equivalent of the modern day subprime mortgage debt meltdown in the form of U.S. loans to Latin American countries which had to be written off .
“ The big difference is the attitude of central banks and specifically the attitude of the Fed , ” Connolly said .
Some economists have blamed the U.S. economy ’s travails in the 1930s on the Federal Reserve ’s hesitation to inject reserves into the banking system .
However , today ’s Fed has tried to preempt the danger of a protracted economic slump and has responded swiftly to a credit crunch in the past year and gathering signs of deterioration in the economy , Connolly said .
The Fed has stepped up its temporary additions of reserves to the banking system , and swiftly slashed its benchmark fed funds target rate to 3.0 percent from 5.25 percent in September .
Analysts expect at least another 0.5 percentage point cut in next month .
At the same time , “ the fed funds rate ca n’t stay significantly above the 2 - year note yield , ” Connolly said .
On Tuesday , the 2 - year Treasury note yield was at 2.00 percent , not far above the lowest level since 2004 .
The Fed “ almost certainly ” has to cut the funds rate to 2.0 percent by the end of this monetary easing cycle , he said .
If conditions in the banking sector worsen , the Fed could cut the funds rate to 1.0 percent , a low last seen in June 2004 .
Global banks have already written down more than $ 100 billion of bad debts associated with the U.S. subprime mortgage debt meltdown and housing market decline .
However , Fed rate cuts alone are unlikely to avert a prolonged period of economic weakness because the danger still exists that a burdened banking sector will choke off credit to consumers and households .
“ The Fed probably ca n’t fix it all on its own now , ” Connolly said .
“ There is a chance the Fed gets forced into unconventional cooperation with government , ” which could involve buying a range of assets to reflate their value .
That would be reminiscent of some steps the U.S. government took in the 1930s when the economy was mired in deflation and high unemployment .
One turning point came when agricultural prices were restored to their pre-slump levels , Connolly said .
Such measures were among the New Deal programs that President Franklin D. Roosevelt launched to bolster the economy .
Either way , investors face bleak prospects now without some kind of further government intervention , he said .
Those steps might offer clues to investors in stocks and commodities , which Connolly expects the government might be ultimately force to step in and buy to stabilize markets .
He expects that a depression may be averted , but only by the state and the Fed reinflating the price of such assets .
Beleaguered housing , non-government fixed - income securities and even the now overvalued Treasury market have little hope of generating substantial returns for investors over the next few years , he said .
“ If we do n’t avoid depression , the only thing worth holding is cash , ” he added .

MSNBC " Countdown " host Keith Olbermann designated Ill. Rep. Monique Davis ( D- Chicago ) as Tuesday 's " Worst Person in The World " for her verbal attack last week on atheist activist Rob Sherman :
Davis owes the witness and everybody in this country who believes in freedom of religion an apology .
And if she ca n’t figure that out , she should resign and take her prejudice with her .
But she also needs to improve her own education .
That phrase , “ This is the land of Lincoln where people believe in God . ” Ms. Davis said that in Springfield where , when Lincoln first ran for Congress in 1846 , the future great president was accused by his opponent of being an atheist .
You not only spat on the fundamental American freedom to embrace religion , a religion or no religion , Assemblywomen Davis , but you also made a damn fool out of yourself in the process .
Meanwhile , Sherman , who is running for the state house in the northwest suburbs on the Green Party ticket , has written a letter to Rep. Jack Franks ( D- Woodstock ) , requesting that Davis be formally censured for attempting to order Sherman out of the witness chair as Sherman testified before the House State Government Administration Committee , which Franks heads .
Her grounds : " It ’s dangerous for our children to even know that your philosophy exists ! "
UPDATE ---
At his Web site , Sherman is reporting ( and I have not confirmed since Davis has not returned several phone calls from me ) that he has accepted an apology that Davis offered to him over the phone :
Davis said that she had been upset , earlier in the day , to learn that a twenty - second and twenty - third Chicago Public School student this school year had been shot to death that morning .
She said that it was wrong for her to take out her anger , frustrations and emotions on me , and that she apologized to me .
I told her that her explanation was reasonable and that I forgave her ..... she thanked me for forgiving her .....

FAA whistleblower : Manager threatened job , family

FAA whistle blower Douglas Peters told a House committee Thursday that his boss threatened his job and his family if he turned in a report on unethical behavior by FAA employees .
Peters , an FAA aviation safety inspector , became emotional as he recounted to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee how the acting manager of the FAA office charged with overseeing the agency , had allegedly picked up a framed picture of Peters ' family while issuing the threat .
" ' You have a good job here and your wife has a good job over at the Dallas [ FAA flight standards office ] .
I 'd hate to see you jeopardize yours and her careers trying to take down a couple of losers , ' " Peters said he was told by Bobby Hedlund , the Acting Manager of FAA 's Southwest Certificate Management Office .
Peters said this ensued after he had told Hedlund that he just wanted to do the right thing .
" We should always do the right thing , " Hedlund reportedly replied , just before the alleged threat .
Peters and Charalambe Bobby Boutris , another inspector who was part of FAA 's Southwest Airlines team in 2007 , said they believe officials in FAA headquarters also deliberately looked the other way with respect to their reports of record - keeping and safety violations at Southwest .

As Obamamania sweeps the land , the end may be nigh for Hillary Clinton .
Her husband has effectively declared that she must win Tuesday 's votes in Texas and Ohio to survive .
Barack Obama has turned her once - giant leads in those states into dead heats .
Even if she manages to win both contests , only implausibly large margins of victory will narrow Obama 's current , nearly insurmountable delegate lead .
Yes , Hillary Clinton is a survivor and she may again stun the world just as she did in New Hampshire .
But her prospects are grim .
Thus it 's impossible not to begin imagining what is likely to come next : a general election campaign between Barack Obama and the Republican nominee apparent , John McCain .
Giddy over their man 's incandescence - ' He can cure cancer with a simple touch ; summon rain in the desert ; make peace between black and white , Arab and Jew , Jagger and Richards ' - some Obama followers are anticipating a rout .
They see their man as a young tribune of hope and prescient Iraq war opponent facing down a cranky old Washington fixture who supported both the war and the failed presidency of George W Bush .
Could this be , to borrow a phrase from the Bushies , a slam dunk ?
Not so fast .
A new opponent and a new brand of voters will both put Obama to his greatest test yet .
Although Hillary Clinton once appeared unstoppable , in hindsight it 's clear that she provided Barack Obama with a near - perfect foil .
The people who vote in Democratic primaries are a fundamentally idealistic lot .
They romanticise politics and want to believe that great dreams can be achieved .
In recent years , they have simmered with frustration that their party 's leaders have become hyper - calculated sellouts who answer to corporate interests and cow before the Republican attack machine .
With her extreme image - control , her history with shady campaign donors and , above all , her 2002 vote to authorise the Iraq war , she embodied much of what Democratic primary voters hate .
She has compounded these problems by dismissing Obama 's thrilling vision .
While he has promised to transform Washington , Clinton has argued that it takes an insider to operate its vulgar machinery .
She has seemed a champion of compromise and Obama the personification of idealism .
Critically , this contrast between Obama and Clinton has largely been one of style and not substance .
With few policy differences to debate , their contest has focused on image .
For Hillary - older , less charismatic , tainted by past scandals - that dynamic has been crippling .
An Obama - McCain match would be a very different story .
The men have fundamental differences on everything from national security to abortion rights , from gun control to health care and taxes .
' It is only natural that when policy differences are smaller in the primary , you focus on the people , ' says Dan Schnur , a former top aide to McCain .
' The general election will be about issues . '
Obama is not the policy lightweight that some critics imagine .
But as he has demonstrated in countless debates , he is not at his best when discussing issue specifics .
He needs grand themes to make himself grand .
No issue will test him like McCain 's favourite subject : national security .
Clinton has tried , and largely failed , to raise doubts about Obama 's ability to keep America safe .
But she was severely limited on security issues by the Democratic primary dynamic .
She knew liberal voters would n't stand for Karl Rove - like attacks on Obama as ' soft ' on security .
She repeatedly claimed to be the most qualified candidate to lead the country , but always stopped short of flatly declaring Obama dangerously unqualified .
McCain will have no such reservations .
He will be free to attack Obama as unprepared for the job of commander in chief .
And he may succeed where Clinton has failed .
A late - February Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll found that voters believe McCain has ' the right experience ' over Obama by a 53 - 22 margin .
This is not the portrait of an electorate ready to be swept away by memories of Robert F Kennedy .
In the face of doubts about his core qualifications , Obama can't fall back on soaring oratory .
He 'll be forced to spend more time proving his serious bona fides in ways more likely to elicit yawns than the fainting spells of his recent rallies .
Take Iraq as an example .
McCain 's strong original support for the war is a political handicap .
But public opinion remains divided about the next step in that country and McCain has benefited from perception that the troop ' surge ' he backed has succeeded .
It is not at all clear that Obama 's call for a near - total troop withdrawal will trump McCain 's arguments for avoiding ' defeat ' in Iraq .
That same poll showed voters trusting McCain to handle Iraq over Obama by a 47 - 34 margin .
The debate will be sombre and perhaps bitter .
And it will demand complex strategic reasoning , not inspirational slogans such as : ' Yes , we can . '
There 's also the risk of hope fatigue .
American culture is absurdly fickle and the media love to defile their own holy icons .
And euphoric puppy love must yield to mundane reality : ' People can't be awed by every speech for the next eight months , ' says one Democratic Obama admirer in Washington .
' Everyday tedium might do in " hope " more than the Republicans will .'
Finally , McCain may challenge Obama with his own version of hope .
Clinton erred badly by treating Obama 's vision for political reform as naive .
But rather than defend the status quo , McCain will counter with change credentials that cannot be dismissed .
In 2002 , he passed the most important reform to the federal campaign finance system in 30 years and has engendered bitterness among his Washington colleagues for exposing wasteful spending projects .
McCain boosters are already highlighting this .
' One candidate has fought for change his entire life while the other has talked about it , ' says one longtime McCain adviser .
By no means will this election be easy for McCain .
Iraq could plunge back into chaos and the US economy could spiral further down , two scenarios that would badly stigmatise his party and , quite likely , his candidacy .
Obama has also been underestimated before .
Few people imagined he could defeat Clinton in 10 straight primary contests as he has this winter or raise up to $ 2 m per day .
For the moment , Obama remains the most inspirational political figure in a generation , but his admirers must prepare themselves for a reality check .
Winning the Democratic nomination , if he can pull it off , will have been the easy part .
" One of the many quirks of Ron Paul 's unexpectedly vigorous campaign for the Republican presidential nomination has been that he has been able to generate such a fervent following despite a campaign manner that verges on the grandfatherly .
But in a brief interview in New Hampshire a few days ago , Paul showed that he is capable of delivering a barbed line or two , albeit wrapped in a kindly septuagenarian smile .
" Asked what he made of John McCain 's comments at last week 's GOP debate comparing Paul 's opposition to the war in Iraq to the appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s , Paul let loose , saying that McCain was " confused historically . "
" ' People in the 1930s who did n't want war did n't cause World War II .
I think Hitler caused the war , not the Americans who argued for a pro-American foreign policy , ' he said .
" ' I do n't think [ McCain ] understands the difference between isolationism and non-intervention .
How can he condemn it if the Founders believed in it ?
George Washington , Jefferson , this was their strong advice . ' "
Alec MacGillis , Washington Post , 12/06/07
The United Nations warned yesterday that it no longer has enough money to keep global malnutrition at bay this year in the face of a dramatic upward surge in world commodity prices , which have created a " new face of hunger " .
" We will have a problem in coming months , " said Josette Sheeran , the head of the UN's World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
" We will have a significant gap if commodity prices remain this high , and we will need an extra half billion dollars just to meet existing assessed needs . "
With voluntary contributions from the world 's wealthy nations , the WFP feeds 73 million people in 78 countries , less than a 10th of the total number of the world 's undernourished .
Its agreed budget for 2008 was $ 2.9 bn ( £ 1.5 bn ) .
But with annual food price increases around the world of up to 40 % and dramatic hikes in fuel costs , that budget is no longer enough even to maintain current food deliveries .
The shortfall is all the more worrying as it comes at a time when populations , many in urban areas , who had thought themselves secure in their food supply are now unable to afford basic foodstuffs .
Afghanistan has recently added an extra 2.5 million people to the number it says are at risk of malnutrition
" This is the new face of hunger , " Sheeran said .
" There is food on shelves but people are priced out of the market .
There is vulnerability in urban areas we have not seen before .
There are food riots in countries where we have not seen them before . "
WFP officials say the extraordinary increases in the global price of basic foods were caused by a " perfect storm " of factors : a rise in demand for animal feed from increasingly prosperous populations in India and China , the use of more land and agricultural produce for biofuels , and climate change .
The impact has been felt around the world .
Food riots have broken out in Morocco , Yemen , Mexico , Guinea , Mauritania , Senegal and Uzbekistan .
Pakistan has reintroduced rationing for the first time in two decades .
Russia has frozen the price of milk , bread , eggs and cooking oil for six months .
Thailand is also planning a freeze on food staples .
After protests around Indonesia , Jakarta has increased public food subsidies .
India has banned the export of rice except the high - quality basmati variety .
" For us , the main concern is for the poorest countries and the net food buyers , " said Frederic Mousseau , a humanitarian policy adviser at Oxfam .
" For the poorest populations , 50 % - 80 % of income goes on food purchases .
We are concerned now about an immediate increase in malnutrition in these countries , and the landless , the farmworkers there , all those who are living on the edge . "
Much of the blame has been put on the transfer of land and grains to the production of biofuel .
But its impact has been outweighed by the sharp growth in demand from a new middle class in China and India for meat and other foods , which were previously viewed as luxuries .
" The fundamental cause is high income growth , " said Joachim von Braun , the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute .
" I estimate this is half the story .
The biofuels is another 30 % .
Then there are weather - induced erratic changes which caused irritation in world food markets .
These things have eaten into world levels of grain storage .
" The lower the reserves , the more nervous the markets become , and the increased volatility is particularly detrimental to the poor who have small assets . "
The impact of climate change will amplify that already dangerous volatility .
Record flooding in west Africa , a prolonged drought in Australia and unusually severe snowstorms in China have all had an impact on food production .
" The climate change factor is so far small but it is bound to get bigger , " Von Braun said .
" That is the long - term worry and the markets are trying to internalise it . "
The WFP is holding an emergency meeting in Rome on Friday , at which its senior managers will meet board members to brief them on the scale of the problem .
There will then be a case - by - case assessment of the seriousness of the situation in the affected countries , before the WFP formally asks for an increased budget at its executive board meeting in June .
But the donor countries are also facing higher fuel and transport costs .
For the biggest US food aid programme , non -food costs now account for 65 % of total programme expenditure .
Global impact :
Where inflation bites deepest
1 United States
The last time America 's grain silos were so empty was in the early seventies , when the Soviet Union bought much of the harvest .
Washington is telling the World Food Programme it is facing a 40 % increase in food commodity prices compared with last year , and higher fuel bills to transport it , so the US , the biggest single food aid contributor , will radically cut the amount it gives away .
2 Morocco 34 people jailed this month for taking part in riots over food prices .
3 Egypt
The world 's largest importer of wheat has been hard hit by the global price rises , and most of the increase will be absorbed in increased subsidies .
The government has also had to relax the rules on who is eligible for food aid , adding an extra 10.5 million people .
4 Eritrea
It could be one of the states hardest hit in Africa because of its reliance on imports .
The price rises will hit urban populations not previously thought vulnerable to a lack of food .
5 Zimbabwe With annual inflation of 100,000 % and unemployment at 80 % , price increases on staples can only worsen the severe food shortages .
6 Yemen Prices of bread and other staples have nearly doubled in the past four months , sparking riots in which at least a dozen people were killed .
7 Russia
The government struck a deal with producers last year to freeze the price of milk , eggs , vegetable oil , bread and kefir ( a fermented milk drink ) .
The freeze was due to last until the end of January but was extended for another three months .
8 Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai has asked the WFP to feed an extra 2.5 million people , who are now in danger of malnutrition as a result of a harsh winter and the effect of high world prices in a country that is heavily dependent on imports .
9 Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf announced this month that Pakistan would be going back to ration cards for the first time since the 1980s , after the sharp increase in the price of staples .
These will help the poor ( nearly half the population ) buy subsidised flour , wheat , sugar , pulses and cooking fat from state - owned outlets .
10 India
The government will spend 250bn rupees on food security .
India is the world 's second biggest wheat producer but bought 5.5 m tonnes in 2006 , and 1.8 m tonnes last year , driving up world prices .
It has banned the export of all forms of rice other than luxury basmati .
11 China Unusually severe blizzards have dramatically cut agricultural production and sent prices for food staples soaring .
The overall food inflation rate is 18.2 % .
The cost of pork has increased by more than half .
The cost of food was rising fast even before the bad weather moved in , as an increasingly prosperous population began to demand as staples agricultural products previously seen as luxuries .
The government has increased taxes and imposed quotas on food exports , while removing duties on food imports .
12 Thailand
The government is planning to freeze prices of rice , cooking oil and noodles .
13 Malaysia and the Philippines Malaysia is planning strategic stockpiles of the country 's staples .
Meanwhile the Philippines has made an unusual plea to Vietnam to guarantee its rice supplies .
Imports were previously left to the global market .
14 Indonesia Food price rises have triggered protests and the government has had to increase its food subsidies by over a third to contain public anger .
FAQ : Food prices
Few winners and many losers
What is the problem ?
In the three decades to 2005 , world food prices fell by about three - quarters in inflation - adjusted terms , according to the Economist food prices index .
Since then they have risen by 75 % , with much of that coming in the past year .
Wheat prices have doubled , while maize , soya and oilseeds are at record highs .
Why are food prices rising ?
The booming world economy has driven up prices for all commodities .
Changes in diets have also played a big part .
Meat consumption in many countries has soared , pushing up demand for the grain needed by cattle .
Demand for biofuels has also risen strongly .
This year , for example , one third of the US maize crop will go to make biofuels .
Moreover , the gradual reform and liberalisation of agricultural subsidy programmes in the US and Europe have reduced the butter and grain mountains of yesteryear by eliminating overproduction .
Who are the winners and losers ?
Farmers are the obvious winners , as are poor countries that rely extensively on food exports .
But consumers are having to pay more , and the urban poor in many developing states will be hardest hit , as they often spend more than a third of their income on food .
How long are prices likely to be high ?
The US department for agriculture says the country 's wheat stocks are at their lowest for 50 years and demand will continue to exceed supply this year .
There is potential to bring more land into production in countries such as Ukraine , but that could take time .
And as all foodstuffs have risen sharply in price there is little incentive for farmers to switch from one crop to another .
What about the EU 's common agricultural policy ?
High food prices certainly remove the need to subsidise farmers and so there is a chance , say experts , that badly needed reductions in CAP subsidies , which cost European taxpayers dearly , could now be within reach .
Are other commodity prices also rising ?
Oil , metals and coal have seen their prices rise strongly as the global economy has expanded rapidly , driving up demand for almost everything ,
particularly from emerging economies such as China and India .
Some economists think speculation may also play a part .
Disappointed by the sub - prime collapse and falling property values in many countries , investors have piled money into commodities .

For many adults , it 's time to cringe and run for the hills when the
family photo album comes out .
But Barack Obama showed off these intimate childhood snapshots to the
world as he fought for the hearts of American voters on
" Super Tuesday . "
Scroll down for more ...
The photos were designed to underline the 46 - year - old White House
frontrunner 's rise from a humble background as the mixed race son of a
single mother to the brink of the Democratic Party 's presidential
nomination .
They were also part of the youngest candidate 's strategy to push his
broad appeal as the fresh face with the best chance to make history by
winning the November 4 election to become the first black U.S
president .
The Obama campaign released the family album as 24 states went to the
polls with the Illinois senator running neck - and - neck with former first
lady Hillary Clinton , 60 .
The pictures show him at various stages of his life , from him splashing
about in the ocean as a little boy in the Sixties , to swinging a
baseball bat and riding around on a tricycle .
A poignant shot shows him laughing in the arms of his mother , Ann .
There are photos of his Kenyan father , after whom he was named , his
Indonesian stepfather and his white grandparents .
Like most 70s fashion survivors , he also has that photo of the wide
collar shirt .
His hair edges towards an afro in the same snap .
From being virtually unknown a couple of years ago , Mr Obama 's story
has captured the imagination of voters .
Being the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from
America 's Midwest , Mr Obama claims to embody the desire for change
after eight years of the Bush administration .
His father , who grew up herding goats in a village called Alego in
Kenya's Nyanza province , won a scholarship to Hawaii , where he met and
later married Ann Dunham , who hailed from Kansas .
Their son was born in Honolulu on August 4 , 1961 .
The marriage did n't last and Barack Sr. later returned to Kenya , where
he worked as a government economist before his death in a car accident
when his son was 21 .
When Mr Obama was six , his mother married Lolo Soetoro , an Indonesian
foreign student and the family moved to Jakarta .
After four years , he
went to Hawaii to live with his grandparents and attend university .
His
mother died of cancer 12 years ago at the age of 53 .
The security cabinet voted on Wednesday to declare the Gaza Strip a hostile political entity .
The ministers also discussed the continuous rocket attacks against Israel .
The unanimous vote also authorized the imposing of economic sanctions against Gaza , so long as they do not affect the civilian population .
The measures to be taken against Gaza include cutting back on the supply of electricity and fuel , in accordance with international law .
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said that Israel 's decision constituted a " declaration of war . "
" This is a dangerous escalation of the attempt to legitimize destroying Palestinian land , criminal behavior and bringing a humanitarian disaster on the Palestinian people .
This is Israel attempting a knock - out blow against Hamas following its successes in taking control of Gaza .
" I find the silence and cooperation of the man in Ramallah ( Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ) with the enemy to be very curious indeed , " said Barhoum .
Gaza Dilemma Avoiding past mistakes / Yossi Ben - Ari Israel should weigh all parameters before embarking on Gaza operation Full Story
The security cabinet met on Wednesday morning to discuss recent events in Gaza , including last week 's Qassam attack against the Zikim military base .
Over 60 soldiers were wounded in the attack .
All cabinet ministers and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert voiced their objection to retaking Gaza at this time .
On Tuesday Defense Minister Barak convened the IDF chief of staff and other senior military officials , including representatives from the Military Advocate General specializing in international law , to discuss possible punitive measures Israel could take against Gaza as the rockets continue to fall .
Following the meeting Barak conclude that Gaza and the Hamas government must first be declared a hostile entity .
Barak 's office said that in accordance with international law – in dealing with a hostile entity , Israel would be able to respond without imposing a collective punishment against the civilian Palestinian population .
Those measures include preventing the flow of funds into Gaza , restricting the operations of the various border crossings , cutting off the Israeli supply of fuel to Gaza and cutting back the amount of electricity provided to the public .
Barak said however that Israel would not cut off the supply of drinking water and food or equipment and electricity required by Gaza 's health services .
The defense minister said he believed the international community would understand Israel 's decision .
At present time Barak is not expected to order a large - scale military campaign in Gaza but rather maintain the current policy of carrying out pinpointed operations .
The open - source WebKit HTML rendering engine is rapidly gaining ground on the Linux platform where it is increasingly being adopted by conventional desktop applications for content display .
Ongoing efforts to facilitate tighter WebKit integration are opening the door for developing rich Internet applications on Linux with the open - source GTK and Qt development toolkits .
WebKit in GTK
Development on the GTK WebKit port is progressing at a very impressive pace .
We have previously looked at several noteworthy experiments related to the port , including a GStreamer - based HTML5 video element implementation , and WebKit backend support for web browsers on Maemo , Epiphany , and OLPC .
These tests demonstrate the increasing efficacy of the GTK WebKit port in the context of a conventional browser , but there are also many other fascinating experiments that reveal additional contexts in which the GTK WebKit port has value .
GTK WebKit developer Alp Toker published slides last week from his presentation at the Free and Open Source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM ) .
The presentation discusses prospects for developing hybrid desktop / web applications with WebKit and GTK .
The project aims to create a robust GObject - based API that makes WebKit trivially easy to use in desktop applications .
Bindings are already available for several programming languages , including C# , Python , and Vala .
Embedding a WebKit renderer in a GTK application is as easy as instantiating a WebView and packing it in a GTK ScrolledWindow or other container .
In Python , Toker 's slides note , this can be done in only a dozen lines of code .
The WebView object , which is similar to a GtkTextView , provides full support for both rich content editing and display .
Development efforts that are currently in progress will provide a full GObject - based API for programmatic manipulation of the DOM , making it easy for applications to control and modify content in embedded HTML views .
It will also be possible to expose internal application functionality through JavaScript so that it can be used inside of the view .
WebKit has already been adopted experimentally by several GTK - based desktop applications that are widely used on the Linux platform .
Developers report that using WebKit in Yelp , GNOME 's documentation browser , led to a noticeable decrease in application startup time .
Pidgin developer Sean Egan is working on creating a plugin for the instant messaging client that replaces that conventional message view with one based on WebKit that can even use themes from Adium .
WebKit in Pidgin offers a much richer and more flexible user interface .
WebKit in Qt
One of the cool features we examined when we took our first look at Qt 4.4 last year is the QWebView , a WebKit rendering component that wrapped in a Qt widget API with full support for conventional signals and properties .
A whitepaper published by Trolltech provides a lot of insight into the robust technical capabilities of Qt's WebKit widget .
A particularly impressive feature is support for integrating regular native Qt widgets directly into QWebView HTML layouts .
This makes it possible to seamlessly interweave web content into Qt desktop applications .
Qt 's meta - object system handles binding so that native widgets are accessible through JavaScript and the contents of the QWebView can be manipulated through native code .
Trolltech also plans to create a QWidget subclass which implements the Netscape plugin API so that Java applets , Flash movies , and other similar components can be embedded directly in regular Qt applications .
Following Nokia 's recent acquisition of Trolltech , the developers have been working to increase the visibility of their WebKit development efforts .
Nokia perceives Qt- based WebKit software as having particularly high relevance in mobile environments .
" The Qt WebKit Integration helps developers to combine live web content with mobile and desktop applications , " said Trolltech developer Lars Knoll at the Mobile World Congress last month in Barcelona .
" This erodes the boundaries between the desktop , mobile phones and the Web .
It also enables graphics and Web designers to join developers in making user interfaces more advanced than ever — no matter which device or desktop application you are using . "
Knoll is the original creator of KHTML , the KDE - based open - source HTML rendering engine that Apple adopted to serve as the basis for WebKit .
For more of his insights , check out the interview with him that our Infinite Loop writers conducted last year at WWDC .
Some demo videos available from the Trolltech web site show off a few the cool QWebView features in action .
One of the videos shows how to create a site - specific browser by dragging and dropping a QWebView widget onto a form in the Qt Designer tool .
Another video demonstrates how Google maps can be integrated into a desktop application .
A more scalable solution for RIAs
Using embedded WebKit renderers in GTK applications will make it possible to rapidly implement rich media - oriented displays and reuse existing web content in destkop applications .
There are obviously many contexts where rich Internet applications are a compelling and much - needed solution .
When we took a close look this morning at Adobe AIR ( which also heavily uses WebKit ) , we noted that its lack of support for exposing native libraries through the runtime imposes serious limitations on scalability .
Using embedded WebKit components in native GTK and Qt applications is an approach that offers more flexibility and permits broad use of native libraries .
It is also worth noting that Qt ( and GTK to a lesser extent ) is cross- platform compatible and supported on Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux .
These toolkits provide a strong open - source alternative to AIR that supplies adequate portability and also offer a broader and more robust collection of widgets and tools for conventional desktop software development .
As these competing solutions for rich Internet application development become more mature , they will likely influence some significant changes in the way that developers create software .
The expanding spectrum of available tools and solutions for this kind of development is a very promising sign of things to come .
Finding fewer emails in your AT&T spam folder ?
It may be a mixed blessing .
AT&T appears to have implemented new spam filters that are catching legitimate emails - but provide no warning to the intended recipients .
Over the past week , internet service providers , individual email senders and customers of AT&T - controlled email services have reported a sharp uptick in the number of non-spam messages that failed to make it into end users ' inboxes .
The reports coincide with a noticeable decline in the number of messages being funneled into junk mail folders , causing many users to assume the blocking of legitimate emails is connected to antispam measures AT&T has recently rolled out .
Michigan - based Deerfield.com is one of the ISPs affected .
On Friday , Kevin Fortune , a technical service representative , discovered AT&T had blocked all email being sent from servers connected to its DNS2GO service .
" They just took the preemptive approach and blocked everything from one of our IP addresses , if not all of them , " Fortune said .
On Monday morning , he said he had conflicting information about whether email originating from his servers was still being blocked .
El Reg reader Brett Brennan , a Deerfield customer who found he was unable to send email to addresses maintained by AT&T , said his messages were no longer bouncing , but he had n't yet confirmed that they were getting through , either .
An AT&T spokeswoman said she was investigating the reports .
Brennan and Deerfield.com are by no means alone , judging from DSLReports threads here , here and here .
All these forums report a familiar pattern : people who get their email from Yahoo.com , PacBell.net , BellSouth.net , or other domain names controlled by AT&T noticed a big drop in the amount of spam beginning sometime late last week .
But at the same time , many of these users also found they were unable to receive email from legitimate sources .
" I get my work via email , so to me this is not a trivial problem , " an AT&T customer named Liz who declined to give her last name said in an interview .
So far , she 's discovered that email coming from a friend and her web host are both being blocked , but she worries prospective customers who try to contact her through her website are also getting blocked .
" If they can't reach me , " she said , " I do n't know it . " ®
Although Darfur is part of Sudan , it is physically distant from the country ’s heartland and sources of military power .
Every inch of the 600 miles of barren territory between Khartoum and the killing grounds is an opportunity for a reprieve commanded by American air power  with not a boot on the ground .
The Sudanese military in Darfur can be trapped there without sustenance , to wither or retreat as the bulk of Sudanese forces are kept out .
And the janjaweed can be denied tangible support merely by severing the few extenuated routes of supply .
Image Credit ... Joseph Hart
The first requirement of a cordon sanitaire , however , would be to cut all air links , which would require carrier - based air strikes to destroy the Sudanese air force ’s 51 combat aircraft , 25 transports , and 44 helicopters ( all figures from the International Institute for Strategic Studies ) ; its fuel , munitions and maintenance facilities ; and the few runways capable of supporting heavy transports and fighters .
Were Chad to approve a small expeditionary force of America ’s A - 10 tactical - air - support planes , which it probably would , just a few of these could closely suppress remnant Sudanese armor and check any force of the janjaweed militia sufficiently concentrated to overcome local means of self - defense .
Moreover , none of this would prove necessary were the United States willing to go further and threaten or accomplish the destruction of the Sudanese regime ’s means to power over a country that has been pulled apart centrifugally by multiple secessions .
One need n’t be squeamish about such a proposition .
It pertains to a government that has long massacred hundreds of thousands of its “ own ” people in its South and West , supported international terrorism and menaced most of its neighbors .
The precise targeting of a substantial portion of its 1,200 armored vehicles and 1,100 artillery pieces ; its telecommunications exchanges and microwave towers ; its dozen small naval vessels ; its aircraft , runways , munitions , military headquarters , logistical stores , security ministries and presidential residences would be only a few days ’ work for long - range bombers dispatched from remote bases , and the planes of two carrier task forces hastened to the Red Sea .
Which would the regime in Sudan prefer ?
To be annihilated , or to discontinue its campaign of mass murder in Darfur ?
Given Sudan ’s record , very few nations would be willing to come to its aid with other than a pro forma whimper , and given the geography and the air and naval balance , no nation could .
Though many a repressive dictatorship would protest , and Sudan ’s patron , China , might determine to speed up the formation of the blue - water navy it is already building , little else would change except for the better .

The World from Berlin Munich to US : " Do n't Send Your CIA Thugs out into Europe 's Streets "
In a historic first , German prosecutors have issued arrest warrants for 13 suspected CIA agents thought to have illegally kidnapped a German citizen as part of the war on terror .
The decision has been universally welcomed by German commentators .
Last month , Eli Estrada found $ 140,000 cash in the street on his way to work .
The $ 20 bills were unmarked , bundled into wads of $ 20,000 and in a bag in the middle of Gridley Road in Cerritos .
The 40 - year - old Highland Park man ’s first thought was : “ I ’m rich . ”
But he immediately decided to turn in his find .
The money would go a long way , he thought , but keeping it would be wrong .
Advertisement
“ That ’s just your first reaction , ” Estrada said , “ but it ’s not yours and you feel nervous and you feel like you did something wrong , even though you did n’t . ”
It ’s not that he did n’t need it .
About six months ago , Estrada opened a landscaping and artificial - grass business , Tuff Turf , and is in debt .
He said his child support payments are tough to make and he supports his mother , who moved in with him last year after she lost her house to a fumbled refinancing plan and declared bankruptcy .
Estrada found the bag of money the morning of March 11 .
He and another Tuff Turf employee who was with him then drove to a landscaping job in Long Beach .

Being with the cash was “ a weird feeling , ” Estrada said .
“ It ’s not like you would expect it , it ’s surreal . ”
By chance , Estrada ’s Long Beach clients worked for police .
Estrada told them he wanted to turn the money in , and they called the Long Beach Police Department .
Estrada said he was content with his decision , though admitted “ it was hard to give up . ”
Authorities said the money was lost by Brinks armored truck drivers .

Long Beach police spokeswoman Dina Zapalski said she had never heard of someone turning in so much cash .
“ I ’ve had people come to me with purses and wallets with cash in it and they ’ll turn it in , ” Zapalski said .
“ But not like this . ”
Zapalski said officers were surprised that Estrada did n’t ask for a reward .
Instead , he went right back to work .
Estrada ’s mother , Rosa Estrada , said her son had always been nervous about doing something unethical or illegal .
This time was no different even though “ he needs the money , ” she said .
Advertisement
“ He was very nervous ; he said he would n’t be able to sleep ” if he did n’t turn it in , she said .
Brinks later gave Estrada $ 2,000 for turning in the money .
His mother smiled and said , “ They should have given him 10 % . ”

Does a macho culture cause problems ?
Hormone surges among City traders could be partly responsible for driving " boom and bust " economics , say researchers .
A Cambridge University team found testosterone levels were directly linked to the profit they made .
The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study also found levels of the stress hormone cortisol could affect the risks they took .
A psychologist who works with investment bankers said it may help explain seemingly irrational behaviour .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The Cambridge study measured testosterone levels in a small group of male City of London traders at both 11 am and 4 pm , and matched these to the levels of profit or loss recorded for that day .
They found that daily testosterone levels were significantly higher on days when traders made more than their average profit .
They ascribe this to the " winner effect " , seen in sportsmen , in which success increases testosterone levels , which in turn increase feelings of confidence and ability to take risks , which then increase the chances of further profits .
However , if repeated too much , they say , the rising testosterone levels could eventually compromise their ability to make rational decisions , as the traders take bigger and bigger risks during so - called " bubbles " , where the market rises sharply .
Prof Joe Herbert , one of the study 's authors , said : " Our work suggests that these decisions may be biased by emotional and hormonal factors that have not so far been considered in any detail .
" Hormones may be important for determining how well an individual trader performs in the stressful and competitive world of the market . "
' Learned helplessness
The researchers also looked at cortisol , which is produced in response to stress , and in the case of traders , extreme volatility in the markets .
In very stressful situations , some traders will just freeze
Jeremy Holt
Occupational Psychologist Dr John Coates , another of the study 's authors , said that while ever - increasing testosterone levels might turn risk - taking into an " addiction " , the reverse was true with the stress hormone cortisol , which , in excess , causes people to actively avoid risk , potentially worsening the effects of any downturn .
" In the present credit crisis , traders may feel the noxious effects of chronic cortisol exposure , and end up in a psychological state known as ' learned helplessness ' .
" If this happens central banks may lower interest rates only to find that traders still refuse to buy risky assets .
" At times like these , economics has to consider the physiology of investors , not just their rationality . "
' In the Zone ' Jeremy Holt , an occupational psychologist who works with investment banks to coach their traders on the psychology of risk - taking , agreed that both scenarios fitted well with his experiences .
" Traders will often talk to me about being ' in the zone ' - similar to a sportsman , meaning a feeling of ' unconscious competence ' , decisiveness and confidence .
" But it 's amazing the number of times that traders put in a really good run but then hand a lot of their profits back because they have become over - confident , and did n't just stop when they needed to .
" They often come up with some strange , irrational reasons for doing this . "
He added : " On the other hand , in very stressful situations , some traders will just freeze , and not do anything . "

What are these ?
If you listen to the analysts and study the markets , they will tell you that recession is upon us .
They will tell you that the housing market has crashed and the global markets will let you know that our currency is daily losing its value .
However , in this economic turmoil gold and silver are thriving .
New highs are being reached on almost a daily basis .
If you have invested in precious metals than this is your time .
Entrepreneurs are like precious metals they know how to thrive in bad times .
Unstable times bring incredible opportunities .
Capitalizing on these opportunities separate you from the doomsayers .
It also provides income opportunities that may not have been there in the past .
For example , if you are in the real estate business you know it ’s not your time to sell , but it ’s prime season if you are buying and adding to your real estate empire .
The mortgage crunch , which has led to record numbers of foreclosures , has been a great benefit to you .
Businesses of all types are using this time to generate new business within all this negative talk .
You are seeing businesses offer creative pricing and inexpensive luxuries .
With these types of tactics you ’re seeing businesses move around their slower moving competitors .
Mark Wardell , president of Vancouver - based consulting company Wardell Professional Development Inc. , “ it ’s never too late to start recession - proofing . ”
Mark says that even in recession you have to spend money to make money .
“ When times are tough , investment can be a hard pill to swallow , ” says Wardell .
“ But it ’s exactly the medicine a business needs if it is going to successfully ride out the coming economic storm . ” ( Canadian Business Online )
As an entrepreneur what have you done to recession - proof your business ?
How are you using this time to capitalize on the slower moving large companies ?
What creative tactics have you initiated ?

Extreme also in terms of the amount of natural light that penetrates through them .
The lower deck is the most comprehensive in its class with 4 cabins and 4 bathrooms .
As the largest flybridge in its category , the Azimut 70 offers 30 square metres to enjoy betwixt the sky and the sea ; over 15 square metres of glass surfaces that allow light to cascade through ; balanced design that is typical to the entire range .
It is not by chance that the 70 is a huge success , and it is not by chance that it is an Azimut .
The woolly jumpers help the chickens to grow new feathers
Chickens in jumpers
Brigitte Hawley , from Benenden , in Kent , gave the four bald birds a new home last November after receiving them from the Battery Hen Welfare Trust .
She designed the knitwear to protect them during the winter as they adapted to life away from the chicken sheds .
" Just to see them around the garden and doing what chickens should do is lovely , " said Ms Hawley .
Ms Hawley said her invention , which she calls a " chux tux " , had been adapted from a bobble hat , and came in different designs depending on which parts of the bird were in need of insulation .
Her bespoke design was the winning entry in a national knitting competition .
Since their release from captivity , her four battery hens are now showing signs of recovery , thanks to the designer knitwear .
Saving the Earth is hard work , especially if you 're trying to convince companies to be more eco-friendly .
But what if you could help a local business go green by doing nothing more than shopping there ?
That 's the idea behind Carrotmob , an enviro - minded consumer activism event that took place in San Francisco last weekend .
The idea : Carrotmob organizes a staged buying spree at a particular business .
In return , that business puts a percentage of the revenue toward energy - saving business renovations .
The business wins through a boom in sales , a green reputation and lowered energy costs , while the consumers also benefit , by putting an ecological bang behind their bucks for stuff they need to buy anyway .
" People have been doing mobs for no reason , so it 's nice to be in one with a cause , " said Adi Cohen , who spent about an hour of his Saturday afternoon in a very nonmobbish – but long – line at the K&D Market , an unremarkable , everyday kind of bodega on 16th St. in San Francisco 's Mission district .
Carrotmob is the brainchild of Brent Schulkin , a San Franciscan whose day job is conducting team - building games for corporations .
He generated considerable buzz over the event , campaigning on Facebook and MySpace , via e-mail and through a Carrotmob video channel .
All that online organizing paid off : Several hundred shoppers , many of them pals with the affable Schulkin , showed up on a Saturday afternoon and ponied up for way more wine , cookies , 40 - ounce beer , toilet paper and chips than they 'd normally buy at a convenience store .
Schulkin had asked more than 20 convenience stores in the Mission to make bids on what percentage of sales generated during a set time they'd be willing to put toward green renovations to their stores .
K&D bid the highest amount – 22 percent – and got to play host .
Store manager David Lee said he plans to change out the store 's light bulbs and make the wall - to - wall beer and milk fridges more efficient .
The shoppers were palpably stoked by the notion that their dollars would have a positive and immediate impact on the store .
And they were n't stingy with their purchases :
The store 's notoriously surly clerk rang up a whopping $ 9,400 during the four - hour spending spree .
Lee said an estimated 11 percent of that sum will go to cover tax and CRV ( California Refund Value ) , and then 22 percent of what 's left , or about $ 1,840 , will go toward renovations .
Schulkin hopes he can parlay Carrotmob into a thriving nonprofit , staging more events like last weekend's .
But will the Carrotmob premise catch on – and more importantly , can it raise enough money to make a difference ?
Lee said a full fridge makeover is going to cost well over what the Carrotmob - generated sales percentage will cover , so the store will start with changing out the light bulbs , then try to figure out how to address the 23 - year - old , energy - sucking fridges without springing for a complete replacement .
It 's not exactly saving the Earth , but it 's a start .
Apple loves 'em some Intel right ?
Sure , it was the Intel power - per - watt roadmap which Jobs cited as the reason to ditch IBM 's PowerPC platform .
Analysts have since been tripping over themselves with speculation about future generation iPhones and iPod touches going Intel -- especially since the arrival of Atom .
So what will analysts make of Apple 's $ 278 million in cash purchase of the 150 person P.A. Semi microprocessor design company ?
The company was founded by Dan Dobberpuhl , lead designer of DEC 's doomed Alpha and StrongArm processors , and responsible for the introduction of a 2GHz , 64 - bit dual - core microprocessor which in February 2007 was said to be 300 % more efficient than comparable chips running at 5 to 13 watts .
Forbes speculates that Apple will wrap its ARMs around the company 's boutique processor in a bid for exclusivity -- a move meant to differentiate itself from competition using Intel and other off - the - shelf processors .
Interestingly , after a long courtship with P.A. Semi , the acquisition discussions only began in the last few weeks .
Say what you want about Jobs , but he 's nothing if not a man who knows what he wants and makes damn sure he gets it .
Update : Oh shazam !
We just remembered that P.A. Semi and Apple had been this close to a deal just prior ( as in minutes ) to the announced Intel switch in 2006 .
Interesting , very interesting .
Why now Apple ?

ELDORADO , Texas ( CNN ) --
Dozens more children and young women were removed Saturday from a Texas ranch that is home to members of a polygamist sect , as state workers investigated claims of physical and sexual abuse .
Texas authorties used the bus in the background to transport children from a FLDS compound Friday .
A total of 183 people -- including 137 children -- have been taken away since law enforcement officers raided the compound Thursday night , said Marleigh Meisner , a spokeswoman for the Texas Child Protective Services Division .
The children -- most of them girls -- were being interviewed by special investigators , she said .
" We 're trying to find out if they 're safe , " she explained .
" We need to know if they have been abused or neglected . "
Eighteen of the girls have been taken into state custody .
Authorities believe that they " had been abused or were at immediate risk of future abuse , " said Child Protective Services spokesman Darrell Azar .
The others were taken to a nearby civic center .
Meisner described them as doing " remarkably well . "
Authorities continue to search the 1,900 - acre YFZ ranch , occupied by followers of imprisoned polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs , and at least one man is being sought by police .
Law enforcement agencies raided the ranch Thursday night after receiving a report Monday that a 16 - year - old girl had been " sexually and physically abused , " Azar said .
Watch buses take girls from compound »
Law enforcement and child welfare officials were at the ranch all night Thursday and throughout Friday .
According to the search warrant , authorities are seeking Dale Barlow , 50 , whom they suspect of having married and fathered a child with a 16 - year - old girl .
Watch an Eldorado neighbor talk about the raid »
The warrant cited an " immediate need " for authorities to have access to the 16 - year - old and an 8 - month - old child with either the last name of Barlow or the girl 's last name .
It instructs law enforcement officers to look for any records showing that Barlow and the girl were married and any evidence of them having a child .
The people living at the ranch are cooperating , authorities said .
Jeffs , the 52 - year - old leader and " prophet " of the 10,000 - member church , was convicted in Utah last year and sentenced to 10 years on two counts of being an accomplice to rape , charges related to a marriage he performed in 2001 .
He faces trial in Arizona on eight charges of sexual conduct with a minor , incest and conspiracy .
Jeffs ' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints bought the land near Eldorado four years ago and built the ranch , which they call the YFZ Ranch .
The letters are said to refer to the words Yearning for Zion .
It is home to as many as 400 members who relocated from their Arizona and Utah compounds .
State and local law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks around the ranch Thursday evening , preventing journalists from seeing what was happening on the property , according to Randy Mankin , editor of the Eldorado Success weekly newspaper .
" This came totally out of the blue , " Mankin said .
There were no indications of violence around the ranch , he said .
When CNN crews have visited the ranch , it was guarded by armed men equipped with night vision gear and other high - tech surveillance tools to prevent intruders .
When CNN flew over the ranch in a small plane last year , the crew saw a massive temple , the three - story housing units where Jeffs ' chosen followers live , the water tower , the school and community center , the dairy and cheese factory and a massive concrete mill .
The church openly practices polygamy in two towns straddling the Arizona - Utah state line -- Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona -- but members living on their Texas ranch rarely venture into Eldorado , four miles to the south .
Critics of the sect say that it arranges marriages for girls as young as 13 and that competition for brides may be reduced through exiling young men .
If male followers are excommunicated , the critics claim , their wives and children can be reassigned to someone else .

Kate Hudson's Wild New Hairdo PHOTOS
got caught in a definite updraft at the premiere of her latest movie Fool 's Gold .
We could n't pass up an opportunity to show the lovely celebrity with her hair doing it 's own thing .
The gorgeous actress does n't let a little wind dampen her spirits .
She and fellow actors Matthew McConaughey and Donald Sutherland were on hand in Los Angeles to hype their latest body of work .
On McConaughey 's arm was pregnant girlfriend Camilla Alves .
We 've included some additional pictures of the lovely Kate .
* Photo : Heather Johnson * __Fred Krupp is n't __your typical tree hugger .
Chided by radicals for wooing corporate partners , the president of the Environmental Defense Fund is revered in Silicon Valley for championing a capitalist approach to clean energy .
His new book , Earth : The Sequel ( with Miriam Horn ) , spotlights the most promising climate solutions , from nanotech to flying windmills .
Wired asked Krupp how these technologies can compete .
Wired : Explain the title of your book .
Krupp :
We 've put Earth at the brink of climate calamity , thanks to rapid industrialization and market forces .
That 's part one .
The sequel is how we get out of this fix .
I believe it 's those same forces , innovation and profit — and nothing else — that can stop global warming .
Wired : How so ?
Krupp :
In 1992 , the EDF worked with Bush Sr. to craft a market system to reduce acid rain .
It spurred a revolution in sulfur dioxide scrubbing technologies .
The costs were projected at up to $ 2,000 a ton , but after 10 years they were down to about $ 100 a ton and emissions were slashed by 50 percent .
In 2005 , George W. Bush signed off on an additional 70 percent cut .
Why ?
The costs proved so low , the political controversy had disappeared .
I suspect the same thing can happen with a cap on global warming emissions once the incentives are right .
Wired :
What kind of cap ?
Krupp :
A legal limit that requires reductions of at least 20 percent from current levels by 2020 , ratcheting up to 80 percent by 2050 .
That 'll give new technologies the chance to flower .
Wired :
But wo n't our economy get hammered by China and India ?
Krupp :
It 's inevitable that those countries will adopt caps , too .
We will gain a competitive advantage by going first .
The real question is , do we want to import clean tech from Germany , Japan , and China or export it to the rest of the world ?
Wired :
How fast will industry 's costs decline ?
Krupp : I can't say without claiming to know more than I do , but I know that capitalism works , that American entrepreneurialism works , and we can damn well expect that private capital — not government money — will actually solve this problem .
Wired :
Why are so many of the leaders of the energy revolution the same folks who led the dotcom boom ?
Krupp :
It 's the mindset : Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are willing to take risks .
And many of the energy technologies are founded in computing sciences .
But the energy business is much more capital - intensive than Web apps .
And ultimately , clean tech is a much more important revolution .
We 're talking about the future of humanity , not how to find a date on the Internet .

Relativity Tutorial
Galilean Relativity
Relativity can be described using space - time diagrams .
Contrary to popular opinion , Einstein did not invent relativity .
Galileo preceded him .
Aristotle had proposed that moving objects ( on the Earth ) had a natural tendency to slow down and stop .
This is shown in the space - time diagram below .
But Galilean transformations do not preserve velocity .
Thus the statement " The speed limit is 70 mph " does not make sense -- but do n't try this in court .
According to relativity , this must be re-expressed as " The magnitude of the relative velocity between your car and the pavement must be less than 70 mph " .
Relative velocities are OK .
Special Relativity
But 200 years after Newton the theory of electromagnetism was developed into Maxwell 's equations .
These equations describe waves with a speed of 1 / sqrt( epsilon o * mu o ) , where epsilon o is the constant describing the strength of the electrostatic force in a vacuum , and mu o is the constant describing the strength of the magnetic interaction in a vacuum .
This is an absolute velocity -- it is not relative to anything .
The value of the velocity was very close to the measured speed of light , and when Hertz generated electromagnetic waves ( microwaves ) in his laboratory and showed that they could be reflected and refracted just like light , it became clear that light was just an example of electromagnetic radiation .
Einstein tried to fit the idea of an absolute speed of light into Newtonian mechanics .
He found that the transformation from one reference frame to another had to affect the time -- the idea of sliding a deck of cards had to be abandoned .
This led to the theory of special relativity .
In special relativity , the velocity of light is special .
Anything moving at the speed of light in one reference frame will move at the speed of light in all unaccelerated reference frames .
Other velocities are not preserved , so you can still try to get lucky on speeding tickets .
Thus in the situation shown in 3 space - time diagrams below , the central section shows the worldline of one stationary observer , one observer moving to the right , and two events on the future light cone on the event where the two observers ' worldlines cross .
What is the evidence for the invariance of the speed of light ?
The hypothesis that the speed of light is c relative to its source can easily be disproved by the one - way transmission of light from distant supernovae .
When a star explodes as a supernova , we see light coming from material with a large range of velocities dv , at least 10,000 km / sec .
Because of this range of velocities , the spectral lines of a supernova are very broad due to the Doppler shift .
After traveling a distance D in time D/c , the arrival time of the light would be spread out by dt = ( dv / c ) ( D/c ) .
However , light could travel at speed c relative to a medium -- the ether .
If it did , then the rate of a " bouncing photon clock " moving with respect to the ether
P( par ) = L/( c- v ) + L/( c+v ) = [ 2L / c ]/(1-v2/c2 ) .
( ct ) 2 = L2 + ( vt ) 2 so t = L/ sqrt( c2 - v2 ) P( perp ) = 2t = [ 2L/c]/sqrt(1-v2/c2 ) .
dP/P = [ P( par ) - P( perp ) ] / P = 0.5*v2/c2 .
Michelson and Morley used two bouncing photon clocks at right angles to each other , but without the lasers and counters which did n't exist .
This left an L - shaped interferometer .
But they were able to show that dP/P was essentially zero instead of the ether model prediction .
Radar
The constancy of the speed of light allows the use of radar ( RAdio Detection And Ranging ) to measure the position and time of events not on an observer 's worldline .
All that we need are a clock and the ability to emit and detect radar pulses .
Time Dilation
Armed with radar , we can determine the time of two events on the worldline of an observer moving with respect to us .
We can then compare the time interval we measure to the time interval measured by the moving observer .
Consider the two observers A and B below .
v = D/t = DA(R ) / tA ( R ) = c( k*k - 1 ) /( k*k+1 ) .
k = sqrt(( 1+v/c ) /(1-v/c ) )
( 1+k*k ) / ( 2*k ) = 1/sqrt(1-v2/c2 ) .
This slow down factor is exactly the slow down calculated above in the ether model for a bouncing photon clock moving perpendicular to its bounce axis .
The clock moving parallel to the axis slows down by the same amount under special relativity because of the Lorentz - Fitzgerald contraction of moving objects in the direction of motion .
P( par ) = [ 2L*sqrt(1-v2/c2 ) / c ]/(1-v2/c2 ) = [ 2L/c]/ sqrt(1-v2/c2 ) = P( perp )
Because the clocks of different observers run at different rates , depending on their velocities , the time for a given observer is a property of that observer and his worldline .
This time is called the proper time because it is " owned " by a given particle , not because it is the " correct " time .
Proper time is invariant when changing reference frames because it is the property of a particle , not of the reference frame or coordinate system .
In general , given any two events A and B with B inside the future light cone of A , there is one unaccelerated worldline connecting A and B , just as there is one straight line connecting two points in space .
In the frame of reference of the observer following this unaccelerated worldline , his clock is always stationary , while clocks following any other worldline from A to B will be moving at least some of the time .
Because moving clocks run slow , these observers will measure a smaller proper time between events A and B than the unaccelerated observer .
Thus the straight worldline between two events has the largest proper time , and all other curved worldlines connecting the two events have smaller proper times .
This is exactly analogous to the fact that the straight line between two points has the smallest length of all possible curves between the points .
Thus the " twin paradox " is no more paradoxical than the statement that a man who drives straight from LA to Las Vegas will cover fewer miles than a man who drives from LA to Las Vegas via Reno .
The pair of space - time diagrams above show quintuplets separated at birth .
The middle worldline shows the quint who stays home .
The space - time diagram on the left is done from the point of view of the middle quint .
Each dot on a worldline is a birthday party , so the middle quint is 10 years old when they all rejoin each other , while the other quints are 6 and 8 years old .
The space - time diagram on the right shows the same events from the point of view of an observer initially moving with one of the moving quints .
When the quints come together their ages are still 6 , 8 , 10 , 8 , and 6 years .
Thus the straight worldline between two events can be found by maximizing the proper time , just as the straight line between two points can be found by minimizing the length .
General Relativity
Now we come to a matter of gravity : how can gravity be an inverse square law force , when the distance between two objects can not even be defined in Einstein 's special relativity ?
Special relativity was constructed to satisfy Maxwell 's equations , which replaced the inverse square law electrostatic force by a set of equations describing the electromagnetic field .
So gravity was the only remaining action - at - a - distance inverse square law force .
And gravity has a unique property ; the acceleration due to gravity at a given place and time is independent of the nature of the body .
Thus through any event in space - time , in any given direction , there is only one worldline corresponding to motion solely influenced by gravity .
Compare this to the geometric fact that through any point , in any given direction , there is only one straight line .
We are led to propose that worldlines influenced only by gravity are really straight worldlines .
But how can an accelerating body have a straight worldline ?
It all depends on how you measure it .
Suppose we plot a straight line on polar graph paper , and then make a plot of radius vs angle as shown below ?
Principle of Equivalence
Einstein proposed that the effects of gravity ( in a small region of spacetime ) are equivalent to the effect of using an accelerated frame of reference without gravity .
As as example , consider the famous " Einstein elevator " thought experiment .
If an elevator far out in space accelerates upward at 10 meters / second2 , it will feel like a downward acceleration of gravity at 1 g = 10 m/s2 .
If a clock on the ceiling of the elevator emits flashes of light f times per second , an observer on the floor will see them arriving faster than f times per second because of the Doppler shift due to the acceleration of the elevator during the light transit time .
The effect of gravity on clocks was tested to greater precision by Vessot etal ( 1980 , PRL , 45 , 2081 ) who launched a hydrogen maser straight up at 8.5 km / sec , and watched its frequency change as it coasted up to 10,000 km altitude and then fell back to Earth .
The frequency shift due to gravity was ( f ' / f - 1 ) = 4*10 - 10 at 10,000 km altitude , and the experimental result agreed to within 70 parts per million of this shift .
Because of the gravitational speedup for uphill clocks , an observer moving between two events can achieve a larger proper time by shifting his worldline upward in the middle .
Going too far upward requires moving so fast that time dilation due to motion reduces the proper time more than the gravitational speedup , so there is an optimum curvature to the worldline that maximizes the proper time .
Curved Spacetime
Curved coordinates alone , such as the polar graph , do not provide a satisfactory model for gravity .
Two straight lines through the same point but with different directions will never cross again , while two worldlines influenced only by gravity which pass through the same event with different velocities can cross again .
Consider the Galileo spacecraft , which made two Earth flybys .
In between the flybys , Galileo was on an elliptical orbit with a 2 year period .
In order to allow " straight " lines to cross multiple times , a curved space - time is needed .
As a familiar example of a curved space , consider the surface of the Earth and the great circle arc connecting two cities .
The great circle is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of the Earth , and it is the path followed by airliners .
Plotting latitude vs longitude , as if longitude were time and latitude position , gives the pseudo - spacetime diagram below .
Einstein was able to compute the perihelion advance of Mercury using general relativity , and his calculation matched an observed discrepancy with Newtonian predictions .
Einstein also computed that light passing by the Sun would be deflected by twice as much as a prediction using Newtonian gravity and Newton 's particle model for light would suggest .
The same effect causes a delay of light passing by the limb of the Sun , known as the Shapiro delay , which has now been measured to great accuracy and agrees with the prediction of general relativity .
Light cones in curved space - time
Unlike the restricted set of Lorentz transformations allowed in special relativity , the more general coordinate transformations of general relativity will change the slope of the walls of the lightcones .
In other words , the speed of light ( dx / dt ) will change in the transformed coordinates : dx ' / dt ' will not equal dx / dt in general .
The light cones can tilt or stretch .
The figure below shows " lightcones " added to the radius vs angle example given above :
Thus the fundamentals of relativity that are important for cosmology are :
The speed of light is a constant independent of the velocity of the source or the observer .
Events that are simultaneous as seen by one observer are generally not simultaneous as seen by other observers , so there can be no absolute time .
Each observer can define his own proper time -- the time measured by a good clock moving along his worldline .
Observers can assign times and positions to events not on their worldlines using radar observations .
Every observer will see his clock running faster than other clocks which are moving with respect to him , and this is a mathematically consistent pattern required by the properties of radar observations .
As a result , the unaccelerated worldline between two events will have the longest proper time of all worldlines connecting these events .
In the presence of gravity , the worldlines of objects accelerated only by gravity have the longest proper times .
Gravity requires that spacetime have a non-Euclidean geometry , and this curvature of spacetime must be created by matter .
Relativity also leads to interesting objects such as black holes , but these are not very relevant to cosmology .
There are many books on relativity available , but two that stick to a simple level of mathematics are :

WASHINGTON – Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s lies about risking her life under sniper fire during a visit to Bosnia as first lady have infuriated the US military brass and troops .
“ She has no sense of what a statement like that does to soldiers , ” fumed retired Maj.
Gen. Walter Stewart , the former head of the Pennsylvania National Guard .
“ She is insulting the command in its entirety , ” he said yesterday .
VOTE : Has Hillary ’s credibility been “ shot to pieces ? ”
Clinton came under fire after saying she “ misspoke ” about what happened during the trip and claimed it was the first time she erred in describing her visit – an assertion Barack Obama ‘s campaign quickly disproved by finding at least three prior occasions over the last few months where she ’s claimed there was sniper fire .
Stewart , who was assigned to the Army ’s European headquarters at the time of Clinton ’s visit in 1996 , called her statements “ really astonishing . ”
“ Believe me , heads would have rolled all over ” if the military put the then - first lady at “ unacceptable risk , ” added Stewart , who is supporting Barack Obama .
Air Force Lt. Gen. Buster Glosson , a John McCain supporter who ran the air attack in the first Gulf War , said , “ It bothers me any time anyone running for the highest office in the land fabricates a story .
“ That should bother any American , whether you ’re military or nonmilitary . ”
Another source , a former Army analyst who was stationed abroad when dignitaries visited , said , “ You know , we have soldiers overseas now who are getting shot at by real bullets from real enemies who really want to kill them .
“ Getting shot at by snipers is not something you forget – or make light of , ” he added .
“ If getting shot at by sniper fire qualifies you to be president , then there are thousands of guys in the military right now who are way more qualified than Hillary Clinton to be our next president . ”
Clinton insisted yesterday she “ misspoke ” for the first time in a dozen years when describing the trip in a recent speech .
But Obama ’s camp immediately sent out three additional instances where Clinton made claims of dangers faced during her Bosnia visit that have been contradicted by videos of a tranquil arrival ceremony for her goodwill mission .
Clinton yesterday tried to backpedal .
“ The military took great care of us , ” she told Pittsburgh ’s KDKA radio station .
“ I have written about it in my book and talked about it on many other occasions and last week , you know , for the first time in 12 or so years , I misspoke . ”
Maj . Gen. William Nash , the commander of US troops in Bosnia , told The Washington Post he was unaware of any security threat to Clinton during her eight - hour stay in Tuzla .
During an Iraq speech last Monday , Clinton ’s version of the trip sounded more like a Sylvester Stallone thriller : “ I remember landing under sniper fire .
There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead , we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base . ”
In December , campaigning in Dubuque , Iowa , Clinton said , “ We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire .
I do n’t remember anybody offering me tea on the tarmac when that was happening . ”
Video taken by CBS News on the trip reveals a quaint greeting ceremony with a local schoolgirl who read a poem to Clinton , along with a group of other children .
“ It goes without saying that they do n’t arrange a ceremony with little girls , with bouquets and poems and stuff , if there ’s a serious risk of taking sniper fire said , ex-Sgt .
Peter Cachion , who served in Bosnia .
Comedian Sinbad , who was also on the trip , told The Washington Post his biggest worry was where he was going to get his next meal .

COMPLETE ELECTION 2008 COVERAGE
EDITORIAL : The Phantom Sniper
OPINION : Hill ’s Little Lies
American ’s love TV , thats science , do n’t argue .
They love it so much that they want to “ upgrade ” it all the time .
Not content with normal TV , the want to upgrade to HIGH DEF ( yo ! ) , or DIGITAL 1080i ( man ! ) , or they want PLASMA ( dude ! ) , or WIDE SCREEN ( wow ! ) , or WHATEVER ( yeah ! ) .
Then someone got the good idea that the analog signal just was n’t good enough for TV what it needs is a shot of 1s and 0s .
So in a couple months a million perfectly good televisions will suddenly become useless because they will not be able to pick up a digital signal .
The Plague of Zombie TVs is born .
I imagine the millions of dead TVs will rise from the landfills and stalk the earth looking for brains to eat as undead zombie TVs ( which is pretty much what they did while they were alive ) .
However our good “ friends ” at the Consumer Electronics Association ( never trust an organization that calls you a consumer ) say we need not fear a mass of undead electronics that feel no pain and hunger only for your delicious , tasty , brains .
According to a new study released today by the Consumer Electronics Association ( CEA ) , called ‘ Trends in Consumer Electronics ( CE ) Afterlife ’
( See they are talking about Zombies ! ) show that households receiving broadcast signals only over - the - air ( OTA ) expect to remove fewer than 15 million televisions from their homes through 2010 , ninety - five percent of which will be sold , donated or recycled .
Most OTA - only households expect to buy a digital converter box ( 48 % ) and continue using the same TV .
The sad fact behind this one is that this means that 15 MILLION new TVs will be created .
Which means 15 MILLION more TV ’s worth of heavy metals , water pollution , slave sweatshop labor , etc .
“ Consumers are far more likely to recycle , reuse , give away or sell analog TVs than throw them away ” says CEAâ€™s Senior Director of Market Research Tim Herbert .
“ While some have speculated that millions of TVs would enter the waste stream , this new study suggests that is not the case ”
He went on to say that the only way to kill a zombie was to smash its brains in and under no circumstance should you light them on fire .
The crowd responded “ duh , everyone knows that a zombie lit on fire is now an insatiable eating machine , that is ON FIRE ! ”
Recycling is an increasingly common way to dispose of unused TVs .
In fact , according to the survey , consumers report recycling nearly 30 percent more TVs in 2007 than in 2005 .
That trend also extends to other CE categories .
While only three percent more devices were removed from homes in 2007 , twenty - seven percent more devices were recycled .
At the same time , the number of CE products that end up in the trash is decreasing - down 7 percent from two years earlier .
“ We see a very positive trend developing when it comes to CE afterlife ” notes Herbert .
“ A full 87 percent of consumers say itâ€™s important to recycle their CE devices .
Not only is traditional recycling an increasingly popular option for consumers , but the vast majority of consumers report that they give away or sell unused devices , which is also a form of recycling ”
Among those consumers that did report throwing away a TV in the last year , 42 percent reported that they werenâ€™t aware of recycling programs for electronics .
Let us pray they know how to use a shotgun .
“ Itâ€™s terrific to see more consumers being more thoughtful and proactive about the responsible disposal of their electronics devices ” added Herbert .
“ However , there is still much to be done in terms of educating consumers about the options for electronics recycling ”
He went on to mention that everyone should have a zombie preparedness kit , lots of ammo , nails , hammers , and plenty of wood to board up the windows .
He also made an extra effort to stress that once grandma gets bitten it is only a matter of time before she rises from the dead and tries to kill you , and that the best option is to “ deal with her ” before this happens .
CEAâ€™s consumer website , www.myGreenElectronics.org educates consumers about the responsible use , reuse and recycling of electronics and also includes a zip - code searchable database of electronics recyclers .
Do n’t let your television end up in the landfill , you would n’t want to be responsible for the TV zombie apocalypses , would you ?!
Child Abuse in the Name of Protecting Children :
Two snippets from the FLDS " child protection " case in Texas , in which 437 children have been forcibly removed from parental care while the state investigations allegations that adolescent girls were sexually abused by being coerced or " brainwashed " into " marriages " ( religiously but not legally recognized ) with much older men .
( The raid was apparently prompted by a bogus call to CPS ) : ( 1 ) " Children under 12 months will be placed in foster homes with siblings who are under 5 , she said , and every attempt will be made to place [ other ] siblings together .
Boys 8 and older are going to Cal Farley 's Boys Ranch northwest of Amarillo , where 27 adolescent boys already have been staying . " ( 2 )
The Texas judge overseeing the polygamous FLDS sect 's case refused Monday to make any ruling that would allow breast - feeding mothers to remain with their children in state custody .... Attorneys for the women asked the judge to consider letting nursing mothers remain with their children after negotiations with CPS on the issue stalled .
They asked the judge to let the mothers stay until DNA results are in , likely to take up to 40 days .
Walther acknowledged the nutritional and bonding benefits of breast - feeding .
" But every day in this country , we have mothers who go back to work after six weeks of maternity leave , " she said .
" The court has made a determination that the environment those children were in was not safe , " said Walther , adding that there is a shortage of suitable placements for infants in Texas .
Yep , having your mom go to work 8 hours a day is just like having no maternal contact at all and being placed in a foster home .
It 's time for a nationally prominent civil liberties attorney to get involved .
UPDATE : And , courtesy of a VC commenter , a stinging op - ed from the Dallas Morning News :
File under Straws : clutching at .
Not content with trying to make the internet service providers police copyrighted content moving across their networks , NBC Universal now wants iTunes to include anti-piracy tools which would apply not just to music from the iTunes Store but all media in your library , including music you have ripped yourself .
While NBC's George Kliavkoff did n't name iTunes or the iPod , do you think the highlighted parts of his statement could refer to anything else ?
If you look at studies about MP3 players , especially leading MP3 players and what portion of that content is pirated , and think about how that content gets onto that device , it has to go through a gatekeeping piece of software , which would be a convenient place to put some antipiracy measures .
This is part of NBC 's plan to get its TV shows back on iTunes so it can sell more than two or three downloads a month .
The sticking points are the same – NBC wants to control the pricing – but this looks like a new " negotiation " tactic :
By implying that iTunes is a tool for piracy , Kliavkoff thinks he can strong - arm Apple into backing down .
Let 's think for a moment what would happen if Apple actually did police the content on your computer .
Nobody would use iTunes .
Not only would NBC lose a marketplace , but Apple would lose the link that makes buying an iPod worthwhile : the ease of buying and managing content before transferring it to the player .
Look at the fuss created when Apple put the Mini -Store into iTunes , which was just a music recommendation engine like Last. fm .
In short , Apple would never agree to snooping content .
Pirated music and music ripped legitimately from CDs is the majority of most music libraries .
If Apple started dickering with this , then the iTunes Store would become irrelevant because people would n't be using iTunes at all .
Kliavkoff surely knows this and it's hard to see what he hopes to achieve .
His arguments seem particularly desperate in the light of two other comments he made :
It 's really difficult for us to work with any distribution partner who says ' Here 's the wholesale price and the retail price , ' especially when the price does n't reflect the full value of the product .
And
The music industry guys would have something to say about how the pricing has affected their product over the last few years .
One word : BitTorrent .
NBC , along with the " music industry guys " , is competing with free .
Free music , free movies and free TV shows .
ITunes is about the only legal way to get this stuff easily .
Instead of worrying that " the price does n't reflect the full value of the product " , you should be thankful that there are still people willing to pay for your DRM encrusted crap .

Boone Pickens , famed oil tycoon and philanthropist , founder of BP Capital , takes part in the " The Future of Energy Prices " panel discussion during the 10th Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills , California April 24 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Crude oil prices are still headed upward and could top $ 125 a barrel in the near - term , legendary oil investor T. Boone Pickens said on Thursday .
“ It will go up , ” said Pickens , who heads the BP Capital hedge fund with over $ 4 billion under management .
“ Oil is moving to a substantially higher level -- say above $ 125 a barrel . ”
U.S. crude futures hit a record $ 115.54 on Thursday .
Oil prices have more than quintupled since 2002 , propelled higher by soaring demand from emerging economies like China alongside slow increases in global production capacity .
Despite new production from the Canadian oil sands and elsewhere , Pickens said global crude oil production is unlikely to rise above its current rate of about 85 million barrels per day , while global demand will likely hit 87 million bpd in the third quarter of 2008 .
Pickens also expects U.S. natural gas prices to rise from current levels near $ 10 per million British thermal units to $ 12 - $ 14 this upcoming winter .
Pickens , in Washington on Thursday to deliver a speech about energy at Georgetown University , made more than $ 1 billion in 2006 by betting on rising oil prices .
Pickens ’ hedge fund lost over 20 percent in the first three months of 2008 on a bet that oil prices would fall .
Pickens said his fund is now looking for oil and natural gas prices to rise .
“ The position is long , not short , ” he told reporters .
“ I covered the short position - it was a mistake on my part . ”
Sen . Nelson : Create system of regional primaries , abolish Electoral College Muriel Kane
Published : Friday March 28 , 2008

Print This Email This Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) appeared on CNN to slam both the Democratic Party nominating process and the Electoral College .
Nelson said he would like to abolish the Electoral College entirely , because " people are increasingly dissatisfied when you can have the most votes for president and the other candidate ... ends up being elected , as last happened in the year 2000 . "
He is also proposing to do away with the current presidential nominating procedures in favor of six large regional primaries , which would be held between March and June of every presidential election year in an order to be determined by drawing lots .
CBS 's John Roberts did not comment on the merits of Nelson 's proposal , but merely noted that " Iowa and New Hampshire are going to scream bloody murder . "
" Of course they 're going to kick up and scream , " Nelson replied , " but those states are not representative of America as a whole and why should they have an outsized influence ? "
Nelson , a supporter of Hillary Clinton , also expressed frustration over the disenfranchisement of Florida and Michigan primary voters as a result of those states ' violations of party guidelines .
He sued the Democratic Party on behalf of his state last fall , but that suit was denied .
Last month , he predicted a " train wreck " at the Democratic National Convention if the issue is not resolved .
Nelson 's latest suggestion is that the Florida delegates be seated but only counted as half a vote .

Transcript via closed captions :: 15 minutes after the hour on a friday morning .
we 're back with the most politics in the morning .
is our current electoral system broken ?
our next guest says we need a complete overhall .
his state , florida , has no part in this year 's democratic primary process since they broke rules by holding its primary too early and was stripped of its delegates .
joining me is democratic senator bill nelson .
good morning to you . :: good morning . :: do you believe the system is broken and why do you think it is ? :: if ever we 've had had an example of a mess , it 's this one .
and i do n't think there 's anybody in america that is satisfied with this presidential nominating process . :: oh , i do n't know .
i think john mccain is pretty happy with it . :: well , i'm talking about on the democratic side . :: oh , okay . :: but when you get around to the november election , you know , people are increasingly dis dissatisfied when you can have the most votes for president and the other candidate who gets less votes in the country ends up being elected , as last happened in the year 2000 .
it 's happened a few times in our history .
so we ought to abillionish the electoral college well as well . :: let 's take a look at your entire proposal here .
first of all , in terms of choosing a nominee for the democratic primary , you 're suggesting rotating regional primaries instead of the system we 're going through right now .
then in terms of electing a president , abol issue the electoral college to allow the president to be voted by popular vote and allow early voting .
let 's go back to the first point .
how would the system of rotating primaries work ? :: well , it replaces the primaries and caucuses that go now , and if it keeps going like it is , they keep jumping each other , the first one will be at halloween .
so let 's have a system of rational primaries that start in march and go through june of the presidential year .
let 's group up states according to lots drawing one through six where you have a combination of small states and big states all on one particular date , and let 's do that six times from march june .
and then you 've got a little bit of order out of the chaos that we have now . :: so you know what 's going to happen .
iowa and new hampshire are going to scream bloody murder about this whole thing , particularly since , you know , every four years their economy gets a tremendous boost from the amount of advertising , the amount of money that comes into those two states because of these primaries .
what do you say to iowa and new hampshire ? :: of course they 're going to kick up and scream .
but those states are not representative of america as a whole .
and why should they have an outsized influence into determining who 's going to be the presidential nominee ?
so that 's what senator levin of michigan and i are saying .
let 's combine small states , large states , drawn by lot , on the order of one through six , and let 's give a more representative sampling of america to term who 's going to be our nominee . :: senator , why is it so much worse this year than in others ?
and are you concerned that the democratic party could implode over this whole thing and basically you 'll hand john mccain the general election ? :: the answer is , because it 's even steven .
a nominee had n't been determined early on like the gop with john mccain .
as a result , you 've got all of these party rules getting into the way of voters ' rights .
i'm speaking of michigan and florida .
and there 's no end in sight .
we can't get a compromise .
i've been trying since last summer to get the dnc to work it out so that they would not be denying the vote to almost two million florida democrats that came out and voted .
and , yet , we are where we are because we can't get agreement between the candidates because each of the candidates feel that this offer of compromise is to their advantage or disadvantage , and the other one feels the other way .
so we can't get agreement . :: your latest proposal for a compromise in the florida situation is to seat all of .
delegates at the convention in denver in august and allow them a half a vote based on the results of the florida primary .
but people say because you are a hillary clinton supporter , you can 'ten an honest broker in any plan here .
what do you say ? :: well , somebody 's got to solve this thing .
i've talked to barack and hillary and the chairman howard dean about this .
basically , you 'd go back to what the dnc rules say , and they say if a state moves early , they 're going to be penalized half their votes .
that 's what the republican rules said as well , and that 's what the republicans did .
so i'm saying , well , penalize florida half its votes and let 's move on .
and because at the end the day , john , if the democratic party disses and stiff - arms florida , how do you think floridaians are going to feel come the november election ? :: you think they 'll sit out ? :: well , already we 're seeing in the polls that 20 % of independents in florida are saying they 're less likely to vote for the nominee because of the way they 've been treated . :: and we 've also got polls that show that 16 % of both barack obama and clinton supporters would sit out if their choice does n't become the nominee .
senator nelson , we 'll put what you said to howard dean in an hour .
thank gz for being with us . :: thanks . :: so we want to know what you think .
we 'll be asking this question all morning -- should the electoral college be scrapped in choosing a president ?
presidents elected by a national popular vote nationwide instead ?
yes or no , cast your vote at cnn.com
Phobos from 6,800 Kilometers ( Color )
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took two images of the larger of Mars ' two moons , Phobos , within 10 minutes of each other on March 23 , 2008 .
This is the first , taken from a distance of about 6,800 kilometers ( about 4,200 miles ) .
It is presented in color by combining data from the camera 's blue - green , red , and near - infrared channels .
The illuminated part of Phobos seen in the images is about 21 kilometers ( 13 miles ) across .
The most prominent feature in the images is the large crater Stickney in the lower right .
With a diameter of 9 kilometers ( 5.6 miles ) , it is the largest feature on Phobos .
The color data accentuate details not apparent in black - and - white images .
For example , materials near the rim of Stickney appear bluer than the rest of Phobos .
Based on analogy with materials on our own moon , this could mean this surface is fresher , and therefore younger , than other parts of Phobos .
A series of troughs and crater chains is obvious on other parts of the moon .
Although many appear radial to Stickney in this image , recent studies from the European Space Agency 's Mars Express orbiter indicate that they are not related to Stickney .
Instead , they may have formed when material ejected from impacts on Mars later collided with Phobos .
The lineated textures on the walls of Stickney and other large craters are landslides formed from materials falling into the crater interiors in the weak Phobos gravity ( less than one one - thousandth of the gravity on Earth ) .
In the full - resolution version of this image , a pixel encompasses 6.8 meters ( 22 feet ) , providing a resolution ( smallest visible feature ) of about 20 meters ( about 65 feet ) .
The image is in the HiRISE catalog as PSP_007769_9010 .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Lockheed Martin Space Systems , Denver , is the prime contractor for the project and built the spacecraft .
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment is operated by the University of Arizona , Tucson , and the instrument was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. , Boulder , Colo .

I can remember when I first saw them , pulsating and drifting through space .
They made my hair stand on its end .
I watched as dozens of them swarmed in the television pictures coming from NASA 's STS75 mission in December of 1996 .
The broken tether appears as a pencil shaped object surrounded by a swarm of white blobs .
Are these " space debris " or possibly some form of life ?
The target of NASA 's untraviolet cameras was supposed to be a 12 mile long tether used to tow a 100 million dollar satellite [ Right ] in an experiment that went wrong .
The cable , made from copper , teflon and carbon fibers had snapped and separated from the space vehicle and was slowly drifting away .
Examination of the cable shows that it actually melted from over 35,000 watts of electrical energy that was generated by its travel through the Earth 's magnetosphere .
The experiment was to determine if tethers could be a reliable source of electrical energy , instead of batteries or generators , for the space station , satellites and other orbital missions .
The results appear to show that more energy than anticipated was generated .
NASA is now seeking a stronger material to carry this higher electrical load .
But it was what happened after the accident that was significant .
As the tether separated and drifted behind the shuttle craft , it elongated .
Mission control instructed astronaut Franklin to take a picture of it with the onboard infrared camera .
As he focused and zoomed in on the broken tether the image was projected on huge screens in Houston .
Engineers could n't believe what they were seeing .
If the plate - like objects pass behind the 12 mile long tether , which is itself more than 80 nautical miles from the space vehicle , the estimated size must then be about 2 - 3 miles in diameter !
" What are we looking at ? " the anxious voice of Houston Control inquires of astronaut Franklin Chang - Diaz .
On the television screen there was a white line , the extended tether , surrounded by an ever increasing number of fuzzy , circular shapes .
Some were small but others were huge .
The large ones afforded a better assessment of the shape and revealed a hole in the center and a " notch , " sometimes two , on the peripheral egde .
This notch seems to appear in different locations on different shapes , eliminating the possibility of a video lens or camera iris artifact .
Astronaut Franklin : " You guys getting the image ? "
Houston Control : " Franklin we see a long line , a couple of star - like things and a lot of things swimming in the foreground .
Can you describe what you 're seeing ? "
Astronaut Franklin : " Well the long line is the tether and , uh , there 's a little bit of debris that kind of flies with us and , uh , it 's illuminated by the Sun at such a low angle so there 's a lot of stray light and it 's getting washed out quickly ... "
All the time , white blobs , resembling swimming sperm , surround the tether .
They seem to come from all directions , speed up and then slow down .
Occasionally some large shapes slowly drift in to the frame and are eclipsed by the tether .
This indicates to many observers that they are behind the tether , meaning that they must have been huge .
The tether , at this point is almost 80 miles away but , knowing its size and width , the approximate size of the largest floating shapes could be measures in miles , not feet .
The shapes seem to pulsate as they move .
Some have described the movement as a contraction or winding motion which alternatively unwinds and releases .
The hole in the center often can be seen expanding and contracting slightly .
In short , these do not seem to be vehicles or artifacts , but rather living things !
Similar shapes have been photographed closer to the ground .
The images above were cpatured in the United Kingdom using an infrared camera .
Note the similarity to the NASA images with the central hole and the peripheral " notch . "
Critics of the " alien " assessment point out that all of the objects seem to be positioned too perfectly for the camera .
If the hole suggests that the objects are flat or plate - like , why do we never see them edge on ?
They claim that this must prove that the shapes are , in fact , ice crystals or some other minute debris that is closer to the camera and so out of focus .
Certainly this phenomenon is well known and has happened to almost everyone at some time when taking pictures , especially in the snow or in a dusty room .
But the video clearly shows these objects moving at variable speeds , sometimes stopping and changing direction .
Critics have yet to explain how space debris could do this .
In the past decade we have seen life existing at the depths of our oceans , thriving in unimained pressure and temperatures .
We have seen it thriving under miles of the Earth 's crust and under freezing glaciers in Antarctica .
It is not impossible to imagine forms of life that can exist in a vacuum , possibly thriving on radiation and other sources of energy that we know little about .
Called " sky critters " by some researchers , mysterious blobs have appeared throughout history without a satisfactory explanation .

Center and Right : Images shot with night vision cameras and infrared film .
Here 's a good link : NASA 's Tether Video .
What do YOU think ?
-- MORE --
Same shapes found on the Moon !
I watched the video on YouTube a couple of times .
I agree they certainly do look like they are alive , or maybe directed by some kind of intelligence .
They zoom towards the tether thing and then quickly stop or slow to a drift as if they 're checking it out .
I do n't know though , maybe they could be some kind of machine or vehicle .
Just because they pulse does n't mean they have to be alive .
A machine could do that also .
Richard G .
The official line given by NASA is that these are ice crystals .
That 's what they always call them so who knows .
I wonder if the astronauts have made any comments about this one way or another ?
Matt S .
I think the astronauts are suppose to not talk about things that happen .
I also read that these things can change shape , appear and disappear pretty quickly and they are only visible when you look at them in ultraviolet or something like that .
G.C .
Why does the tether look so wide ?
If it 's 12 miles long and looking that wide , then the object perhaps are way more tiny too , but just looking very wide .

Phorm is a web tracking technology
BT defends itself Trials of an online ad system carried out by BT involving more than 30,000 of its customers were potentially illegal , says a leading digital rights lawyer .
BT has said it trialled a prototype of Phorm , which matches adverts to users ' web habits , in 2006 and 2007 .
The company did not inform customers that they were part of the trial .
Nicholas Bohm , of the Foundation for Information Policy Research , said tests without the knowledge of users were " an illegal intercept of users ' data " .
A spokesman for BT said the firm had no comment about the legality or illegality of the 2006 test .
In a statement the firm said the trial was " a small scale technical test of a prototype advertising platform " .
" The purpose of the test was to evaluate the functional and technical performance of the platform . "
' Robust and fit '
It continued : " It is important for BT to ensure that before any new technologies are deployed , they are robust and fit for purpose .
No personally identifiable information was processed , stored or disclosed during this test . "
Earlier this month BT told BBC News that before the 2007 test it had taken " legal and other external advice ... and on the basis of that advice commenced the small scale technical test in good faith " .
Eighteen thousand customers were involved in the 2006 trial and BBC News understands that the 2007 test was on a similar scale .
Virgin Media and Talk Talk are also due to deploy the technology and there is no suggestion that the two companies have trialled the system in the past .
The Foundation for Information Policy Research has written to the Information Commissioner to argue that Phorm contravenes the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ( Ripa ) , which protects users from unlawful interception of information .
Phorm and BT have said the technology does not breach any UK laws .
Following advice from the Home Office , both companies have said the technology complies with UK law as customers have to give informed consent to use the technology .
BT has said that customers will be issued with amended terms and conditions before any eventual roll out of the technology .
A planned third test of the system will take place next month .
The company will be approaching 10,000 customers asking them to take part .
This was highly intrusive and highly objectionable
Nicholas Bohm , Fipr Mr Bohm told BBC
News : " If the customers in 2006 and 2007 were n't invited to do anything and it was completely surreptitious , and assuming that BT and Phorm trialled a version of what they are planning to launch later this year , then it was a massive scale illegal interception .
" They could n't at that stage have had any guidance from the Home Office , or had anything in writing , as nothing was issued until January this year . "
He added : " This was highly intrusive and highly objectionable to set up a profiling system based on their customers online activities , especially since the customers knew nothing about it . "
Fipr has argued that Phorm must not only seek the consent of web users but also of website operators for the technology to be legal .
Phorm 's system works by " trawling " websites visited by users and then matches keywords from the content of the page to a profile .
Users are then targeted with adverts that are more tailored to their interests on websites that have signed up to Phorm 's technology .
Phorm has said its technology will improve the internet experience for users as they will receive more relevant adverts .
The company also believes its technology will boost the finances of websites because adverts will reach more targetted audiences .

What are these ?
The Concept That Changed Our Financial Life
Update # 2 : I posted a follow up on this article for a reader question .
That article included more images to help everyone understand what is going on .
Update : Hello , Reddit !
If there is nothing else I can share with you on this blog , let it be this : keep a one month income buffer .
This has been the key to our budgeting success .
( We are no longer living paycheck to paycheck thanks to this system ! )
This concept is so important , I fear I will explain it incorrectly .
Please do n’t hesitate to comment with questions or concerns .
Again , I honestly think this is the most important thing I can offer to you .
Here ’s how it works : do n’t spend the money you earn this month .
You are going to spend it next month based on your monthly budget .
That means you should be living this month on last month ’s income .
It sounds confusing , but it really is n’t .
I think it is a simple system if you can get your head around it .
How about an example ?
A Simple Example
You earn $ 3,000 after - tax every month .
Your direct deposit is sent twice per month on the 14th and 28th .
You have three expenses : rent ( $ 800 ) , food ( $ 300 ) , and utilities ( $ 200 ) .
Rent is a fixed cost — it should n’t change until your lease runs out .
Food and utilities are variable — they change each month .
Some months you eat out more , some you cook more .
Some months of the year it is cold and you use the heat more , other you are using very little heat .
On average , your expenses total $ 1,300 .
This leaves you $ 1,700 to do with as you please , preferably savings .
Now your typical person will take the money they receive on the 30th of the previous month to pay the next two weeks worth of expenses .
Then when the check comes in on the 15th , it pays for the next two weeks of expenses .
If you used 100 % of the money every two weeks , you would n’t have any savings .
Doing this is called living paycheck to paycheck .
That is , if your paycheck does n’t arrive in two weeks , you ca n’t pay your expenses .
Bad news .
What We Do
We take all of the money in month one , say March , and leave it in our checking account .
It ’s in the account , but we do n’t touch it .
Every time we get paid in March , we simply put the money aside and hold onto it .
At the end of the month our budgeted amounts for food , utilities , and the like should be pretty low .
That ’s okay , it ’s the end of the month .
Hopefully we are n’t in the red , either ( for the budgeted categories , not for our checking account in general ) .
Remember , we ’ve got all of March ’s earnings sitting in the account waiting to be utilized for April .
Using the above example , this is how it might look :
March 1 : Just getting started Total in checking : $ 1,300 ( $ 1,300 budgeted for March , $ 0 earnings from March )
Just getting started March 8 : Buy groceries for $ 50 , pay electric bill of $ 100 .
Total in checking : $ 1,150 ( $ 1,150 left for March , $ 0 in paychecks from March )
Buy groceries for $ 50 , pay electric bill of $ 100 .
March 14 : Get paid $ 1,500 ; buy groceries for $ 50 Total in checking : $ 2,600 ( $ 1,100 left for March , $ 1,500 in paychecks from March )
Get paid $ 1,500 ; buy groceries for $ 50 March 16 : Pay gas utility bill $ 100 Total in checking : $ 2,500 ( $ 1,000 left for March , $ 1,500 in paychecks from March )
Pay gas utility bill $ 100 March 21 : Pay rent $ 800 , buy groceries $ 100 Total in checking : $ 1,600 ( $ 100 left for March , $ 1,500 in paychecks from March )
At this point we are getting pretty low on our budgeted money for March .
Hopefully we do n’t have too much more expense to incur as we do n’t want to dip into our paycheck money if we can keep from it .
Pay rent $ 800 , buy groceries $ 100 March 28 : Get paid $ 1,500 , buy groceries $ 100 Total in checking : $ 3,000 ( $ 0 left for March , $ 3,000 in paychecks from March )
Get paid $ 1,500 , buy groceries $ 100 March 31 :
We do n’t spend any more money this month .
We now re-allocate our paycheck money for April ’s expenses .
Total in checking : $ 3,000 ( $ 0 left for March , $ 1,300 budgeted for April , $ 1,700 left from paychecks in March that should be moved to savings )
We do n’t spend any more money this month .
We now re-allocate our paycheck money for April ’s expenses .
Note that every time you spend money in March , it does n’t affect the money you ’ve earned in March .
It only affects what you ’ve budgeted for March .
Now rinse and repeat for April .
Save your paychecks in April , and live off of your $ 1,300 budgeted for the month .
Any excess at the end of the month ( hopefully near $ 1,700 or so ) goes towards savings .
I hope all of that made sense .
Essentially , you are setting aside your budget at the beginning of the month and only using that money for that month .
The money you earn during the month goes towards next month .
Above all other things , this concept has helped us move towards financial freedom .
It Takes Time
I ’m not saying it is easy to get to this point .
If you are currently living paycheck to paycheck you may not have a lot of wiggle room .
If your monthly expenses are $ 1,300 and you only have $ 25 left to your name at the end of every two weeks ( $ 50 / month ) , you have an uphill battle to climb .
If you do n’t make any other changes to your life , it is going to take you 26 months to save up a one month buffer .
Even if it took you that long , it ’s worth it .
You might consider cutting your expenses or increasing your income to speed up your process .
Of course , if you had $ 1,700 left at the end of every month then you can try this next month .
Flexibility
Living on last month ’s income gives you some flexibility in your finances .
If you spend $ 350 on groceries this month ( versus a budgeted $ 300 ) , your checking account does n’t go into the red .
If your utilities bill were slightly higher than expected , you are n’t having to choose which one to pay first .
That overage can be covered by your excess money , and perhaps you adjust your budget for the next month .
Again , there has been nothing , nothing , more crucial to our success in managing our finances than this concept .
Stop living paycheck to paycheck .
Stop trying to time when you pay your bills .
Live off last month ’s income this month .
Try it one month , and I think you ’ll be convinced .
We absolutely love it .

To answer a question from a comment on how I came up with the numbers — I made them up .
“ Why did n’t you include a car payment , or this , or that ? ”
It makes the example extremely complicated very quickly .
Having a handful of expenses simplifies things .
I do understand that you probably have 10 - 20 different expenses you need to track .
I feel so much better mentally after the experience .
Last week was my first ever triathlon ( Cornwall Sprint Triathlon ) .
I have n’t really swam with any real technique or focus until 2 months ago .
Before that I swam with my face out of the water and just swam to get around the pool / lake .
I thought after all of the practice that I had put in I was ready for the swim portion of the triathlon .
I was wrong , lol .
I ended up having to hang onto a kayak for a bit to catch my breath .
Positives were that I was able to finish strong and got out of the water in 17 minutes ( 750 meters ) .
The last 300 metres I was back to swimming like I had been practicing and was actually passing people again .
Fast forward to yesterday .
I wanted to swim to an island across our lake that is over a km away from our dock .
It was one of the greatest experiences that I ’ve ever had .
I was able to get in a rhythm and just felt right in a zone .
I ended up doing the swim to the island and back in under an hour ( 2.5 km ’s ) .
It was an awesome learning experience .
When I finished I was at the dock with my sister and she could n’t get over how I was n’t out of breath .
I feel so much better mentally after the experience .
I feel as though I have the ability to swim really quickly over long distances .
Thank you for all of the help in getting me able to face the challenge of swimming and befriending the water .

Mark Boyle : " We need to get back to a more communal way of living "
Equipped with only a few T - shirts , a bandage and spare sandals , former dotcom businessman Mark Boyle is set to cross Europe and the Middle East .
On his 9,000 - mile trek to Gandhi 's birthplace , he will have to pick his way through war - ravaged Afghanistan .
Mr Boyle , 28 , said : " I will be offering my skills to people .
If I get food in return , it 's a bonus "
He says he is part of the freeconomy movement - a group which began in the US and aims to bring about a moneyless society .
He said : " My interest started five or six years ago when I was studying economics .
" The more we accumulate wealth , the more it leads to a breakdown of community . "
We need to get back to a more communal way of living
Mark Boyle
Mr Boyle aims to walk between 15 and 45 miles a day , with the goal of getting to Porbandar on India 's west coast .
He plans not to touch any money and is taking no credit cards or travellers ' cheques .
Travelling light , his rucksack contains just t- shirts , sandals , sunscreen , a knife and a bandage .
" We need to get back to a more communal way of living , " he said .
" My mum and dad always speak about a time in Ireland when people came together and took in the harvest together , and no money changed hands . "
Asked about how he would manage without money , Mr Boyle said : " I 've got a lot of faith in humanity .
FREECONOMY
Freeconomy now has almost 3,000 members in 54 countries
It offers people the chance to exchange skills and labour Ultimately , members would like a moneyless society
They also want to see more face - to - face communication
" My friends are really supportive .
I 'm very lucky .
My mum was very supportive but was getting very worried . "
Although he will walk nearly all the way , Mr Boyle has even hatched a plan for when he is forced to cross water - he will explain his mission to ferry staff .
He added : " If that does n't work , I will simply try again and again .
" If I 've got to spend two and a half years to show one person the conviction of what I 'm doing , then it's two and a half years well spent . "
Mr Boyle plans to give anyone he meets a password , which they can use to enter his website and upload details of his journey .
Inside Out West will be following the walk in its new series on BBC One from 22 February .
Strong faith in God is by itself no recipe for fidelity with a spouse .
Close to the Almighty ?
You may not have a prayer .
Just go to church , or synagogue , mosque or temple .
That could keep you faithful on more than one level , a new study suggests .
Attendance at religious services is the only faith - related activity that predicts improved chances of fidelity in marriage , according to the research .
Other factors , including prayer , were found to have no unique bearing , statistically , on whether couples fooled around on each other .
In fact , those who said religion was very important to them but who did n't get to church often were more likely than others in the study to have had an affair .
Survey participants who rarely if ever attend services were about four times more likely to have had an affair compared to those who attend services with great frequency .
What 's going on ?
Attending services perhaps means that an individual is hearing religious teaching on marital fidelity and the general importance of marriage , the researchers suggest .
The assumption is they 're more likely to practice what 's been preached .
But the researchers also figure that attendance implies a shared commitment by spouses and a strong network of social support .
" Individuals often marry other people who are similar to them in a variety of ways , including religiousness , " explained researcher David C. Atkins of the Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena , Calif .
" We think that sharing similar values , incorporating values and practice into one 's marriage and family , and being part of a worshipping community all may be a part of this finding between religious attendance and infidelity , " Atkins told LiveScience .
" Prayer , belief in God , strong faith etc. in the absence of attendance does not show this same relationship . "
Atkins and Fuller colleague Deborah E. Kessel detail their findings in the May 2008 issue of the Journal of Marriage and Family .
The religion factor
In one past survey , 23 percent of men and 12 percent of women reported having an affair at some point in their marriages , Atkins and Kessel note , adding that previous studies have consistently suggested that more religious individuals are less likely to have had affairs compared to the less religious .
( Sex surveys are thought to be frequently skewed , however , because people lie about the topic . )
The researchers sought to learn what aspects of religion might predict fidelity .
The study was based on a review of data from the 1998 General Social Survey ( GSS ) conducted by the National Opinion Research Center .
The surveys consisted of face - to - face interviews with questions related to religion and spirituality .
The new study " calls into question the idea that beliefs without behavior may serve a protective factor with infidelity , " Atkins and Kessel conclude .
As an aside , money , or lack of it , can also suggest infidelity , the study found .
Those earning between $ 40,000 and $ 60,000 a year were the least likely to report having an affair .
And people previously divorced were 2.5 times more likely to report an affair in their new marriages .
Not so long ago I went to the best party in years .
The guests brought wine or beer .
The hosts provided the makings for Chinese dumplings .
And everyone did the work assembling them .
I walked into a kitchen full of mostly strangers and left having enjoyed a good conversation with nearly every one of them .
Clearly , there are icebreakers , and then there are dumplings .
Trying to stuff three different fillings into two types of dough and get the pleats right made everyone bond big - time .
The hostess , whose skills are seemingly genetic , taught the first arrivals how much pork or vegetables or shrimp to mound into each wrapper , and how to seal it , and the lesson was passed along as more guests turned up , bottles in hand .
Over the course of the afternoon we filled nearly 300 dumplings .
And then we got to eat .
As soon as the sensational pot sticker - style dumplings were off the stove , we dunked them in a well - spiced dipping sauce and slurped them up as we stood around and kept talking .
Nothing more was really needed for refreshments , but the hosts had bought scallion pancakes from a Chinese grocery to nibble while we wrapped , and they handed out quirky Chinese candies as sweets to finish .

Now I ’m convinced dumplings are one of those productions -- like tamales -- that are most fun to tackle in a group , with many hands making tedious tasks go faster .
You could assemble them all in advance all by yourself , but division of labor can actually ramp up the festivities .
Luckily , dumplings are so forgiving that even those made by the klutziest guest will cook up fine and taste great .
The experience is even easier to repeat if you take a few shortcuts .
Our hostess made some of the dumpling skins from scratch , with amazingly silky results , but even she was not prepared to roll out and cut 300 .
If she saw no stigma to store - bought , neither should you .
Having grown up boiling dumplings , she also was far more adept at that tricky technique than a novice would be .
Her method involved bringing the cooking water to a boil no fewer than three times .
Steaming and pan-frying are much simpler , although you sacrifice the rich and flavorful broth created by boiling that our hostess served at the end .
For the fillings , pork bound with Napa cabbage , flecked with mushrooms and seasoned with garlic and ginger is classic .
( The meat , I learned , should not be too lean nor ground too fine . )

Our chief cook added minced shrimp to about a third of the pork mixture to create a second filling , but for guests who are meat - averse , a better bet would be a blend of shrimp , scallops and crab , held together with an egg white but also seasoned with garlic and ginger .
And for vegetarians , a filling based on spinach and tofu is a safe option .
( Cooked eggs give it more body , but they can be omitted for even fussier eaters . )
The toughest part of making the filling is getting the ingredients evenly incorporated , especially with the pork .
It takes muscle to blend everything together ; the designated mixer should be someone who knows from the elliptical trainer .
Anyone can fill .
You need a big table to gather around , a few small bowls of water to dip into to wet the edges of the skins to seal them and baking sheets to hold the finished dumplings .
A small bit of filling is mounded in the center of each wrapper , folded into a half - moon and then pleated across the top side so that the skin pulls around the filling tightly .
Keep the drinks flowing and the work goes surprisingly fast .
When it ’s time to cook , one person should be in charge , but many can take shifts .
You need a bamboo steamer or a pot with a steamer insert and a wok or just a big skillet with a lid .
Steaming makes the dumplings silky ; pan-frying them over medium heat produces wonderfully crispy bottoms .

The dipping sauce can be made well in advance , just by mixing soy sauce , sesame oil and any seasonings you choose ( grated ginger , fish sauce , hot sauce ) .
As a whimsical dessert , I like snickerdoodles flavored with five - spice powder .
And as an appetizer , scallion pancakes are a great choice , especially made using a shortcut from “ Tom Douglas ’ Seattle Kitchen ” : flour tortillas filled with chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds , coated with egg and fried to order .
Make those in batches and guests wo n’t notice you are letting them do all the work on the dumplings .
Air Canada continues its slide into self - parody with a new optional service for fliers : for a mere $ 25 - $ 35 per trip , the airline will sell you its " On My Way " service .
What 's " On My Way " service ?
It 's a special number you can call that 's staffed with people who are n't anaesthatized , script - reading drones , in the event that the airline loses your luggage , cancels your flight , or otherwise screws you over .
This is the same airline that charges coach passengers two bucks for a " pillow " that 's actually a ziploc bag you blow up and slip into a paper doily ( business - and first - class passengers get their ziploc bags for free ) , so I guess it 's all in keeping with business as usual at Canada 's flagship air - carrier .
Air Canada said passengers who opt to pay an additional $ 25 one - way on short - haul flights and an extra $ 35 one - way on long - haul routes within North America will receive " speedy " access to " specially - trained " customer service agents who will help rebook flights on Air Canada or other airlines , as well as pay for hotel stays and meals , if necessary .
Air Canada said the program , which applies to any flight cancelled within 48 hours of the scheduled departure , goes beyond the industry practice of assisting customers affected by schedule changes deemed to be the airline 's fault , such as mechanical problems with aircraft , scheduling glitches or crew members failing to show up for flights .
But while Air Canada is touting the program as an industry - first , at least one observer said it was once common for big North American carriers to go out of their way to help inconvenienced or stranded customers – free .
Ruby 1.9 でのファイバー ( コルーチン ) の追加、および最 近 のErlangおよびアクターの人気など、あまり知られていない概念がRubyプログラミングの世界に入ってきている。並行性を考えたときにRubyの世界で何が使用可能であるかを大まかに理解するため、長年RubyコミュニティのメンバーであるMenTaLguY氏(source)に話を伺った。彼は、1.8.x
MRIでスレッド化を改善したfastthread(source)ライブラリなど、Rubyの並行性およびスレッド化に長い間関わってきた。最近では、Rubinius(サイト・英語)にも関わっており、JRubyチームのメンバーにもなっている。
InfoQ : アクターライブラリは、Rubyにどのような影響がありますか？
MenTaLguY : 私は、実際には2つのアクターライブラリを作成 ( リリース ) しました。1つは、Omnibus並行性ライブラリで、もう1つはRubinius stdlibの一部となっているものです。どちらも、Erlangによって広まった並行性モデルであるアクターモデルのRuby実装です。並行性は、コードを並行して実行するという意味では、それ程実現の難しいものではありません。難しい問題が発生するのは、制御が別の複数のスレッドで、通信することや、1つのリソースを共有することが必要となった場合です。このような通信を組み立てられるように何らかの単純な形式モデルを採用しなければ、正しいコード、または必ず意味のあるコードを作成することはほぼ不可能です。表面的には「動いている」ように見えても、実際には正常に機能しない場合もあります。
関連スポンサーコンテンツ
「 アクター」は、このような場合のためのモデルです。アクターは、メールボックスとスレッドで構成されます。アクタースレッドは、自立的に、特定の種類のメッセージがメールボックスに現れるのを待機しています。メッセージが発生すると、その種類に応じて、他のアクターにメッセージを送信するなどの動作 ( act ) をします。このように、スレッドは、自立的で明示的なメッセージ交換によって動くので、比較的簡単に想像できる方法で通信できます。
InfoQ : アクターは、Rubyのスレッド化システム、またはRubyの新しいファイバーやコルーチンにどのように関係しますか？
MenTaLguY : 私の作成したアクターライブラリは、単純に、各Rubyスレッドに1つのメールボックスを関連付け、それぞれにアクターを作成します。しかし、これがRubyでアクターを使用する際の唯一の方法というわけではありません。ファイバーは、単純に、単一のスレッド内で協調的にスケジュールされたタスクですが、これの上にアクターを置くこともできます。実際、Tony Arcieri氏は彼のRevactorライブラリ( サイト・英語)でこのようの方法を使用しています。ファイバーはフルスレッドよりも軽量であり、また割り込みを考慮する必要もないため、彼の方法にはいくつかの利点があります。ただし、フルスレッドが必要になる場合もあります
( Ruby stdlibはフルスレッドを必要とすることがあります ) 。
Tony氏と私は、設計について活発かつ生産的な議論を重ねています。計画としては、アクター実装はできる限り互換性のあるものにし、他のアクター実装も連携するために使用できる、単純なオブジェクトプロトコルを提供しようとしています。外側からは、アクターは同じものをダックタイピングすることができます。つまり、行うべきことは、どのような場合も、メッセージをメールボックスに送信することだけです。ほとんどの部分において、そのメッセージを処理しているのがスレッドであるのかファイバーであるのか、あるいは別のRuby VMで実行されているものであるのかは問題になりません。原則としてアクターのダックは、何らかの場所でErlangのプロセスに依存することも可能です ( 例えば 、Scott Fleckenstein のErlectricityを経由するなど ) 。
InfoQ : 最近、このアクターに関するコミット(source)のように、Rubiniusリポジトリのコミットをいくつか見ましたが、アクターは、Rubiniusで使用されますか？
MenTaLguY : 実装の一部としては使用されません ( これは、私がアクターをコアからstdlibに移動した理由の1つです)。私は、アクターがそのようなレベルで必要とされるとは考えていません。
InfoQ : アクターまたはそのメールボックスの実装は、最近Evan氏がRubiniusに追加したメッセージ送信マルチVM
IPC ( source ) で使用されますか ( その可能性はありますか ) ？
MenTaLguY : アクターを、マルチVM IPC メカニズムを実装するために使用することはありません。しかし、別々のVM内のアクターが相互に通信することを可能にするために、背後でマルチMVM IPCを使用することはあると思います。
InfoQ : Rubiniusのスレッド化は、現在どのような状態ですか？何が使用されますか？ユーザスペーススレッド、カーネルスレッド、あるいはm:nでの両方の組み合わせですか？
MenTaLguY : VM 内では、複数のユーザスペーススレッドを使用しますが、それぞれのVMは別々のカーネルスレッドで実行されます。現在のところ、複数のCPUがありそれをすべて使用する場合は、それぞれに1つまたは2つのVMを作成します。Evan氏は、最終的にはVMの中でm:nのスレッド化を行うことを望んでいますが、Rubyには、そのために乗り越えなければならない技術的課題が数多くあります。Ruby 1.9でも、ネイティブスレッドは制限しているため、事実上はユーザスペーススレッドになっています。
最初からネイティブスレッド化ランタイム ( XRuby 、JRuby 、IronRuby ) に基づいて構築され たRuby実装であれば、ネイティブスレッドを完全にサポートできる可能性があります。結局、ネイティブスレッドは、マルチVMが十分に軽量化できるか、CPU間の通信の方が高価になる ( このころまでには、NUMAがより普及している )
のであれば、あまり重要ではなくなります。
しかし、ネイティブスレッドを避けられない状況が1つあります。それは、IO APIが、適切に設計されていないために非同期動作をサポートしない場合です。
このような場合、複数のネイティブスレッドは必要としますが、マルチコアを活用できるわけではなく、何もすることができません。場合によっては、犠牲とするスレッドに、ブロックしている呼び出しの終了を待機させて、他のコードを問題なく処理する以外に方法がないこともあります。
今後、このよう なAPIが減っていくことを願っています。Tony氏のRevactorライブラリは、このような問題にとって希望の光となります。アクターにIOを行わせることで、コードの実行が、ブロックしている呼び出しを無駄に待機したり、制御の反転や巨大な明示的ステートマシンを用いたりするのではなく、IOイベントによって進むようにします。現在のところ、これはMRI 1.9に結合されていますが、私達は、他のRuby実装でも、これを移植するか、または同様のものを実現することが可能です。
InfoQ : Rubiniusには、スレッド、アクター、マルチVM、メッセージ送信IPCなど、並行性に関して豊富なアイディアとツールが含まれているように見えます。
MenTaLguY : 並行性は、現在、特に重要な関心事となっています。Rubiniusはこうした状況を反映しているのだと思います。
InfoQ : これらのツールの1つとして私が気付いたのは、チャネルです。これは、Rubiniusの中でどのような役割を果たしますか？(例えば、高速デバッガは、デバッガスレッドに通知を行うためにチャネルを使用していると理解しています。)
MenTaLguY : チャネルは 、Rubiniusにおける基本的な通信の基礎となる要素です。他のすべてのものは、チャネルの上に実装されています。基本的な並行性モデルは、大まかに言えば、複製なしの非同期Pi calculus[GLOVA1
]と、非決定的選択のようなよくあるいくつかの拡張を合わせたものです
( これは、潜在的に、チャネル操作が中央でアービトレーションされることを必要とします)。私がPi calculusチャネルをお勧めするのは、それが単純であるからです。単純性は、一般的に、パフォーマンスと保守性に反映されてきます。
現在のところ 、Pi calculusは、 「 ローカル 」 ( VM内 ) のものに直接的に使用する場合に適切です。Pi calculusではチャネルの両端が可動であるので、分散されるものの実装にはあまり適していません。書き込みが非同期である場合、開始だけして後は何もしないということが可能です。しかし、チャネルからの読み取りは同期操作です。1つのチャネルが複数の読み取り者に渡された場合、それらの読み取り者は、それぞれの読み取りを行うためにどこかに集合する必要があります。それぞれが特に離れている場合には、適切なものとは言えません!
これは、私が、大規模なものを対象としたときにアクターに関心を持った理由の1つです。アクターメールボックスは、非同期calculusのチャネルに似ています。違いは、(非同期)
書き込みの端だけが独立して可動であるという点です。読み取りの端は、特定のローカルエージェントに固く固定されています。特別な「長距離」連携は必要ありません。
InfoQ : Ruby 1.9では、ファイバーとコルーチンが追加されました。これらは、Rubiniusにおいてどのように実装されますか？
MenTaLguY : ファイバーは 、Rubiniusタスクによってあまり問題なく実装できると考えています。ファイバーとタスクはとても似ています。
InfoQ : ファイバーやコルーチンについて、何か見通しや意見はありますか？これらを使用するとすれば、それは何のためですか？
MenTaLguY : これらは、明示的ステートマシンの代替に適していると思います。特に、コルーチンは、ライブラリコードを使用するときの自由度を大きくしてくれると思います。しかし、ステートマシンが十分に小さい場合、またはそれを生成するのにRagelのようなものを使用するのが適切である場合は、まだステートマシンの方が優れています。
InfoQ : 現在JRubyのコミット権を持っているというのは本当ですか？JRubyの何に興味を持っていますか？また、何に取り組んでいますか？
MenTaLguY : 本当です。私の関心の対象は、主に並行性です。Rubyとネイティブスレッドの連携には、いくつかの面白い課題があります。私は、並行性に関するバグを修正したり、一般的にどのような並行性の保証を提供すべきかということを検討したりしています。また最終的には、できれば移植可能な方法で、Java並行性機能をRubyに適切に公開しようと思っています ( これは、部分的にOmnibus並行性ライブラリのミッションになります ) 。
InfoQ : 他にはどのようなプロジェクトに関わっていますか？
MenTaLguY:たまに 、Shoesにパッチを提供したりしています。これに加えて、多くのライブラリに影で協力しています。これらの多くは、準備ができ次第、発表およびリリースされる予定です。まだ正式には発表されていませんが、私が最近リリースしたものを1つここで紹介します。それは、「case」です。これは、配列、構造体、または任意の述語用のパターンマッチングを、Rubyのcase-match演算子を使用して提供します。
require ' rubygems '
require ' case '
Foo = Case :: Struct.new :a , :b
def example ( arg )
case arg
when Foo[ : blarg , Object ] # matches any Foo with .a == : blarg
# ...
when Foo[10 , 20 ] # matches only a Foo with .a == 10 and .b == 20
# ...
when Foo # matches any Foo
# ...
when Case :: Any [ String , Array ] # matches either a String or Array
# ...
# matches a three - element array with initial elements 1 , 2 :
when Case [ 1 , 2 , Object ]
# ...
# matches any Integer > 10 :
when Case :: All [ Integer , Case.guard { |n| n > 10 } ]
# ...
end
end
Tony氏も私も、待機するメッセージの種類を選択するのに、アクターライブラリでcase-match演算子 ( === ) を使用しています。この演算子は、このような場合に非常に便利です。

Two men accused of disturbing a dolphin while they swam in the sea after a drunken night out have told a court they believed the animal enjoyed itself .
Michael Jukes , 27 , and Daniel Buck , 26 , from Folkestone , Kent , swam with the female dolphin known as Dave off the coast of Sandgate after it swam up to them in June last year
They were arrested and charged with recklessly disturbing a wild animal under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 .
The bottlenosed dolphin became a tourist attraction and was frequently spotted off the seaside town after getting separated from its group .
In the months before the arrests it had not been seen and there was speculation it had died .
The two men had attended a friend 's house party where they had both been drinking heavily , Dover magistrates cout heard .
At around 5 am they and another friend walked to a garage for cigarettes and then decided to have a swim .
Buck told the court he was the first to go into the water and had not seen the animal at first .
He was scared as it approached him as he swam about 10 feet out from shore .
" If I 'd seen the dolphin first I would n't have gone for a swim , " he said .
Jukes denied witness reports that he had grabbed the dolphin 's dorsal fin and tried to climb on to its back .
" I did n't hurt the dolphin in any way .
I did n't think I did anything wrong . "
Nearby residents called the police to complain about the noise and the two men were arrested .
Both denied they ignored officers ' orders to swim ashore and said they were swept further out to sea by the current rather than because they were trying to get away .
James Barnett of British Divers Marine Life Rescue told the court that the more interaction solitary dolphins had with humans , the less likely they were to rejoin their group .
Barnett , a vet with nearly 20 years ' experience who has been involved in many marine animal rescues across the country , said that if dolphins become too familiar with humans they could become unpredictable and dangerous and even make sexual advances .
Spending too much time in shallow water made them more receptive to catching bacterial diseases and put them at greater risk of becoming entangled in fishing nets and damaged by boats , he said .
Jukes argued in court that Dave 's celebrity status meant she had already had a lot of human contact .
Both men have pleaded not guilty .
The case continues .
Two top McCain advisors lobbied for predatory lender RAW STORY
Published : Monday March 31 , 2008

Print This Email This Once derisive , McCain calls his lobbyists ' honorable '
Two top advisors for Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) represented one of the nation 's most aggressive predatory lenders , contradicting McCain 's " straight talk " about America 's collapsing housing market .
" I will not play election - year politics with the housing crisis , " the GOP presidential hopeful declared last week when unveiling his response .
" John Green , the senator 's chief liaison to Congress , and Wayne Berman , his national finance co-chairman , billed more than $ 720,000 in lobbying fees from 2005 through last year to Ameriquest Mortgage through their lobbying firm , " disclosure forms reviewed by the Daily News show .
The News revealed the story in Monday 's editions of the paper .
Ameriquest , which since has been bought out , was forced to settle suits with 49 states for $ 325 million .
More than 13,680 New York homeowners got taken for a ride by the company , records show .
" They would be defined as the most blatant and aggressive predatory lenders out of everybody , " said Bruce Marks , head of the nonprofit Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America .
Despite their past familiarity with the issue , neither Green or Berman had any input into McCain 's plan for dealing with the lending crisis , aides to the Arizona senator said last week .
" Sen. McCain has never done anything that would violate the public trust and he has never done favors for special interests or lobbyists , " said McCain spokesman Tucker Bonds .
McCain 's stable also includes a handful of lobbyists , the News notes , including McCain campaign manager Rick Davies , formerly a lobbyist for the telecommunications industry and Thomas Loeffler , McCain 's national financial chairman , who recently helped Airbus land a lucrative Pentagon contract .
' Honorable ' McCain has previously described the work former and current lobbyists have done for his campaign .
Although the so - called " maverick " Arizona lawmaker has long fought to minimize the role of special interests in electoral politics , McCain called his senior campaign staff " honorable " for their lobbying work .
" These people have honorable records , and they 're honorable people , and I 'm proud to have them as part of my team , " he declared February in Indianapolis , blaming the system and not the individuals who work within it for unduly influencing policy - making .
" The right to represent interests or groups of Americans is a constitutional right , " he added .
" There are people that represent firemen , civil servants , retirees , and those people are legitimate representatives of a variety of interests in America . "
Unfortunately for McCain , a review of federal records maintained by the Senate Office of Public Records show that the lobbyists at the top of the senator 's campaign and senatorial staffs do not represent fire fighters , civil servants , or retirees , the legitimate causes he identified in his address on Friday .
According to the SOPR database , the International Association of Fire Fighters ( IAFF ) does its own lobbying , and has also employed Dutko Worldwide , McAllister and Quinn , and Valis and Keelen , LLC .
The American Association of Retired People ( AARP ) also does much of its own lobbying , and has at times retained Bracewell & Giuliani , CJ Strategies , Davis , Wright Tremaine , LLP , Duberstein Group , Ernst & Young , Fleishman - Hillard Goverment Relations , Innovative Federal Strategies , Mark J. Iwry , Johnson , Madigan , Peck , Boland , and Stewart , and Reinecke Strategic Solutions .
Finally , the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) does much of its own lobby work , too , and has also paid Jefferson Government Relations and Lussier , Gregor , Vienna and Associates .
At the federal level , the American Federation of Government Employees is a member of the AFL - CIO , and has been represented by mCapitol Management , and Murphy , Frazer , and Selfridge .

From WikiLeaks
Description of JP Morgans stock program from page 21 of the leaked document .
Legal insider trading in three easy steps , brought to you by JP Morgan and the SEC
KEVIN WILSON , MARIA CHRISTINA PADRO , JULIAN ASSANGE & staff
March 16 , 2009
A confidential memo obtained by Wikileaks shows that not only has the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission created an insider trading loophole big enough to drive a truck through , but that Wall Street is taking full advantage of it , establishing ' how - to ' programs and even client service divisions to help well - heeled clients circumvent insider trading regulations .
Most of us think of insider trading as illegal .
It allows those with inside knowledge to tilt the playing field , with the small investors invariably losing to the privileged few .
Unfortunately for the small investor , the big boys get to play by different rules , and it has all been made legal , thanks to the SEC .
In 2000 the SEC promulgated Rule 10b5 - 1 .
The new Rule was designed to address the confusion caused by a series of court decisions that had left investors uncertain about what constitutes insider trading .
Rule 10b5 - 1 was designed to " clarify " what constitutes illegal insider trading .
But top Wall Street houses were not to be deterred from advantaging their big clients at the expense of their small ones .
Wall Street firms like JP Morgan found loopholes in Rule 10b5 - 1 that allowed them to continue trading on inside information " legally . "
Indeed , JP Morgan has gone so far as to set up an entire ' selling program ' within its Securities division to help their clients profit from the loophole .
Documents obtained earlier this month by Wikileaks from JP Morgan Private Bank , which subtitles itself as " World class solutions for wealthy individuals and families " , show the firm has a dedicated ' 10b5 - 1 Selling program , ' along with a ' dedicated 10b5 - 1 team ' to help its clients take advantage of the loophole .
Here 's how it works :
1 . An insider client transfers all or a portion of their company stock into a JP Morgan Securities Inc. brokerage account .
2 . The insider then develops , in conjunction with the 10b5 - 1 team , a ' phased , pre-planned sales program to be executed at either market or specified prices ' .
3 . Depending on the information available to the insider ( but not the public ) , the insider can decide whether to execute the sale or not .
By gaming the system this way , JP Morgan teaches insiders how to use their knowledge to create a rigged market , one in which it is the " house " that always wins , and the small investor that always loses .
Alan D. Jagolinzer , an assistant professor at Stanford University Graduate School of Business , completed a study of roughly 117,000 trades in 10b5 - 1 plans by 3,426 executives at 1,241 companies .
He found that trades inside the plans beat the market by 6 % over six months .
By contrast , executives at the same firms who traded without the benefit of plans beat the market by only 1.9 % .
http://businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_51/b4014045.htm
One can only guess at how many wealthy executives profited under JP Morgan 's " insider trading program , " leaving small investors holding the bag .

Overview
Not all of this year ’s hottest gaming mods are portable systems / laptops .
Kotomi’s “ Fami- card ” is one prime example .
It features dual joystick ports , cartridge port , 6V power input , A/V inputs , and even an on / off switch .

Dubbed the Caspian Sea Monster , the USSR 's top - secret ekranoplan skimmed on a pocket of air just above the water 's surface and well below radar .
Only a handful were built , and the behemoth never made it out of trials .
2. Marine Corps Space Plane
A few years ago , the Marine Corps proposed Sustain — the Small Unit Space Transport and Insertion project — which would put boots on the ground anywhere in the world within two hours .
It made a great PowerPoint presentation .
3. Atomic Airplane
In the 1950s , a rumor spread that the Soviets were working on a nuclear - powered aircraft .
Alarmed , the US rushed to finish its own .
The hitch :
The crew would be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation .
One solution offered was to use older pilots .
4. Psychedelics
For years , the US military experimented on its own soldiers with LSD , pot , and 3 - quinuclidinyl benzilate , hoping to learn how to give foreign armies a bad trip .
5. Sun Gun
The Nazis developed plans to build a space - based reflector that would redirect sunlight into a devastating heat beam .
Allied engineers doubted the Germans could do it .
They were right .
6. Davy Crockett Nuclear Bazooka
A nuclear recoilless rifle of questionable accuracy — what could go wrong ?
It was actually deployed in Europe during the Cold War .
7. Excalibur
This space weapon would have used a thermonuclear weapon to power a massive X - ray laser .
Eventually the notion of setting off hydrogen bombs in orbit started to seem like a bad idea .
8. Bat Bomb
Aiming to end World War II , the Pentagon sponsored a project to release time - bomb - laden bats over Japan .
The mammals would nestle in the nooks of buildings , where their incendiaries would eventually ignite .
Little Boy and Fat Man beat them to the punch .
9. Crusader
The Crusader could have shot 10 artillery rounds a minute at ranges in excess of 20 miles .
It would have been awesome — for fighting the Soviet Union , which collapsed a decade before the super howitzer was finished .
10 . Puckle Defence Gun
In the 1700s , Englishman James Puckle invented what many credit as the first machine gun .
One selling point :
It fired round bullets for shooting Christians and square ones for shooting Muslims , whom he felt deserved a more painful death .

REUTERS / Steve Marcus
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - A man in Australia is auctioning his life -- his house , his job , his clothes and his friends -- on eBay , after his marriage broke up , saying he wants to start a new life .
“ It ’s time to move .
A completely fresh start .
I want to see where life takes me , ” Ian Usher , 44 , told Australian television on Tuesday from Perth in Western Australia state .
Usher said he was auctioning his life as “ a package ” with his house in Perth valued at around A$ 420,000 ( US $ 385,000 ) .
“ Hi there , my name is Ian Usher , and I have had enough of my life !
I do n’t want it any more !
You can have it if you like ! , ” reads his Web site www.alife4sale.com, which has a link to eBay for bidders .
Usher said his life auction , which starts on June 22 , included not only his house , a car , a motorbike , a jet ski and a spa , but also an introduction to “ great friends ” and a job at a rug shop in Perth for a trial two - week period .
“ When it ’s over , I will just walk out the front door , take my wallet , my passport and start a new life , ” he said .
Usher said his ex-wife had heard of his auction .
“ Her last comment was , ‘ it seems a bit mental to me ’ , ” he said .
The future of the detention facility on the American naval base at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , inspires an unusual degree of bipartisan consensus , at least in theory .
All three remaining candidates for President , the Republican John McCain and the Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , have called for Guantánamo to be closed .
So have Condoleezza Rice , the Secretary of State , and Robert M. Gates , the Secretary of Defense ; after touring Guantánamo in January , Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said , “ I ’d like to see it shut down . ”
At a news conference in 2006 , President Bush said , “ I ’d like to close Guantánamo . ”
Still , Guantánamo is bustling .
Although the number of detainees has fallen from a high of around six hundred and eighty to around two hundred and seventy - five , the base is gearing up for what could become a series of military commissions — criminal trials of detainees .
The first is scheduled to begin in May .
On a dusty plaza surrounded by barbed wire on an abandoned airfield , contractors are finishing a metal warehouse - type building , which will house a new , highly secure courtroom .
On the former runways , more than a hundred semi-permanent tents have been erected , in which lawyers , journalists , and support staffs will work and sleep ( six to a tent ) during the trials .
The tent city has been named Camp Justice .
The Bush Administration , instead of closing Guantánamo , is trying to rebrand it — as a successor to Nuremberg rather than as a twin of Abu Ghraib .
The commission trials will be the latest act in a complex legal drama that began shortly after September 11 , 2001 .
A few weeks after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the United States invaded Afghanistan , and on November 13 , 2001 , President Bush issued an order establishing military commissions to prosecute war crimes by members and affiliates of Al Qaeda .
On January 11 , 2002 , the first prisoners from Afghanistan reached Guantánamo , which was at the time a sleepy Navy facility used for refuelling Coast Guard vessels .
The Bush Administration made it clear that it did not believe that the detainees were entitled to any Geneva - convention protections .
Then as now , the Bush Administration asserted that they could be held until the “ cessation of hostilities , ” meaning not the war in Afghanistan but the “ global war on terror ” — that is , indefinitely .
From the moment Guantánamo opened , it has been a target of criticism around the world .
In 2005 , the Amnesty International secretary - general said that “ Guantánamo has become the gulag of our times , entrenching the notion that people can be detained without any recourse to the law . ”
There were allegations of excessively harsh interrogation practices at the detention center in its first years of operation , and the Army ’s own reporting has substantiated at least one case of abusive treatment .
There have been four apparent suicides at the camp and many more attempts .
Even staunch American allies , like Tony Blair , in Great Britain , and Angela Merkel , in Germany , have criticized the facility .
As McCain said in 2007 , “ Guantánamo Bay has become an image throughout the world which has hurt our reputation . ”
It is that sort of damage , as much as what has gone on at Guantánamo , that has prompted the calls for the closing of the facility .
Administration officials hope that the military commissions will change Guantánamo ’s reputation , but that seems unlikely .
To date , the commissions have been an abject failure ; in more than six years , they have adjudicated just one case — a plea bargain for David Hicks , a former kangaroo skinner from Australia .
In March , 2007 , after more than five years in custody , he pleaded guilty to “ material support to terrorism , ” and was sentenced to nine months ; he was returned to Australia , where he served out his sentence , and has now been released .
Charges have been filed against fifteen detainees , but even if these cases come to trial — and considerable legal obstacles remain — many more prisoners will be left in limbo , without any charges pending against them or any foreseeable prospect of release .
As the clatter of construction work shows , it is easier to talk about closing Guantánamo than to do it .
Even shuttering it would not settle the most fundamental question raised by this notorious prison : what to do with its inmates .
And attempts to resolve that dilemma are increasingly likely to play a role in the Presidential election .
Four times a week , a twelve - seat propeller plane belonging to Air Sunshine , a small airline based in Florida , lands at Guantánamo .
The flight from Fort Lauderdale , just three hundred miles away , takes three hours , because the American airliner must avoid Cuban airspace .
More than two thousand people work there ; most are Navy and Army personnel , and about twelve per cent are civilian contractors .
As in many military bases around the world , the local commanders compensate for Guantánamo ’s isolation with a kind of hyper -Americanism .
There are half a dozen fast - food restaurants , two outdoor movie theatres , miniature golf , and a bedraggled , but playable , nine - hole course .
The roads are full of “ Gitmo specials ” — broken - down heaps that are traded to newcomers by people at the end of their tours .
Heading west from the base ’s townlike center , you pass the first of its infamous landmarks — Camp X - Ray .
A connected series of open - air cages surrounded by barbed wire , X - Ray was the destination for Guantánamo ’s first prisoners .
Photographs of these orange - suited detainees , many hunched over in awkward positions , became emblems of the base .
The number of prisoners quickly exceeded the capacity of Camp X - Ray , and it was closed in April , 2002 .
Base leaders have long wanted to tear down the camp , but a federal judge , who is presiding over one of the many pending cases regarding Guantánamo , ordered X - Ray preserved as possible evidence .
So the camp remains , filled with trash and overgrown with weeds .
Fifteen minutes farther down the road , overlooking a particularly beautiful rocky beach , is Camp Delta , the prison complex for the remaining detainees .
When I first visited Guantánamo , in late 2003 , most of the detainees were held in three areas of Camp Delta , Camps 1 , 2 , and 3 , which look like higher - tech versions of Camp X - Ray .
The detainees spent their days and nights in open - air cells , which were topped by metal roofs and surrounded by layers of barbed wire .
Now , with fewer prisoners , these camps appear almost empty .
( The camp authorities will not specify how many people are in each camp . )
About two dozen “ highly compliant ” prisoners are being held in Camp 4 , which features a dusty courtyard in which inmates can move freely during the day and dormitory - style sleeping arrangements .
The prisoners in Camp 4 also have access to a small library for books and movies ( a National Geographic film about Alaska is popular ) , and they can take classes to learn to read and write Pashto , Arabic , and English .
The biggest change to Guantánamo has been the completion of Camp 5 , in 2005 , and Camp 6 , the following year .
Most of the detainees now reside there .
They are modern federal - prison structures , brick - for - brick copies of a pair of existing facilities , one in Terre Haute , Indiana , and the other in Lenawee , Michigan .
The scenes inside , for better or worse , resemble those at most Supermax facilities .
The prisoners spend about twenty - two hours a day inside climate - controlled , eight - foot - by - twelve - foot cells , with no televisions or radios , and generally leave only for showers or for recreation in small open - air cages .
Painted on the floor of all cells are arrows pointing toward Mecca , and through the cell doors the detainees can hear each other pray five times a day .
Each tier of cells appoints a prayer leader who gets a sign — “ Imam ” — on his door .
About two years ago , there were a hundred detainees on hunger strikes demanding an end to their terms , or at least a finite sentence ; the number has declined to about ten , although one inmate has been refusing food for more than eight hundred days , and another for nine hundred days .
( These prisoners are force - fed twice daily , via a tube through the nose . )
Interview rooms for interrogations are outfitted with blue couches for the detainees .
Camp 6 had been intended as a medium - security alternative to Camp 5 , but after a series of near - riots by the detainees , in 2006 , it , too , was converted to maximum - security status .
The so - called “ high value ” defendants are held at Camp 7 .
This is a secret location at the base and is never shown to reporters .
In a trailer “ inside the wire , ” adjacent to Camp 4 , I spoke with Bruce Vargo , the Army colonel who runs the detention facility .
“ I think any facility matures over time , and I think that we ’ve continued maturing and offering more programs to them , like the library , ” he told me .
“ But they are still very dangerous men , and they take every opportunity they can .
There are still assaults that take place weekly on the guards .
Every day we have ‘ splashings , ’ so I made sure the guards have face shields to protect themselves from feces and urine . ”
The catchphrase that Vargo and others at Guantánamo often used when describing their work was “ safe and humane care and custody . ”
It was clear , however , that winning hearts and minds is not part of the agenda .
“ They would n’t be the type of people they are without being driven , ” Vargo said .
“ They obviously are very intent on pursuing their cause .
They will let you know that this place is just an extension of the battlefield . ”
He went on , “ I would not say that we are building a fan base for the U.S. here .
We are keeping bad guys off the battlefield . ”
Vargo ’s comments reflect the unchanging perspective of the Bush Administration , which holds that these detainees are , in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , “ the worst of a very bad lot ” — incorrigible soldiers in an unending war .
But , in the absence of any meaningful due process , there is no proof that they are .
Benjamin Wittes , a fellow at the Brookings Institution , has made a comprehensive review of the prisoners for his forthcoming book , “ Law and the Long War . ”
For a period in 2006 when Camp Delta held about five hundred prisoners , Wittes examined all the available data — including the military ’s assertions about the prisoners and any statements that they themselves made — and estimated that about a third of the detainees could reasonably be said to be terrorists or enemy fighters .
The legal battle over Guantánamo has followed a trajectory similar to the political fortunes of the Bush Administration as a whole .
The first court challenges by lawyers representing detainees were filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights , the left - leaning legal - advocacy group in New York , and Joseph Margulies , a civil - liberties attorney .
Now , however , the anti-Guantánamo cause has gone mainstream , and Air Sunshine flights often ferry attorneys from white - shoe law firms to visit their detained clients .
Almost all the remaining detainees who want attorneys are represented by American counsel .
Initially , government lawyers asserted that because the detainees were held outside the United States they had no right to challenge their status in American courtrooms , or even to file writs of habeas corpus .
The Presidential order of November 13 , 2001 , said that the detainees “ shall not be privileged to seek any remedy or maintain any proceeding , directly or indirectly . . . in any court of the United States . ”
But , in 2004 , the Supreme Court ruled , in Rasul v. Bush , that , because the Guantánamo base was under the exclusive control of the U.S. military , the detainees were effectively on American soil and had the right to bring habeas - corpus petitions in federal court .
As Justice John Paul Stevens said in his opinion , the federal courts “ have jurisdiction to determine the legality of the Executive ’s potentially indefinite detention of individuals who claim to be wholly innocent of wrongdoing . ”
In response to Rasul , the Department of Defense created a Combatant Status Review Tribunal , an administrative proceeding to justify each detainee ’s “ enemy combatant ” status .
According to the rules , however , the detainees are not entitled to counsel , are not allowed to see all the evidence against them , and receive only the opportunity to be present and , if they choose , to respond to unclassified charges against them .
These days , the review tribunals are conducted in a windowless double - wide trailer inside the wire , under the supervision of a Navy captain named Ken Garber .
These are not trials but a rough cross between grand - jury and probable - cause hearings .
Three officers preside over each tribunal , and they can recommend continued detention or transfer to another country .
There is only a limited right to appeal , but each detainee receives an annual review of his status in another hearing .
“ We look at two questions , ” Garber told me above the hum of the air - conditioners .
“ Are they still a threat ?
Do they still have intelligence value ?
A yes to either one is enough to keep them . ”
The tribunals have been widely criticized as one - sided — Eugene R. Fidell , a noted American expert on military law , has called them a “ sham ” — and , according to Garber , last year only thirteen per cent of the detainees agreed to participate in or attend their own annual review hearings .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama is gaining ground on Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania , moving within range of an April 22 upset that could end the hard - fought Democratic presidential race months earlier than expected .

Less than two weeks before their next showdown , opinion polls show Obama cutting Clinton ’s once big lead in Pennsylvania to single digits and making gains among some voting blocs that have been her most reliable backers .
An Obama win would be a shocking twist in a Democratic race filled with them , effectively scuttling Clinton ’s hopes of overtaking him in the fight for the right to face Republican John McCain in November ’s presidential election .
“ If Obama wins Pennsylvania , the race is over , ” said Cal Jillson , a political analyst at Southern Methodist University in Texas .
“ That would be a signal to the Democratic Party to move decisively to end this nominating race now and to start looking to the general election , ” he said .
A loss in Pennsylvania would destroy Clinton ’s central argument in the race against Obama -- that she is the strongest Democratic candidate in the big states the party needs to win in the election battle with McCain .
Pennsylvania had been considered a lock for Clinton because of its high concentration of the older , white , Catholic and blue - collar voters that form the backbone of the New York senator ’s coalition .
But a heavy barrage of television advertising by Obama , who has been tripling Clinton ’s spending in Pennsylvania , a successful six - day bus tour of the state and a few bad weeks for Clinton have helped tighten the race , analysts said .
A new Quinnipiac University poll showed Clinton ’s lead at 6 points , down from 9 points last week and 12 points in mid-March .
An average of all polls in the state this week shows Clinton with about a 7 - point advantage .
‘ OBAMA CLOSES IN ’
“ Obama is definitely closing in .
You look at all the demographic groups that have been her base and she is slipping everywhere , ” said Clay Richards , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll .
But Obama has closed the gap on Clinton ahead of contests in big states like Ohio , New Jersey , California and elsewhere -- only to lose .
It was common for polls to tighten after heavy advertising campaigns like Obama ’s and as the voting draws closer , Clinton aides said .
The Quinnipiac poll showed Obama , an Illinois senator , gaining ground among whites , women and those voters who rank the economy as their top issue , he said .
Obama also was picking up support in the populous and crucial Philadelphia suburbs .
Terry Madonna , a political analyst at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania , said Obama ’s advertising had been effective and his week - long swing through the state showed him talking with voters in a more personal and effective style .
“ He was talking specifics in ways that he did n’t before , about health care and the economy -- it was n’t just ‘ turn the page , ’ ” Madonna said .
“ He started really talking to people about the problems they face .
In other words , he was doing what Hillary usually does so well , ” he said .
Meanwhile , Clinton suffered through questions about her disproven claims to have faced sniper fire in Bosnia in 1996 -- she said she “ misspoke ” -- and whether she should even remain in the race amid dwindling hopes of catching Obama .
Obama has a nearly unassailable lead on Clinton in the pledged delegates who will help pick the nominee , but neither is likely to reach the 2,024 needed to clinch the nomination once the nominating contests end in early June .
That leaves the decision to nearly 800 superdelegates -- office holders and party insiders free to back any candidate .
Clinton has courted them by saying her wins in Ohio , California , New Jersey and elsewhere proved her strength in big states critical to beating McCain .
She also hopes the final contests will help her close the gap on Obama in pledged delegates and catch him in popular votes cast in the state - by - state contests .
All that is gone with a loss in Pennsylvania -- or possibly even a narrow win , Madonna said .
“ If he gets within 5 percentage points of her , he can declare victory anyway .
That may not get her out of the race but it deflates her arguments , ” Madonna said .
Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson rejected the notion she has to win big in the state to make meaningful headway .
“ A win is a win .
There is no reason why Senator Obama ca n’t win there .
If they fail to win there , they will have failed in Pennsylvania , ” he said .

Why did the Church of Scientology buy a channel on YouTube ?
Well , remember how a video of Tom Cruise babbling about Scientology cropped up on YouTube ?
And how the Church got the video taken down so we put it on Gawker and then another copy stayed on YouTube ?
Well the Church tried to fight its critics with a regular user account , but that did n't work ; the organization had no more visible cred than the anonymous people accusing it of suppressing free speech .
So now the Church bought themselves this fancy channel stocked with 82 videos about their religion .
Most are just bland , and some are delightfully creepy , even if they lack the star power of Tom Cruise .
But I 'm not allowed to show them here .
One of YouTube 's selling points is the ability to embed its videos on other pages .
This allows free discussion of those videos , just like excerpting an image or text .
But the Church turned off embedding in their clips .
In fact , you can't link to just one video by clicking from the Church 's official channel .
You have to search for their videos .
Then you can find this creepy clip of a ceremony celebrating the Church 's " International Way To Happiness Foundation . "
A South African dignitary thanks the Church ( or more precisely , a supposedly secular wing of the Church ) for starting a program in his country 's prisons .
An Israeli publisher thanks the Church for healing the Middle East , as does a Palestinian education official .
In another video , a narrator explains how you are a thetan , not a body or mind .
Another clip introduces the auditing process .
In that clip , it sounds weirdly like the therapeutic process in the psychiatric field that Scientologists like Tom Cruise have publicly denounced .
But most of the clips are innocent slideshows with a narrator gently listing beliefs that would fit with mainstream Christianity .
Every clip has a cheesy grocery - store soundtrack .
The net effect is to make the Church look like another dull religion or self - help class and not , as some critics label it , a murderous cult .
Either way , because the Church disabled the option to embed their videos , I can't show you the clips here but can only link to them .
I 've downloaded some copies , but uploading them here might violate copyright law as long as there 's another copy on the Church 's channel .
The Church paid for its special channel .
Anyone can disable embeds , but a specially formatted user page does n't come free .
YouTube helped the Church integrate its custom menu into the channel , though of course it did n't create any of the content .
Nor did YouTube endorse the Church or give it control over other users ' videos , and all such accusations I saw provided no evidence .
But I 'm baffled why the Church , after putting together such a friendly little propaganda channel , not only disabled all comments ( a reasonable way to avoid actually diving into two - way conversation ) but disabled embedding and turned its channel into a tidy menu .
That guarantees that hardly anyone will stumble onto the videos .
I guess the rest of the world should be glad that the Church does n't get the Internet .
What may piss off some viewers is that the Church is advertising their channel all over YouTube .
This might explain the no-embed rule ; the Church is specifically targeting YouTube users , not the Internet at large , though I see no reason to specifically hide from everyone outside of the video site .
But one user was creeped out by Church ads appearing on popular channels like Smosh , Awkward Pictures , and Playboy , even though any creator can ask YouTube to keep certain advertisers off its page .
Guess everyone just needed the money .
At least I can still show you the anti-Church videos .
Mr Mukherjee said the Dalai Lama was a " respected guest " in India
India 's Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee has warned the Dalai Lama against any political activity damaging to India 's relationship with China .
Mr Mukherjee also stressed that the exiled spiritual leader would continue to be welcome in India .
The comments , which reiterate Delhi 's position , come at a sensitive time , following anti-China protests in India .
Correspondents say the protests are embarrassing for the Indian government
which is improving ties with China .
Speaking on Indian television , Mr Mukherjee said : " India will continue to offer him all hospitality , but during his stay in India , they should not do any political activity , any action that can adversely affect relations between India and China " .
Demonstrations
This policy has been in place since 1959 , when the Dalai Lama fled his homeland , after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in the Himalayan region .
He settled in the north Indian hill town of Dharamsala , which has been the site of recent protests against China .
Demonstrations have also been seen outside the Chinese Embassy in Delhi , after which Beijing summoned the Indian ambassador .
India has assured China that the Olympic torch will pass safely through the country .
But the country 's football captain has refused to carry the torch .
Gecko Tech
The amazing lizard uses its hairy toes to defy gravity and its dynamic tail to always land on its feet if it falls .
See how scientists are using the gecko's tricks to design better robots , spacesuits and — just maybe — Spiderman gloves

In its seemingly never - ending quest to belittle U.S. Sen .
Larry Craig , the Idaho Statesman recently ran a long story about two “ homosexuals ” who went to the University of Idaho at the same time he did and suffered significantly more because their proclivity for the same sex was discovered .
One , Chris Smith , an outstanding newspaper editor and political consultant , came out of the closet after graduating and , despite a glowing resume of success , was unable to get work in Idaho as a result .
The other , Ray McDonald , an All America football player , never came out publicly , but had his professional career ruined by persistent rumors of his homosexuality .
He died in his late 40s of AIDS related causes , according to the Statesman .
As it happens , I knew Ray McDonald and the guy who accused him of rape and started his decline to oblivion .
We all lived on the second floor of Shoup Hall , a small three - story dormitory since converted into a Theater Arts classroom building .
Ray , a sophomore , lived in one of the three single rooms .
My roommate and I lived in a room directly across the hall from the showers .
The accuser , whose name I honestly can’t remember , lived two doors down from me .
He was from Salt Lake City .
He drove a gorgeous white MG TC sports car in near perfect condition .
His roommate , also from Salt Lake , drove an equally impressive black Alpha Romeo roadster .
One winter ’s night when the mercury dipped well below zero , they pushed the furniture in the main - floor lounge to the walls and drove their cars in for protection from the weather .
Most evenings these guys wandered up and down the second floor hallway engaging people in idle conversations .
If you went to the bathroom while studying and failed to close your door firmly , one or the other would usually slide in and be reclining on your bed waiting to chat when you returned .
They also enjoyed turning the shower into a steam room .
The shower room at Shoup Hall was made up of a small anti room with wooden benches on each side and hooks on the wall for robes and towels .
The shower itself was a large , maybe eight - by - eight - foot room immediately beyond it with six showerheads , two on each of the three walls .
By turning all the showers on full hot , it was possible to create a cloud of steam in the anti room where they would sit on the wooden benches and , well , “ steam ” .
Most nights they were the only participants , although others did occasionally join them .
I never saw Ray McDonald at one of these steam baths and am confident he never participated .
Neither did I .
I knew what was going on because my room was directly across the hall and the steam parties always involved lots of yelling and running around the halls .
McDonald was seldom seen in the hall .
He was usually studying with his tutors in his room or at the library when not attending football workouts and practices .
Once I had a casual conversation with him while we ironed our clothes in the ironing room .
He was gracious , humorous and somewhat self - effacing .
A good guy to talk and laugh with .
Occasionally he would watch television in the basement recreation room .
People did n’t like to sit beside him on the couch , myself included , because he was constantly slapping his hand on your knee or putting his arm around your shoulders for a brief hug when something funny or exciting happened on the television show .
I never sensed any sexual meaning in them , but the squeezes and hugs were very annoying .
Others in the hall started talking about him being “ queer ” – the still acceptable street slang for homosexuals .
It became a running joke , which , I am ashamed to say , I participated in .
The night everything came to a head , so to speak , I was in my room studying and one of Salt Lake guys was taking a steam by himself across the hall .
His roommate had gone home for the weekend .
They never seemed to lack money for airline tickets and fine clothes .
At around midnight , the steamer was in the hall shouting that he had been raped by McDonald .
He said he had gone to sleep on one of the benches in the anti room and Ray had come into the shower room and raped him .
I remember thinking at the time that the story sounded fishy .
McDonald was nowhere to be seen and the guy had apparently made no protest while the alleged rape was in progress .
He was not an especially attractive man .
He was small , about 5 ’ 6 ” , and his face was pinched with close - set eyes and densely packed with brownish freckles .
His roommate was about the same size and considerably better looking with doe eyes and black well groomed hair .
When I asked him why he did n’t say or do anything before or during the alleged rape , he said , “ What would you do if you had 250 pounds of muscle on top of you ? ” I said I would at least yell for help to which he sneered , “ Yea , I bet you would . ”
The thing is , I could n’t imagine Ray McDonald assaulting anyone , sexually or otherwise .
He was one of the most instinctively gentle people I had ever met .
In addition , I was so naïve at the time that I did n’t believe there was such a thing as homosexuality .
I thought it was something guys talked about just to gross people out .
Honestly , that ’s what I believed .
With the aid of considerable hindsight I have come to believe McDonald was probably entrapped .
Although his accuser complained bitterly and constantly that he was treated unfairly by the university and its athletic department , he and his roommate departed Idaho a month or so after the incident several thousand dollars richer .
He never said how many thousand , maybe it was a condition of the settlement , but he did say he did n’t have to worry about college anymore .
McDonald moved off campus to an undisclosed location .
He continued to play fullback on the football team and was named to both the preseason and postseason All America teams of every major sports publication .
In his senior year against the University of Washington he gained more yards than the entire UCLA team did against the Huskies one week later .
On the street , however , McDonald was recognized more for his rumored homosexuality than his football prowess .
“ I hear you ’ve got an All America queer over there , a Washington State University fraternity brother said when we all met in the pub one night .
My roommate and I joined a fraternity in the second semester of our freshman year .
When the news got out , McDonald good - naturedly taped a sign on our door reading “ Fratte Rattes ” .
He apparently suffered from a severe case of Dyslexia , a not yet recognized learning disability that transposes letters and seriously affects the ability to read and spell .
McDonald worked extremely hard to overcome his learning disability , I learned later from a guy in my fraternity who had tutored him in math and science .
All athletes in major sports were offered tutors by the athletic department , but few took advantage of the service as much as McDonald , who , I am told , graduated in four years .
According to the Statesman , he later attended graduate school .
Like Larry Craig , who persistently denies being gay despite mounting evidence to the contrary dug up by the Idaho Statesman , I do n’t think Ray McDonald believed in homosexuality .
He likely thought it was a temptation to be fought and overcome , like being attracted to young girls .
Had society accepted homosexuality on the same basis that it accepts heterosexuality and let people live the lives they have been given with dignity and respect , Ray McDonald would likely have been an All Pro running back instead of an NFL dropout .
Larry Craig would be running for the Senate again this November and Chris Smith would likely be working for his opponent .
Simple acceptance of people as they are .
It seems little to expect from society to save what should have been three very productive lives .

Robert Lovelace : “ I have no doubt that more people will have to go to prison before Ontario becomes nuclear free and we embrace a society that undertakes real sustainability ”
Robert submitted this handwritten presentation to the Inquiry via surface mail .
Acting Ardoch Algonquin First Nation Co-Chief , Mireille LaPointe , read the presentation at the Ottawa Inquiry on Robert ’s behalf .
My name is Robert Lovelace .
I am a member of the Ardoch Algonquin n First Nation .
Our traditional homeland is within the Ottawa River Valley among the Madawoska , Mississippi and Rideau watersheds .
Our community also uses the Nation River watershed .
The Ardoch Algonquin First Nation is with the greater Algonquin Nation of the Anishnabeg People .
I am writing to you from the Central East Correctional Centre in Lindsay , Ontario on the 50th day of incarceration .
I have been imprisoned because I refused to submit to Judge Douglas Cunningham ’s order for my community to leave their peaceful protest and permit Frontenac Ventures Corporation access to our traditional homelands to carry out exploration activities , including deep core drilling for uranium .
I have been sentenced to 6 months and fined $ 25,000 .
In addition , Co -Chief Paula Sherman was fined $ 15 , 000 dollars and the community $ 10,000 and the community ’s defence and counter claims to a $ 77 million dollar lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Cunningham leaving the First Nation completely vulnerable and without representation .
In my defence , and as explanation for actions taken by the Ardoch Algonquin First Nation , I gave evidence about the Algonquin understanding of land and the responsibility for protecting the land with Algonquin Law .
This knowledge comes to us through oral traditions : through stories , songs , principle saying and ceremony .
It is shared collectively .
No one person holds all the knowledge with requires people to come together and contribute what they know for the greater good .
We also turn to our elders who through their long experience of living and cumulative use and understanding of knowledge can instruct with intelligence and wisdom .
In this way Algonquin law continues to be profound and dynamic .
The Algonquin understanding of land begins with creation and in the context of its expressions in Anishabemowin ( the Algonquin language ) .
For Algonquins creation does not centre on human beings or on a determined plan of an all powerful god .
The face of creation is shaped by vision , which gives spirit form .
Mater , in its diversity and sameness dances in a whirl of changing shapes , arranged by harmony , balance and compliment .
In this animate matrix all being are alive .
The air , water , stone and the fires of the earth and sun are living beings .
Like all the creatures who fly , walk or swim , what exist within a symbiotic reference with all life , either real imagined or symbolic is linked to spirits of a living world .
If the creator directs any attention towards human being it is with benign indifference as the great spirit observes the artifice of life ’s vision with equal interest .
Like all creatures , humans are created whole but not in the image of the totality of life .
In fact humans are understood to be one of the most dependent of all creatures lacking a fundamental understanding of purpose , which leaves them vulnerable and ignorant .
Humans through like all other creatures have a will to survive , instincts to prevail , logic discipline and imagination to adopt and prosper .
Like other creatures the highest achievement of human beings is successful integration into the immense complexities of the local .
Failure is to be alienated to the marginal and superficial grasping and exploiting without caution anything that merits consumption .
The later is what we call Windigo .
Being humans is not about mitigating heaven and hell or any other godly realms .
Being a human being is about activating the gifts of truth , courage , love , respect , honesty wisdom and honour the principles which allow Anishnabeg to stay true to the human purpose of protecting the land and then human purpose of protecting the land and the human family .
Our creation stories if told one after another would take days if not weeks to recite .
A lifetime is not long enough to understand the cumulative wisdom and knowledge of the stories .
However , it would not take a listener long to understand that it is the land that gives shape to the spirits in physical form .
Each place , each watershed , each ecosystem moulds and shaves , revealing pragmatic variations .
The colour of eyes , the length of limbs , the metabolic rhythms that regulate fibre and fluid , the lay and colour of hair are traded for harmony within the ecosystem .
Serendipity is tested and retested , accepted and rejected in minute detail that takes ages to preserve and to be changed again and again .
It is enough to know that as human beings we are appendages of the land , made of the same earth , flowing in the same waters , breathing the same wind , warmed by the same fire .
We live in a critical age .
Never before has humanity faced such great peril and never before has the human conscience been so alive in its collective recognition and understanding of the way forward .
As a species we have become intimate with almost every ecosystem on the planet .
And beyond that we have an empirical understanding of the beginning and end of this universe .
However , our human systems embrace a self - defeating dilemma through reactive resistance or acquiescence to Solomon ’s lament that everything is vanity .
And while the real choices seem ultimately confusing , now is the time that we must decide the fate of generations to come .
There is no mystery that as a species we have fallen from grace .
There is great suffering among humans in this world because few have privilege and many do not .
Even in the so called developed nations the gap between rich and poor is widening .
The indigenous wealth , in economic terms called ‘ virgin wealth ’ , which has been rapaciously extracted from the earth without consent or concern is now long past the point where demand exceeds supply .
The great European Empires who rose in five centuries from the cheapest labour in the world to indulgent affluence are now consuming their own children with debt , unable to sustain or curtail superfluous excess .
While our parents and grandparents honestly believed they were creating a better world .
We know now that their dreams were not sustainable .
We know that .
Politicians , guided by the power of the privileged class , promise that the dream of perpetual affluence is still possible .
It is not .
For millions upon millions of human beings , impoverished and separated from their indigenous relationship with the land , the proof is clear , development as defined by Colonial nations of this world is merely theft and murder and when we bring it on ourselves it is suicide .
To put one stone upon another without ultimate acceptance of the consequences is to kill both the meaning and spirit of our sacred relationship with the earth .
Modern leaders plead with us to accept the most obsequious forms of racism , classism , sexism and human and environmental injustice as an abeyance of our own uncontrollable decline in the hope that we will choose the inevitable , a binary of privilege and poverty as the only sustainable reality .
It is in this sense that Ontario promotes uranium exploration , mining and the extension of a highly subsidized nuclear energy policy .
With the current Ontario leadership there is no turning back , there are no efficient alternatives , there is no preparations for the end of social an cultural consumerism , as dependency on fossil fuels becomes too expensive .
For the present government in Ontario one unachievable promise replaces another .
Along side the blind faith in continued development , political leaders continue to accept the degradation of the environment as a natural law of economics .
Politicians tell us that they know best .
Despite their obvious allegiance to a privileged and insulated clientele , they assure the less privileged that they alone have insight into the future , a higher standard of legal and social justice and a single - mindfulness for the welfare of humanity .
They at once point to the
unspoiled ‘ wilderness ’ as a national treasure while over seeing its spoilage through central management .
Over the past two decades environmental protection legislation has not been strengthened .
In fact it has been consistently compromised through a lack of funding and abridgements to legislation .
What we thought we had in Ontario by way of environmental protection while discursive of quasi- judicial levels remains at best the whimsy of the political party in power .
The principles of environmental protection as a dynamic discipline are for less known among Ontario leadership than the results of their latest popularity poll or the info - advertisements of some jaded pundit in the National Post .
The dependency on ‘ virgin wealth ’ in their minds is confused with divine authority advance by colonial ideology .
Continuing down this seeming relentless path of consumption and waste will draw humanity ever closer to a threshold where neither the lessons of the past or the promises of the future have any applicable meaning .
I am not a scientist but I have informed myself about the nuclear industry .
Not for one moment do I believe that nuclear energy is clean or cheap .
I have seen the pictures from Chernobyl and Three Mile Island and read much about the devastating effects on people and the environment .
I have learned that the leading industrial diseases in the United States are caused by ionizing radiation .
I spent the better part of my youth listening to strategic Air Command Bomber ’s take off and return with their cargos of Atomic weapons , commanded by politicians with marginally sophisticated technology and less than honourable political agendas .
I understand that Canada ’s ‘ virgin wealth ’ in yellow cake uranium has left this country virtually untraceable and found its way into the processing plants of the likes of Saddam Hussien .
This is not a clean technology when millions of tons of radioactive waste from mining is deposited into lakes and ponds with no intent on the part of industry or government to mitigate the cost and damage to future generations .
There is nothing clean about open pit mining that demands the burning of exorbitant amounts of fossil fuels to extract , process and transport the raw product .
Conservative estimates of the costs of fossil fuels in mining uranium are ¼ of the economic output in the life of a nuclear reactor .
This estimate does not include the impact of expended carbon emissions on the environment .
Spent uranium following the fission process presents even greater costs and concerns .
The National Academic of Science reported in February 1958 that ‘ the cost of story radioactive fission products temporarily to cool them , of extracting long lived isotopes and shipping waste to disposal points for ultimate disposal will have a major influence on the economics of nuclear power . ’
Fifty years later not one county using nuclear power generation has solved the problem and the cost of temporary storage continues to escalate .
Economically speaking if I were only concerned with return on my investment I would put my money on nuclear power .
No other industry in Canada has had the level of environmental protection costs exempted than the nuclear industry .
Besides the assurance that environmental protection will not encumber business , every loan - shark in the world knows that there is no greater profit than in an enterprise that is unable to pay off the initial loans .
In the future the cost of nuclear energy will not only fuel inflation but it will also reap the highest rates of investment return .
Ontario has reached a threshold where existing first generation nuclear reactors are some 15 billion dollars in debt and unable to draw down the debt any further .
The present premier ’s solution is to borrow more money to build an even costlier second generation in an era where private energy conservation due to rising prices will be the normative challenge of every household .
You can bet that it will not be the McGuinty loan sharks .
Those who will pay the cost will be working and retired , the poor and indigenous people .
I have come to understand that uranium and the military industrial complex that it feeds , is the forbidden fruit of our generation .
It is the turtle with the ring of moss on its back .
It is the glittery box on which Pandora speculates .
My investment in the future will not be in uranium nor its allied industries .
I chose the morality of Algonquin Law and I will let posterity be my judge .
I have never been reconciled with Solomon ’s view that all is vanity .
The beauty of a frozen swamp in the middle of winter is not a self - absorbed pretension .
The beauty of a rainbow , a sunset , a fungus growing in layers along a fallen tree , a world independent of human comings and goings , all in all , never less than any which may be contrived .
The goal of living is not in attaining beauty but in accepting it .
Desire is what blinds us to invent beauty , to invent confections for the heart and mind .
And in doing so we live our lives out as caricatures on Vanity ’s stage .
As an Anishnabeg person I am not long our of the forest and I know that water in its natural form is beautifully clean , the wind is warm and full of song or cold and clear , the earth after a billion years still smells fresh and clean , one see will produce ten , a hundred , even a thousand fold .
I know that the earth is a quiet place as though listening to itself .
When it speaks it does so in an immense diversity of voices , some cautious , some cautioning , all beautifully distant but urgent to be heard .
It is such a world that vanity seeks to erase .
I believe that at not other time in history have humans collectively had such a clear view of the whole frame .
At once it is possible to see our beginnings and the possible futures a head of us .
This perspective however will not last .
As we advance further a history of over consumption and unmanageable waste the opportunities for sustainability and the perceptible choices become fewer and fewer .
Social change does not come easily .
The defences against colonialism have had only marginal success and more often than not have resulted in violence and counter revolution .
However when we look at the natural world we can see their powerful forces with which human beings ally .
Within our human nature are forces with which we can endure through the harshest challenges .
Collectively , the bonds of family , clan and community are far stronger than the deceptions that divide us .
In pursuit of positive social change we need to activate within ourselves the gifts endowed upon us through creation .
Perception , logic , discipline , imagination , courage and insight are only a few of the powerful gifts within us .
We need to activate ourselves to ask less and give more so our local communities become stronger .
We need to embrace silence so when we do speak the clarity of our voice will be unmistakable .
Changing the intentions of governments can be even more difficult than effecting social change .
I have no doubt that more people will have to go to prison before Ontario becomes nuclear free and we embrace a society that undertakes real sustainability .
The whole basis of sustainability is local communities meeting local needs .
Big government simply does not fit into this picture and neither does corporate construction of need fulfilment .
Sustainability is not about turning back the clock but rather the long overdue evolution of rationalizing real human needs with real earthy processes .
As a society in change Ontario will need every bit of the wealth now destined for nuclear development to effect the transitions that are required .
Urban structures need to be reinvented .
The meaning of labour will need to be redefined .
Eco-cartography will reshape political boundaries .
And most of all people will change culturally .
The present energy crisis and the need for sustainable economies necessitate a renaissance of humanity but present governments resist such change because the old means of governance ; repression , false promises and popularity contests are not sufficient to control populations through emergent creativity .
For today’s
governments it will seem easier to deny , pretend , punish and finally abdicate responsibility .
People need to take initiative on there won and they need to do so now .
There is a great need to defend the earth and our relatives in creation .
Stopping uranium exploitation is definitely an important action in defending the earth .
The coalitions that are created are nexus of shared knowledge and mutual concern .
But simply shutting down the machines , turning off the taps and extinguishing the lights is not enough to meet the challenges of an over consumptive society .
We need to reinvent ourselves .
Last year when I learned that 30,000 acres of our homeland had been staked for uranium exploration with the potential for an open pit mine , my first thoughts were how to protect Algonquin rights and interests .
Since then my knowledge and understanding has grown beyond parochial interests to include my non-Algonquin neighbours and a struggle that goes further than mere resistance to colonialism .
However my core understanding of what is to be Anishnabeg ( human being ) , my knowledge of the land ( aki ) and my acceptance of the meaning of creation still inform who I am and what I believe .
Going to prison is a small price to pay for one ’s integrity and even a smaller price to pay for the right to care for the earth , our mother and home to all of our relations .
Sacrifice is the work that binds us with the rest of humanity who struggles to preserve their homelands , sustainable cultures and natural justice .
As each day passes I believe more and more that to live free , active , intelligent , compassionate lives is our inheritance .
Imprisonment is never the end of the struggle for change .
It is the beginning of conviction .
To be a human being is to find peace and good will taking only what you need and giving back everything .
I am humbled to be able to share my thoughts with the Citizens ’
Inquiry and I commend all of you for your hard work and sacrifices bringing this forum to the people .

A friend of mine and I were swapping some email , and he pointed out to me that Ron Paul is still running for president .
I replied that this makes sense , because there is no way that Paul will ever endorse , John “ Warmonger ” McCain , so why should he get off the ballot ?
He might as well keep spreading his message .
The Republican Party already ignores him anyway , so he should stick a thumb in their eye , and ride this campaign out until the end .
A little later while surfing around , I came across this nugget posted a few days ago on the USA Today website .
In a small around two paragraph blurb the writer said , “ The Republican congressman from Texas continues to raise money for his presidential campaign .
He is planning to visit states that have yet to hold their primaries and is urging his small but devoted cadre of followers to hold rallies for the libertarian causes he espouses . ”
Wow , if that description was n’t just full of cheap shots .
Notice that Paul is essentially characterized as a cult leader with followers .
These are a bunch of crazies that wo n’t get with the program .
Advertisements
What I am trying to figure out is why are some in the media continuing to take shots at Paul ?
( The media does n’t take shots at Obama , because his popularity means ratings ) .
The campaign is for all intensive purposes finished .
Why pile on ?
In the interest of full disclosure , I am a Democrat , not a Ron Paul supporter , but I have had the pleasure of talking to hundreds of Paul supporters over the year , and while some of them are a bit out there , 99 % of them are good people who are frustrated with both political parties , and believe in Ron Paul .
Paul ’s supporters are n’t crazy , spammers , or a cult .
They are regular people many of whom gave their time and money to this campaign .
Most of his supporters were first time participants in politics , and if anything they were a bit naïve .
The only people I have found to rival the Paul supporters in terms of enthusiasm are the Obama backers .
Both groups bring a passion and freshness that is a pleasure to be around .
The problem for people who have been Washington , D.C. or the political establishment for a long time is that they do n’t understand this passion .
It frightens them , so they find ways to disparage it .
However , these new participants are the lifeblood of a democracy , and we need their energy , now more than ever .
What a death scene looks like on Halo 3 .
I can't count the number of times I 've died .
I can't even count the number of ways I 've died .
Like most gamers , I 've been slaughtered by AK - 47 - wielding terrorists , poisoned by eldritch spiders and blown up with alien frag grenades .
I 've also been impaled on medieval swords , ripped limb from limb by dinosaurs and impassively stomped by 20 - story - tall , walking war machines that barely noticed my existence .
Yet here 's the thing :
It 's possible that these deaths have been among my most enjoyable game experiences .
This is the fascinating argument of a new paper by Niklas Ravaja , a scientist who has done pioneering research into the emotions of gamers as they play .
In " The Psychophysiology of James Bond : Phasic Emotional Responses to Violent Video Game Events " – published in this month 's edition of the journal Emotion – Ravaja reaches an amazingly counterintuitive conclusion : Gamers do n't like shooting their opponents , but they 're suffused with pleasure when they themselves are shot dead .
" It was , " he tells me when I call him up , " quite a surprise . "
I 'll say .
For his experiment , Ravajas took 36 gamers and wired them up with several sensors that minutely recorded their emotional states , including electromyographic activity in key facial muscles and skin conductance levels .
Then he had them play James Bond 007 : Night Fire , a first - person shooter that was , at the time , a pretty realistic videogame .
The results ?
When people killed an opponent , their electrodermal activity shot up , while their faces registered distress .
" That is , instead of joy resulting from victory and success , wounding and killing the opponent elicited anxiety , anger or both , " Ravajas said .
When gamers themselves were killed , in contrast , the sensors detected " positively valenced high - arousal affect , " he said .
Dying was , in some way , fun .
Ravajas is n't entirely sure why gamers feel this way , though he has theories .
If we feel distress when we kill an in - game opponent , it may be because it violates our ingrained sense of morality ; we know killing is bad , even when it 's virtual .
( Interestingly , this stands in contrast to much desensitization theory .
Psychologists worry that killing too many virtual enemies numbs you to violence ; Ravajas finds it " reassuring " that gamers seem to be resisting this numbing . )
His much weirder experimental result , though , is our thrill at dying .
Ravajas thinks this might occur because getting killed is " transient relief from engagement " :
A first - person shooter is so incredibly stressful that we 're happy to get any respite , even if it requires being blown to pieces .
This makes a lot of sense to me .
When I play a shooter like Call of Duty 4 , the emotional current flows like this : I 'll be racing through a war - torn building , hunted down by cackling terrorists , and watching as the blood leaches into the periphery of my vision .
My stomach 's in knots , and I 'm frantically looking for cover when boom – I 'll stumble into a room full of guys with shotguns and get a face full of pain .
As I watch my corpse crumple to the ground , sure , I feel annoyed .
But my annoyance is n't as powerful as my sense of release : I can feel my whole body unwind .
Indeed , I 'm often so wrapped up in the game that I do n't even realize how badly I 'm clenched up .
I may not want to die ; but for the sake of my mental health , I probably need to .
Yet , not all deaths are equal .
This sounds strange to say , but there are games I enjoy getting killed in more than others , because some designers have a much better sense of how to craft an aesthetically – and ludologically – satisfying death .
My hands - down favorite is probably Halo 3 in online multiplayer .
The instant you die , the game switches abruptly from the first - person perspective to third - person .
Since the physics of Halo are pretty kinetic , often – after a grenade kill , or a really moist punch to the face – you watch as your corpse goes pinwheeling gracefully through the air , arms and legs flailing in the grip of rag - doll physics .
This is , in essence , much like the out - of - body experiences people report during near - death moments .
Even better , really , because Halo gives you a very high degree of camera control ; while I wait to respawn , I 'll poke around like a curious ghost , dispassionately examining my former human shell .
It 's an oddly graceful moment of Zen , and it works in beautiful contrast to the fight - or - flight riot of battle .
Most shooters execute this third - person shift , of course .
But Bungie has made it into an experiential tone poem .
You could think of it as " the architecture of death , " and game designers ought to pay more attention to it .
Because one thing 's for sure :
We 're all going to die .
Over and over again .
A tip of the hat to Brandon Erickson for bringing this study to my attention !

There ’s a new CBS / NYT poll out ; but I have n’t yet seen a write - up of the campaign details .
So a few nuggets , which will be followed later with a write - up at TPM Election Central .
The internals look significantly better for Obama than Clinton .
For instance , Democrats overwhelmingly think Obama ’s the stronger general election candidate — 56 % to 32 % .
On favorable vs. unfavorable ratings , Obama has the biggest net positive of all three candidates — 19 % .
Clinton has a net negative 1 % .
On “ shares the values of Americans ” , it ’s Obama ( 70 % - 21 % ) , McCain ( 66 % - 27 % ) , Clinton ( 60 % - 34 % ) .
But the numbers are fairly close .
One thing that jumps out at me if the question of who particular candidates would favor — rich , middle class , etc. Obama does ‘ better ’ than Clinton .
But 53 % of voters think McCain would favor the rich — and only 23 % say he ’d treat all economic classes the same .
Still there ’s good news for Hillary and Dems across the board in the horse - race number .
Both Dems beat McCain by five points ( Obama 47 % - 42 % and Clinton 48 % to 43 % ) .
Late Update : The Times now has up their own write - up of the results , which paints a more mixed picture for Obama .
Here ’s the Times pdf of the poll internals .
Here ’s the one from CBS .
I ’d be curious to hear what others think after looking at the crosstabs .
There ’s a notch down in Obama ’s favorables among Democratic primary voters .
And a chunk of Democratic primary voters who had an unfavorable opinion of Clinton appear to have moved into the undecided column .
Overall , though , in most of the key measures that people are now watching , the internals pretty much all look good for Obama and he appears to have been damaged very little by March .
But , again , take a look at the internals and let me know your thoughts .

MAQUILAPOLIS [ city of factories ]
A film by Vicky Funari and Sergio De La Torre A co-production of the Independent Television Service ( ITVS ) .
A project of Creative Capital .
This film was supported by a grant from the Sundance Institute Documentary Fund .
THE FILM Carmen works the graveyard shift in one of Tijuana ’s maquiladoras , the multinationally - owned factories that came to Mexico for its cheap labor .
After making television components all night , Carmen comes home to a shack she built out of recycled garage doors , in a neighborhood with no sewage lines or electricity .
She suffers from kidney damage and lead poisoning from her years of exposure to toxic chemicals .
She earns six dollars a day .
But Carmen is not a victim .
She is a dynamic young woman , busy making a life for herself and her children .
As Carmen and a million other maquiladora workers produce televisions , electrical cables , toys , clothes , batteries and IV tubes , they weave the very fabric of life for consumer nations .
They also confront labor violations , environmental devastation and urban chaos -- life on the frontier of the global economy .
In MAQUILAPOLIS , Carmen and her colleague Lourdes reach beyond the daily struggle for survival to organize for change : Carmen takes a major television manufacturer to task for violating her labor rights .
Lourdes pressures the government to clean up a toxic waste dump left behind by a departing factory .
As they work for change , the world changes too : a global economic crisis and the availability of cheaper labor in China begin to pull the factories away from Tijuana , leaving Carmen , Lourdes and their colleagues with an uncertain future .
THE PROCESS
To create MAQUILAPOLIS , the filmmakers brought together factory workers in Tijuana and community organizations in Mexico and the U.S. to collaborate on a film that depicts globalization through the eyes of the women who live on its leading edge .
The factory workers who appear in the film have been involved in every stage of production , from planning to shooting , from scripting to outreach .
This collaborative process breaks with the traditional documentary practice of dropping into a location , shooting and leaving with the " goods , " which would only repeat the pattern of the maquiladora itself .
The process embraces subjectivity as a value and a goal .
It merges artmaking with community development to ensure that the film 's voice will be truly that of its subjects .
THE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN
We are currently seeking funding to implement a binational Community Outreach Campaign , designed and implemented collaboratively with stakeholder organizations in the U.S. and Mexico .
The campaign utilizes a high - profile public television broadcast , top tier film festivals and community screenings of the film to create meaningful social change around the issues of globalization , social and environmental justice and fair trade .
Our outreach team includes dedicated activists on both sides of the border , mediamakers commited to social change , and most importantly a group of women factory workers struggling to bring about positive change in their world .
Using a set of simple rules for moving and two knifelike feet , a robot in Germany has learned not only how to walk with a remarkably human gait but also how to ascend a ramp .
To be sure , C - 3PO and his cinema cousins have been tottering across movie screens for generations , and real - life walking robots are nothing new .
But the strides made by RunBot , reported in the July issue of the journal Public Library of Science Computational Biology , mark the first time a real - life robot has walked with such grace .
Until now , walking robots like Honda ’s Asimo , which has an advertised ability to run four miles per hour , have relied on heavy - duty computational power , calculating the angle of the knees and ankles every moment of every step .
RunBot , developed in the lab of computational neuroscientist Florentin Wörgötter of the University of Göttingen , takes a simpler , more human approach .
“ Humans do not exert continuous control , ” Wörgötter says .
“ During parts of the walking process , we just fall forward and catch ourselves on the next step . ”
Wörgötter and his colleagues designed RunBot to walk almost automatically , with a simple set of control circuits analyzing data from sensors in the legs and making minor adjustments along the way — a process similar to that of human walking , some neuroscientists believe .
Only when faced with an obstacle like a ramp does RunBot ’s higher - level programming kick in to adjust its strides to walk over the new terrain .
It ’s not just robots that stand to gain from RunBot ’s breakthrough .
Wörgötter wants to adapt his simple control circuitry for artificial human legs to provide amputees a more natural step .

Cloned Hamburger , Anyone ?

Spotting John Loughrey amid the sombre suits and hushed chat of the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand is not that tricky .
There 's the mahogany fake tan ( " I think I rather overdid it this morning - oh dear , it 's all over my hands " ) and the constant greetings by court staff - " Welcome back , John " , " Happy New Year " , and " All set for this afternoon ? "
Oh yes , and the three - inch tall " Diana " written across his forehead in wobbly blue letters and smaller " Dodi " on his cheeks either side of his shiny nose .
Scroll down for more ...
" I 've always been a Diana fan , but last year I woke up one day and decided to paint her name on my forehead - it just felt right , " he says .
" All I knew was that it had to be blue , because it 's a good colour - a royal colour and I know she liked it , so I 've been wearing it ever since .
She 's very important to me . "
So important , indeed , that he has spent 48 days - today will be his 49th - sitting extremely still on the same blue plastic chair in the public gallery of Court 73 , watching the Diana inquest unfold before him .
" All I want is to see that the truth will out .
" And it 's terribly gripping - you 'll see what I mean in a minute . "
And with that , the jury of six women and five men file in , followed by a rather bleary - looking Lord Justice Scott Baker , and the first session of 2008 kicks off with witness number 137 , a man called Grahame William Harding who owns a security firm .
Court 73 is about as far from legal splendour as you can get .
There are banks of computer screens , ranks of modern blue chairs , dozens of grey - suited lawyers and a slightly musty smell of too many people cooped up in one room for too long .
On one side of the public gallery - a roped - off bit at the back - two journalists in crumpled suits get out their notebooks with a sigh .
On the other , a small band of Diana devotees - neat , tidy , grey - haired and armed with noisy carrier bags and clingfilmed sandwiches - mutter , rustle , exchange knowing glances and take important - looking notes as Grahame answers questions about his security business , and John looks like he 's in heaven .
Scroll down for more ...
John has long been a committed royalist - he was second in line for the Queen Mother 's book of condolences , spent four nights sleeping rough in Kensington Gardens following Diana 's death in 1997 and even slept out overnight in Hyde Park on the eve of the opening of the Diana Memorial Fountain .
" I was the only one and I felt very alone .
Everyone loved her - where were they all ? "
But his " quest for the truth " started last September , just after the tenth anniversary of Diana 's death .
" I had a moment of revelation .
It was late at night and I was standing outside Kensington Palace gates looking at the tributes and candles and suddenly I felt four fingers rest on my left shoulder and brush down towards my elbow .
" I knew it was Diana - I 've never felt her so close before .
So I knew what I had to do for her , whatever it took . "
He certainly does n't lack commitment .
As well as giving up his job as a chef at a golf club , letting out his south London flat and moving in with his sister Geraldine in Enfield to help ends meet during the hearing - expected to run at least another three months until the beginning of April - he slept outside the court for the first three nights of the hearing .
" It was very wet and cold , but it was worth it because I was worried I might not get a seat , " he says .
He need n't have .
There are dozens of empty seats in court and the special Diana annex - an enormous white plastic marquee erected outside in one of the courtyards for overflow - is deserted .
" It does n't make sense to me - I thought it'd be mobbed .
Where is everyone else ?
Everyone loved her , but just look at all the empty seats ... it does n't seem right . "
Empty seats or not , he 's not taking any chances .
His alarm goes off at 5 am and he's here by 7 am , waiting outside the main entrance .
Which , given the Royal Courts do n't actually open until nine and there 's never anyone else in the queue , is n't strictly necessary .
But as John puts it : " I was shocked on the first morning , really shocked - I was still the only person here at 8 am , but that 's not the point .
Scroll down for more ...
" I do n't want this to be handed to me on a plate .
It 's not meant to be easy . "
Happily , although it 's hardly full , at least he always has company in the public gallery .
Today there are nine of us and all are very friendly and welcoming .
They greet each other with nods and Happy New Years .
All have favourite seats - John sits in the middle with a clear view of the Coroner and Michael Mansfield QC 's lustrous silver hair - and exchange views on witnesses , cover-ups and whitewashes .
John is unusual in that he thinks Diana 's death was a genuine accident and simply wants all loose ends tied up .
Others , members of the Diana Circle , are rather more strident .
So is there tension with the other " regulars " ?
" I'm the only real regular , no one else has been every day , " he clarifies quickly .
" I tend to get on with everyone , although I do n't like all the chat from the Diana Circle - they say lots of nasty things about Camilla Parker Bowles , and talk about conspiracies , and play Candle In The Wind a lot . "
So far , they must be a bit disappointed .
Since the hearing kicked off last October , there 's been little to fuel their favourite theory that Diana and Dodi were killed by Britain 's security services at the request of the Duke of Edinburgh , to stop their marriage and prevent the Princess giving birth to a Muslim baby .
" Some of them do tend to be a bit paranoid and seem to think there 's a big conspiracy going on - you 'll see what I mean . "
And I do , the moment I get chatting to a very well - spoken lady with immaculate make - up and pretty coral nails , dressed in a plum - coloured tweedy jacket .
" I 'd tell you my name , my dear , but when you 've been threatened in the past and people have tried to kill you , it makes you more careful , " she says cheerily .
" There are quite a few regulars , but first one has to differentiate which are MI5 and MI6 - they 're everywhere .
" That couple who were here earlier , for example .
He seemed a genuine man but he has the type of shoes that police wear , if you know what I mean . "
It barely seems worth asking if she thinks Diana 's death was an accident .
" I think there are a lot of people telling a lot of lies - I used to live with the mistress of a Viscount , in Fulham , so I 've got inside knowledge - but dare I say that ?
Oh well , they want to kill me anyway . "
Oh dear .
Sitting next to me is a man called Lee - Jon who is researching his first book - " a sort of fact - cum - fiction version of Diana 's death - very powerful . "
In another corner is a nice lady called Susan who used to play the clarinet professionally and says she 's related to both the Spencer and Windsor families ( " I have photos that can prove it .
My father is the son of Edward VIII - he had about 20 children . " )
Suddenly , John and his quest for the truth seem rather reassuring .
He might seem a touch eccentric , what with all the blue face paint , but he 's kind and smiley , and his heart's in the right place - he 's collecting the paper passes issued by the court each day so that he can one day sell his collection on eBay in aid of Prince Harry 's Well Child charity .
" I feel it 's my duty .
I hate to blow my own trumpet , but I 'm probably one of Diana 's most loyal supporters ever .
People say I 'm her representative . "
But how about Dodi ?
How has his name - admittedly in smaller letters but still very prominent - made it onto John 's cheeks ?
" I felt sorry for Mohamed Al Fayed .
Dodi was killed as well , so it somehow did n't seem fair not to support him , too . "
And the huge blue Diana on his forehead - is n't it all a bit of a palaver ?
" My sister Geraldine paints it on with a little make - up brush .
" If I do it myself in the mirror , it 's backwards and hard to get the letters the right way round . "
Kind though Geraldine is , she wo n't get up at 5 am for him : " She does it at night , so I have to sleep on my back , which I hate , so it does n't smudge on the pillow . "
And has he ever missed a day ?
" Oh no ! " he says , looking appalled .
" I would n't ... I could n't , never ! "
But does n't it ever get the teeniest bit boring sitting there watching a bunch of lawyers banging on in court for five hours a day ?
" Never .
I love being with lawyers .
I 'm like a lawyer - I think the same way - a bit like Sherlock Holmes , so I feel very at home here .
" I find it so interesting , and I particularly like that Michael Mansfield QC . "
Back in Court 73 , one of the barristers has mentioned " dark forces " and a ripple of excitement passes through the gallery .
The next minute , Grahame the security man has confirmed that there was a device - most likely a bug - found in the wall of the Princess 's bedroom , no less .
Clearly , this is big news .
All the Diana devotees are sitting up like meerkats .
A muscle 's going in John 's cheek and a white - haired lady in the middle has snapped out of a slumber and is taking furious notes .
In fact , for a moment or two , it is genuinely exciting .
And then at 4.15 pm , just as it's getting really gripping , the exhausted - looking judge rubs his eyes and adjourns proceedings for the day .
The Diana disciples are reluctant to leave the court room .
" Did you hear that - dark forces ?
I always said . "
" I knew it was n't an accident ... See you Wednesday . "
" Ooh , I love that Michael Mansfield .
So masterful , and such good hair , do n't you think ? "
And with that , we bid our farewells - I trudge out into the rain , John heads up to the third floor to eat his sandwiches in peace and quiet , and the others linger in a tight little knot , nodding sagely and oohing and aahing .
Will I be joining them again ?
Probably not .
But for a one - off , Court 73 makes for a highly diverting day out and , according to my very excited new friends , it might even be Paul Burrell next week .
Just make sure you get there in plenty of time .

U.S. Rep. Geoff Davis , a Hebron Republican , compared Obama and his message for change similar to a " snake oil salesman " [ at a Northern Kentucky Lincoln Day dinner ] .
He said in his remarks at the GOP dinner that he also recently participated in a " highly classified , national security simulation " with Obama .
" I 'm going to tell you something : That boy 's finger does not need to be on the button , " Davis said .
" He could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country . "
MMgc is the Tamarin ( née Macromedia ) garbage collector , a memory management library that has been built as part of the AVM2 / Tamarin effort .
It is a static library that is linked into the Flash Player but kept separate , and can be incorporated into other programs .
Using MMgc
Managed vs. Unmanaged Memory
MMgc is not only a garbage collector , but a general - purpose memory manager .
The Flash Player uses it for nearly all memory allocations .
MMgc can handle both managed and unmanaged memory .
Managed memory is memory that is reclaimed automatically by the garbage collector .
The garbage collector is " managing " it , detecting when the memory is no longer reachable from anywhere in the application and reclaiming it at that time .
In MMgc , you get managed memory by subclassing GCObject / GCFinalizedObject / RCObject , or by calling GC : : Alloc .
Unmanaged memory is everything else .
This is C++ memory management as you 're accustomed to it .
Memory can be allocated with the new operator , and must be explicitly deleted in your C++ code at some later time using the delete operator .
Another way to think about it :
Unmanaged memory is C++ operators new and delete
and Managed memory is C++ operator new , with optional delete
MMgc contains a page allocator called GCHeap , which allocates large blocks ( megabytes ) of memory from the system and doles out 4KB pages to the unmanaged memory allocator ( FixedMalloc ) and the managed memory allocator ( GC ) .
MMgc namespace
The MMgc library is in the C++ namespace MMgc .
You can qualify references to classes in the library ; for example : MMgc:: GC , MMgc:: GCFinalizedObject .
Alternately , you can open the MMgc namespace in your C++ source so that you can refer to the objects more concisely :
using namespace MMgc ; ... GC * gc = GC :: GetGC ( this ) ; GCObject * gcObject ;
GC class
The class MMgc:: GC is the main class of the GC .
It represents a full , self - contained instance of the garbage collector .
It may be multiply instantiated ; you may have multiple instances of the garbage collector running at once .
Each instance manages its own set of objects ; objects are not allowed to reference objects in other GC instances .
The GC typically is constructed early in your program 's initialization , and then passed to operations like operator new for allocating GC objects .
There are a few methods that you may need to call directly , such as Alloc and Free .
GC : : Alloc , GC :: Free
The Alloc and Free methods are garbage - collected analogs for malloc and free .
Memory allocated with Alloc does n't need to be explicitly freed , although it can be freed with Free if it is known that there are no other references to it .
Alloc is often used to allocate arrays and other objects of variable size that contain GC pointers or are otherwise desirable to have in managed memory .
These flags may be passed to Alloc to control the allocation type .
/** * flags to be passed as second argument to alloc */ enum AllocFlags { kZero=1 , kContainsPointers=2 , kFinalize=4 , kRCObject=8 } ;
k Zero zeros out the memory .
Otherwise , the memory contains undefined values .
kContainsPointers indicates to the GC that the memory will contain pointers to other GC objects , and thus needs to be scanned by the GC 's mark phase .
If you know for certain that the objects will not contain GC pointers , leave this flag off ; it will make the mark phase faster by excluding your object .
k Finalize and kRCObject are used internally by the GC ; you should not need to set them in your user code .
GC ::GetGC
Given the pointer to any GCObject , it is possible to get a pointer to the GC object that allocated it .
void GCObject :: Method ( ) { GC * gc = MMgc:: GC::GetGC( this ) ; ... }
This practice should be used sparingly , but is sometimes useful .
Base Classes
GCObject
A basic garbage collected object .
A GCObject is allocated with parameterized operator new , passing the MMgc:: GC object :
class MyObject : public MMgc:: GCObject { ... } ; MyObject * myObject = new ( gc ) MyObject ( ) ;
Any pointers to a GCObject from unmanaged memory require the unmanaged object to be a GCRoot .
class MyUnmanagedObject : public MMgc:: GCRoot { MyObject * object ; } ;
Any pointers to a GCObject from managed memory require a DWB write barrier macro .
class MyOtherManagedObject : public MMgc:: GCObject { DWB ( MyObject * ) object ; } ;
Now for the good part ... there is no need to delete instances of MyObject , because the GC will clean them up automatically when they are unreachable .
However , a GCObject can be deleted explicitly with the delete operator .
Only do this if you know for certain that there are no other references , and you want to help the GC along :
// Optimization :
Get rid of myObject now , because we know there are no other // references , so no need to wait for GC to clean it up .
delete myObject ;
The destructor for a GCObject will never be called ( unless the object is also a descendant of GCFinalized Object ... see below . )
class MyObject : public MMgc:: GCObject { ~ MyObject ( ) { assert ( !" this will never be hit ( unless we also descend from GCFinalizedObject ) " ) ; } } ;
GCObject::GetWeakRef
GCWeakRef * GetWeakRef ( ) const ;
The GetWeakRef method returns a weak reference to the object .
Normally , a pointer to the object is considered a hard reference -- any such reference will prevent the object from being destroyed .
Sometimes , it is desirable to hold a pointer to a GCObject , but to let the object be destroyed if there are no other references .
GCWeakRef can be used for this purpose .
It has a get method which returns the pointer to the original object , or NULL if that object has already been destroyed .
GCFinalizedObject
Base class : GCObject
A garbage collected object with finalization support .
All of the rules from GCObject above apply to GCFinalized Object .
The finalizer ( C++ destructor ) of a GCFinalizedObject will be invoked when MMgc collects the object .
class MyFinalizedObject : public MMgc::GCFinalizedObject { public : ~ MyFinalizedObject ( ) { //
Do finalization behavior , like closing network connections , // freeing unmanaged memory owned by this object , etc. } } ;
RCObject
Base class : GCFinalizedObject
This is a reference - counted , garbage collected object .
RCObject is used instead of GCObject when more immediate reclamation of memory is desired .
For instance , the avmplus : : String class in AVM + is a RCObject .
Strings are created very frequently , and are often temporary objects with very short lifetimes .
By making them RCObjects , the GC is able to reclaim them much faster and limit memory growth .
All of the rules for GCObject apply to RCObject , and there are a few more :
Any pointer to a RCObject from unmanaged memory must use the DRC macro .
class MyObject : public MMgc:: RCObject { ... } ; class MyUnmanagedObject : public MMgc:: GCRoot { DRC ( MyObject * ) myObject ; } ;
Any pointer to a RCObject from managed ( GC ) memory must use the DRCWB macro .
This is true whether the object containing the pointer is GCObject or RCObject .
class MyObject : public MMgc:: RCObject { ... } ; class MyOtherManagedGCObject : public MMgc:: GCObject { DRCWB ( MyObject * ) myObject ; } ; class MyOtherManagedRCObject : public MMgc:: RCObject { DRCWB ( MyObject * ) myObject ; } ;
The RCObject must zero itself out on deletion .
For this reason , RCObject 's always have finalizers .
Declare a destructor that zeros out all of the fields of your RCObject .
See Zeroing RCObjects for more information .
class MyObject : public MMgc:: RCObject { public : MyObject ( ) { x = 1 ; y = 2 ; z = 3 ; } ~ MyObject ( ) { x = y = z = 0 ; } private : int x ; int y ; int z ; } ;
GCRoot
If you have a pointer to a GCObject from an object in unmanaged memory , the unmanaged object must be a subclass of GCRoot .
GCRoot must be subclassed by any unmanaged memory class that holds GC pointers .
class MyGCObject : public MMgc:: GCObject { ... } ; class MyGCRoot : public MMgc:: GCRoot { MyGCObject * myGCObject ; } ;
Note that a GCRoot is NOT a garbage - collected object .
It is an unmanaged memory object that contains GC pointers .
MMgc keeps a list of all GCRoots in the system and makes sure that it marks them .
GCRoots are generally expected to be allocated using MMgc 's unmanaged memory allocators , so that MMgc can figure out how big the GCRoot object is .
Use of GCRoot is required to have GC pointers from unmanaged memory , since without GCRoot , those pointers wo n't be marked by the mark phase of the GC .
Note that GCRoot can be used either by subclassing , or by creating a GCRoot and passing it the memory locations to treat as a root :
/** subclassing constructor */ GCRoot ( GC * gc ) ; /** general constructor */ GCRoot ( GC * gc , const void * object , size_t size ) ;
Allocating objects
Allocating unmanaged objects is as simple as using global operator new / delete , the same way you always have .
To allocate a managed ( GC ) object , you must use the parameterized form of operator new , and pass it a reference to the MMgc: : GC object .
class MyObject : public MMgc:: GCObject { ... } ; ... MyObject * myObject = new ( gc ) MyObject ( ) ;
DWB / DRC/DRCWB
There are several smart pointer templates which must be used in your C++ code to work properly with MMgc .
DWB
DWB stands for Declared Write Barrier .
It must be used on a pointer to a GCObject / GCFinalizedObject , when that pointer is a member variable of a class derived from GCObject / GCFinalizedObject / RCObject/RCFinalizedObject .
class MyManagedClass : public MMgc:: GCObject { // MyManagedClass is a GCObject , and // avmplus :: Hashtable is a GCObject , so use DWB DWB ( avmplus :: Hashtable * ) myTable ; } ;
DRC
DRC stands for Deferred Reference Counted .
It must be used on a pointer to a RCObject / RCFinalizedObject , when that pointer is a member variable of a C++ class in unmanaged memory .
class MyUnmanagedClass { // MyUnmanagedClass is not a GCObject , and // avmplus :: Stringp is a RCObject , so use DRC DRC ( Stringp ) myString ; } ;
DRCWB
DRCWB stands for Deferred Reference Counted , with Write Barrier .
It must be used on a pointer to a RCObject / RCFinalizedObject , when that pointer is a member variable of a class derived from GCObject / GCFinalizedObject / RCObject/RCFinalizedObject .
class MyManagedClass : public MMgc:: GCObject { // MyManagedClass is a GCObject , and // avmplus :: Stringp is a RCObject , so use DRCWB DRCWB ( Stringp ) myString ; } ;
When are the macros not needed ?
Write barriers are not needed for stack - based local variables , regardless of whether the object pointed to is GCObject , GCFinalizedObject , RCObject or RCFinalizedObject .
The GC marks the entire stack during collection , and not incrementally , so write barriers are n't needed .
Write barriers are not needed for pointers to GC objects from unmanaged memory ( GCRoot ) .
GCRoots are marked at the end of the mark phase , and not incrementally , so no write barriers are required .
DRC ( ) is required for RC objects , since the reference count must be maintained .
Write barriers are not needed for C++ objects that exist purely on the stack , and never in the heap .
The Flash Player class " NativeInfo " is a good example .
Such objects are essentially the same as stack - based local variables .
Zeroing RCObjects
All RCObjects ( including all subclasses ) must zero themselves out completely upon destruction .
Asserts enforce this .
The reason is that our collector zeroes memory upon free and this was hurting performance .
Since MMgc must traverse objects to decrement refcounts properly upon destruction , I just made destructors do zeroing too .
This mostly applies to non-pointer fields as DRCWB smart pointers do this for you .
Poisoned Memory
In DEBUG builds , MMgc writes " poison " into deallocated memory as a debugging aid .
Here 's what the different poison values mean :
0 xfafafafa Uninitialized unmanaged memory 0xedededed Unmanaged memory that was freed explicitly 0 xbabababa Managed memory that was freed by the Sweep phase of the garbage collector 0 xcacacaca Managed memory that was freed by an explicit call to GC : : Free ( including DRC reaping ) 0xdeadbeef
This is written to the 4 bytes just after any object allocated via MMgc .
It is used for overwrite detection .
0xfbfbfbfb A block given back to the heap manager is memset to this ( fb == free block ) .
Finalizers
If your C++ class is a subclass of GCFinalizedObject or RCFinalizedObject , it has finalizer support .
A finalizer is a method which will be invoked by the GC when an unreachable object is about to be destroyed .
It 's similar to a destructor .
It differs from a destructor in that it is usually called nondeterministically , i.e. in whatever random order the GC decides to destroy objects .
C++ destructors are usually invoked in a comparatively predictable order , since they 're invoked explicitly by the application code .
In MMgc , the C++ destructor is actually used as the finalizer .
If you do n't subclass GCFinalizedObject or RCFinalizedObject , any C++ destructor on your garbage collected class will basically be ignored .
Only if you subclass GCFinalizedObject or RCFinalizedObject will MMgc know that you want finalization behavior on your class .
It 's best to avoid finalizers if you can , since finalization behavior can be unpredictable and nondeterministic , and also slows down the GC since the finalizers need to be invoked .
Finalizer Access Rules
Finalizers are very restricted in the set of objects they may access .
Finalizers may not perform any of the following actions :
Fire any write barriers
Dereference a pointer to any GC object , including member variables ( except see below about RCObject references )
Allocate any GC memory ( GC :: Alloc ) , explicitly free GC memory ( GC :: Free )
) , explicitly free GC memory ( )
Change the set of GC roots ( create a GCRoot object or derivative )
Cause itself to become reachable
If a finalized object holds a reference to an RCObject , it may safely call decrementref on the RCObject .
Threading
The GC routines are not currently thread safe , we 're operating under the assumption that none of the player spawned threads create GC'd things .
If this is n't true we hope to eliminate other threads from doing this and if we can't do that we will be forced to make our GC thread safe , although we hope we do n't have to do that .
Threading gets more complicated because it makes sense to re-write ChunkMalloc and ChunkAllocBase to get their blocks from the GCHeap .
They can also take advantage of the 4 K boundary to eliminate the 4 byte per allocation penalty .
Troubleshooting MMgc
Dealing with bugs
GC bugs are hard .
Forgetting a write barrier
If you forget to put a write barrier on a pointer , the incremental mark process might miss the pointer being changed .
The result will be an object that your code has a pointer to , but which the GC thinks is unreachable .
The GC will destroy the object , and later you will crash with a dangling pointer .
When you crash with what looks like a dangling pointer to a GC object , check for missing write barriers in the vicinity .
Forgetting a DRC
If you forget to put a DRC macro on a pointer to an RCObject from unmanaged memory , you can get a dangling pointer .
The reference count of the object may go to zero , and the object will be placed in the ZCT .
Later , the ZCT will be reaped and the object will be destroyed .
But you still have a pointer to it .
When you dereference the pointer later , you 'll crash with a dangling pointer .
When you crash with what looks like a dangling pointer to a RC object , look at who refers to the object .
See if there are missing DRC macros that need to be put in .
Wrong macro
If you put DWB instead of DRCWB , you 'll avoid dangling pointer issues from a missing write barrier , but you might hit dangling pointer issues from a zero reference count .
If you crash with a dangling pointer to a RC object , check for DWB macros that need to be DRCWB .
Unmarked unmanaged memory
If you have pointers to GC objects in your unmanaged memory objects , the unmanaged objects need to be GCRoots .
GCRoots are known to the GC and will be marked during a collection .
Pointers must be marked for the GC to consider the objects " live " ; otherwise , the objects will be considered unreachable and will be destroyed .
And you 'll be left with dangling pointers to these destroyed objects .
If you get a crash dereferencing a pointer to a GC object , and the pointer was a member variable in an unmanaged ( non - GC ) object , check whether the unmanaged object is a GCRoot .
If it is n't , maybe it needs to be .
Finding missing write barriers
There are some automatic aids in the MMgc library which can help you find missing write barriers .
Look in MMgc / GC.cpp .
// before sweeping we check for missing write barriers bool GC :: incrementalValidation = false ;
// check for missing write barriers at every Alloc bool GC ::incrementalValidationPedantic = false ;
If you suspect you have missing write barriers , turn these switches on in a DEBUG build .
( The second switch will slow your application down a lot more than the first switch , so you could try the first , then the second . )
When a missing write barrier is detected , MMgc will assert and drop you into the debugger , and will print out a message telling you which object contained the missing write barrier , the address of the member variable that needs it , and what object did n't get marked due to the missing write barrier .
Sometimes , this missing write barrier detection will turn up a false positive .
If you can't find anything wrong with the code , it might just be a false positive .
Debugging Aids
MMgc has several debugging aids that can be useful in your development work .
Underwrite / overwrite detection
MMgc can often detect when you write outside the boundaries of an object , and will throw an assert in debugging builds when this happens .
Leak detection ( for unmanaged memory )
When the application is exiting , MMgc will detect memory leaks in its unmanaged memory allocators and print out the addresses and sizes of the leaked objects , and stack traces if stack traces are enabled .
Stack traces are enabled via the MMGC_MEMORY_PROFILER feature and setting the MMGC_PROFILE environment variable to 1 .
The MMGC_MEMORY_PROFILER feature is implied by the debugger feature and is always on in DEBUG builds .
Deleted object poisoning and write detection
MMgc will " poison " memory for deleted objects , and will detect if the poison has been written over by the application , which would indicate a write to a deleted object .
Stack traces ( walk stack frame and lookup IPs )
When #define MEMORY_INFO is on , MMgc will capture a stack trace for every object allocation .
This slows the application down but can be invaluable when debugging .
Memory leaks will be displayed with their stack trace of origin .
Sample stack trace :
xmlclass.cpp:391 toplevel.cpp:164 toplevel.cpp:507 interpreter.cpp:1098 interpreter.cpp:20 methodenv.cpp:47
Allocation traces , deletion traces etc .
If you 're trying to see why memory is not getting reclaimed ; GC : : WhosPointingAtMe ( ) can be called from the msvc debugger and will spit out objects that are pointing to the given memory location .
Memory Profiler
MMgc 's memory profiler can display the state of your application 's heap , showing the different classes of object in memory , along with object counts , byte counts , and percentage of total memory .
It can also display stack traces for where every object was allocated .
The report can be output to the console or to a file , and can be configured to be displayed pre/post sweep or via API call .
The Memory Profiler use sRTTI and stack traces to get information by location and type :
class avmplus :: GrowableBuffer - 24.9 % - 3015 kb 514 items , avg 6007 b 98.9 % - 2983 kb - 512 items - poolobject.cpp:29 abcparser.cpp:948 … 0.8 % - 24 kb - 1 items - poolobject.cpp:29 abcparser.cpp:948 … class avmplus :: String - 13.2 % - 1602 kb 15675 items , avg 104 b 65.6 % - 1051 kb - 14397 items - stringobject.cpp:46 avmcore.cpp:2300 … 20.4 % - 326 kb - 10439 items - avmcore.cpp:2300 abcparser.cpp:1077 … 6.5 % - 103 kb - 3311 items - avmcore.cpp:2300 abcparser.cpp:1077 …
The gcstats flag on the GC object controls verbose output .
In the avmshell this is enable with the - memstats flag .
Output looks like this :
[ mem ]
------- gross stats ----- [ mem ] private 5877 ( 23.0 M ) 100 % [ mem ] mmgc 5792 ( 22.6 M ) 98 % [ mem ] unmanaged 13 ( 52 K ) 0 % [ mem ] managed 2596 ( 10.1 M ) 44 % [ mem ] free 3081 ( 12.0 M ) 52 % [ mem ] jit 0 ( 0 K ) 0 % [ mem ] other 85 ( 340 K ) 1 % [ mem ] bytes ( interal fragmentation ) 2527 ( 9.9M ) 96 % [ mem ] managed bytes 2520 ( 9.8 M ) 97 % [ mem ] unmanaged bytes 7 ( 28 K ) 53 % [ mem ]
-------- gross stats end -----
Numbers are in pages ( with M and K in parens ) .
Private is the number of private committed pages in the process , mmgc is the amount of memory GCHeap has asked for from the OS ( not including JIT ) .
FixedMalloc vs. GC allocations are shown in the unmanaged vs. managed split .
Free is the amount of memory GCHeap is holding onto that is n't in use by the mutator .
Other is the delta between private and mmgc , it includes things like system malloc , stacks , loaded library data areas etc .
When this is enable this information is logged everytime we log something interesting .
So far something interesting means an incremental mark cycle , a sweep or a DRC reap .
They are logged like this :
[ mem ] sweep ( 21 ) reclaimed 910 whole pages ( 3640 kb ) in 22.66 millis ( 2.4975 s ) [ mem ] mark ( 1 ) 0 objects ( 180866 kb 205162 mb /s ) in 0.88 millis ( 2.5195 s ) [ mem ] DRC reaped 114040 objects ( 3563 kb ) freeing 903 pages ( 7800 kb ) in 17.41 millis ( 2.0015 s )
How MMgc works
Mark / Sweep
The MMgc garbage collector uses a mark / sweep algorithm .
This is one of the most common garbage collection algorithms .
Every object in the system has an associated " mark bit . "
A garbage collection is divided into two phases : Mark and Sweep .
In the Mark phase , all of the mark bits are cleared .
The garbage collector is aware of " roots " , which are starting points from which all " live " application data should be reachable .
The collector starts scanning objects , starting at the roots and fanning outwards .
For every object it encounters , it sets the mark bit .
When the Mark phase concludes , the Sweep phase begins .
In the Sweep phase , every object that was n't marked in the Mark phase is destroyed and its memory reclaimed .
If an object did n't have its mark bit set during the Mark phase , that means it was n't reachable from the roots anymore , and thus was not reachable from anywhere in the application code .
The following Flash animation illustrates the working of a mark / sweep collector :
( temporarily not working ) < gflash >600 300 GC.swf </gflash >
One pass
The mark sweep algorithm described above decomposes into ClearMarks / Mark / Finalize / Sweep .
In our original implementation ClearMarks / Finalize / Sweep visited every GC page and every object on that page .
3 passes !
Now we have one pass where marks are cleared during sweep so clear marks is n't needed at the start .
Also Finalize builds up a lists of pages that need sweeping so sweep does n't need to visit every page .
This has been shown to cut the Finalize / Sweep pause in half ( which happens back to back atomically ) .
Overall this was n't a huge performance increase due to the fact the majority of our time is spent in the Mark phase .
Conservative Collection
MMgc is a conservative mark / sweep collector .
Conservative means that it may not reclaim all of the memory that it is possible to reclaim ; it will sometimes make a " conservative " decision and not reclaim memory that might 've actually been free .
Why make the collector conservative ?
It simplifies writing C++ application code to run on top of the collector .
The alternative to conservative collection is exact collection .
To do exact colllection , every C++ class and variable would need to specify exactly which variable contained a GC pointer or not .
This is a lot to ask from our C++ developers , so instead , MMgc assumes that every memory location might potentially contain a GC pointer .
That means that it might occasionally turn up a " false positive . "
A false positive is a memory location that looks like it contains a pointer to a GC object , but it 's really just some JPEG image data or an integer variable or some other unrelated data .
When the GC encounters a false positive , it has to assume that it MIGHT be a pointer since it does n't have an exact description of whether that memory is a pointer or not .
So , the not - really - pointed - to object will be leaked .
Memory leaks do n't sound like an OK thing , right ?
Well , memory leaks that result from programmer error tend to be bad leaks ... leaks that grow over time .
With such a leak , you can be pushing hundreds of megabytes of RAM real quick .
With a conservative GC , the leaks tend to be random , such that they do n't grow over time .
The occasional random leak from a false positive can be OK .
That does n't mean we should n't worry about it at all , but often conservative GC suffices .
It is possible that a future version of MMgc might do exact marking .
This would be needed for a generational collector .
Deferred Reference Counting ( DRC )
MMgc uses Deferred Reference Counting ( DRC ) .
DRC is a scheme for getting more immediate reclamation of objects , while still achieving high performance and getting the other benefits of garbage collection .
Classic Reference Counting
Previous versions of the Flash Player , up to Flash Player 7 , used reference counting to track object lifetimes .
class Object { public : Object ( ) { refCount = 0 ; } void AddRef ( ) { refCount ++ ; } void Release ( ) { if (!-- refCount ) delete this ; } int refCount ; }
Reference counting is a kind of automatic memory management .
Reference counting can track relationships between objects , and as long as AddRef and Release are called at the proper times , can reclaim memory from objects that are no longer referenced .
Problem : Circular References
Reference counting falls down when circular references occur in objects .
If object A and object B are reference counted and refer to each other , their reference counts will both be nonzero even if no other objects in the system point to them .
Locked in this embrace , they will never be destroyed .
This is where garbage collection helps .
Mark / sweep garbage collection can detect that these objects containing circular references are really not reachable from anywhere else in the application , and can reclaim them .
The problem with going from reference counting to pure mark / sweep garbage collection is that a lot of time may be spent in the garbage collector .
This time will pause the entire application , and give the impression of poor performance .
Even with an incremental collector that does n't have big pauses , a GC sweep only kicks in every so often , so memory usage can grow very quickly to a high peak before the GC collects unused objects .
So , some kind of reference counting is still attractive to lower the amount of work the GC has to do , and to get more immediacy on memory reclamation .
However , reference counting is also slow because the reference counts need to be constantly maintained .
So , it 's attractive to find some form of reference counting that does n't require maintaining reference counts for every single reference .
Enter Deferred Reference Counting
In Deferred Reference Counting , a distinction is made between heap and stack references .
Stack references to objects tend to be very temporary in nature .
Stack frames come and go very quickly .
So , performance can be gained by not performing reference counting on the stack references .
Heap references are different since they can persist for long periods of time .
So , in a DRC scheme , we continue to maintain reference counts in heap - based objects .
So , reference counts are only maintained to heap - to - heap references .
We basically ignore the stack and registers .
They are considered stack memory .
Zero Count Table
Of course , when an object 's reference count goes to zero , what happens ?
If the object was immediately destroyed , that could leave dangling pointers on the stack , since we did n't bump up the object 's reference count when stack references were made to it .
To deal with this , there is a mechanism called the Zero Count Table ( ZCT ) .
When an object reaches zero reference count , it is not immediately destroyed ; instead , it is put in the ZCT .
When the ZCT is full , it is " reaped " to destroy some objects .
If an object is in the ZCT , it is known that there are no heap references to it .
So , there can only be stack references to it .
MMgc scans the stack to see if there are any stack references to ZCT objects .
Any objects in the ZCT that are NOT found on the stack are deleted .
Incremental Collection
The Flash Player is frequently used for animations and video that must maintain a certain framerate to play properly .
Applications are also getting larger and larger and consuming more memory with scripting giving way to full fledged application component models ( ala Flex ) .
Unfortunately the flash player suffers a periodic pause ( at least every 60 seconds ) due to garbage collection requirements that may cause unbounded pauses ( the GC pause is proportional to the amount of memory the application is using ) .
One way to avoid this unbounded pause is to break up the work the GC needs to do into " increments " .
In order to collect garbage we must trace all the live objects and mark them .
This is the part of the GC work that takes the most time and the part that needs to be incrementalized .
In order to incrementalize marking it needs to be a process that can be stopped and started .
Our marking algorithm is a conservative marking algorithm that makes marking automatic , there are no Mark ( ) methods the GC engine needs to call , marking is simply a tight loop that processes a queue .
The way it works is that all GC roots are registered with the GC library and it can mark everything by traversing the roots .
At the beginning all the GC roots are pushed onto the work queue .
Items on the queue are conservatively marked and unmarked GC pointers discovered while processing each item are pushed on to the queue .
When the queue is empty all the marking is complete .
Thus the queue itself is a perfect way to maintain marking state between marking increments .
This is n't an accident , the GC system was in part designed this way so that it could be easily incrementalized .
The problem then becomes :
How to account for the fact that the mutator is changing the state of the heap between marking increments
How much time to spend marking in each increment
Mark consistency
A correct collector never deletes a live object ( duh ) .
In order to be correct we must account for a new or unmarked object being stored into an object we 've already marked .
In implementation terms this means a new or unmarked object is stored in an object that has already been processed by the marking algorithm and is no longer in the queue .
Unless we do something we will delete this object and leave a dangling pointer to it in its referent .
There are a couple different techniques for this , but the most popular one based on some research uses a tri-color algorithm with write barriers .
Every object has 3 states : black , gray and white .
Black means the object has been marked and is no longer in the work queue Gray means the object is in the work queue but not yet marked
White means the object is n't in the work queue and has n't been marked
The first increment will push all the roots on to the queue , thus after this step all the roots are gray and everything else is white .
As the queue is processed all live objects go through two steps , from gray to black and white to gray .
Whenever a pointer to a white object is written to a black object we have to intercept that write and remember to go back and put the white object in the work queue , that 's what a write barrier does .
The other scenarios we do n't care about :
Gray written to Black / Gray / White - since the object is gray its on the queue and will be marked before we sweep
White written to Gray - the white object will be marked as reachable when the gray object is marked White written to White - the referant will either eventually become gray if its reachable or not in which case both objects will get marked Black written to Black / Gray / White - its black , its already been marked
So a write barrier needs to be inserted anywhere we could possibly store a pointer to a white object into a black object .
In practice this means :
Setting a property on an object to another object ( creating an arch in the reachabilty graph )
Native code that writes a pointer to a GC object into another GC object Writing an object to a GC root
1 and 2 are pretty well isolated .
1 is the SetSlot method in the AVM - and some assembly code in the AVM +.
# 2 can be found by examining all non-const methods of GC objects ( and making all fields private , something the AVM + code base does already ) .
# 3 is a little harder because there are a good # of GC roots .
This is an unfortunate artifact of the existing code base , the AVM + is relatively clean and its reachability graph consists of basically 2 GC roots ( the AvmCore and URLStreams ) but the AVM - has a bunch ( currently includes SecurityCallbackData , MovieClipLoader , CameraInstance , FAPPacket , MicrophoneInstance , CSoundChannel , URLRequest , ResponceObject , URLStream and UrlStreamSecurity ) .
In order to make things easier we could avoid WB 's for # 3 by marking the root set twice .
The first increment pushes the root set on to the queue and when the queue is empty we process the root set again , this second root set processing should very fast since the majority of objects should already be marked and the root set is usually small ( marked objects are ignored and not pushed on to the work queue ) .
This would mean that developers would only have to take into account # 2 really when writing new code .
Illustration of Write Barriers
The following Flash animation demonstrates how a write barrier works .
( temporarily not working ) < gflash >600 300 GC2.swf</gflash >
Detecting missing Write Barriers
To make sure that we injected write barriers into all the right places we plan on implementing a debug mode that will search for missing write barriers .
The signature of a missing write barrier is a black to white pointer that exists right before we sweep , after the sweep the pointer will point to deleted memory .
Also we can check throughout the incremental mark by making sure any black -> white pointers have been recorded by the write barrier .
Furthermore we can run this check even more frequently than every mark increment , for instance every time our GC memory allocators request a new block from our primary allocator ( the way our extremely helpful greedy collection mode works ) .
This would of course be slow but with good code coverage should be capable of finding all missing write barriers .
Only checking for missing write barriers before every sweep will probably be a small enough performance impact to enable it in DEBUG builds .
The more frequent ones will have to be turned on manually .
Write Barrier Implementation
There are a couple options for implementing write barriers .
At the finest level of granularity everytime a a white object is written to a black object we push the white object onto the work queue ( thus making it grey ) .
Another solution is to put the black object on the work queue , thus if multiple writes occur to the black object we only needed one push on the the queue .
This could be a significant speedup if the black object was a large array getting populated with a bunch of new objects .
On the other hand if the black is a huge array and only a couple slots had new objects written to them we are wasting time by marking the whole thing .
A popular solution to this is what 's called card marking .
Here you divide memory into " cards " and when a white object is written to a black object you mark the card containing the slot the pointer to the white object was written to .
After all marking is done you circle back and remark the black portion of any card that was flagged by the write barrier .
There are two techniques to optimize this process .
One is to save all the addresses of all pages that had cards marked ( so you do n't have to bring every page into memory to check its hand , so to speak ) .
Another option is to check every page while doing the normal marking and it any of its cards where flagged handle them immediately since your already reading / writing from that page .
The result will be at the end of the mark cycle fewer things need to be marked .
These two optimizations can be combined .
Increment Time Slice
Before diving into the this it should be acknowledged that another way to go about this is to use a background thread and not worry about incremental marking .
This approach was not chosen for the following reasons :
Coordinating the marking thread and the main thread will require locking and may suffer due to lock overhead / contention Supporting Mac classic 's cooperative threads makes this approach harder Flash 's frame based architecture gives us a very natural place to do this work
We have better control over how much time is spent marking without threads
When SMP systems become more prevalent it may be worth investigating this approach because true parallelism may afford better performance .
Another point to consider is whether marking should always be on or should be turned on and off at some point based on memory allocation patterns .
I think we want the later because :
All WB 's take the fast path when we 're not marking , so the more time we spend out of the marking phase the better performance will be overall Applications that have low or steady state memory requirements should n't suffer any marking penalty
The first thing to determine is when we decide to start marking .
Currently we make the decision on when to do a collection based on how much memory has been allocated since the last collection , if its over a certain fraction of the the total heap size we do a collection and if its not we expand .
Similarly we can base the decision on when to start marking when we 've consumed a certain portion of the heap since the last collection , call this the ISD ( incremental start divisor ) .
So if we go with an ISD of 4 we start marking when a quarter of the heap is left and an ISD of 1 means we 're always marking .
Now that we know when we start marking there are two conflicting goals to achieve in selecting the marking time slice :
Maintain the frame rate
Make sure the collector gets to the sweep stage soon enough to avoid too much heap expansion
If we do n't maintain the frame rate the movie will appear to pause and if we do n't mark fast enough the mutator could get ahread of the collector and allocate memory so fast that the collection never finishes and memory grows unbounded .
The ideal solution will result in only one mark incremental per frame unless the mutator is allocating memory so fast we need to mark more aggressively to get to the sweep .
So the frequency of the incremental marking will be based on two factors : the rate at which we can trace memory and the rate at which the mutator is requesting more memory .
Study of real world apps will be used to determine how best to factor these to rates together .
GCHeap
The GC library has a tiered memory allocation strategy , consisting of 3 parts :
A page - granular memory allocator called the GCHeap A set of fixed size allocators for sizes up to 2 K A large allocator for items over 2K
When you want to allocate something we figure out what size class it 's in and then ask that allocator for the memory .
Each fixed size allocator maintains a doubly linked list of 4 K blocks that it obtains from the GCHeap .
These 4 K blocks are aligned on 4 K boundaries so we can easily allocate everything on 8 - byte boundaries ( a necessary consequence of the 32 - bit atom design -- 3 type bits and 29 pointer bits ) .
Also we store the GCAlloc: : GCBlock structure at the beginning of the 4 K block so each allocation does n't need a pointer to its block ( just zero the lower 12 bits of any GC - allocated thing to get the GCBlock pointer ) .
The GCBlock contains bitmaps for marking and indicating if an item has a destructor that needs to be called ( a GCFinalized Object base class exists defining a virtual destructor for GC items that need it ) .
Deleted items are stored in a per- block free list which is used if there are any otherwise we get the next free item at the end .
If we do n't have anything free and we reach the end , we get another block from the GCHeap .
GCHeap 's reserve / commit strategy
GCHeap reserves 16MB of address space per heap region .
The goal of reserving so much address space is so that subsequent expansions of the heap are able to obtain contiguous memory blocks .
If we can keep the heap contiguous , that reduces fragmentation and the possibility of many small " Balkanized " heap regions .
Reserving 16 MB of space per heap region should not be a big deal in a 2GB address space ... it would take a lot of Player instances running simultaneously to exhaust the 2GB address space of the browser process .
By allocating contiguous blocks of address space and managing them ourselves , fragmentation of the IE heap may actually be decreased .
On Windows , this uses the VirtualAlloc API to obtain memory .
On Mac OS X and Unix , we use mmap .
VirtualAlloc and mmap can reserve memory and / or commit memory .
Reserved memory is just virtual address space .
It consumes the address space of the process but is n't really allocated yet ; there are no pages committed to it yet .
Memory allocation really occurs when reserved pages are committed .
Our strategy in GCHeap is to reserve a fairly large chunk of address space , and then commit pages from it as needed .
By doing this , we 're more likely to get contiguous regions in memory for our heap .
GCHeap serves up 4 K blocks to the size class allocators or groups of contiguous 4 K blocks for requests from the large allocator .
It maintains a free list and blocks are coalesced with their neighbors when freed .
If we use up the 16MB reserved chunk , we reserve another one , contiguously with the previous if possible .
When memory mapping is not available
GCHeap can fall back on a malloc / free approach for obtaining memory if a memory mapping API like VirtualAlloc or mmap is not available .
In this case , GCHeap will allocate exactly as much memory as is requested when the heap is expanded and not try to reserve additional memory pages to expand into .
GCHeap wo n't attempt to allocate contiguous regions in this case .
Forget Bush , White House press corps captivated by pan flute master Zamfir
Forget about President Bush , Vladimir Putin and matters of international security at the NATO summit .
It was Zamfir , " Master of the Pan Flute , " who captivated the White House press corps in Bucharest on Friday .
Zamfir , the native Romanian and gypsy music virtuoso , played a lively 30 - minute set of traditional tunes for journalists covering President Bush 's visit here .
Although his popularity in Europe never quite seemed to catch on across the Atlantic , Zamfir made his mark on American television in the 1980s with late - night infomercials that seemed to be everywhere .
On Friday , as NATO leaders met behind closed doors with Putin , Zamfir and an energetic septet rocked the White House press filing center .
It was believed to be an unprecedented performance in the normally staid quarters .
" I can safely say that we have never seen anything like this before , " said CBS correspondent Bill Plante , who has covered the White House since 1981 and , like many of his colleagues , remembered all too well the explosion of Zamfir commercials two decades ago .
" We can all say we grew up with Zamfir , " said a surprised and amused National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
Zamfir , himself , eschewed world politics .
He gestured to his band and said " It 's all about my music , " when asked for his thoughts on the NATO summit .
His appearance , at the invitation of a television news producer , came two days after the press corps was presented with an informational packet about famous Romanians  one that placed the pan-flutist among the most recognizable and well - known citizens .

Sen .
Barack Obama dominated yesterdays Potomac primaries by easily winning the Democratic contests in the District , Maryland and Virginia running his victory streak to eight in a row Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton looked to tamp down her rivals rising momentum in the delegate - rich states to come .
Mr. Obama , of Illinois , was poised to bypass Mrs. Clinton in the race for delegates , but the senator from New York was expected to win enough votes in Virginia and Maryland to keep the presidential nomination contest in a virtual dead heat .
In the key swing state of Virginia , Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton 63 percent to 35 percent with 2,097 of 2,472 precincts reporting , or 85 percent .
“ Today , the change we seek swept through the Chesapeake and over the Potomac , ” Mr. Obama said at a rally in Wisconsin , site of the next contest Tuesday .
“ The cynics can no longer say our hope is false , ” he said last night , in a reference to one of Mrs. Clinton ’s talking points .
Mr. Obama continued to gain support among both men and women , in nearly every age group and from across racial lines .
Exit polls in Virginia showed Mr. Obama even winning among white men , only the second time he won that segment of the vote in a Southern state .
He split the overall white vote with Mrs. Clinton .
She won her base , white women , and he won 90 percent of the black vote .
In Maryland , where Anne Arundel County Judge Ronald A. Silkworth ordered that the polls be held open an additional 90 minutes due to bad whether , Mr. Obama was immediately declared the winner at 9:31 by the Associated Press and several networks .
Minutes later , Mr. Obama was declared the District ’s winner .

NYT : Bill Clinton ' bitterly ' believes Obama camp 's painted him as ' brutish , race - baiting ' Mike Sheehan

The possibility of a " dream " Clinton - Obama or Obama - Clinton Democratic ticket is the subject of a front - page story in Tuesday 's edition of The New York Times .
" Imagine President Barack Obama is preparing his first State of the Union message .
Would he want Vice President Hillary Rodham Clinton tut - tutting with edits or suggesting how she could write it better ?
Would he want to hear Second Spouse Bill Clinton wax on and on about favorite lines from his own speeches ? " writes Patrick Healy for the Times .
" Alternatively , would the poll - obsessed Clintons want to wake up in the White House residence in 2009 and read about Vice President Obama 's sky - high popularity ratings , and how they make her look like his stern old lady ? "
In discussing the pros and cons of a joint - ticket scenario , Healy shares a few choice bits of information about the two campaigns .
Former president Bill Clinton -- who has had a rough time campaiging on behalf of his wife , to the point that she told him to shut up - -" bitterly believes that the Obama camp has portrayed him as a brutish and race - baiting campaigner , " says Healy , per associates of the former first lady .
He adds that Obama aides feel Sen. Clinton's " baggage " would hurt Obama 's image , " and they also believe that the Clinton camp 's negative tone seems a poor match for Hope . "
Remote hope remains , though , for advocates of a " dream ticket . "
Healy says that " some uncommitted superdelegates see such a unity ticket as a way to short - circuit a fight for the nomination all the way to the Democratic convention in August " and to combine the voter bases of the two White House hopefuls .
" All that stands in the way are a few pesky details , " writes Healy , " like that Obama and Clinton want to be done with each other , starting now . "
The two camps " have been brutal to each other , " the article notes , quoting a senior Obama aide as saying Clinton staffers would bring " their toxicity and negativism into our campaign , " while the Clinton camp accuses Obama of going " sharply negative . "
Excerpts from the Times article , available in full at this link , follow ... #
To be precise , aides for both candidates would not rule out the idea of a joint ticket -- though it was hard to hear it through all the laughing .
Indeed , some Clinton aides said that Clinton , should she catch up and surpass Obama in the fight for delegates , would almost certainly have to offer him the vice presidential slot , given his tremendous popularity ( and especially if he is still ahead in the popular vote ) .
Each might also be in a position to argue that he or she has the right of first refusal on the vice presidency -- though Obama aides said that the oddity of having a former president as the spouse of a sitting vice president might be great enough to rule out asking Clinton ( or at least provide an excuse to do so ) , a point on which several political analysts agreed .
" It 's one thing to keep your running mate on message -- it'd be much more difficult for Obama to keep a former president of the United States on his message , as well , for four or eight years , especially one with the skills and disposition of President Clinton , " said Joel K. Goldstein , an expert on the vice presidency and a professor at Saint Louis University School of Law .
" And if Hillary is the presidential nominee , Obama might not want to accept a spot that really is n't the second spot -- it 's the third spot , behind Bill Clinton , " he added . #
A desire to turn over a new , more healthful leaf typically accompanies the start of a new year .
My mail , for example , has been inundated with diet books , most of which offer yet another gimmick aimed ultimately at getting the gullible reader to eat less and exercise more .
Publishers assume , correctly , that the shock of the scale after nearly six weeks of overindulging on food and drink will prompt the purchase of one or more books on dieting by people who are desperate to return to their pre-Thanksgiving shape .
And really , it does n’t matter whether you choose a diet based on your genotype or the phases of the moon , or whether you cut down on sugars and starches or fats .
If you consume fewer calories than you need to maintain your current weight , you will lose .
My advice here is to save your money , toss out ( or donate to a soup kitchen ) the leftover high - calorie holiday fare , gradually reduce your portion sizes and return to your exercise routine ( or adopt one if you spent too much of ’ 07 on your sofa ) .
On congested city streets with many pedestrians , couriers and drivers , it is often difficult to cross .
Many things are going on the same time , and even the best of drivers make an error here and there .
The pedestrian has his / her own responsibility as well , looking and making sure they are out of harm ’s way , but still … accidents happen and should be prevented .
The Virtual Wall is envisioned to reduce the amount of hits ( pedestrians or vehicles ) .
It is a wall created with plasma laser beams , which is to be placed on congested streets .
Based on stoplight colors and both vehicle and pedestrian territories , the timing will turn this virtual wall on .
As people pass on the crosswalk , the wall ’s early presence will prompt drivers to stop early enough , no vehicle could break the laser beams , thereby decreasing casualties ( hopefully ) .
A great concept by Hanyoung Lee which we may run across ( or walk ) in the near future .

When the United States broke up the Bretton Woods international monetary system on Aug. 15 , 1971 , it marked the official end of an era when the dollar was literally " as good as gold . "
President Nixon 's announcement -- that the U.S. would no longer permit foreign central banks to redeem U.S. dollars for gold at the established fixed rate -- shocked Japan and Europe , our main overseas trade partners .
It was the repudiation of a formal agreement hammered out some 27 years earlier at Bretton Woods , N.H. , and signed by delegates from 29 participating nations .
The whole purpose of the agreement -- which was initiated by the U.S. -- was to establish a stable , post - World War II monetary foundation so that free trade could flourish .
Never again would nations shortsightedly cheapen their currencies to obtain an unfair advantage ; the nightmare of economic warfare leading to military warfare would be ended .
Today , our trade partners are no longer shocked .
They have come to expect domestically focused monetary policy from America .
But they are deeply concerned by the demise of the once - dependable dollar and deeply impacted by the economic distortions caused by skewed exchange rates .
They are , no doubt , deeply affronted by what they detect as the same cavalier attitude that decades earlier prompted Nixon 's Treasury Secretary , John Connally , to quip to U.S. allies :
" It may be our currency -- but it 's your problem . "
Has the U.S. forever given up on the dream of a rules - based monetary order for a global economy dedicated to free trade ?
Have we abandoned all sense of duty associated with providing the world 's key reserve currency ?
These days it 's easy to forget that , during the Great Depression years leading to World War II , floating exchange rates were not considered the free - market approach to currencies .
They were considered the antithesis of global monetary order .
Whereas the international gold standard guaranteed a level playing field in the trade arena , facilitating market - based outcomes among well - intentioned competitors in an open global marketplace , a nation that devalued its money against gold -- i.e. , floated its currency -- was considered to be cheating .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea test - fired a battery of short - range missiles on Friday in what analysts said was a show of the reclusive state ’s anger at Washington and the new conservative government in Seoul .
North Korean soldiers talk on the northern part of the Joint Security Area at the truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone in Paju , 42 km ( 26 miles ) northwest of Seoul , as a group of journalists attend a media tour organised by the United Nations Command March 26 , 2008 .

The launch comes a day after the North expelled South Korean officials from a joint industrial complex north of the border , after Seoul told its destitute neighbor to clean up its human rights and stop dragging its feet in nuclear disarmament talks if it wants aid to keep its economy afloat .
A South Korean presidential spokesman told a news briefing the North had fired short - range missiles during a military exercise .
Local news reports said the three were ship - to - ship missiles launched into the sea off the west coast .
“ We believe the North does not want a deterioration of relations between the South and the North , ” spokesman Lee Dong - kwan told reporters .
In Washington , White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said missile testing was “ not constructive ” and should end .
“ North Korea should focus on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and deliver a complete and correct declaration of all its nuclear weapons programs , and nuclear proliferation activities and to complete the agreed disablement , ” he said .
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said North Korea ’s tests had not broken any agreement but were not helpful .
North Korea had made an “ incredible amount of progress ” in disabling its Yongbyon nuclear facility and he encouraged them to do more .
New South Korean President Lee Myung - bak has said he wants to end the free ride given to North Korea under 10 years of left - leaning presidents who gave billions in aid while asking little in return as long as there was stability .
Lee ’s government has said it is ready to invest heavily if the North meets conditions such as scrapping its nuclear arms program or returning the more than 1,000 South Koreans it kidnapped or kept in the country after the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
Pyongyang was basically sending two messages with the launch , said Keio University Korea expert Masao Okonogi .
The first , aimed at the United States , showed the North ’s disfavor with Washington ’s pressure to come clean on uranium enrichment and ties with Syria .
The second was a riposte to the Lee government ’s policy shift , the Tokyo - based analyst said .
“ They are warning Seoul not to go back on things agreed between the North and the South , ” Okonogi said .
North Korea also threatened the South Korean navy , saying its patrols in disputed waters off the west coast of the peninsula could lead to battle .
North Korea ’s KCNA news agency described the patrols as the “ reckless military provocations of the South Korean military warmongers . ”
North Korea has more than 1,000 missiles , at least 800 of them ballistic , that can hit all of South Korea and most parts of Japan , experts have said .
Its launches often coincide with periods of political tension .
At about the same time as the launch , North Korea ’s official media fired a rhetorical volley at the United States , blaming it for pushing into deadlock six - country talks aimed at ending the North ’s nuclear arms plans .
“ If the United States continues to delay the resolution of the nuclear problem by insisting on something that does n’t exist , it could have a grave impact on the disablement of the nuclear facility that has been sought so far , ” KCNA quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying .
Pyongyang began disabling its Soviet - era nuclear plant late last year as part of a deal with regional powers in return for aid and an end to international isolation .
The process has reached a stage where it would likely take North Korea at least a year to get its Yongbyon nuclear plant running again , South Korean officials said .
U.S. and South Korean officials said most steps to disable the reactor , a plant that makes nuclear fuel and another that turns spent fuel into arms - grade plutonium , are complete but a few elements have been delayed for technical reasons .
The agreement calls for the North to make a complete declaration of its nuclear weapons arsenal and answer U.S. suspicions of proliferating nuclear technology and having a clandestine program to enrich uranium for weapons .
“ To make it clear , we have not enriched uranium or cooperated with any other country on nuclear projects .
We have not even dreamed about it , ” the North ’s spokesman was quoted as saying .
North and South Korea held separate talks on Friday without incident on energy and economic aid the communist state receives in return for complying with the nuclear deal .

So obsessed that I ’m becoming a bore
If I ever start to obsessively collect things , I 'll make a conscious effort to choose something small like vacuum tubes or flash memory cards .
I definitely wo n't choose arcade machines , because it would take only a year or two to completely fill my basement .
Peter Hirschberg and family recently faced this very problem ( you might remember his brilliant LEDhead handheld game emulator and Vertibird simulator from past posts ) .
While he could have restricted himself to a collection of vintage Mattel handhelds , Hirschberg started buying and restoring classic arcade machines from the 1980s .
His collection eventually overran the basement and his kids ' former playroom .
In a desperate quest to reclaim the house and avoid cocktail game cabinets in the dining room , Peter and his wife Julie did what any average Generation - X couple would do -- they built a separate 2 - story 2400 square foot building and dubbed it Luna City Arcade .
Heck , it even had its own blog to document the construction process .
Luna City features authentic " arcade style " carpet and lighting , along with literally hundreds of vintage gaming posters from Hirschberg 's collection .
It certainly qualifies as one of the largest private collections in the USA , and I can imagine losing myself in this place for hours on end .
The collection now numbers almost 70 arcade standups including must - have classics like Asteroids , Defender , Pac - Man , Tron , Galaga and eight pinball machines including Gottlieb 's magnificent Black Hole .
I am in awe and can only imagine the number of hours invested into restoring and maintaining these magnificent machines .

Millionaires - in - Chief
The top White House contenders are a lot richer than the rest of us .
Here 's where they got it ... and where it goes .
1 of 7 Clinton 's money Net Worth : $ 34.9 million
Where she got it
When Bill Clinton first ran for President in 1992 , Hillary provided most of the couple 's income working for the Rose law firm in Little Rock ; he earned only $ 35,000 a year as governor of Arkansas .
Although she takes in $ 165,200 a year as a senator , these days Bill is breadwinner - in - chief .
His presidential pension is $ 201,000 a year , and he grabbed a $ 12 million advance for his 2001 memoir , " My Life . "
( Her " Living History " won an advance of $ 8 million and $ 7 million in royalties . )
But it 's been Bill 's great gift for gab that has really feathered the Clintons ' nest .
He earned an astounding $ 41 million speaking to groups and corporations in the first six years since he left office .
Standard fee : $ 150,000 .
The fact that he may be married to the next President can only burnish his star power .
Where it goes
Until May 2007 , the Clintons had cash and a blind trust .
When Hillary launched her campaign , however , she ( and Mitt Romney ) had to " unblind " the trust to comply with Executive Branch rules , so the contents became public .
The Clintons ' money was spread among 190 mostly large - cap stocks from A ( Abbott Labs ) to Y ( Yahoo ) with a sprinkling of New York State and U.S. bonds .
Jason Mirsky of RiskMetrics assessed the portfolio as aggressive but not foolish .
A Black Monday event , he says , would have lost the Clintons about 16.5 percent of their portfolio's value .
Anxious about potential conflicts , the Clintons sold everything but the U.S. bonds .
Allan Roth of Wealth Logic estimates the move cost $ 500,000 to $ 1.8 million in taxes .
" They have done their fair share to shrink the budget deficit , " he says .
How she could do better
The Clintons ' cash hoard leaves them exposed to inflation , says Roth .
Federal and state taxes put them in the 40 percent bracket , so the after - tax net on a 5 percent yield would be only 3 percent .
The Clintons should invest half their money in the stock market , using broad index funds to avoid conflicts of interest .
If they set up a new blind trust , they should confine themselves to 30 to 50 securities .
" With the old portfolio , " says Mirsky , " they had a lot of fragmented positions that did n't do much but add to their transaction costs . "

" They have done their fair share to shrink the budget deficit , " he says .
The Clintons ' cash hoard leaves them exposed to inflation , says Roth .
Federal and state taxes put them in the 40 percent bracket , so the after - tax net on a 5 percent yield would be only 3 percent .
The Clintons should invest half their money in the stock market , using broad index funds to avoid conflicts of interest .
If they set up a new blind trust , they should confine themselves to 30 to 50 securities .
" With the old portfolio , " says Mirsky , " they had a lot of fragmented positions that did n't do much but add to their transaction costs . "

Eyewitnesses have described a Jeep Cherokee being driven at speed towards the building with flames coming out from underneath .
They have also described seeing two Asian men , one of whom was on fire , who had been in the car .
Strathclyde Police said two people had been arrested and detained in connection with the incident .
The airport has been evacuated and all flights suspended following the incident at 1515 BST .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has chaired a meeting of Cobra - the emergency committee .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the national terrorism threat level had been raised to its highest level of " critical " , meaning an attack was expected " imminently " .
A&E closed
First Minister Alex Salmond has activated emergency procedures .
The accident and emergency department of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley has been closed .
A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said this was due to the police investigation into the events at the airport .
One of the suspects was being treated at the hospital .
Emergency patients are being taken to Glasgow A&E departments at the Southern General Hospital and Western Infirmary .
However , the rest of the Royal Alexandra Hospital , is operating as normal .
The incident comes a day after two cars were found containing explosives in central London .
The cars contained petrol , gas cylinders and nails but the devices did not detonate .
One eyewitness at Glasgow Airport said : " I heard the sound of a car 's wheels spinning and smoke coming out .
" I saw a Jeep Cherokee apparently as if it was trying to get right through the doors into the terminal building .
" There were flames coming out from underneath then some men appeared from in amongst the flames .
" The police ran over and the people started fighting with the police .
I then heard what sounded like an explosion . "
Molotov cocktails
Eye - witness Richard Gray told BBC News 24 : " A green Jeep was in the middle of the doorway burning .
" There was an Asian guy who was pulled out of the car by two police officers , who he was trying to fight off .
They 've got him on the ground .
" The car did n't actually explode .
There were a few pops and bangs which presumably was the petrol . "
Dozens of emergency personnel attended the scene
Stephen Clarkson said he helped police restrain one of the men .
" I managed to knock the fellow to the ground , " he said .
" By this time there were four policemen who got on top of him and restrained him .
" His clothes had partially burned from his body .
His hair was on fire .
" His whole body was on fire . "
Thomas Conroy , a maintenance worker at the airport believes the men deliberately tried to set the car on fire .
" It looked like they had Molotov cocktails with them , " he said .
" They sort of burst them round about the flames to make sure the car would go up big style .
" Within minutes it was up and the terminal caught as well . "
TRAVEL CHAOS Glasgow Airport has been closed until further notice
All roads around the airport are cordoned off A number of flights bound for Glasgow have been diverted to Prestwick Prestwick Airport was operating as normal Edinburgh Airport is closed to vehicles , though flights are operating as normal
Airport closed
Dr Rak Nandwani was at the airport building to pick up relatives when he saw a plume of black smoke .
He said : " The whole place has come to a standstill , the terminal building has been evacuated .
I have spoken to my relatives and they have been moved to outside the building .
" They were told they could not pick their baggage up from the baggage collection area .
" There must be about 50 police cars at the airport .
Me and my son , along with everyone else , have been moved to the car rental area . "
Taxi driver Ian Crosby said : " This was no accident .
This was a deliberate attack on Glasgow Airport . "
Witnesses said the car was driven at the building deliberately
The reaction of members of the public was not to help the men in the car , but to restrain them , he told the BBC .
Mr Crosby , who said he served in Northern Ireland , told how he shepherded people away from the scene in case of a secondary explosion or a nail - bomb .
Two men , one of whom was reported to be badly burned , were seen being led away in handcuffs .
Michael McRanor from Glasgow , photographed the arrest of one of the men .
A number of people are stuck on aeroplanes and on the airport strip while others have been told they might not be able to leave the airport complex until at least 2100 BST .
Edinburgh Airport has been closed to vehicles which are being turned away on approach , however , flights are operating as normal .

Fossilized Finds Scientists Reveal Secrets of Opaque Amber
Until now , fossils hidden inside opaque amber have remained elusive to scientists .

LONDON : In an embarrassment for the British Government , the High Court yesterday overturned the decision to drop an investigation into alleged bribery and corruption in a deal between the arms manufacturer BAE Systems and Saudi Arabia .
Two judges said the director of the Serious Fraud Office had capitulated to threats from the Saudi royal family over arms deals with BAE , Europe 's biggest defence company .
" No one , whether within this country or outside , is entitled to interfere with the course of our justice , " one of the judges , Lord Justice Moses , said , calling the decision a failure of government .
By now every C++ engineer worth her salt knows that virtual inheritance is not free .
It has object code , runtime ( both CPU and memory ) , as well as compilation time and memory overheads ( for an in - depth discussion on how virtual inheritance is implemented in C++ compilers see “ Inside the C++ Object Model ” by Stanley Lippman ) .
In this post I would like to consider the object code as well as compilation time and memory overheads since in modern C++ implementations these are normally sacrificed for the runtime speed and can present major surprises .
Unlike existing studies on this subject , I wo n’t bore you with “ academic ” metrics such as per class or per virtual function overhead or synthetic tests .
Such metrics and tests have two main problems : they do n’t give a feeling of the overhead experienced by real - world applications and they do n’t factor in the extra code necessary to account for the lack of functionality otherwise provided by virtual inheritance .
It is hard to come by non-trivial applications that can provide the same functionality with and without virtual inheritance .
I happened to have access to such an application and what follows is a quick description of the problem virtual inheritance was used to solve .
I will then present some measurements of the overhead by comparing to the same functionality implemented without virtual inheritance .
The application in question is XSD/e , validating XML parser / serializer generator for embedded systems .
Given a definition of an XML vocabulary in XML Schema it generates a parser skeleton ( C++ class ) for each type defined in that vocabulary .
Types in XML Schema can derive from each other and if two types are related by inheritance then it is often desirable to be able to reuse the base parser implementation in the derived one .
To support this requirement , the current implementation of XSD/e uses the C++ mixin idiom that relies on virtual inheritance :
// Parser skeletons .
Generated by XSD / e. // struct base { virtual void foo ( ) = 0 ; } ; struct derived : virtual base { virtual void bar ( ) = 0 ; } ; // Parser implementations .
Hand - written . // struct base_impl : virtual base { virtual void foo ( ) { ... } } ; struct derived_impl : virtual derived , base_impl { virtual void bar ( ) { ... } } ;
This approach works well but we quickly found out that for large vocabularies with hundreds of types the resulting object code produced by g++ was unacceptably large .
Furthermore , on a schema with a little more than a thousand types , g++ with optimization turned on ( - O2 ) runs out of memory on a machine with 2GB of RAM .
After some analysis we determined that virtual inheritance was to blame .
To resolve this problem we have developed an alternative , delegation - based implementation reuse method ( will appear in the next release of XSD /e ) that is almost as convenient to use as mixin ( this is the case because all the support code is automatically generated by the XSD/e compiler ) .
The idea behind the delegation - based approach is illustrated in the following code fragment :
// Parser skeletons .
Generated by XSD / e. // struct base { virtual void foo ( ) = 0 ; } ; struct derived : base { derived ( base* impl ) : impl_ ( impl ) { } virtual void bar ( ) = 0 ; virtual void foo ( ) { assert ( impl_ ) ; impl_ -> foo ( ) ; } private : base * impl_ ; } ; // Parser implementations .
Hand - written . // struct base_impl : base { virtual void foo ( ) { ... } } ; struct derived_impl : derived { derived_impl ( ) : derived ( &base_impl_ ) { } virtual void bar ( ) { ... } private : base_impl base_impl_ ; } ;
The optimized for size ( - Os ) and stripped test executable built for the above - mentioned thousand - types schema using virtual inheritance is 15 MB in size .
It also takes 19 minutes to build and peak memory usage of the C++ compiler is 1.6GB .
For comparison , the same executable built using the delegation - based approach is 3.7MB in size , takes 14 minutes to build , and peak memory usage is 348 MB .
That ’s right , the executable is 4 times smaller .
Note also that the generated parser skeletons are not just a bunch of pure virtual function signatures .
They include XML Schema validation , data conversion , and dispatch code .
The measurements also showed that the runtime performance of the two reuse approaches is about the same ( most likely because g++ performs a similar delegation under the hood except that it has to handle all possible use - cases thus the object code overhead ) .
( FORTUNE Small Business ) --
Ever since eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) announced changes to its feedback rules and fee structure last week , sellers have been irate , exploding onto message boards and blogs with discussions about how the new policies will affect their businesses .
But when the idea of a strike was floated , some sellers and buyers decided to get more organized about expressing their displeasure .
A discussion thread on eBay 's own forums with the title " Sign the pledge_no sales Feb 18 - 25 ! " has received 4,000 posts in nine days , many expressing members ' intentions to join the boycott .
The strike is scheduled to overlap eBay 's planned Feb. 20 launch date for its new policies , which include fee hikes , a 21 - day hold on some funds sent through its PayPal payment service , and disallowing sellers from leaving negative feedback for their buyers .
Facebook and MySpace pages dedicated to the strike are circulating , along with an online petition , and a mailing list called the Online Seller Cyber Union has gathered more than 700 emails in a week .
A YouTube video on Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) entitled " Feb 18 - 25th 2008 : Worldwide Ebay Strike " has racked up more than 16,000 views since Saturday .
" It 's like a rallying cry for other sellers , " said Valerie Lennert , creator of the YouTube video .
" It was another way of letting people know that they were not alone .
My inbox is overflowing with people that are ticked off . "
Past boycotts fizzled
EBay boycott attempts are hardly a new phenomenon .
The eBay community has always been stridently vocal about the fee and policy changes that the company introduces nearly every January , and previous seller strikes , such as one protesting eBay 's 2006 fee hikes , were largely ineffective .
" We 've seen a lot of these .
They have n't really changed eBay 's mind before , " said David Steiner , president of AuctionBytes , a trade publication for online merchants that has followed the online auction industry since 1999 .
" But this is a pretty severe one .
People are much angrier than last year . "
EBay says it 's unworried by the rebellious rhetoric .
" We have a passionate community , and we are not surprised to hear them voicing concern , " eBay spokesman Usher Lieberman said via e-mail .
" However , when our sellers have had ample opportunity to evaluate the entire package we now offer and consider the traffic and trading velocity we deliver every day , we are confident that they will conclude eBay remains their best business partner . "
Nonetheless , support for the planned strike later this month seems to be snowballing .
Some sellers see it as their last resort for protesting changes more drastic than any eBay has previously unleashed .
Joe Hackney of Sadetha , Kan. , has run a business selling used motorcycle parts through eBay auctions since 2002 .
His decision to take part in the boycott means losing a week of business : about $ 6,500 in gross sales , plus the cost of wages for two employees who will be sent home on paid leave .
If the action is successful in persuading eBay to change its new rules , Hackney thinks it 'll be worth it .
Otherwise , he expects the new fees to cost him an extra $ 4,000 a year , an expense he says he has no choice but to pay .
" I 'm scared because there is n't anywhere else to go , " he said .
" I 've looked at other sites and there 's no one there . "
Other upset sellers are hoping to colonize new sites with a fresh influx of fleeing eBay merchants .
Joyce Wilson of Marion , Ohio , makes scrapbooks and sells them on eBay through auctions and a storefront .
She plans to boycott eBay , but she 's also already moving her products to Etsy.com , an online store for handmade items .
She knows that she wo n't get as much traffic as she does now , but she 's confident that she can start bringing some of her eBay customers to the new site .
" I'm in the process of looking into other options , " she said .
" But I 'm going to see what eBay 's reaction is .
It 's up to their reaction whether I stay or not . "
YouTube videomaker Lennert , who has also been handing out boycott fliers at her local post office in Anaheim , Calif. , feels she has no choice but to protest and hope eBay takes note .
Last month , she quit her job as a social worker to instead sell doll clothing on eBay full - time .
Less than a week later , the fee changes were announced , and Lennert realized that they would put too much pressure on her bottom line .
" Now I 'm interviewing for another job because I do n't think I can pull it together enough to make a profit on eBay , " she said .
She plans to boycott eBay both as a seller and as a buyer .
" That 's it .
No more , until something is done about these changes , " she said .
At least 3,000 young women in Britain are the victims of forced marriages each year , with the scale of the problem far bigger than originally thought , according to a groundbreaking report out this week .
The first study ever conducted in the UK into the prevalence of the custom shows that there are far more victims , spread across different ethnic minority communities , than official figures suggest .
Teachers should be given a key role in talking confidentially to young girls whom they believe may be at risk of being coerced into marriages , particularly if there is suspicion that an older sister has been married off against her will , the report recommends .
But there also needs to be more determined effort within communities to end the practice , so that forced marriages become a matter of shame and humiliation for parents , instead of being a matter of pride .
The Home Office - funded study calls on authorities to take the institution more seriously , so that it is treated as an issue of illegality , domestic violence and bullying .
The study , which looked at cases in Luton , a town with a large south Asian community , found at least 300 cases where victims had contacted community organisations .
Yet the government 's forced marriage unit , set up to tackle the problem three years ago , handles only 300 cases a year nationwide .
The report concludes that at least 10 times that number , and possibly far more that , are taking place , without any agencies ever finding out , although forced marriages are illegal under British law .
The government has ordered a national count of missing schoolgirls amid fears that hundreds have been forced into marriage , or are living in fear of so - called " honour " violence .
Researcher Nazia Khanum , who carried out the study , said : " There is this wall of silence around forced marriages .
" Of course , there are thousands of arranged marriages happening in Britain each year but that is very different , as both partners in these are willing participants .
" We are talking about girls being very much coerced into those marriages , often not knowing beforehand who their husbands will be , and then having little or no rights once they are married .
Most of them feel there is simply no one they can turn to . '
Labour MP Margaret Moran , who helped set up the study in her constituency of Luton South , said she was shocked by the scale of abuse which they had uncovered .
" It 's uncomfortable for people to think about , but it can't remain this hidden any longer .
" It 's not simply about Muslim families ; we also found that it happens among Chinese and African communities too , such as the Somali families .
Nor is it something that comes across with new immigrants .
" Many of these women were third - generation British and it is just a custom that is being handed down between the ages .
It is something that causes enormous grief and now has to be seen for what it is : a form of bullying , often resulting in violence and great damage . "
The report has discovered that sometimes brides are being forced into marriages with men who are severely disabled , and whom they have never met before .
There are particular concerns about the women who are brought up outside the UK , are married overseas and then brought into the country as brides .
Many women then find themselves " subjugated into the in - laws ' family culture " which can be a traumatic experience .
Some girls are married off when they are just 16 , and even if they want to go into higher education , it almost certainly means the end of their schooling .
Shaminder Ubhi , the director of the Ashiana Project , which provides refuge to south Asian , Turkish and Iranian women , said in response to the report : " Certainly we agree that forced marriage , at a basic level , is an abuse of human rights .
It can affect girls as young as 14 , 15 and 16 years old and can involve emotional coercion , forced imprisonment , violence and in the extreme , murder .
" It is an abuse of women . "
Leave it to a vision researcher to make you feel like Mr. Magoo .
When Jeremy Wolfe of Harvard Medical School , speaking last week at a symposium devoted to the crossover theme of Art and Neuroscience , wanted to illustrate how the brain sees the world and how often it fumbles the job , he naturally turned to a great work of art .
He flashed a slide of Ellsworth Kelly ’s “ Study for Colors for a Large Wall ” on the screen , and the audience could n’t help but perk to attention .
The checkerboard painting of 64 black , white and colored squares was so whimsically subtle , so poised and propulsive .
We drank it in greedily , we scanned every part of it , we loved it , we owned it , and , whoops , time for a test .
Dr. Wolfe flashed another slide of the image , this time with one of the squares highlighted .
Was the highlighted square the same color as the original , he asked the audience , or had he altered it ?
Um , different .
No , wait , the same , definitely the same .
That square could not now be nor ever have been anything but swimming - pool blue ... could it ?
The slides flashed by .
How about this mustard square here , or that denim one there , or this pink , or that black ?
We in the audience were at sea and flailed for a strategy .
By the end of the series only one thing was clear :
We had gazed on Ellsworth Kelly ’s masterpiece , but we had n’t really seen it at all .
The phenomenon that Dr. Wolfe ’s Pop Art quiz exemplified is known as change blindness : the frequent inability of our visual system to detect alterations to something staring us straight in the face .
The changes need n’t be as modest as a switching of paint chips .
At the same meeting , held at the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America at Columbia University , the audience failed to notice entire stories disappearing from buildings , or the fact that one poor chicken in a field of dancing cartoon hens had suddenly exploded .
In an interview , Dr. Wolfe also recalled a series of experiments in which pedestrians giving directions to a Cornell researcher posing as a lost tourist did n’t notice when , midway through the exchange , the sham tourist was replaced by another person altogether .
Beyond its entertainment value , symposium participants made clear , change blindness is a salient piece in the larger puzzle of visual attentiveness .
What is the difference between seeing a scene casually and automatically , as in , you ’re at the window and you glance outside at the same old streetscape and nothing registers , versus the focused seeing you ’d do if you glanced outside and noticed a sign in the window of your favorite restaurant , and oh no , it ’s going out of business because , let ’s face it , you always have that Typhoid Mary effect on things .
In both cases the same sensory information , the same photonic stream from the external world , is falling on the retinal tissue of your eyes , but the information is processed very differently from one eyeful to the next .
What is that difference ?
At what stage in the complex circuitry of sight do attentiveness and awareness arise , and what happens to other objects in the visual field once a particular object has been designated worthy of a further despairing stare ?
Can You Please Not Complain ... for 21 Days ?
One pastor 's experiment to get parishioners to stop kvetching .
April 17 , 2008  --
We 've all done it -- griped at the slow driver ahead of us , complained about our boss , the weather , our health .
Pastor Will Bowen of Christ Church Unity in Kansas City , Mo. , believes whining has become a national epidemic -- and a roadblock to prosperity .
So he started preaching about it .
" I wanted people to stop focusing on what they did n't have in their lives and complaining about it , and to start focusing on what they do have in their lives and being grateful for it . "
Bowen had an idea .
He handed out purple rubber bracelets and instructed parishioners to move them from one wrist to the other every time they uttered a complaint .
The goal ?
Not to have to move the bracelet for 21 days .
Click Here for Your Free Bracelet :
The church has set up a Web site to expedite orders for bracelets , books and T - shirts .
" I believe that your mind is a manufacturer , and your mouth is a customer .
And if the customer stops buying what the manufacturer is producing -- in other words , you stop complaining , the manufacturer retools , and you literally start thinking happier thoughts , " Bowen said .
It was n't easy .
" It took me three months to go 21 consecutive days , and I broke three bracelets in the process just switching it back and forth , " Bowen admits .
Eventually , the pastor stopped griping .
Remarkably , so did members of his church , including Paul Skeyen .
" It took two weeks to make it through the first day , " Skeyen said .
" It 's very difficult . "
Paul and his wife , Anita , sell real estate .
So how do they talk about the market without sounding as if they 're complaining ?
" We need to run the numbers and share the facts , " explained Anita .
" And it 's not a complaint if you 're sharing the facts . "
Going " complaint - free " has changed their lives in a number of ways .
" I feel happy .
I feel reborn , like a kid again , " explained Paul .
" That 's how I feel through this whole process . "
It has also narrowed the Skeyens ' social circle .
" ' We 've found there are a lot of friends we just do n't communicate with anymore , because they complain constantly , " Paul said .
Bowen 's complaint - free crusade has spread around the world .
Every Saturday , volunteers gather in the church basement to ship between 30,000 and 50,000 bracelets .
On this particular Saturday , orders will be mailed as far as Thailand , Jordan and Britain .
" I thought when he handed out these bracelets , it would last for a couple of weeks , " said church member Jennifer Alsup , who was busy stuffing purple bracelets into a stack of packing envelopes .
" And now it 's all over the world . "
Not that Jennifer is complaining .
She proudly wears her purple bracelet on her right wrist .
" I made my 21 days , " she said , smiling .
" It took me eight months .
The hardest part was at work .
I 'm a nurse . "
There is even a complaint - free cruise scheduled for next year .
But -- imagine this !
-- there are some complaints about the campaign to stifle complaining .
Barbara Held , a professor of psychology at Bowdoin College and author of " Stop Smiling , Start Kvetching : A Five - Step Guide to Creative Complaining , " said , " One size does not fit all .
That 's true of clothing , and it 's true of coping .
Some need to vent .
Some do n't . "
Apparently , more people want to vent less .
On a recent Sunday morning , Bowen announced the official numbers from the pulpit .
" We have 5.3 million bracelets that we have sent out now , " he said .
The congregation burst into applause .
Bowen 's goal is to distribute 60 million bracelets worldwide , to 1 percent of the world 's population .
" We feel that if we can get 60 million bracelets out , that we can totally transform the consciousness of the planet . "
He adds , " I think that if a church this size in the Midwest can do something that is impacting the world the way we are , then every one of us is more powerful than we ever dreamed . "
And that is hardly a complaint .

On a clear day , the view from the top will take in the Middle East , North Africa and the Indian Ocean - providing you 've a head for heights .
Plans for a mile - high tower in the Saudi Arabian desert have been unveiled by the billionaire owner of London 's Savoy Hotel .
At 5,250 ft , the £ 5 billion project , masterminded by two British engineering consultancies , will be twice as high as its nearest rivals , skyscrapers under construction in Dubai and Kuwait , and almost seven times as high as the Canary Wharf tower in London 's Docklands .

Little brother : The Dubai Tower and Prince al - Walid bin Talal , who is behind the scheme
It is being planned for a new city near the Red Sea port of Jeddah .
Behind the scheme is 51 - year - old Prince al - Walid bin Talal , who bought the Savoy for £ 1.25 billion in 2005 .
The plan gives the Middle East a clear lead over Asian countries and the U.S. , who have vied in the past to construct the world 's tallest buildings .
None of the other skyscrapers under construction , including New York 's Freedom Tower on the World Trade Centre site , will exceed 2,296ft .

The prince 's company , Riyadh - based Kingdom Holdings , has set up a joint venture with the London firms Hyder Consulting and Arup .
Experts say the technical challenges are enormous .
Much of the lifting will be carried out by helicopters , which will also be used as commuter transport for builders .
The tower will have to be capable of withstanding a wide range of temperatures , with its top baking in the desert sun by day but dropping to well below freezing at night .
To resist the strong winds prevalent in the area and stop it swaying , giving its occupants a form of high - rise seasickness , it will be fitted with a giant computer - operated damper .
Two " mini- towers " - both taller than Canary Wharf - will be built on either side of the main tower .
Linked to it by elevated walkways , they will anchor it and act as stabilisers .
Until recently , the still - under - construction Dubai Tower was expected to be the world 's tallest building .
Plans have changed several times to make it higher , but the final version is expected to be 2,300 ft with 160 storeys .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Most U.S. troops can be withdrawn safely from Iraq in roughly one year and the Bush administration should begin planning the pullout immediately , according to a study released Wednesday .
With the exception mostly of two brigades of about 8,000 troops who would remain in the touchy Kurdish region in the north for a year , trying to guard against conflict with Turkey , the U.S. troops would be moved to Kuwait initially , sags the study by the Center for American Progress , a self - described " progressive think tank " headed by John D. Podesta , a former chief of staff to former President Clinton .
There a brigade and an air wing of some 70 to 80 planes would remain in the Persian Gulf country indefinitely .
Meanwhile , the withdrawal would give the United States leeway to add 20,000 troops to the 25,000 in Afghanistan trying to counter Taliban and al - Qaeda forces .
How fast the troops depart from Iraq and most of them go home depends largely on how much essential equipment goes along with the withdrawal , according to the study .
The troops could be out of Iraq in no more than three months if the equipment is left behind , a course not proposed in the study .
On the other hand , " if the United States does not set a specific timetable , our military forces and our overall national security will remain hostage to events on the ground in Iraq , " the report said .
Even worse , an all - out civil war could compel a withdrawal of the U.S. troops , now numbering about 160,000 , in three months ' time , which would force leaving valuable equipment behind and preventing control of an orderly exodus , the report said .
The Bush administration is expected to disclose next month how large a withdrawal it contemplates and over what period of time .
No consensus on when to begin and how deeply to cut has developed .
Lawrence Korb , a former Pentagon official who specialized in manpower and logistics there from 1981 to 1985 , said in an interview : " It is essential that the military begin planning for a phased withdrawal from Iraq now so it can be safely completed within 10 to 12 months . "
Korb , one of the authors of the report , said withdrawal proposals have varied from three months to four years .
The center 's recommendation for withdrawal over a period of 10 to 12 months is based on consultation with military planners and logistics experts , the report said .
It proposed removing two combat brigades from Iraq a month while simultaneously reducing a proportional number of non-combat support personnel .
If the plan is adopted and U.S. combat units deployed in Iraq were not replaced as they went home the Bush administration could conclude the withdrawal by the end of next July " and with much more care than they did the invasion and occupation , " the report said .
" The time for half - measures and experiments is over ; it is now time for a logistically sound strategic redeployment , " the report concluded .

Further proof that no one in the media is capable of even the simplest reality - checks when it comes to publishing numbers they get from activist press releases .
This whole concept below is a howler ( the idea is that global warming causes volcanoes ) but it is the last paragraph that really caught my eye :
So much ice in Iceland has melted in the past century that the pressure on the
land beneath has lessened , which allows more of the rock deep in the ground
to turn to magma .
Until the ice melted , the pressure was so intense that the
rock remained solid .
Carolina Pagli , of the University of Leeds , led research which calculated that
over the past century the production of magma had increased by 10 per cent .
The research team , reporting their findings in the journal Geophysical
Research Letters , said an extra 1.4 cu km of magma has been created
under the VatnajÃ¶kull ice - cap in the past 100 years .
Since 1890 the ice - cap has lost 10 per cent of its mass , which has allowed the
land to rise by up to 25 m ( 82 ft ) a year .
The volume lost between 1890 and
2003 is estimated at 435 cu km .
Leaving aside cause and effect ( e.g. does ice cap melting cause more hot stuff in the ground or does more hot stuff in the ground melt ice ) , consider the statement that the ground has risen under the ice cap by 82 feet per year for 118 years .
This gives us a rise in the land of 9,676 feet after just 10 % of the ice mass has supposedly melted .
Note that this is an enormous , totally non-sensical value .
It implies that a full melting of the ice might increase the land height by 10 x this amount , or nearly 100,000 feet ( airplanes stay away ! ! )
As another check , 9,676 is more than the entire depth of the Iceland ice sheet ( it is about the same as what scientists think the Greenland ice sheet depth is ) .
Another way of looking at this is this is about 1/8 - inch land surface rise PER HOUR for the last century .
I am not sure how any writer or editor on the planet could look at " 82 feet a year for 118 years " and not smell a rat .
HARARE , Zimbabwe ( AP )  President Robert Mugabe , campaigning for upcoming elections , has signed a new law requiring foreign - and white - owned businesses to hand over 51 % control of their operations to blacks , state media reported Sunday .
Cranking up his campaign theme of " economic empowerment " in the impoverished African nation , Mugabe also unveiled plans to distribute tractors , generators , gasoline and cattle to black farmers who have resettled on white - owned land seized by the government since 2000 .
" This equipment and implements now form a critical mass that should be deployed effectively so as to meaningfully uplift productivity levels , " the state - owned Sunday Mail reported Mugabe as saying at a Harare ceremony Saturday .
The new program comes three weeks before Zimbabweans vote in crucial presidential , parliamentary and local council elections in which Mugabe , 84 , is running against former finance minister and ruling party loyalist Simba Makoni , 57 , and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , 55 .
The March 29 vote takes place amid an economic meltdown — including a shrinking economy , rocketing inflation , shortages of most basic goods and collapsing public services — in the nation once known as Africa 's bread basket .
Since the government began ordering the seizure of white - owned farms in 2000 , production of food and agricultural exports has slumped drastically .
Zimbabwe has the world 's highest official rate of inflation : 100,500 % .
One - third of the nation 's 12 million people received emergency food aid in January , U.N. food agencies said .
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization predicted shortfalls in local harvests in coming weeks and said just 10 % of fertilizer needed in the last planting season is available to farmers .
Since December , the Central Bank has spent at least $ 43 million to import corn , Zimbabwe 's staple food , from neighboring countries , bank Gov. Gideon Gono said Saturday .
The Sunday Mail said the government new program will put Zimbabwe " back at work " with state - of - the - art generators , buses , tractors , 300 buses , motorcycles and some 3,000 cattle .
No details about the cost of the equipment — funded by the state central bank , much of it in scarce hard currency — was provided .
In the past , similarly free equipment mainly has gone to supporters of the ruling party .
Mugabe blames the crisis on economic sanctions imposed by Britain , Zimbabwe 's former colonial power , and its allies , to protest his land reforms .
" This hate program by Britain and her fellow racists imposed unjustified sanctions on Zimbabwe in futile attempts to frighten us off our land , " he said .
" They should remember we are not that easily scared away , " he said .
The Economic Empowerment Act requires " indigenous Zimbabweans " to hold a minimum 51 % stake in every business and public company , and to have a controlling stake in every investment or company merger .

Janszen Interview with Australian Economist Dr. Steven Keen : Part I
What is debt deflation ?
Why it is occurring now ?
What impact on the financial system , economy , households and businesses ?
Dr. Keen is an economist for the University of West Sydney .
He specializes in long term macro-economic trends with a specialization in debt deflation , a rare economic and monetary process now taking place in the US , UK , Australia and other countries .
Before we get into the interview , we start with the latest post from Dr. Keen 's debtdeflation.com blog .
Why Now ?
There has been no shortage of commentators and players willing to vouch that this is the worst financial crisis they have ever seen .
Equally , there has been no shortage of bailout moves by the Federal Reserve–remedies that put “ the Greenspan Put ” to shame in their magnitude .
And yet the market meltdown continues , and the casualties continue to mount , with Bear Stearns the latest–and surely not the last .
In all this , no one yet seems to have posed the question of “ why now ? ” .
Why is the crisis clearly more severe this time than ever before , and why are remedies that worked relatively quickly in the past ( remember the fast turnaround of the market after October 1987 , and the rapid recovery from the rescue of Long Term Capital Management ? ) failing today ?
The answer is , simply , that the world has never in its history carried the level of debt that it is carrying today .
The remedies that worked when America ’s private debt to GDP ratio was a mere 150 percent ( see Figure 1 ) are inadequate when that ratio is 275 percent .
Figure 1 : Debt to GDP Ratios over the Long Term
Those remedies worked in the past , not because they “ solved the problem ” , but because they encouraged the renewal of the debt accumulation process .
Each Federal Reserve rescue was followed by a renewed growth of debt relative to income–without which , the economy would have gone into a slump , rather than a boom .
The traditional cure to a financial crisis–to restart the debt accumulation engine–ca n’t work this time , because in America today , there ’s no - one left to lend to ( there is no sub - subprime borrower ) , and no lender willing to risk its capital in yet more debt .
So the dominoes will continue to fall .
Manoeuvres like extending the range of securities that are eligible for the Federal Reserve ’s repo window will provide temporary liquidity .
But while that liquidity exists , the financiers then have to find someone else willing to give them the medium term credit needed to honour the other side of the repo agreement –to buy the securities back from the Fed when the repo agreement expires .
That could be when the next dose of the proverbial manure hits the proverbial fan .
The repo agreements that the Fed will arrange will doubtless involve discounts to face value of the bonds being accepted as securities .
The firms that take out that temporary liquidity then have to buy those bonds back–and without reserves to draw upon , that will involve further debt .
What odds that it wo n’t be possible to find that debt , unless the bonds can be repossessed at a higher still discount ?
What will the Fed do then ?
Bankrupt the primary dealers who ca n’t honour the second leg of their repo agreements ?
Validate the folly of sub - primes by permanently buying the toxic securities they have accepted as collateral–and at what discount ?
And , with what money , since the reserves of the Federal Reserve are dwarfed by the scale of outstanding private debt ?
So the real fun on the markets will begin in three months time , when the credit extended by the expansion of the liquidity window yesterday by the Federal Reserve has to be repaid .
Interview with Australian Economist Steve Keen : Part II
Stagflation a transitory state for an economy or is a structural stagflation possible ?
A stunning rate of economic decline due to the impact of debt deflation on aggregate demand
Wage inflation : the only way out ?
And other economic heresy
Thank you for granting us this interview .
My first question is to get our reader ’s level - set here because we ’ve talked about this concept of debt deflation for a while but many readers may be new to it .
First of all , you ’ll agree the process that particularly the US but some other Anglo - Saxon economies are undergoing right now is a debt deflation .
Would you agree ?
It ’s certainly a debt deflation in the U.S. , Australia , and the UK .
Whether it is occurring elsewhere in Europe is a question mark .
France an unusual example of a country that is not suffering an enormous burden of debt compared to GDP and inflation at the moment from historical standards , and compared to where we were in the 1970s where we suffered from stagflation , inflation there is quite low .
So my sense is that danger is we already have one of the two debt deflation recipes there .
It is possible that we can expect something as horrific as the 1930s to recur .
What is you definition of debt deflation ?
Okay .
A debt deflation is where you have an unsustainable level of debt in an economy , so a level that has already caused a crisis and therefore the types of affects we ’re seeing with a credit crunch start to occur .
And those are regarded as threefold .
First of all people did n’t try to reduce their debt .
Secondly , banks that were allowing a large rate of creation of new money are no longer willing to allow the creation to occur , certainly not at the same rate .
And thirdly the banks are tempted to turn reduce available funds for lending in particular drops drastically .
So rather than going to an airport and having to fight your way past half a dozen booths that are trying to give you a new credit card , suddenly credit cards scarce and you ’ll find your credit card limits being reduced rather than expanded .
So those combinations come together and you ’re going to have a downturn driven by those factors of reduced credit and tightened credit plus the excessive debt level and the basic elimination of investment due to people trying to pay their debt down rather than trying to invest .
That gives you a downturn , and then on top of that you have falling prices and they can come about for a range of reasons .
If there is distress selling taking place people who are in debt are trying to move their product more rapidly to improve their cash flow and reduce their debts .
You can bet they can actually cause a cascade over from falling asset prices into falling consumer prices with the impact of that , and very visibly this is what happened in America in the 1930s , this actually increases the ratio of debt to GDP because two factors of price declines and debt repayment occur simultaneously .
First the rate of GDP growth stops and becomes negative so GDP is actually falling and then it starts falling doubly fast because its falling in nominal terms .
Therefore the debt , even though you pay down the debt in monetary terms , the actual ratio of debt to GDP rises .
So with America ’s debt situation at the beginnings of the Great Depression in the 1930s the ratio of debt to GDP was as shown in the chart above but that ratio rose 65 % courtesy of deflation in the first two years of the Depression .
The US experienced in the 1930s and to a certain extent the Japanese in the 1990s a spillover effect of asset price deflation into the real economy resulting in a decline in the general price level .
In the 1930s most governments were operating under a gold standard which made inflation difficult , and the Japanese experienced deflation ( although it was never a runaway deflation , never more than 2 % in a year ) attempted to internalize their problems unlike the US which has been externalizing its economic distress by depreciating its currency .
Yes .
That ’s true .
So our understanding of what occurred before during commodity price deflations is that a lot of the decisions that were made that created that result were political and not mechanical or monetary .
In other words , the US put a lot of emphasis on protecting the value of the dollar at a time when the policy in retrospect should have been to allow the dollar to depreciate in a way that would have benefited the US but maybe not so much foreign investors in the US .
The politics was : let the deflation occur , let the dollar appreciate and let the economy and the market clear itself .
I think there was an internal endogenous dynamic to this as well .
It is n’t just bad political decisions during a debt deflation that leads to commodity price deflation and that ’s one reason why I ’m trying to go back and create a model to simulate it to see whether its something that is entirely driven by its own dynamic or whether you need some external policy mistake to make it happen .
The results I see and my interpretation of Fisher ’s theories and Minsky ’s theories say the dynamic is endogenous .
It is something which will occur in a debt deflation even if the policy makers do what looks like the right thing under the circumstances , even if they avoid trying to realign consumer prices with asset prices .
One of our observations from reading the history is that in 1933 when FDR called in gold and re-priced it the US had an instantaneous 40 % inflation and this was done simultaneously with a bank holiday where all the banks were closed and all but 20 % were reopened .
Thus confidence was somewhat restored in the banking system and the inflation stimulated demand .
Everyone believed that the banks that were open were actually solvent and that largely ended the credit crisis .
The economy actually grew quite strongly from that period , from 1933 to 1937 .
It reminds us very much of the post stock market bubble period from 2001 to 2007 , actually .
We had a more modern approach to reflation in 2001 than in 1933 but it had a similar result , creating a temporary inflationary boom .
Debt was expanded , too .
A lot of people forget that the stock market in 1937 had almost risen to the same level as 1929 , in nominal terms , but in real terms only increased by about half and again this was very similar to what we ’ve seen over the last seven years where the DJIA is close to its nominal peak but in real terms is down about 15 % - 20 % or so .
So it appears to us the parallels are interesting .
The question is , can they be used again to manage debt deflation ?
This is partly where I think the Minsky analysis goes wrong .
The presumption is the Fed has an intimate role in controlling the money supply and from the point of view of the research that I do that comes from the post - Keynesian perspective – and its also known as the Circuit school coming out of Europe , mainly out of Italy – the argument is the money supply is predominantly endogenous , in other words predominantly under the control of the relationship between the financial sector and household and business sectors .
The government ’s contribution is like a second way ‘ in ’ of creating additional money .
So it certainly does have the capacity to create money both in fiat terms and then credit creation on top of that .
But it is comparatively minor compared to the impact of the endogenous capacity of the financial system can generate credit .
So when you have a downturn like we had in the 1930s – and in Japan recently too – you can have actions taken by government abjectly to increase the money supply by directly manipulating the components that it controls and then waiting for the flow - through effects for the rest of the system to amplify that .
Policies designed to restore money can if necessary include depreciation of the currency .
And I say abjectly because the scale of what the government does is like trying the raise the level of the river by putting a hose into it .
The amount you ’re contributing to raise the water level is tiny compared to the impact of the volume of water draining out .
With all that endogenous capacity it ’s very hard for the government sector to do anything to counter the impact of what that financial and industrial component is doing .
So you ’re point is it ’s a scale issue .
I guess our interpretation of Keynes ’ contribution to all this is to say that when the endogenous credit system breaks down the government can temporarily step in , stimulate demand and get the endogenous credit system restarted .
The government does n’t substitute for the endogenous credit system but steps in to prevent it from completely spiraling down to the level of dysfunction that we saw in the 1930s .
That ’s why the Fed is making loans to non-bank institutions that are part of the endogenous credit system .
Yes but I think Keynes underestimated how big a problem that was , and I think also other aspects of reflation besides manipulating the money supply .
Ben Bernanke famously said that , “ If we do actually find ourselves in a deflation we can take comfort in the fact that the logic of the printing press will restore inflation . ”
Returning to the hose in the river analogy the most recent instance to refute that is what happened in Japan in 2001 or 2002 , the Japanese monetary authorities increased base money by over 25 % in one year .
Now you ’d expect that to restart the endogenous credit system and create some inflation and have solved the problem .
In fact a year after that 25 % growth in broad money the rate of inflation in Japan was negative once more .
The rate of deflation actually rose from minus 0.5 % to minus 1 % in wholesale price terms , so this is n’t something that can be addressed merely by growing the money supply .
That ’s what scares me because that ’s the policy that monetary authorities have committed themselves to .
Here ’s our observation from reading a lot of Bernanke ’s writing going back to 1983 , snd if you may remember that here in the United States when he was brought on board he was sold to the public as a keen student of the Great Depression .
That tells you a lot about what they were expecting when they hired him .
And what he wrote in a lot of his papers was that the big mistake that the US made in the Depression and that the Japanese also made in the early 90s was not shifting from interest rate to inflation targeting and maintaining inflation to prevent real interest rates to turn negative .
Priority # 1 in a debt defation is to even if they hit the zero bound they must keep inflation above zero because once they hit the zero - bound that there was nothing much more that they can do to stimulate demand .
The moral they took away from past was target inflation and in so doing prevent asset price deflation from evolving into a deflationary economic crisis .
So far they seem to be sticking to the program .
In fact though if you just saw the most recent figures for the CPI in America the rate of increase in February was zero .
Now from the point of view of the very conventional economists who dominate Australian policy that would be just fine here because managing inflation is all they obsess about .
At least Bernanke realizes debt deflation is a risk over there but I also agree there are plenty of inflationary forces taking place in the US and that the zero CPI number may be a misleading one month figure .
That ’s my other great fear , that the circumstances on the planet , generally speaking in favor of inflation , are being created by global warming and peak oil and are causing a rise in the cost base worldwide .
But it ’s feasible that a sudden collapse in the utilization of capacity due to the debt deflation can lead to a whole chain reaction effect of people having to liquidate to meet debt payments leading to a potentially deflationary effect at a much lower cost level .
The combination of cost push inflation and debt deflation could lead to a demand crash and deflation spiral and once that happens I do n’t believe there ’s any effective monetary means of fighting it .
Friends who run public and private tell me they have experience cost push inflation for a number of years because of the depreciated dollar and high input costs for many traded good , s especially energy , and anything else they have to bring in or that competes with materials they bring into the country .
This is now started to feed into the prices they have to charge for their finished products .
Price in creases at restaurants are the most obvious symptom .
The net effect this is quite extraordinary because we also have very low savings rate here and people have a lot of debt .
So as we go into recession and unemployment begins to rise we have this perverse situation here where wage - earners do n’t have any pricing power in the market so they can’t demand higher wages .
On the other hand many businesses they encounter , whether a restaurant or any business that is producing a product that is not coming from a country that manages its currency the way China can , prices are going up .
So what ’s occurring the worst of both worlds : businesses in order to stay in business to maintain profits have to raise prices ( or use cheaper ingredients or smaller portions ) as their input prices go up .
Wage earners can’t pay more so they either buy items less frequently or will consume cheaper versions of the same kind of product .
That ’s the process we are in right now .
You ’ve made a good point because here in Australia , in our case we have n’t been suffering a depreciating currency whereas America does have this massive impact of a depreciating currency and it is only going to get lower , too , and that will continue to cause inflation and rising cost levels which is a complication that I do not have to factor into my thinking about my own country .
But to me the dilemma goes one step further and that is that your wage earners are not in a position to push up their wages but in fact that really means that the cash flow that businesses are getting is being constrained on two sides .
This is different from the situation like you did in the 1930s when there was very little need to worry about America importing inflation from a depreciating currency because it was so much a more self - sufficient economy in the 1930s than it is now .
That prospect could lead to rising wages and the whole thing could cause inflation that would erode the outstanding value of the debts .
Bingo .
Currency depreciation driven cost - push inflation is good in a debt deflation and asset price deflation , right ?
Is n’t that the question , how to create inflation when the endogenous credit system is on the fritz ?
The cycle of currency depreciation and traded - goods price inflation is a natural brake on the deflationary impact of falling assets prices .
Eventually , as you say , it will lead to wage inflation .
That will be the next problem to solve , politically .
The process is in effect conscripting the cash flow that companies have available to pay their debts and at the same time of households who are facing high rising costs are having a restricted ability to repay their own debts so they ’re both much more likely to go bankrupt .
So you ’re getting like a super - inflation coming out of that or a super - stagflation .
It ’s actually in a sense a completely new phenomenon .
Yes , we are very inventive here .
I want to explore that point more .
The only experience we ’ve had with stagflation was in the 1970s and I think the way everyone remembers as a long period of recession and inflation throughout the 1970s .
In fact we had two recessions and inflation was very volatile throughout the period .
We ’d have one month when inflation would be 9 % and then the next month it would be 0 % .
Inflation was all over the place .
This is when commodity prices , and particularly precious metals , were going way up because it was very difficult for the market to design wage and other fixed price contracts that required a steady expectation of inflation .
This is a point I ’ve made to readers over the years , that societies can function with seemingly absurd levels of inflation for many years as long as the inflation rate is fairly constant .
What does the yield on a 10 year US Treasury bond mean when inflation is 0 % on month and 6 % the next ?
That ’s what we are seeing again today .
But in order to get money out of hard assets and back into the financial sector , out of the commodity sector , the US Central Bank in the early 1980s had to raise interest rates all the way to 20 % until the spread between CPI inflation and the yield on the thirty - year bond was 9 % .
Huge .
That is what it takes once inflation expectations become imbedded .
That ’s what was necessary in order to convince capital to move out of commodities back into financial assets .
The way most people remember the period was a lot of unemployment and prices declining as the transmission of wage inflation into prices was broken .
So most people assume that what really got rid of the inflation in the early 1980s was busting up the unions and the break in the wage inflation .
I ’d like to hear your comments on this , but my understanding is that that was part of it but it was n’t by any means the whole story .
Stopping wage inflation was only part of the story .
A large part of the story was an enormous debt bubble .
Most people look back on the 1970s do n’t realize that a debt bubble back then had burst .
And that happened both in Australia and America and so to give you a very rough idea of it we ’re talking about a much smaller scale than what we ’re going through now of course .
The private debt - to - GDP ratio in America peaked at 97 % in the mid 1970s and then fell down to 91 % in the aftermath of 1980s Fed policy actions .
And that decline in debt finance expenditure was actually a large part of the recession that occurred at that time .
It was a speculative bubble .
It burst but it was not nearly as obvious as when the 90s speculative stock bubble burst .
The bursting of the 1970s credit bubble was a large part of why we had a major downturn in the economy .
Inflation was overlaid on top of that courtesy of the momentum of the economy beforehand and the Vietnam war effect as well .
You had a booming economy , high wage demands with workers driving up their wages in an attempt to get ahead of price inflation .
And of course those high real wages did occur for a while , certainly in Australia they did , and to some extent also in America .
But that was then eroded by subsequent stagflation , high rates of inflation in a stagflationary period .
If we had n’t had that inflation then if OPEC had n’t come along after the stock market bust in the early 1970s and after the downturn began , then we could have had a deflation back then and that would have been a damn sight worse then what we went through .
It ’s amazing but we do n’t realize how bad the period could have been , the alternative could have been a 1930s style deflation .
That ’s a very interesting point .
It ’s long been the iTulip hypothesis – we came up with theory called the Ka-Poom Theory which presumes the US government will eventually have to inflate fiscal and household debt away , that is , both the private sector and public sector debt , and the mechanism of this would be depreciating the currency which would be self reinforcing with respect to the response of US creditors .
I ’m not so certain they ’ll do that .
That ’s a policy guess .
Yes .
That ’s a policy guess , of course .
But does n’t it appear that is exactly what they are doing ?
I definitely agree with the idea of the “ Greenspan Put ” and that ’s obviously been a deliberate policy throughout the past 20 years , that whenever the financial system , the Wall Street system , gets itself in dire trouble the Fed will come in and effectively negate the mistakes it ’s made at whatever cost that might involve .
But it also simultaneously been on top of consumer price inflation ; when they come in and validate what Wall Street ’s doing , they ’re validating asset price inflation and in fact as a result , they ’ve driven the gap between asset prices and consumer prices to historically unprecedented levels and that , from a Minskian point of view , means that realignment of those prices is going to also be historically unprecedented in scale .
Are you familiar with Dr. Michael Hudson over at the University of Missouri ? K : Yes .
In fact Michael and I correspond occasionally but not often enough .
He ’s a very smart and a very original thinker in my opinion with unique historical depth to his thinking .
I particularly appreciate his observations of the construction of the US economy as really two economies : the FIRE Economy composed of the finance , insurance , and real estate sectors and the production - consumption economy .
In his view the Federal Reserve has policies which are intended to maintain low all - goods price inflation , particularly the wage inflation to prevent the transmission of wage inflation into the price complex , but at the same time has as its mandate to continuously inflate asset prices .
That ’s right .
I agree with that .
In fact you can see if you take a look at Robert Shiller ’s housing data in particular you get a very good view as to just how ‘ extreme ’ that policy has been because when you take a look at the ratio of the DJIA compared to the Consumer Price Index over the long term , I ’m talking from 1915 through to 1995 , Shiller has done his work in his second edition of Irrational Exuberance you see the ratio of the Dow to the CPI at 100 in 1915 , which is when the Dow series begins , and over the entire eighty years period from 1915 to 1995 the average ratio is 255 .
Recently the value peaked during the 2000 stock market boom and almost returned to it in 2007 at 12,440 , in other words pretty close to five times the long - term average .
There can be no relationship between asset prices and consumer prices like that again .
This ratio is always mean reverting .
Even in housing that almost in some ways is even more extreme the ratio is lower .
Doing the same thing , again with Shiller ’s data , starting back in 1892 concerning the ratio of home prices to the CPI the ratio is 100 in 1890 .
The average made in 1890 right through to 1995 , so we ’re talking 105 years , the average was 103 .
It peaks in 2004 at around 228 .
And it rose to that level in from roughly 1997 at 115 to 228 just in the last twelve years .
The scale of the bubble , and the scale of the evaluation of asset prices relative to other prices that the Fed has allowed to happen is utterly unprecedented .
Professor Shiller , by the way , he gave the keynote last week at the 22nd Annual Conference of the Boston Security Analyst ’s Association that I attended .
His basic thesis , as you know , is that home prices nationally in the US tend to track the rate of inflation and that ’s about it .
Any delta between home prices in aggregate across the US and the rate of inflation over the same period is asset price inflation .
I do n’t think that Shiller necessarily understands the dynamics as well as he understands the empirical side .
I wrote a Harper 's Magazine piece to help explain the actual dynamics of how the interaction of the US political system , Wall Street , the press and so on interact with the economy in the context of Fed policy to produce asset price inflations but I think he does understand the empirical process .
Yes he does .
And he ’s done a very good job there from a neoclassical standpoint but that approach makes it hard to understand these developments the way you can if you analyze from the point of view of Minsky and Keynes .
" ... under a floating exchange rate system , an initial disturbance ( either domestic or foreign ) can create an exchange rate inflation spiral .
That is , the disturbance can set into motion a cumulative process of inflation and exchange rate depreciation , through which exchange rate effect is rapidly translated into domestic prices and costs and back to the exchange rate . "

The quotation above and image to the left sets the stage for the second part of our interview with Dr. Steven Keen .
Can you imagine the Fed pursuing a policy of wage inflation now to end a debt deflation spiral the way the Fed did in 1933 ?
Probably not until the financial and economic crisis becomes as politically challenging as in 1933 , which means not until the US experiences a period price deflation .
But the Fed has been creating inflation via depreciation of the dollar for years , and the policy is now morphing into a self - reinforcing cycle .
Has the stage for the necessary wage inflation been set as a consequence of previous policy accidents ?

The Trillion Dollar Meltdown
Clifford Pickover 's ESP Page
I am conducting a fascinating ESP experiment .
Recent statistics suggest that my system can predict the correct outcome of your choice with 98 % accuracy .
Preservative chemicals found in samples of breast tumours probably came from underarm deodorants , UK scientists have claimed .
Their analysis of 20 breast tumours found high concentrations of para - hydroxybenzoic acids ( parabens ) in 18 samples .
Parabens can mimic the hormone estrogen , which is known to play a role in the development of breast cancers .
The preservatives are used in many cosmetics and some foods to increase their shelf - life .
“ From this research it is not possible to say whether parabens actually caused these tumours , but they may certainly be associated with the overall rise in breast cancer cases , ” says Philip Harvey , an editor of the Journal of Applied Toxicology , which published the research .
“ Given that breast cancer is the largest killer of women and a very high percentage of young women use underarm deodorants , I think we should be carrying out properly funded , further investigations into parabens and where they are found in the body , ” Harvey told New Scientist .

Chemical cousins
The new research was led by molecular biologist Philippa Darbre , at the University of Reading .
She says that the ester - bearing form of parabens found in the tumours indicates it came from something applied to the skin , such as an underarm deodorant , cream or body spray .
When parabens are eaten , they are metabolised and lose the ester group , making them less strongly estrogen - mimicking .
“ One would expect tumours to occur evenly , with 20 per cent arising in each of the five areas of the breast , ” Darbre told New Scientist .
“ But these results help explain why up to 60 per cent of all breast tumours are found in just one - fifth of the breast – the upper - outer quadrant , nearest the underarm . ”
However , Chris Flower , director general of the Cosmetic , Toiletry and Perfumery Association , challenged the study ’s findings .
“ There are almost no deodorants and body sprays that contain parabens , ” he says .
“ Although they are in most other creams and cosmetics , the safety margin is huge and they would not have any effect on enhancing growth of new tumours . ”
Darbre replies that deodorants and antiperspirants have only stopped containing parabens in the last few months and that the tumours she studied occurred prior to this .
A small survey by New Scientist of three British high street shops and one supermarket found deodorants in each that contained parabens , although most of these products did not .
However , many other products used under the arm commonly contained parabens , such as body sprays , hair removal creams and shaving gels .
Body lotions , face creams , cleansers and shampoos also frequently contained parabens .
Skin deep
Previously published studies have shown that parabens are able to be absorbed through the skin and to bind to the body ’s estrogen - receptors , where they can encourage breast cancer cell growth .
But Flower maintains that the amount of parabens absorbed by the skin is very low and the parabens are “ metabolised by the skin cells to produce products that have no estrogenic activity ” .
Darbre ’s research did not look at the concentrations of parabens in other areas of the breast or body tissues and Harvey cautions that the significance of the chemicals in tumour tissue should not be over - interpreted .
Darbre says she has not used cosmetic products , including underarm deodorants , for eight years .
She recommends that other women do the same “ until their safety can be established ” .

New York City has been an area of concern during hurricane season for many years because of the large population and logistics .
More than 8 million people live in the city , and it has hundreds of miles of coastline that are vulnerable to hurricane threats .
Using computer climate models , scientists at NASA have looked at rising sea levels and hurricane storm surge and will report on them at a science meeting this week .
Cynthia Rosenzweig and Vivien Gornitz are scientists on a team at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) and Columbia University , New York City , investigating future climate change impacts in the metropolitan area .
Gornitz and other NASA scientists have been working with the New York City Department ( DEP ) of Environmental Protection since 2004 , by using computer models to simulate future climates and sea level rise .
Recently , computer modeling studies have provided a more detailed picture of sea level rise around New York by the 2050's .
During most of the twentieth century , sea levels around the world have been steadily rising by 1.7 to 1.8 mm ( ~0.07 in ) per year , increasing to nearly 3 mm ( 0.12 in ) per year within just the last decade .
Most of this rise in sea level comes from warming of the world ’s oceans and melting of mountain glaciers , which have receded dramatically in many places since the early twentieth century .
The 2001 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that a global warming of 1.4° to 5.8° C ( 2.5° - 10.4° F ) could lead to a sea level rise of 0.09 - 0.88 meters ( 4 inches to 2.9 feet ) by 2100 .
A study conducted by Columbia University scientists for the U.S. Global Change Research Program in 2001 looked at several impacts of climate change on the New York metropolitan area , including sea level rise .
The researchers projected a rise in sea level of 11.8 to 37.5 inches in New York City and 9.5 to 42.5 inches in the metropolitan region by the 2080s .
" With sea level at these higher levels , flooding by major storms would inundate many low - lying neighborhoods and shut down the entire metropolitan transportation system with much greater frequency , " said Gornitz .
This image shows the storm surge , in blue , over portions of New York City from a Category 3 hurricane , worst - case scenario , if the storm tracks slightly west of the city .
Areas under water include : the Rockaways , Coney Island , much of southern Brooklyn and Queens , portions of Long Island City , Astoria , Flushing Meadows - Corona Park , Queens , lower Manhattan , and eastern Staten Island from Great Kills Harbor north to the Verrazano Bridge .

With sea level rise , New York City faces an increased risk of hurricane storm surge .
Storm surge is an above normal rise in sea level accompanying a hurricane .
Hurricanes are categorized on the Saffir - Simpson scale , from 1 to 5 , with 5 being the strongest and most destructive .
The scale is used to give an estimate of the potential property damage and flooding expected along the coast from a hurricane landfall .
Wind speed is the determining factor in the scale , as storm surge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf and the shape of the coastline , in the landfall region .
A recent study by Rosenzweig and Gornitz in 2005 and 2006 using the GISS Atmosphere - Ocean Model global climate model for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects a sea level rise of 15 to 19 inches by the 2050s in New York City .
Adding as little as 1.5 feet of sea level rise by the 2050s to the surge for a category 3 hurricane on a worst - case track would cause extensive flooding in many parts of the city .
Areas potentially under water include the Rockaways , Coney Island , much of southern Brooklyn and Queens , portions of Long Island City , Astoria , Flushing Meadows - Corona Park , Queens , lower Manhattan , and eastern Staten Island from Great Kills Harbor north to the Verrazano Bridge .
Gornitz will present these findings at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Philadelphia during the week of Oct. 23 .
To understand what hurricane storm surges would do to the city , surge levels for hurricanes of categories 1 through 4 were calculated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the 1995 Metro New York Hurricane Transportation Study using NOAA ’s SLOSH computer model .
SLOSH ( Sea , Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes ) is a computerized model run by the National Hurricane Center to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical , hypothetical , or predicted hurricanes by taking into account pressure ; size , forward speed , track and hurricane winds .
According to the 1995 study , a category three hurricane on a worst - case track could create a surge of up to 25 feet at JFK Airport , 21 feet at the Lincoln Tunnel entrance , 24 feet at the Battery , and 16 feet at La Guardia Airport .
These figures do not include the effects of tides nor the additional heights of waves on top of the surge .
Some studies suggest that hurricane strengths may intensify in most parts of the world as oceans become warmer .
However , how much more frequently they will occur is still highly uncertain .
Hurricanes have hit New York City in the past .
The strongest hurricane was a category four storm at its peak in the Caribbean , which made landfall at Jamaica Bay on Sept. 3 , 1821 with a 13 - foot storm surge .
It caused widespread flooding in lower Manhattan .
The “ Long Island Express ” or “ Great Hurricane of 1938 , " a category three , tracked across central Long Island and ripped into southern New England on Sept. 21 , 1938 , killing nearly 700 people .
The storm pushed a 25 - 35 foot high wall of water ahead of it , sweeping away protective barrier dunes and buildings .
The 1995 Transportation study was done to assess the vulnerability of the city 's transportation system to hurricane surges .
The 2001 Columbia study was one of the regional studies for the U.S. National Assessment of Climate Variability and Change ; the recent study for the NYC DEP was to evaluate potential climate change impacts , including sea level rise , on the agency 's mandated activities and infrastructure .
" This entire work is solutions oriented , " said Rosenzweig .
" It 's about helping NYC DEP and other New York City agencies make better preparations for climate extremes of today , and changing extremes of the future .
The report will help us determine how can we do better job now , as well as in the future . "

The House , in a rush to get out of town and fearful of being branded as soft on terrorism , approved legislation on Saturday that gives the Bush administration new authority to engage in warrantless surveillance .
The Senate approved the legislation on Friday .
The White House began a full - court press for the legislation last week after the secret court charged with reviewing foreign surveillance reportedly limited eavesdropping on communications between two foreign parties that pass through the United States .
The White House and House Minority Leader John Boehner charged that Congress would be putting Americans in danger if it did n't pass legislation overruling the decision before the August recess .
But the hastily - enacted legislation , dubbed the Protect America Act , does more than permit the interception of foreign - to - foreign communications .
It permits warrantless surveillance " directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States . "
There is no language specifically restricting surveillance activities to communications originating outside of the United States .
No meaningful oversight
Nor will the process have meaningful judicial oversight .
Before undertaking surveillance activities , intelligence officials would need to obtain a certification from the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence — both subordinates of the president — that there were " reasonable procedures " in place for ensuring that the eavesdropping " concerns " persons located outside the United States and that the foreign intelligence is a " significant purpose " of the surveillance activities .
That certification would only be reviewed after the fact , and only to determine if the procedures were , in fact , " reasonable . "
A single certification could approve a broad surveillance program covering numerous individuals , and no judge would review the list of individual targets .
Moreover , the requirement that surveillance " concern " non-U.S. persons could plausibly permit spying on the relatives , friends , and business associates of a foreign target .
Indeed , the administration might argue that the only way to obtain all information regarding foreign targets is to conduct dragnet surveillance of American communications and sift through them to find relevant information .
The legislation empowers the administration to " direct " individuals to " provide the government with all information , facilities , and assistance necessary " to carry out foreign surveillance .
These quasi - subpoenas would not be subject to judicial review before they were issued .
The targets of such orders — who will typically be telecom company executives , not terrorism suspects — have the option of appealing the order to the FISA court , but given the broad scope of surveillance activities authorized by the legislation , it seems unlikely that such challenges would succeed .
Moreover , the legislation offers legal immunity to those who comply with such orders , so telecom providers will have little incentive to resist them .
A couple of small bright spots
The legislation has two bright spots from a civil liberties perspective .
First , as the president noted in his statement on the legislation , it does not provide " meaningful liability protection to those who are alleged to have assisted our Nation following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 " — in plain English , it does n't give telecommunications carriers a free pass for any laws they might have broken over the last six years .
That means that the legislation is unlikely to block lawsuits now in progress against telecom companies for violating their customers ' privacy .
Second , the provisions sunset after six months , giving Congress the opportunity to reconsider the legislation later in the year .
Yet even the sunset provision comes with a loophole : foreign surveillance that had been approved before the sunset date would remain in effect until expiration , which could be as long as a year .
With less than 18 months remaining in his term , President Bush will have the opportunity to put in place surveillance programs that will remain in effect until the day he leaves office .
The legislation was opposed by a majority of Democrats , and Speaker Pelosi has vowed to revisit the legislation when Congress reconvenes in September .
We hope the Democrats will show more backbone the second time around , but you 'll forgive us if we do n't hold our breaths .
This is part 1 of 2 .
Part 2 is my Guide to the use of Semantic HTML ( HyperText Markup Language ) Elements
I ’ve seen a lot of articles discussing the importance of HTML and XHTML ( eXtensible HyperText Markup Language - HTML reformulated as XML ( eXtensible Markup Language ) ) semantics .
I ’ve seen articles describing what it means for a document to be semantic .
Most of these articles , however , do n’t provide a serious overview of what HTML elements actually may be considered semantic — and what those semantic elements actually mean .
And , even more particularly , why it matters .
Semantics is an erudite area of study .
Literally , semantics can be fairly defined as the study of meaning in communication .
Communication can readily be extended to cover symbolic notations , representations of language , organization of language , body language and information structures .
In developing a web page , we are organizing a means to communicate the content of that page : ideally , we are organizing the page in such a manner that it will be understood regardless of the method by which the page is accessed .
It should be equally understandable whether seen , heard , or felt .
The semantics of HTML structure , then , are clearly an important part of web design .
Sending mixed signals to the user agent or the user by using a blockquote purely for it ’s native indentation is an abuse of semantics : even the visual impact is dependent on the assumption that user agents will consistently render a blockquote in an indented manner .
It ’s not precisely an issue that you ’ve used a semantic element for presentational means , because , in fact , you ’ve done more than that : you ’ve presented a block of text which is not quoted material as if it were .
Semantic elements of HTML carry meaning regardless of your knowledge of that meaning .
The result is that the misuse of an element creates the potential to mislead or confuse an end -user .
The most obvious examples in common use are those which make use of elements with semantic meaning which also offer a browser - contributed default presentation in order to use that presentational style .
The blockquote example above is not uncommon ; similarly , the use of empty p elements to create extra white space or heading elements used as a questionable SEO technique in substitution for normal paragraphs .
Other examples which bear mentioning include the use of empty anchor elements to trigger Javascript events — in this case , it ’s partially a limitation of the identity of an anchor element , but an empty anchor element should always be considered an error , as it results in a behavior - less anchor if the Javascript is not available .
Now , you may point to the following paragraph , from the HTML 4.01 specifications , as a response to my opinion :
Authors may also create an A element that specifies no anchors , i.e. , that does n’t specify href , name , or id .
Values for these attributes may be set at a later time through scripts .
The fact that it is allowed by the specification does not make it a best practice .
With all due respect to the W3C ( World Wide Web Consortium ) , this should not be permitted .
For reference , the HTML 5 specification currently reads :
If the a element has no href attribute , then the element is a placeholder for where a link might otherwise have been placed , if it had been relevant .
In addition , although I wo n’t quote everything , the specification states that an anchor which does have the href attribute must specify a URI ( Uniform Resource Identifier ) as the value of that attribute .
It appears to essentially state that an anchor element should have no semantic meaning if the href attribute is not set and valid .
But I could be wrong .
The best means to avoid the misuse of elements is to have a clear understanding of when and why a given element should be used in web development .
To hopefully expand on your knowledge in that respect , I ’m attempting to provide a semantic guide to HTML elements for your reference and rich disagreement .
Be aware , however , that semantics are largely a matter of opinion .
It ’s not a question of blindly following the guidelines set by a group ; it ’s a question of interpreting those guidelines to the best of your ability and belief .
This guide reflect how I think HTML elements should be used ; and I welcome your opinions .

SpaceShipTwo is the spaceship that 'll actually go into space , while White Knight Two is the plane that 'll bring it up high enough to launch itself away .
SpaceShipTwo will be able to tote eight people at a time into sub - orbit , two pilots and six passengers , each of whom will pay $ 200,000 for the right to be one of the few humans to see the earth from above .

The White Knight Two is already almost complete , with testing scheduled for later this year , while SpaceShipTwo is about 60 % complete .
The flights will take off from the Spaceport that Virgin Galactic is building in the New Mexico desert .
As much as I 'd like to say $ 200,000 is a ridiculous amount to spend on a flight into space , you know what ?
If I had so much money that $ 200,000 was n't a big deal , I would be all over this .
Hey , Branson !
How 's about a press preview flight , hmm ?
Good reviews can be bought with free trips to space .

Browse column T his week , in the wake of further falls on the world markets , U.S. President George W. Bush announced that he is prepared to push through yet another " stimulus package " on top of the $ 195 billion already put forward .
Meanwhile , murky Chinese and Arabic state - backed funds are investing tens of billions of dollars into leading Western multinational banking institutions like Citicorp and Merrill Lynch , with others soon to follow .
This is exactly the wrong policy at the wrong time .
The free market should be allowed to resolve and harmonize the distortions in whatever way it sees fit .
State intervention to shore up banks and put money in the citizens ' pockets will only reduce competitiveness and create a cycle of dependency .
Bush 's decision to use socialism to " cure " the free market is yet another indication of how far America is declining , and how little it has come to terms with this decline .
For several years now , America has been suffering from a " hyperpower complex , " in which it still likes to act is if it is the world 's only superpower , and can dictate terms to anyone .
In reality , America 's geopolitical power has suffered one of the most rapid declines since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Who would have thought that a few thousand poorly - armed insurgents in a pair of backwards nations , Iraq and Afghanistan , could defeat superior American forces , and at the same time bankrupt the empire ?
In retrospect , it 's easy to see why this happened .
A combination of imperial overreach and state - interventionism is exactly what doomed the Soviet Union , as well as Great Britain .
Sadly , America is making the same mistake .
It can not admit that it has lost the war in Iraq , and in fact has embarked on a bizarre self - esteem campaign to convince itself that its so - called " surge " has actually worked , and the war now is won .
It 's like watching a terminally ill man making plans to take up hang gliding as soon as he's up and out of the intensive care unit .
Indeed , America today reminds one of the tragic finale in Of Mice And Men , with George Bush as Lenny pointing across the ocean , dreaming of his plans to build a series of democracy farms as far as the eye can see , while his friend George , played by Adam Smith , holds up an old musket - pistol to Bush 's head , and , with a heavy heart , fires a giant musketball of market economics reality into Bush 's uncompetitive state - interventionist brain .
Today , Americans are too misguided to understand that even if hundreds of billions of dollars disappear in the credit crisis , or the American banking system collapses , or they and hundreds of thousands of American families lose their homes to the waves of foreclosures -- that these are not necessarily bad things .
It 's like ripping off a bandage , I like to say .
So if you lose your house , your job , your kids , your future , it 's actually just like ripping off a bandage .
Really , it 's for your own good .
How hard is it to understand that ?
Hard , apparently .
That is why I believe that the world 's Ascending Powers ( APs ) , namely China , Russia , and India , should demand that the United States halt its state intervention into its failed banks and let the market sort it out .
Because nothing sorts out economic distortions better than the free market .
Furthermore , American markets must be pried open to allow Chinese , Russian and Indian banks to move in and snap up the collapsing American banks at firesale prices .
True , old nationalist feelings will stir in the American heartland , and Americans will not like watching their once - prized assets sold off to foreigners for cheap , but Americans must be made to understand that they have no other choice .
Their finances are in a mess and no amount of socialism can help .
They must sell everything off now , quickly , and cheaply , to those who understand how to compete in the 21st century market .
Fat is everywhere , and here are just a few suggestions : America could sell NASA to the Chinese and raise a few hundred million dollars , the school system to Russia for perhaps half that , and the Environmental Protection Agency to India , including the parks and recreation services , all legacies of socialism , in return for allowing India to bury its toxic waste in America 's parklands .
If America wants to survive in the new millennium , it will have to undergo a period of pain .
Since each American is less and less valuable on a per-capita basis , it only makes sense that toxic waste should be increasingly directed to American territory .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Five years after he green - lighted the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , President Bush faced strikingly low approval ratings as he reaffirmed his commitment to " accept no outcome but victory " in the war .
Just 31 percent of Americans approve of how President Bush is handling his job , according to a poll released Wednesday , the anniversary of the start of the conflict in 2003 .
Sixty - seven percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey disapprove of the president 's performance .
The 31 percent approval number is a new low for Bush in CNN polling and is 40 points lower than the president 's number at the start of the Iraq war .
" Bush 's approval rating five years ago , at the start of the Iraq war , was 71 percent , and that 40 - point drop is almost identical to the drop President Lyndon Johnson faced during the Vietnam War , " CNN polling director Keating Holland said .
" Johnson 's approval rating was 74 percent just before Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in 1964 , which effectively authorized the Vietnam War .
Four years later , his approval was down to 35 percent , a 39 - point drop that is statistically identical to what Bush has faced so far over the length of the Iraq war , " he said .
But there was no sign that the conflict would end soon .
During a speech at the Pentagon Wednesday , the president called the debate over Iraq " understandable " but insisted that a continued U.S. presence in the region was crucial .
" Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely we will face this enemy here at home , " he said .
" We 're helping the people of Iraq establish a democracy in the heart of the Middle East .
A free Iraq will fight terrorists instead of harboring them . "
Watch Bush speak on the fifth anniversary of the war »
Not far away from the Pentagon , where the president was speaking , voices called for an end to the conflict .
Several hundred anti-war protesters marched through Washington , splattering red paint on government and defense contractors ' offices and occasionally scuffling with police .
Protesters , including many veterans , demanded the arrests of President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as war criminals .
Watch the protests in Washington »
Others hurled balloons full of paint at a military recruiting station and smeared it on and outside buildings housing defense contractors Bechtel and Lockheed Martin .
At least 31 people were arrested after crossing police lines outside the Internal Revenue Service building on Pennsylvania Avenue , protest organizer Freida Berrigan said .
Other protests took place in San Francisco , where 115 people were arrested and released after being cited for misdemeanors such as trespassing , resisting arrest and blocking an intersection , said Sgt. Steve Mannina , a police spokesman .
The legacy of the war
Bush ordered U.S. troops into Iraq on March 19 , 2003 , after months of warnings that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was hiding stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb .
U.N. weapons inspectors found no sign of banned weapons before the invasion , and the CIA later concluded that Iraq had dismantled its weapons programs in the 1990s .
Almost 4,000 Americans have died in Iraq since then , and estimates of the Iraqi toll range from about 80,000 to 150,000 or more .
Almost 160,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq , and the war has cost U.S. taxpayers about $ 600 billion , according to the House Budget Committee .
The president 's approval rating has been below 35 percent since October and has not cracked 40 percent since September 2006 .
Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider discuss Bush 's poll numbers »
Still , Bush 's approval number is still better than the lowest number for his father , George H.W. Bush , who bottomed out at 29 percent in July 1992 ; Jimmy Carter , who fell to 28 percent in June 1979 ; Richard Nixon , at 24 percent in July and August 1974 ; and Harry Truman , who dipped to 22 percent in 1952 .
" Lame - duck presidents presiding over unpopular wars or struggling economies have gotten low approval ratings in the past , " Holland said .
" By contrast , lame ducks like Ronald Reagan , Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton had robust approval ratings in their final years in office , but each one was presiding over good economic times and a country at peace . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted by telephone with 1,019 adult Americans from Friday through Sunday .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

When multiple Athletes are docked together , the habitat doors can be aligned within a thousandth of an inch , creating a seal tight enough that astronauts can pass from their living quarters to a science laboratory next door in their shirtsleeves .
There , astronauts can analyze samples collected on daytime missions or gathered by drills and scoops attached to Athlete 's legs .
They will be searching for solutions to a number of scientific puzzles .
For example : Did a meteorite really kill off the dinosaurs and , if so , when did it happen ?
The clues may be on the moon .
" A big impact on Earth would have covered the moon in a thin blanket of dust , " Wilcox says .
" Because the moon has no plate tectonics , the layers beneath the surface are presumably undisturbed .
Using the scoop on Athlete would allow us to look at the layering and get an unambiguous timeline of when those events occurred — like with tree rings . "
A recent Wall Street Journal describes Ticketmaster 's problems with online scalpers :
The Internet era has brought speed and convenience to all sorts of consumer transactions .
For concertgoers , however , it has also led to ever - faster sellouts for hot events .
Ticketmaster deploys technology that is supposed to stop brokers from gaining access to large numbers of seats via online sales .
But it says brokers ' software circumvents the company 's protections .
That has placed large numbers of seats in the hands of brokers who use eBay Inc. 's StubHub , Craigslist and other online venues to resell the tickets at a big mark up .
One situation roiling consumers involves the 54 - concert " Best of Both Worlds " tour in which singer - actress Miley Cyrus is performing sets as herself and as her fictional alter ego , Hannah Montana .
Parents and children have found finding tickets for the shows difficult and expensive .
The issue is drawing the attention of government officials .
On Thursday -- in a rare Internet - age example of authorities enforcing antiscalping laws -- the attorneys general of Missouri and Arkansas filed lawsuits against people accused of illegally reselling Hannah Montana tickets .
According to StubHub , tickets for " Best of Both Worlds " are currently selling for an average $ 237 , making them pricier than seats for the Police ( $ 209 ) , Justin Timberlake ( $ 182 ) and Beyonc ( $ 212 ) .
The highest face value for a ticket on the Hannah Montana tour : $ 63 .
They must have really pissed off some high ranking political parents to get that kind of attention .
Not that they do n't deserve it -- scalpers are evil , profiteering bastards , to be sure .
They deserve all the pain we can send their way .
The " technology that is supposed to stop brokers " they 're referring to is CAPTCHA .
For instance , companies like Ticketmaster require customers searching for tickets online to replicate a set of the squiggly letters and numbers , known as a " Captcha . "
Theoretically , only human customers can correctly identify the characters despite the odd fonts , screening out automated purchasing programs .
But RMG 's software , according to Mr. Kovach , can also " figure out the randomly generated characters and retype them automatically . "
Mr. Kovach said RMG employees also gave him advice on fooling Ticketmaster 's computers into thinking his requests were coming from different Internet addresses .
Neither Mr. Kovach nor his lawyer could be reached for comment .
So if online scalpers are somehow beating the system , does that mean CAPTCHA has been broken ?
I covered this topic a year ago , and my opinion has not changed .
If CAPTCHAs were well and truly broken , Google , Yahoo , and Hotmail would stop using them .
Why would they continue to use something that does n't work ?
I 'm not going to rehash all the arguments here , but if you have strong feelings on this topic , I urge you to read my earlier post before commenting .
Ticketmaster 's problem is that their CAPTCHA is not good enough .
Programmers do n't seem to understand what makes a CAPTCHA difficult to " break " .
But it 's not difficult to find out .
Heck , the hackers themselves will tell you how to do CAPTCHA correctly if you just know where to look .
For example , this Chinese hacker 's page breaks down a number of common CAPTCHAs , and the price of software he sells to defeat them at a certain percentage success rate :
the9
100 %
$ 500 dvbbs
95 %
$ 1,000 Shanda
90 %
$ 1,500 Baidu
80 %
$ 3,000 eBay
70 %
$ 4,000 Ticketmaster
50 %
$ 6,000 Google
( unbreakable ) Hotmail
( unbreakable ) Yahoo
( unbreakable )
It seems an awful lot of programmers subscribe to the " add some crazy patterns and / or colors to the text and pray for the best " school of CAPTCHA design .
That 's not only sloppy , it just does n't work .
The top of this chart is littered with their failed attempts .
On some sites , this is OK .
They do n't need the same world - class level of protection from bots and scripts that Ticketmaster does -- there 's tremendous financial incentive for scalpers to break their system .
This particular hacker estimates a 50 % success rate against the Ticketmaster captcha , long before the above article was published .
No wonder those parents were n't able to buy their kids Hannah Montana tickets -- it 's not because of failings in CAPTCHA protection , it 's because the ticketmaster programmers failed to implement CAPTCHA correctly .
Instead of hacking together their own partially effective ( and often not even human solvable ) CAPTCHA , what Ticketmaster 's programmers should have done is studied prior art -- in particular , by outright copying the high - volume , extensively researched Yahoo , Google , and Hotmail CAPTCHAs .
I 'm awfully fond of Google 's CAPTCHA technique ; in my professional opinion , it is simultaneously the most readable and the most hellishly difficult to OCR correctly .
If you need industrial strength protection from bots and scripts , that 's where you want to start .
The number of migratory songbirds returning to North America has gone into sharp decline due to the unregulated use of highly toxic pesticides and other chemicals across Latin America .
Ornithologists blame the demand for out - of - season fruit and vegetables and other crops in North America and Europe for the destruction of tens of millions of passerine birds .
By some counts , half of the songbirds that warbled across America 's skies only 40 years ago have gone , wiped out by pesticides or loss of habitat .
Forty - six years ago , the naturalist Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring , a study of the ravages caused to wildlife , especially birds , by DDT .
The chemical 's use on American farms almost eradicated entire species , including the peregrine falcon and bald eagle .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The pesticide was banned and bird numbers recovered , but new and highly toxic pesticides banned by the US and European Union are being widely used in Latin America .
Because of changed consumer habits in Europe and the US , export - led agriculture has transformed the wintering grounds of birds into intensive farming operations producing grapes , melons and bananas as well as rice for export .
Ornithologists say another silent spring is dawning across the US as birds are being poisoned by toxic chemicals or killed as pests in their winter refuges across South and Central America as well as the Caribbean .
They say that many species of songbird will never recover , and others may even become endangered or extinct if controls are not put in place or consumer habits changed .
More problems await those birds which make it home .
Millions of acres of wilderness the birds use as nesting grounds have been ploughed under in the drive to grow corn for ethanol , for bio -fuel .
Some 150 species of songbirds undertake extraordinary migrations up to 12,000 miles every year as they move from the south to nesting grounds in the US and Canada every spring .
Ornithologists say that almost all these species are at risk of poisoning .
The migratory songbirds in most trouble include the wood thrush , the Kentucky warbler , the eastern kingbird and the bobolink , celebrated by the 19th century American poet Emily Dickinson as " the rowdy of the meadows " .
Bridget Stutchbury , an ornithologist and professor at York University in Toronto , said : " With spring we take it for granted that the sound of the songbirds will fill the air with their cheerful sounds .
But each year , as we continue to demand out - of - season fruits and vegetables , fewer and fewer songbirds will return . "

The bobolink songbird has experienced such a steep decline , it has almost fallen off the charts .
The birds migrate in flocks from Argentina , Bolivia and Paraguay to the east coast of the US , feeding on grain and rice , prompting farmers to regard them as a pest .
Bobolink numbers have plummeted almost 50 per cent in the past four decades , according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey .
Rosalind Renfrew , a biologist who studied bobolinks as they were feeding in rice paddies in Bolivia , found about half of the birds had been exposed to toxic chemicals banned in Europe and the US .
Some 40 to 50 species , which include the barn swallow , the wood thrush the dickcissel as well as migratory birds of prey , are starting to disappear .
It is only recently that the decline has been definitively linked to the use of toxic pesticides in the Caribbean and across Latin America .
" Everyone who has looked for pesticide poisoning in birds has found it , " Professor Stutchbury said .
" When we count birds during our summers we are finding significant population declines in about three dozen species of songbirds . "
She wrote in the comment pages of The New York Times : " They are the modern - day canaries in the coal mine . "
She said : " The imported fruits and vegetables found in our shopping carts in winter and early spring are grown with types and amounts of pesticides that would often be illegal in the United States . "
Growers are using high doses of pesticides , which the World Health Organisation calls class I toxins .
These are also toxic to humans and are either restricted or banned in the US and EU .
But controls in Latin American countries are easily flouted .
" I believe that if we do n't make drastic changes quite literally many birds which are common now are going to become rare , " said Professor Stutchbury .
Testing by individual EU countries and the US Food and Drug Administration reveals that fruits and vegetables imported from Latin America are three and sometimes four times as likely to violate basic standards for pesticide residues .
The suspicion that sexual assaults against inanimate objects , including bicycles and hoovers , are on the rise is confirmed by the disturbing news that a man was last month cuffed for " allegedly simulating a sex act with a lamppost " , as the Wiltshire Times puts it .
The incident apparently took place at about 4.45 pm on 16 February , when police received reports of a man " being indecent " in the Queens Road area of Westbury .
The suspect was arrested on 27 February " on suspicion of outraging public decency " and later bailed pending an " extensive police investigation " .
During their probe , officers gathered evidence and statements , " some of which were from children " , and the unnamed man yesterday answered bail for further quizzing .
He was again released " pending further inquiries " . ®

The Polish building contractor recently caught in flagrante delicto with a Henry Hoover is reportedly no longer welcome is his native land .
The local press has , according to the Sun , expressed its outrage at the incident , with one news website advising vacuum - sex compatriots to " stay and carry on hoovering " .
Catholic Poles , meanwhile , claim the chap demonstrates " how their people reject family values when they come here - and often return with sexually transmitted diseases " .
Quite how you catch the clap from a hoover , we know not .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article European Union finance ministers and central bank governors gather in Slovenia on Friday for a two - day informal meeting expected to focus on financial stability and the current global financial crisis .
Financial stability is expected to top the agenda on the first day of the meeting at Brdo pri Kranju , in a suburb of the Slovenian capital Ljubljana .
Finance chiefs and central bankers from the EU 's 27 nations will examine how the financial industry ran into trouble and what they can do to supervise the financial industry and prevent future cross - border financial crises .
The financial crisis , which erupted on the U.S. subprime mortgage market , shows few signs of abating .
The crisis , which is also having an impact on the EU economy , is compounded by soaring inflation that reached a record 3.5 percent in the eurozone in March , well above the 2 percent guideline of the European Central Bank .
This was coupled with news of deteriorating business sentiment in the eurozone .
As part of the efforts to tackle such crises , the ministers , governors and heads of supervisory bodies will sign a memorandum of understanding on cooperation on the management of cross - border crises .
It will include general principles , practical guidelines and an analytical framework for action .
Over lunch the ministers will be joined by the heads of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank for a debate on how to streamline assistance to the Western Balkans .
There are currently over 20 different instruments of assistance to the region , and Slovenia , which currently holds the EU presidency , has re-launched a debate on how to make funding simpler and more efficient .
The second day of the meeting will be devoted to discussing measures to improve the quality of public finances , a priority of the successive EU presidencies of Germany , Portugal and Slovenia .
The ministers are also expected to adopt a common EU position to be advocated at the forthcoming spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
Prior to the meeting , 15 countries of the Euro group will hold a separate meeting to be chaired by Luxembourg Finance Minister Jean - Claude Juncker .
The meeting will discuss euro's record - breaking run on foreign exchange markets which damages euro exports to the U.S. such as German cars and French luxury goods .

Kathleen Seidel is a New Hampshire mother of two .
She runs a blog , Neurodiversity.com , about autism - - a topic of special interest to her as one of her children had an " autistic spectrum diagnosis . "
There is a theory that thimerosal , a preservative formerly used in vaccines , causes autism .
Seidel has written skeptically of that theory , and of the trial lawyers who have sought to cash in on it .
Last month one of those lawyers , Clifford Shoemaker , had Seidel served with a subpoena demanding that she report for a deposition and ...
Eduardo da Silva once had exquisitely skilful and very quick feet .
It is a statement of fact made no less forlorn by yesterday 's optimistic news that we may be able to say that again in roughly nine months ' time .
Certainly , there is no reassurance in the clamour that says however long he is out of the game it will not be because of the malicious nature of Birmingham City 's Martin Taylor .
OK , let 's agree Taylor is not a footballing psychopath and that his reaction of horror at the consequences of his tackle on Eduardo was entirely genuine .
But then let 's agree on something else .
It was the kind of X - rated tackle which has become commonplace in the Premier League .
Taylor 's foot was in the air , his studs were showing , and , given the hair - trigger dexterity of Eduardo on the ball , the chances of injury ran very high .
Some have praised the referee for reaching so promptly for a red card but if you are a traffic cop and someone comes steaming through a red light you do n't wait to see how much mayhem has been caused .
The truth is , Eduardo 's sickening fate was the big accident waiting to happen .
Now that it has , maybe , just maybe , a growing problem will be addressed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The trouble is not , as so many within the game say , that football is a contact sport that would be hopelessly diminished if defenders were not allowed to tackle with some force .
Good defence is as much an art as good attack ; for confirmation you only have to look at Paolo Maldini or , for that matter , Rio Ferdinand and Gaël Clichy on one of their better days .
What has to be attacked , with new legislation , is the trend which Arsène Wenger legitimately criticised while , by his own commendable admission , going completely over the top in his assertion that Taylor should be banned for life .
What should be wiped away is the belief that teams of inferior resources , and thus inferior skills , are somehow justified in reducing the odds against them by blurring the line between honest , and vigorous , defence and tackling that has no place in the game .
We are not talking about the old devilry of over - the - top tackling that became a dark cult in the Sixties and Seventies .
It was also a deadly skill in possession of some of the most talented players who declared that if they ran the risk of dying by the sword while in full view of unknowing officials they might as well wield one in their own defence .
No , the kind of tackle that Taylor inflicted on Eduardo would have been scoffed at in the old days .
It carried the inherent subtlety of a cudgel .
However , nowadays whenever one of those crude assaults occurs there is an instant chorus from the broadcasting booth and analysis couches that what we have seen is no more than an excess of zeal and shortage of timing .
Wenger 's contention , and it is one that has been loudly voiced this season by the only manager in England who can compete at his level of football skill , Sir Alex Ferguson , is that teams struggling for survival in the top flight too often attempt to kick and intimidate their way out of trouble .
This is especially so when they are faced by teams who have got to the top essentially by playing football .
It was a matter , for example , of much civic pride in Bolton that the blood of the old Gunners ran cold whenever they entered the Reebok Stadium .
It was there , incidentally , that Ferguson was most outraged this season when his team surrendered three points in a storm of ferocious and , some would insist , outrageous tackling by Bolton .
We all know about Ferguson 's occasional objectivity bypass – as we do Wenger 's – but anyone in Bolton that day had to understand his rage to some serious degree .
However , Bolton 's new manager , Gary Megson , declared , " I asked them to be aggressive , yes , but I think we only had one bad tackle [ fortunately , no one had their ankle broken in two places ] .
We have to compete and I 'm not going to criticise them for competing .
There would be a lot more complaints from myself if we did not compete .
I know we have a squad to get us out of trouble . "
Naturally , this barrage of euphemism was warmly saluted in the Match of the Day studio .
Birmingham 's manager , Alex McLeish , also stressed his pleasure at the competitive levels achieved by his struggling team against Arsenal .
Here , of course , we have the greatest of all the euphemisms .
If you do n't have a Fabregas or a Hleb or an Eduardo , or a Ronaldo or a Rooney , to be competitive is all .
But at what cost to the quality of the game and the safety of those stars who are supposed to represent the finest development of football in these days of super fitness ?
If Eduardo does beat the odds and makes a perfect recovery , how confident will he be in his sleight of foot , and lightning speed the first time a big , heedless but famously unmalicious defender comes thundering into the tackle ?
And if he ducks the challenge , that is such a central part of his play can he really be said to have recovered ?
Hardly .
Wenger admitted he was wrong to say Taylor 's action warranted a life ban .
However , he would have been right , utterly , if he had said a three - match automatic suspension was completely inadequate .
In this case , and in all others that but for good luck might bring the same horrendous consequences , the punishment should be at least doubled .
A score of witnesses have sworn Taylor does n't have a bad bone in his body but unfortunately , because of a crude and illegal tackle , his victim now has several .
It is a cruel reality that football cannot afford to ignore .
Not if it cares a penny for an image that will always be best protected by its most gifted players .
Ramos ' strong will shows Chelsea error of their ways
It is hard to know who gained office in the more shabby circumstances , Tottenham 's Juande Ramos or Chelsea 's Avram Grant .
Perhaps it was Grant in that he , as the owner 's pal , allowed himself to be the agent of convenience in the relentless undermining of Jose Mourinho .
At least Martin Jol was a dead man scarcely walking when Ramos submitted to Tottenham 's gold .
What is n't at issue any more is which man responded better to the challenge of his first final in English football .
Ramos , having cracked the whip on underachieving Spurs from his first days in office , presided at Wembley over a team made in his own image throughout the Carling Cup final – a team of force and conviction , if not the talent of beaten Chelsea .
By comparison , it was hard to avoid the impression that Grant was somewhat less than his own man when he allowed a palpably unfit Frank Lampard back into the team on such a showpiece occasion .
Ramos has relaunched Spurs with the weight of a man not likely to stand behind a director of football when it comes to telling the board what he wants .
If the directors did n't understand the value of a strong - willed manager making all his own decisions , they surely do now .
Perhaps even for Roman Abramovich the rouble is beginning to drop .
But when it comes to football the oligarch is a slow learner .
Rugby is latest casualty of the English sporting disease
Naturally , there was a fair amount of cheerleading in the BBC 's elevated studio at the Stade de France , but the claim that England 's extremely disciplined but perhaps less than soul - stirring victory had given them an " outstanding " chance of scoring a Six Nations title victory was more than a shade startling .
It is , sadly , more evidence of the English disease that is rampant in all the major sports .
How quick is the move from despair to irrational euphoria .
Whipped by the Kiwis in the one - day internationals , banished from the European football championship and being told how to show up for dinner dressed as a national team rather than refugees from a backyard barbecue , at least the rugby men are about to restore honour .
Or so we are told .
The best advice is for England and their supporters , with or without headphones , to hold the chariot .
Anything less is to insult a superbly poised tournament which has three teams on four points .
England played well in Paris but this was overdue and it is certainly hard to believe the French will ever again perform so guilelessly .
Ireland have rediscovered some of the best of themselves .
Wales have the look of an exciting work in progress .
They also have six points .
This makes them , literally outstanding – and probably , if they tuned in to the Beeb after their slaughter of Italy , rather disturbingly sore .
The best league in the world is back .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan will not allow the squad of Chinese flame guards to intervene with the Beijing Olympic torch ’s progress when it arrives in a Japanese city this month , the national police head was quoted as saying on Friday .
“ We should not violate the principle that the Japanese police will firmly maintain security , ” Kyodo news agency quoted Shinya Izumi , head of the National Public Safety Commission , as saying .
“ We do not know what position the people who escorted the relay are in , ” Izumi was quoted as saying .
“ If they are for the consideration of security , it is our role . ”
The torch is set to arrive in Nagano , central Japan , where the Winter Games were hosted in 1998 , on April 26 , after passing through Buenos Aires , Mumbai , and Canberra , among other cities .
A phalanx of large and physically fit Chinese men in blue - and - white track suits has been trotting besides the torch along its ambitious global torch route and turned off the flame several times in Paris earlier this week .
Chinese state media have reported that the “ flame protection squad ” , consisting of some 70 members of China ’s People ’s Armed Police , has been employed by the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee to safeguard the fire for 24 hours a day .
But the squad ’s heavy - handed approach in managing the torch relay -- which has been a magnet for chaotic demonstrations in London , Paris , and San Francisco over China ’s human rights record and recent government crackdown on monk - led protests in Tibet -- has made some uncomfortable .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has said Australia , not China , would be the one to provide security for the flame when it comes to his country ..
Despite heightened security concerns , Japan ’s Olympic Committee was quoted as ruling out the possibility of shortening or making any other changes to the torch relay in Nagano .
“ Personally , I ’m not thinking about changing anything , ” Japanese Olympic Committee President Tsunekazu Takeda was quoted as saying by Kyodo news agency .
The torch relay ’s San Francisco route was abruptly changed by city officials this week , while Indonesia has said it would significantly shorten its leg of the relay on April 22 .

There may be constituents in wine that protect against dementia .
This is shown in research from the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg in Sweden .
The findings are based on 1,458 women who were included in the so - called Population Study of Women from 1968 .
When they were examined by physicians they were asked to report how often they drank wine , beer , and liquor by selecting from seven categories on a scale from ' never ' to ' daily . '
The researchers know nothing about how much they drank on each occasion , or how correct the estimates were .
For each beverage the women reported having drunk more than once a month , they were classified as a consumer of that particular beverage .
Thirty - four years after the first study , 162 women had been diagnosed with dementia .
The results show that among those women who reported that they drank wine a considerably lower proportion suffered from dementia , whereas this correlation was not found among those who had reported that they regularly drank beer or liquor .
" The group that had the lowest proportion of dementia were those who had reported that the only alcohol they drank was wine , " says Professor Lauren Lissner , who directs the study in collaboration with Professor Ingmar Skoog , both with the Sahgrenska Academy .
The researchers nevertheless are reluctant to make any recommendations regarding whether a woman should begin to drink wine , continue to drink wine , or increase their consumption .
It 's also important to point out that these findings cannot be generalized for men , who have a different pattern of drinking .
" We have to be very cautious when we interpret these results , since we can't see in this type of population study what is cause and what is effect .
There may be other factors in women who drink wine that provide them with protection against dementia , factors that we can't measure .
But the correlation found is a strong one and can't be explained by other factors that we can measure , such as education , BMI , and smoking , " says Lauren Lissner .
The researchers already knew that the drinking habits of Swedish women have changed over the last few decades .
Today 's women drink more wine and liquor , but less beer , than earlier generations did .
The study shows , for example , that fewer than 20 percent of middle - aged women drank wine every week in the late 1960s .
Today more than half of all women of that age report that they drink wine every week .
" These findings , in combination with the fact that women today drink more wine than 40 years ago , show that it is important to continue to do research on this correlation .
In future analyses we will be studying the effect on more specific types of dementia , such as Alzheimer 's disease .
Other research methods will be needed in order to see what role wine and other alcoholic beverages play in the development of dementia , " says Lauren Lissner .

In what is being billed as the most important firearms ruling in a generation , the US supreme court begins hearing a case tomorrow that will decide whether Americans have a personal right to own guns .
The city of Washington DC has outlawed gun possession for more than 30 years , but a 65 - year - old security guard is challenging the rule which he says prevents him from keeping a gun at home to protect his family .
If the supreme court strikes down the city 's ban , considered the nation 's strictest gun law , the floodgates could open for legal tests on rules limiting gun ownership in the US .
Bankrolling the court challenge is Robert Levy , an affluent lawyer , who believes the Washington ban violates the gun rights set out in the second amendment of the US constitution .
Regardless of which side the court supports , both the gun rights and gun control movements are bracing for a political upheaval .
" It is a potentially huge , landmark decision , maybe the only decision in our lifetime in which the supreme court will tell us what the original meaning of the constitution is without being impeded by precedents , " said Randy Barnett , a Georgetown University law professor .
The US gun rights movement has grown increasingly powerful despite the number of shootings in schools , including the Columbine massacre nine years ago and the murders at Virginia Tech University .
The death toll in the US from firearms far outranks other western countries .
About four of every 100,000 Americans were killed by guns in 2002 , compared with just 0.15 in England and Wales , according to the UK - based Gun Control Network .
It is against this politically and socially incendiary backdrop that the high court will begin examining gun possession for the first time in more than 70 years .
Lawyers for the city are conscious of the recent string of massacres in the US .
They argue that the handgun ban is reasonable in the light of the danger posed by a high crime rate .
" Preventing [ serious ] harm is not just a legitimate goal ; it is a governmental duty of the highest order , " the city 's legal team wrote to the high court .
But Dick Heller , the security guard bringing the lawsuit , cites the local crime rate as a justification for keeping a gun at home .
" I want to be able to defend myself and my wife from violent criminals , and the constitution says I have a right to do that by keeping a gun in my home , " he said when the supreme court agreed to hear the case in November .
" The police can't be everywhere , and they can't protect everyone all the time . "
Other critics of the Washington ban view outbreaks of violence in the US as proof that gun control laws have failed .
" If you look at crime rates , [ Washington ]
DC 's crime rate skyrocketed after the ban was put in place , " said Andrew Arulanandam , spokesman for the National Rifle Association .
" We believe it 's for the simple reason that law - abiding people did n't have the means of defending themselves . "
Barnett , of Georgetown law school , pointed out that Virginia Tech advertised its broad ban on gun use before the massacre there .
" Even in Britain , I do n't think people would want to put a sign on their door saying , ' This is a gun free zone ' , " he said .
" That 's what Virginia Tech was . "
Levy agreed : " If you could prove that gun laws are making us safer , the remedy is to change the constitution . "
The outcome of the court 's decision , expected in June , is likely to have an impact on the presidential election .
The Republican nominee , John McCain , has joined a majority of the US Congress in opposing the Washington ban over the objections of the Bush administration , which fears that overturning the law could threaten other national gun restrictions .
McCain might use the ruling to shore up his conservative credentials , particularly with voters who applauded the supreme court 's shift to the right under George Bush .
But the Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have quietly supported the city 's position .
A ruling that supports individual gun rights would force both to address gun control , an issue their party has played down in recent years as rightwing activists have fuelled the strength of the gun rights movement .
Legal experts say backers of gun rights could have more to lose than to gain from the court case , because the US political dynamic already favours gun owners .
" I thought this litigation was a terrible idea from the beginning , and I speak as someone who thinks the constitution guarantees an individual right [ to own guns ] , " said Brannon Denning , a law professor at Samford University in Alabama .
" Gun rights were being protected pretty well already , at least in line with what popular opinion thinks the second amendment does . "
The president of The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , a lobbying group , also predicted that the court ruling would be " a shot in the arm " for his camp .
" The only thing that hurts our efforts is if it's an extreme decision that says you can't have any limits , any time , anywhere , " Paul Helmke said .
" But anything short of that - that basically allows reasonable restrictions ... I think could help the gun control movement . "
Quest falls to a security guard
Robert Levy , below , is so committed to defeating the strongest gun ban in America that he used his personal fortune to take the case all the way to the supreme court .
But he does not even own a gun .
A senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute , a Washington research foundation , Levy says his challenge is not about weapons or about the laws banning them , but about respect for the US constitution .
The wealthy libertarian , who graduated from law school in his 50s after making money from stock market analysis , began his quest to test the strength of gun rights with a simple recruitment drive : he needed people with compelling personal reasons for owning a gun , who would sue the city of Washington .
The dream team was found without even placing an advertisement .
He chose six plaintiffs with diverse backgrounds to file lawsuits against the city handgun ban .
But of the six , five had their cases dismissed by judges who did not believe they could demonstrate injury .
The last man standing is Dick Heller , a security guard , who sees his case go to trial this week .
Brain surgeons
Unless you ’ve been stranded on a remote Pacific isle , you ’re no doubt aware of the current furor over third party iPhone applications not being able to run in the background .
To be blunt , I ’ve never seen so many experts without a fricken ’ clue .
If you have n’t written code using the jailbreak tool chain , your opinions on the iPhone SDK , based entirely on what you see in a simulator , just are n’t relevant .
You might as well be explaining the nuances of brain surgery .
As someone who has been involved in iPhone development for the past six months , please let me offer you a healthy dose of reality .
Twitterrific on the iPhone could definitely make use of a background process to gather new tweets .
In fact , a prototype version of the software did just that .
And it was a huge design failure : after doing XML queries every 5 minutes , the phone ’s battery was almost dead after 4 hours .
In fact , the first thing I said after giving Gruber this test version was “ do n’t use auto - refresh . ”
The heart of the problem are the radios .
Both the EDGE and Wi-Fi transceivers have significant power requirements .
Whenever that hardware is on , your battery life is going to suck .
My 5 minute refresh kept the hardware on and used up a lot of precious power .
( Those of you under NDA with the iPhone SDK should take a look at the documentation for Core Location .
After reading about how it should be used , you ’ll understand why getting your location in Maps and similar applications is only done on an “ as needed ” basis . )
And right about now , you ’re thinking “ But I ’ll be smart about how I use the hardware . ”
Sorry , bucko , but you ’re the exact reason why we do n’t have background processing in the current SDK .
You ’re living in your own little dream world .
What happens when App A uses the network at 5 minutes past the hour , and App B uses it at 10 minutes past , and App C uses it at 15 minutes past , and so on ?
There ’s no way for you to know what other apps are doing is there ?
And yet the battery is still taking a pounding .
In my opinion , such a scenario is quite likely .
As a satellite device , the iPhone requires contact with other machines to do interesting things .
Periodically hitting the network is the primary reason that developers want to run in the background .
Some have stated that Apple is limiting innovation .
My opinion is that they are helping us from collectively shooting ourselves in the feet .
It takes several months of actual iPhone development before you eventually realize that the iPhone requires a completely different mindset .
Until that happens , you ’ll make assumptions based on desktop experience , and that in turn will lead to a lot of bad designs .
For what it ’s worth , I think Apple will address this issue in the future .
I can imagine a solution based on a plug - in ( bundle ) architecture that lets your application do things when the phone decides it ’s a good time ( not when you decide it ’s a good time . )
If the radios go on because you ’re checking Mail , then you get a “ network active ” notification and a chance to run some short - lived TCP / IP connections .
If you take too long , you ’d get killed , much like Safari does with Javascript that runs too long .
Do I expect such a sophisticated system to be available in a beta of version 1.0 ?
Hell no .
And neither should you .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Trading desks across the United States stopped on Wednesday to watch the resignation speech of New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer , fascinated by the downfall of the man who built a career on investigating Wall Street crimes .
Spitzer had faced growing pressure to quit after The New York Times reported on Monday that he was caught on a federal wiretap arranging to meet a prostitute at a Washington , D.C. , hotel last month .
At around 11:45 a.m. EDT on Wednesday in New York , Spitzer finally resigned , with traders across the country agog .
“ This is bigger than ( Fed Chairman Ben ) Bernanke , bigger than oil , and it may be even bigger than the Super Bowl , ” said Brian Taylor , head currency trader at M&T Bank in Buffalo , New York .
“ Everybody is glued to their desks .
No one has made as many enemies on Wall Street as Spitzer did --
The Street is loving it and I would n’t be surprised to hear a big cheer throughout the trading desk when he goes , ” Taylor added .
Spitzer , 48 and married , is a former New York State chief prosecutor who built his reputation investigating financial crime on Wall Street and probed prostitution rings .
“ He ’s had such a big impact on Wall Street over the past decade that desks are following this story like it ’s Anna Nicole Smith or O.J. Simpson in the courtroom , ” said Edward Bretschger , director , equity sales and trading , at Calyon Securities in New York .

In a statement that dwelled on his remorse for “ private failings , ” Spitzer said Lt. Gov. David Paterson will replace him next Monday , but made no specific reference to the allegations surrounding him .
“ I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me .
To every New Yorker and to all those who believed in what I tried to stand for , I sincerely apologize , ” Spitzer said . ”
Spitzer , who attracted wide publicity but also resentment on Wall Street with his pursuit of financial crimes while he was the state ’s attorney general , became governor with nearly 70 percent of the vote in November 2006 on pledges to clean up state politics .
Even outside of New York , Spitzer ’s downfall was followed with intense interest .
“ Every desk stopped to listen to the story , ” said Warren West , head trader at Greentree Brokerage Services Inc. in Philadelphia .
“ He definitely lived in the media so it is very fitting that he dies there too . ”
In the Midwest , fund managers and traders were also preoccupied with their televisions .
“ Everyone stopped , ” said Mirko Mikelic , portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids , Michigan .
“ After months of just being hammered by all the bad news in the fixed income market , it is actually a welcome distraction . ”
To get the most from your frequent flier credit card , you need to rack up those points .
In this article , we ’ll discuss tips on how you can get more from your frequent flier card and how you can maximize the benefits from it .
What Kind of Travel Reward Credit Card do You Own ?
If you own a travel reward credit card , take a look at it and see if it ’s a frequent flier card or a generic mileage credit card .
Remember that generic mileage credit cards give you the option to purchase tickets or redeem your travel reward points from several choices of airlines .
On the other hand , if your credit card uses a specific frequent flier program , you ’re only allowed to redeem your miles points from one particular carrier .
Racking Up Your Points
Applying for a frequent flier credit card is recommended for those who travel a lot .
If you ’re not a frequent traveler , it may be best to apply for a different type of rewards credit card .
For instance , you can earn rewards more easily with a cash back credit card or a gas station credit card .
On the other hand , the best way to collect miles points on your frequent flier account is by purchasing airline tickets from your affiliate carrier .
Thus , if you really do n’t travel much , it may take a very long time before you qualify for a free travel .
If that ’s the case , be sure your frequent flier card does n’t impose black out dates or you can end up losing all the points you ’ve collected .
Another way to rack up those points is by using your credit card not only on your purchases but on paying your bills as well .
Use your frequent flier card to pay your electricity bills , cable , telephone and other subscriptions .
Use it whenever you refuel in gas stations as well .
The important thing to remember while using your credit card in making payments is to pay off your charges in full each month .
Remember , you do n’t want to end up paying for high interest rates just because you delayed or missed on your credit card payment .
The purpose of getting a reward credit card is to get incentives for your usage .
But if you usually pay for the interest , you may be paying for more than what you get from your credit card .
One final reminder , if you ’re using a frequent flier miles credit card , keep in mind that the available seats for your affiliate carrier are only limited .
If you ’re going to a tourist destination or if you ’re traveling during holiday seasons , you may experience difficulty placing your reservation .
To avoid hassles , as you reach your qualifying miles points , coordinate with your credit card issuer in advance and make sure that you ’ll be able to book your flight early with your affiliate airline .
By making plans and preparations in advance , you can enjoy your free travel reward without headaches or complications .

" Let 's get something straight .
You do n't assume something is terrorism .
You declare early on that it is not assumed to be terrorism . "
" Police and the FBI , which is aiding the inquiry , said they do n't suspect terrorism .
Ricin is also used in experimental cancer treatments .
Castor beans , the key ingredient of the toxin , were found in the Extended StayAmerica hotel room , police said . "
So all 's okay with the world .
Oh , there 's a guy in a coma after exposure to the stuff .
And Associated Press is reporting
that " Firearms and an " anarchist type textbook " were found in the same motel room where several vials of the deadly toxin ricin was found , police said Friday . "
But not to worry .
There 's nothing unusual happening here .
And in all the articles , they keep talking about " the man " a 57 year old man .
No name no info on where he 's from .
You think his name , or some info about who he is might be worth mentioning in an AP or Bloomsberg article .
Remember those good 'ol journalistic questions ?
Who ?
What ?
Why ?
Where ?
When ?
I guess the pros reporting on this story , and their editors forgot to ask that question , or even to mention that the information on WHO was refused by the police or FBI .
Would n't want to get people 's suspicions up if the name or origin of the man would raise suspicions of terrorism .
Oh , and CNN reports that days before the ricin was discovered , they had suspicions , so they searched the room , but did n't find anything .
Then , later , someone who knew the victim in hospital raise the alarm .
That 's when they found the anarchist book , guns ... but still , no reason to suspect terrorism .
And CNN does n't mention who " the man " is , or the person who knew the man .
The Las Vegas police spokesperson reported , " There is no information to lead us to believe that this is the result of any terrorist activity or related to any possible terrorist activity , " AP reports .
Maybe this goes back to my speculation on FBI instructions to new recruits .
Maybe they do n't want to see possible terrorist ties .
Me , when I think of Ricin in the news , I think of people killed in Japanese subways , terrorists plotting , ricin found in 2004 in the capitol .
But no , maybe the Ricin here accidentally fell in " the man " the unindentified man who also had an anarchist book , with the page on ricin bookmarked , maybe that book just accidentally showed up in the room .
Or , maybe , just as I do n't trust the economic numbers the Bush administration dishes out , I do n't believe it when they say there are no cases of terrorism in the US .
Yep .
I do n't believe it when they say there have been no cases of terrorism because it has been clear that they would n't tell us if there were .
It would be nice if we could at least find out who the guy with the anarchy book bookmarked to the ricin page was .

Some guy confronts a couple of cops on their parking habits .... he thinks they have parked illegally .
In testimony before Congressional committees last week , Gen. David Petraeus portrayed Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s late March offensive in Basra as a poorly planned effort that departed from what US officials had expected .
What Petraeus did not reveal is that al - Maliki was deliberately upsetting a Petraeus plan to put US and British forces into Basra for a months - long operation to eliminate the Mahdi Army from the city .
Petraeus referred to a plan for an operation to be carried out in Basra that he and his staff had developed with the head of the Basra Operational Command , Gen. Mohan al - Furayji .
But Petraeus carefully dodged a question from Sen. Hillary Clinton about what resources he was planning to deploy to Basra and over what length of time .
Clinton evidently suspected that the plan envisioned the deployment of US troops on a large scale in the Shiite south , despite the fact that the Iraqi government is supposed to be responsible for security there .
Petraeus responded vaguely that it was " a phased plan over the course of a number of months during which different actions were going to be pursued . "
Reports in the British press indicated , however , that the campaign plan was based on the assumption that British and US troops would play the central role in an effort to roll up the Mahdi Army in Basra .
The Independent reported Mar. 21 that Gen. Furayji had publicly declared there would be a " final battle " in Basra , probably during the summer , and that Britain had already promised to provide military forces for the campaign .
It quoted " senior government sources " as saying that Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s earlier pledge to cut the number of British troops in the south from 4,100 to 2,500 would " almost certainly be postponed until at least the end of the year " .
Two days later , the Sunday Mirror quoted a " senior US military source " as saying that the " coalition " would turn its attention to Basra once the " huge operation " in Mosul against al - Qaeda and nationalist Sunni insurgents was completed , and that the US was prepared to redeploy " thousands " of US marines to Basra , if necessary .
This plan for a major foreign troop deployment to the south for the first time since the US battles against the Mahdi Army in April 2004 did not sit well with al - Maliki .
In 2006 and 2007 , he had repeatedly blocked US proposals that US and Iraqi forces target Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army in Baghdad as well as in the south .
When Vice President Dick Cheney , who had previously played the " bad cop " in the George W. Bush administration ’s relations with al - Maliki , visited Baghdad in mid-March , one of his objectives was to get al - Maliki to go along with the Petraeus plan to eliminate the commanding position of Sadr ’s forces in Basra .
Al - Maliki has told Iraqi officials that Cheney put pressure on him to go along with the Basra operation , according one Iraqi source .
After Cheney met briefly with al - Maliki Mar. 17 , he discussed the " security situation " with Sadr ’s Shiite rival , Abdul - Aziz al - Hakim , head of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , which has been pushing for the destruction of the Mahdi Army .
Cheney lavished praise on Hakim , whom he ostentatiously called " my friend " , for " working so hard with the United States and with Iraq ’s other leaders to advance the cause of Iraq ’s freedom and democracy . "
The signal of the Bush administration ’s intentions toward Sadr could hardly have been clearer .
The Cheney visit apparently mobilized al - Maliki , but not in the way Cheney had intended .
Four days later , when Petraeus met with al - Maliki ’s national security adviser Mowaffak al - Rubaie to talk about the US campaign plan for Basra , al - Rubaie warned Petraeus that al - Maliki had a different plan .
Petraeus was apparently told that the operation would last from a week to 10 days — not the several months envisioned in the Petraeus plan .
The main point of al - Maliki ’s operation , however , was that it would exclude US troops .
As al - Maliki explained in an interview with CNN correspondent Nic Robertson Apr. 7 , he had demanded that US and British troops stay out of Basra , " because that would give an excuse to some militant groups to say that this is a foreign force attacking us . "
al - Maliki thus feared that a confrontation between thousands of US and British troops and the Mahdi Army would further inflame the feelings of Shiites in the south about the occupation , with which his own regime has been so tightly linked .
The Shiite south has become the most anti-occupation region in the country .
The British polling firm ORB , which has been doing opinion surveys in Iraq since 2005 , found in March that 69 percent of respondents in the south believed security would improve if foreign troops were withdrawn , and only 10 percent believed it would get worse .
When al - Maliki met with Petraeus the following morning , according to Petraeus ’s spokesman , Petraeus warned against sending " a couple of brigades " into the city , suggesting that he did not consider the scale of the operation to be large enough .
Nevertheless , when al - Maliki told him the decision to launch an operation in Basra had already been made and that it would begin in three days , Petraeus agreed to support it .
When the Basra operation became an obvious disaster , however , Washington officials began to question al - Maliki ’s motives .
On the third day of the operation , as Bush administration officials were reassessing what they described as " a rapidly deteriorating situation in southern Iraq " , one official told the Washington Post ’s Peter Baker they were comparing conspiracy theories about why al - Maliki had acted so precipitously .
Although that comment was not explained , it clearly implied that al - Maliki was deliberately undermining the US objective of eliminating the Mahdi Army by using US and British troops .
Bush administration suspicions of al - Maliki ’s intentions could not have been eased by the fact that a delegation of pro-government parties traveled to Iran to ask the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) to negotiate a ceasefire with the Mahdi Army .
That ploy move , which did result in a tenuous ceasefire , raised the possibility that al - Maliki intended from the beginning that the outcome of the Basra operation would be a new agreement that would prevent the deployment of US and British troops to fight the Mahdi Army during the summer .
Bush administration officials have been asserting that the most important thing about the Basra operation is that al - Maliki is now convinced that Iran is really an enemy rather than a friend .
But al - Maliki ’s Apr. 7 interview with CNN ’s Robertson made it clear that he has not budged from his position that his government ’s interests lie in an accord between Iran and the United States — not in taking sides against Iran .
" We will always reject the idea of any side using Iraq as a launching pad for its attack on others , " said al - Maliki .
" We reject Iran using Iraq to attack the US , and at the same time we reject the idea of the US using Iraq to attack Iran … "

In the call to Jewish New Yorkers , Mr. Allen said , the caller asks : '' Did you know that before Mrs. Clinton started her run for our U.S. Senate seat , she supported a Palestinian state and did n't support moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem ? ''
According to Mr. Allen , the caller goes on to say that Mrs. Clinton took money from an organization that '' openly brags about its support of Hamas and Yasir Arafat , a group that our own State Department called a terrorist organization because of its attacks on Israeli civilians . ''
In June 1999 , Mrs. Clinton broke with her husband 's administration and said in a letter that she wanted the United States Embassy moved as soon as possible to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv .
In the Republican committee 's calls to non-Jewish New Yorkers , callers say that Mrs. Clinton accepted money from an organization that '' openly brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group -- the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the U.S.S. Cole . ''
Officials of the American Muslim Alliance acknowledge that some members have hard - line views against Israel , but they say the group is essentially mainstream and advocates peaceful solutions to the Mideast conflict .
Its support has long been actively courted by politicians of both major parties -- notably Gov. George W. Bush of Texas , who recently accepted its endorsement for president .
A co-founder and former president of the American Muslim Alliance , Farooq Ansari , expressed distress last night over the telephone campaign .
'' We are just as good citizens as anyone is , '' Mr. Ansari said .
'' Associating Muslims in this country with terrorists is nothing less than McCarthyism .
It is totally false , inaccurate and should totally be stopped . ''
Mr. Allen said the Cole reference was not included in the call to Jewish voters only because each script had to be limited in length .
He said he did not know the process by which New Yorkers were identified as Jews and non-Jews .
He also said he was unable to provide a written text of either script last night .
Mr. Powers , the state Republican chairman , is a former marine known for advocating particularly tough campaign tactics , a trait that has been on particular display in this contest to succeed Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan , who is retiring .
For example , Mr. Powers wrote a fund - raising letter that described Mrs. Clinton as an ''ambitious , ruthless , scheming , calculating , manipulating woman . ''

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Growing scrutiny into subprime mortgages has failed to stop unscrupulous lending practices to blacks , Hispanics and other minority groups , U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said on Monday .
Greater Southwest Development Corporation Director of Counseling Services Livia Villareal stands before a foreclosed home in Chicago January 28 , 2008 .
Growing scrutiny into subprime mortgages has failed to stop unscrupulous lending practices to blacks , Hispanics and other minority groups , U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said on Monday .
REUTERS / John
Gress
Frank , chairman of the Financial Services Committee , warned lenders that regulators would crack down on groups shuttling minorities into subprime loans designed for people with weak credit histories or low incomes .
“ We are still seeing more blacks and Hispanics being pushed into subprime mortgages than they should be and that ’s where you ’ll see more regulation , ” the Massachusetts Democrat said in response to a question after a speech at Boston University .
More than 2 million subprime borrowers face higher mortgage costs and the possible loss of their homes if they cannot meet the payments .
Studies have found that blacks and Hispanics were likely to be charged higher interest rates on subprime loans than whites with similar credit ratings .
Frank helped craft legislation to curb predatory practices aimed at minorities seeking home financing and has pushed for more oversight of lenders in the wake of losses tied to mortgage securities .
Calling the current U.S. economic downturn the worst in a decade , Frank said there was clear evidence that too little regulation can be damaging .
Innovation in products and practices must be fostered , but regulation is needed to stem potential abuses , he added .
“ We ’ve got to enhance the ability of regulatory entities to do their job and to pay them well , ” said the trained lawyer who has represented Massachusetts in Washington since 1981 .
Frank also said it was wrong to turn owning a home into one of Americas ’ biggest dreams .
“ I wish everyone in America earned enough money and had enough sense to own a home , ” Frank said , adding however that many people are pushed into improperly buying one instead of renting .
“ Home ownership is a good thing but Americans also made a great mistake where home was equated to home ownership , ” Frank said .

Bruce Bartlett and I disagree about the size of government .
He would starve the beast , I would want it healthy and thriving , but I have no disagreement with his view of the general lack of character Republicans have displayed on the budget issue :
The GOP 's bait - and - switch tax strategy , by Bruce Bartlett , Commentary , LA Times :
It is an article of faith among Republicans that tax cuts are the cure for every problem the economy faces , and that tax increases are the equivalent of economic poison .
Any hint by Democrats that the current administration 's tax cuts should be revisited in light of changing economic or fiscal conditions is met with charges that they are proposing the largest tax increase in history .
The truth is that President Bush 's tax cuts did n't do much good for the economy ; they were mostly giveaways to GOP political constituencies and were little different conceptually from pork - barrel spending ...
The fact is that the massive tax increase Republicans claim the Democrats are proposing is entirely the result of the GOP 's ... policies .
Rather than expend the effort to make their tax cuts permanent in the first place , they attached expiration dates to every major provision .
...
The alleged tax increase that would result is simply a consequence of the tax system returning to what it was before 2001 ...
In other words , no one is proposing new taxes ...
It is simply a matter of allowing the law that Republicans enacted to follow the course that they chose in the first place .
Republicans respond that they ... did n't have the votes to enact permanent tax cuts , so it was temporary cuts or nothing .
This is not true .
They could have made them permanent , but that would have required bipartisanship and more political capital than Republicans were willing to spend .
So they took the easy way out , figuring that Democrats would n't dare oppose extending the tax cuts when the time came , lest they be accused of favoring a vast tax increase .
But this is n't even the worst of the Republican dishonesty .
That goes to projections from the Congressional Budget Office showing a sharp reduction in budget deficits after 2010 .
But these lower deficits result largely from the expiration of the tax cuts and the higher revenues that would result .
Thus , Republicans are trying to ... blame Democrats for advocating higher taxes while implicitly using those higher taxes to make future deficits smaller .
This sort of political game may be fun for Republicans who think that they have boxed Democrats into a corner .
But this game has had real economic consequences .
Because the tax cuts are not permanent , their economic impact has been severely diminished .
All economists know that permanent tax changes have far more effect than temporary ones because people wo n't change their behavior significantly unless they have some assurance that the tax regime will be in effect for the long term .
...
There is little doubt that the economy would have been stronger with permanent tax cuts .
But that would have meant fewer tax cuts and thus fewer opportunities to buy votes .
It also would have forced Republicans to deal with the true budgetary consequences of their actions .
...
Tax policy is an important campaign issue , and it would be good to get agreement on the post - 2010 tax code as soon as possible .
Current law makes it impossible to plan for the future with regard to taxes .
Whatever is done should be done permanently to the greatest extent possible .
He believes tax cuts promote economic growth to a much larger degree than I do , but there is some common ground .
He wants taxes to be efficient , i.e. to promote maximum growth given the size of government that taxes must support , and I do too .
Thus , to the extent that we can make the tax code more efficient through budget neutral tax changes without compromising equity , we should n't resist doing so .
A budget neutral shift in taxes can promote economic growth in the same way that a tax cut does if the shift eliminates or substantially reduces economic distortions , though as I noted above tax changes are not the first place I would look if enhanced growth was the goal .
What this means is that instead of letting all the Bush tax cuts expire , there is the possibility of retaining some of the existing tax cuts while enacting new ones to replace them so that the revenue implications are the same , but the economic and equity properties are the same or better .
However , given that this would be played as Democrats enacting new taxes , the politics that are involved make such a shift in taxes unlikely even though it would bring about the very thing Republicans claim they want , higher economic growth .
I think Bruce Bartlett is honest in his belief that permanently lowering taxes has a significant effect on economic growth and that this belief corresponds to his small government philosophy , my difference on this issue is over the magnitude of the growth effect relative to what you must give up in terms of key government programs when taxes are cut .
But for many Republicans , it seems as though the growth argument is merely an excuse to attain their real goal , smaller government , and their support of pretty much any tax cut that is proposed is evidence that growth is not the primary concern .
Paul Krugman puts it this way :
Since the 1970's , conservatives have used two theories to justify cutting taxes .
One theory , supply - side economics , has always been hokum for the yokels .
Conservative insiders adopted the supply - siders as mascots because they were useful to the cause , but never took them seriously .
The insiders ' theory - what we might call the true tax - cut theory - was memorably described by David Stockman , Ronald Reagan 's budget director , as " starving the beast . " ...
Starve - the - beasters believe that budget deficits will lead to spending cuts that will eventually achieve their true aim : shrinking the government 's role back to what it was under Calvin Coolidge .
And when taxes have been cut recently , who has benefited most from what is " little different conceptually from pork - barrel spending " is worth thinking about as well .

Everything .

Nothing jolly about that fucker .
That bizarre , jerky robotic walk and that cold , lifeless smile will haunt our dreams forever more .
If this commercial was a horror movie , it would surely feature a friendly , 70 - year - old farmer who , on seeing this terror descending upon his farm , would let out a blood - curdling scream and and take cover behind a bale of hay .
But after noticing the Giant 's calm , smiling face and gentle demeanor he would foolishly step from behind his makeshift shelter and attempt to make nice with a few stammering " H - h - hey buddy 's " and an ice breaking " Are ya lost ? "
All fears would be put to rest when Big Green magically produced a can of Niblets and bent down as if to make a peace offering to the gentle farmer .
It 's at that point our beloved farmer would be bludgeoned to death with the can of corn and promptly devoured .

Quick conversation with Jonathan Pink , partner at Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith
Minow : Could you tell us about the new decision about the state university professor who was sued for copyright infringement ?
Pink :
The case is Marketing Information Masters v. The Trustees of the California State University .[. pdf ]
For several years prior to the suit , the Pacific Life Holiday Bowl had hired Marketing Information to calculate the fiscal impact the Holiday Bowl ( college football game ) had on the City of San Diego .
When Marketing Information tripled its fee , the Holiday Bowl hired San Diego State University to conduct the 2004 survey , but instructed the school to follow the format of earlier years .
When San Diego State delivered its 2004 report to Pacific Life , Marketing Information obtained a copy and cried foul .
Marketing Information alleged that in creating the 2004 report , the school and one of its professors had copied large portions of Marketing Information ’s 2003 report .
The Trustees and the professor filed a motion to dismiss , claiming that the Eleventh Amendment provided them with immunity to a claim for copyright infringement .
While Marketing Information argued that the Eleventh Amendment did not apply because Congress passed the Copyright Remedy Clarification
Act which expressly provided that “ [ a ] ny State , instrumentality of a state … or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State … shall not be immune , under the Eleventh Amendment ” to a suit for copyright infringement .
17 U.S.C. section 511 ( a ) , the defendants argued that the Clarification Act was an invalid exercise of Congress ’s power .
The District Court agreed with the defendants , finding that the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act “ was not passed pursuant to a valid exercise of [ Congress ’s ] Fourteenth Amendment enforcement powers , ” and “ does not constitute a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity . ”
In short , the Court invalidated the Copyright Remedy Clarification
Act as unconstitutional , thus ruling that a State , employee of a State ( acting within his or her official capacity ) or instrumentality of a State cannot be held liable for copyright infringement .
Minow :
Do all state employees have immunity for copyright infringement ?
Pink : No .
The Court ’s ruling only applies to state employees acting within their “ official capcity . ”
This gets a little tricky because a state official who has acted in violation of federal law will be stripped of his or her “ official ” character and will not be immune to suit under the 11th Amendment .
Thus , for example , in the Marketing case , plaintiff may not seek damages against the professor in his official capacity as that it would violate the state ’s sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment , but the professor likely would be “ stripped of his official or representative character ” and would be “ subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct ” if plaintiff can show that the professor violated plaintiff ’s federally protected copyright .
In other words , a state employee will be subjected to suit in his or her individual capacity even though he or she had been acting as an agent of the State if it is shown that the employee ’s conduct was ultra vires his or her delegated authority , e.g. by violating a federal law .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
In the swank Country Club area of Anthem , Ariz. , Barbara Ward - Windgassen 's rescue group has saved a bichon frise , Lhasa apso and shih tzu -- some with their leashes still on -- after their owners had abandoned them in their foreclosed high - priced homes .
She 's also helped find new homes for a rottweiler and pit bull that were being cared for over the fence by neighbors for nearly two months after the family left them in the back yard when their house was taken back by the bank .
Call it reckless abandonment .
Shelters and animal rescue organizations across the country are packed cage - to - cage with dogs and cats , even birds and reptiles , that have been ditched or dropped off as scores of foreclosed - upon homeowners relocate .
It is a disturbing trend and a sign of the tough economic times that has prompted a number of organizations to form hotlines for pet foster homes and to implore pet owners -- or what the industry calls " pet parents " -- to seek help for their animals before they head off .
" There are a lot of people who are just walking away and leaving their pets behind , which breaks everyone 's heart , " said Windgassen , the president of Anthem Pets , a nonprofit animal welfare organization in her community .
The number of abandoned pure - bred dogs in her neighborhood alone has jumped 10 - fold just since Christmas .
" It just boggles my mind , " she said .
" It 's cutting across all income levels and age levels . "
Owners surrender their pets for a variety of reasons , ranging from allergies to plain disinterest .
And there 's no law that says people have to be honest about why they 're giving up their pets ( though there are laws in many states that prohibit pet abandonment ) .
There are no national statistics on pet abandonment or on the number of pets found in vacant properties .
But Stephanie Shain , director or outreach for the Humane Society of the United States , said shelters are reporting full capacity and rescue organizations tell of sharper increases in the numbers of animals coming in .
" The economic times are making everyone pull their belts in a little tighter and people are having trouble taking care of their pets or keeping them if they 've lost their home , " she said .
As consumers face foreclosures they often move first to rental apartments or homes that wo n't allow pets .
They 're also likely to give their pets up if they find themselves imposing on a family member for housing .
No pets allowed
Rick Johnson , the director at the Sacramento Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in California , has found a " marked increase " in the number of drop offs to his center in recent months that he 's attributing to what have become called " foreclosure pets . "
Last December , Johnson said he had 176 pets on board compared with 78 the year before .
" We 're up about 20 % this year over the same period last year at this point and we have been identifying foreclosures " as a prime reason , he said .
Of those who say they are moving -- and willing to talk about it -- one in four admit they are leaving their pet behind because they 're losing their homes and relocating to a leased unit that wo n't allow animals .
" Most people are pretty embarrassed when they come or certainly distraught over having to give up that animal , " Johnson said .
Some dogs , for example , are 10 years old or older , and have been with the owners their entire lives .
" The pain is real for those people . "
Vivian Kiggins , executive director of the Liberty Humane Society in New Jersey , said her center has an extraordinarily large number of mature cats in need of adoption now .
That 's atypical of most early springs that are relatively quiet until the " kitten season " kicks in .
" We should be at a low point right now , but we 're packed with adult cats , " she said , noting that it could be a reflection of the economy .
" We 've had people say they can't afford their pets and we do everything in our power to make sure that they can keep them with free - food programs and low - cost veterinarian appointment opportunities , " she said .
In need of funding
Shelters and rescue centers often rely on donations for their programs and are stepping up efforts to increase giving .
In Delaware , GOP Rep .
Mike Castle has launched a three - week drive with the Food Bank of Delaware called " Donating Food to Fight Foreclosure . "
The campaign -- whose mascot is a 1 - year - old homeless Chihuahua named Sasha -- seeks donations of all kinds of nonperishable foods and pet food .
The Humane Society , which cares for some 8 million pets annually , is starting a fund that will provide grants to animal shelters and rescuers to help them keep up with requests for help .
" Their resources are getting tapped , " Shain said .
It 's also launching awareness programs to promote its food - assistance and foster programs as well as other plans to support animal - friendly help groups .
Meanwhile , the 1- 800 - Save-A- Pet.com
Web site is setting up an online database on which people can offer to provide foster care for animals whose owners may not be able to keep them for as long as a year .
" It can work if it 's done properly and the people who are fostering the animals understand they are providing a temporary home , " said David Meyer , president of the nonprofit adoption group .
More than 5,000 animal shelters post pets for adoption on the Save - A - Pet site .
Compelling pictures
Meyer , who was among those involved in finding families for pets left homeless amid the destruction and flooding in New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina , said this latest wave of needy pets is as great a concern but without the heart - wrenching pictures that motivate the greater public .
" The message has n't gotten out , " he said .
" When Katrina happened people were seeing images in their homes of pets being rescued in boats in New Orleans .
There was a dramatic message that got out .
It was a clear and compelling issue and people understood that there was a need to provide for these pets . "
" This is like a silent , creeping flood that has moved across the country but has not created the images that has spurred the public into action , " he said .
" But it 's still an imminent crisis . "
It 's weird to see people talk about Google App Engine online because I think many people focus on minor details .
Like , to make apps scale horizontally you do need a " shared - nothing " infrastructure , so that 's not really novel .
The BigTable aspects are sorta interesting except there 's nothing there ( in terms of application design ) that you could n't have gotten out of the paper , and the App Engine API is so high - level it's not that close to BigTable .
It 's more like any other high - level flat - address object database , like maybe CouchDB .
The Python thing is also pretty irrelevant ; they just picked a language they have experience with ( having Guido around helped ) , and it's easier to launch supporting one API thanlanguages ' worth .
A good engineer just solves the problem with the tools available , and Python is a pretty good tool to start with .
As for evil plans to steal ideas or code , that 's between you and your skepticism .
Big companies are surprisingly good at doing shitty things , and Google is definitely big , but it's also true that within Google people really try to do the right thing .
I was touched to see a privacy - concerned friend of mine start using Gmail after he was hired , saying that only after he saw how seriously they take privacy inside the company could he feel confident about using it .
But I can't tell you anything that will change your mind about this subject .
I developed an internal application using Google App Engine on and off over a period of months ( during its development I kept trying it out ) and then finally rewriting a few weeks before launch ( after the APIs had all settled ) .
Here are some real problems I 've encountered : 1) All code runs only in response to HTTP fetches .
So that means no cron jobs , and no persistent server - side processes .
I know I just wrote above that you can't really have persistent jobs if you want to scale , but ultimately real apps do occasionally need these .
For example , imagine a timed test app that needs a consistent view of time no matter which server ( or datacenter ! ) the user hits .
A time server becomes a single point of failure but when it 's critical for your app it can be engineered around .
2 ) No long connections means no " comet " ( server - push messaging ) .
My first thought on hearing about App Engine was to port lmnopuz but I can 't.3 ) Playing around with your data is hard .
Since there 's no way to perform operations on your data except by uploading code to the server , you 're often left creating a new URL per operation you want to perform .
Hacks like the shell helps with this , but a lot of the time I want to be able to just run a local script and see the output .
( For my project I found a decent workaround : make a URL that accepts Python code as a POST and runs it .
Then your scripts just need to know to serialize themselves into strings and send them over the wire . )
But see the next point .
4 ) Slow table scans .
My app had ~ 1200 rows that it performs various analyses on and produces graphs .
I can appreciate that such a query is labor - intensive , and so I had written it to cache the results of the graph generation ( the rows only change once a day ) .
But I can't even seed the cache once because fetching 1200 rows is too slow to happen within a single query .
5 ) Bulk operations are hard .
Say you want to delete all objects in a table ( or class , I forget the App Engine term ) .
The " delete " operation requires you fetch the object first , and then you 're back into slow table scans land .
The best you can do is batch up your processing into multiple smaller stages , each of which write their intermediate output into the data store : either make a page that auto - refreshes itself with Javascript and leave a browser pointed at it , or make a command - line script that repeatedly hits a URL on your app .
6 )
No arbitrary queries .
( If you have n't read the docs in detail , you would n't know this , but any query that involves multiple attributes [ columns , if you 're still thinking SQL ] of an object must have an index exactly matching the query .
They make index creation and maintenance trivial , and even automatic in most cases . )
Though everyone 's repeatedly shoehorned SQL underneath object - relational mappers , App Engine ( and others ) demonstrate that you can provide an object storage API and gain performance by not using SQL underneath .
I argue the real utility of SQL is that it lets you quickly ( in terms of programmer time , not machine time ) perform queries that you have n't done before and wo n't do again .
Say I learn about a bug where I built all of March 's data with the word " none " in place of where a column should really be null ( None in Python terms ) -- that 's a line of SQL to fix but it's a world of pain with App Engine due to the bulk operations thing .
With all that said , it 's still pretty good .
When I was looking to switch projects about a year ago , it came down to basically three projects and App Engine was one of them , because the guys who work on it are some of the best hackers I know at the company .
All of the above bullet points ( and minor stuff like the languages thing ) are n't fundamental limitations of the design , they 're temporary flaws that can be solved by good engineering and are surely being prioritized by the team .
I 'm pretty confident it 'll improve rapidly .
Decide where you want your protection , across what doorways and then decide on where you want the laser to plug in and where you want the photocell box to pick up the laser .
I used 1 " square mirrors ( from an arts and crafts store ) and HandiTak to mount the mirrors .
You could use a more permanent solution for the mirrors .
The idea is to angle all the mirrors to the next wall across where you want protection and then have it end up pointing at the photocell .
In the last week , I have managed to burn one knuckle on each finger , two fingertips , the palm of one hand and the back of the other .
My hands , more or less , look like I washed them in napalm .
I could , of course , blame all this on the fact that I 've had to use the deep fryer at work more often than usual the last few days , but even if I did n't go anywhere near a tub of boiling oil , I 'm sure I would have managed to find a way to hurt myself .
You see , I 'm a klutz .
And that 's why today we 're going to talk about one of my brothers in arms , a fellow klutz .
Quite possibly the most infamous klutz in American history .
Harry K. Daghlian , Jr. had spent most of the summer of 1945 working as an assistant in the preparation of a plutonium core for the Trinity nuclear bomb test in Alamogordo , NM .
The tests were successful , and in August he was moved to the Los Alamos Omega site , where he assisted with a series of experiments concerning the critical masses of a 13.6 pound sphere of plutonium in various tungsten carbide tamper arrangements .
In these experiments , the tungsten bricks were slowly added around the core as neutron reflectors , serving to reduce the mass required for the plutonium to go critical .
Eventually , enough bricks would have been added to allow the assembly to go into a controlled critical nuclear reaction , basically becoming a miniature nuclear reactor .
On the morning of August 21 , Daghlian constructed a cube of tungsten carbide bricks around the plutonium sphere on a square base measuring 14 - 7/ 8 inches per side ( photo below is from a re-creation of the experiment ) .
He noted that the assembly was found to be critical when five layers of bricks were completed and two additional bricks were placed in the middle of a sixth layer .
That afternoon , he constructed another cube around the plutonium , this time on a 12 - 3/ 4 inch square base .
Criticality was achieved when five layers of bricks were completed , it was a smaller , more efficient assembly .
As he disassembled the materials and returned the plutonium to its vault , Daghlian began planning the next criticality experiment and decided to he would construct the next assembly on a 10 - 5/8 inch square base .
He then went to dinner and a lecture at the site 's theater , during which he decided to return to the lab that evening to continue the tests , rather than the next morning as originally planned .
Daghlian had been working in the government labs for some time at this point , and was no doubt well aware that his decision to perform a potentially hazardous experiment alone and after - hours violated official safety regulations .
His mind was made up , though , and he returned to the lab at 9:30 that night .
He removed the plutonium from the vault and , using the clicks of a Geiger counter as a guide , completed four - and - a - half layers on the new assembly .
As he went to place another brick in the fifth layer , the increasing clicks alerted him that this brick would cause the assembly to go supercritical , meaning an increasing rate of fission , as opposed to the equilibrium fission of the critical state .
A supercritical mass , as we 'll see , is not a good thing .
He immediately withdrew the hand holding the brick , but was struck by an ill - timed case of butterfingers .
He dropped the brick into the center of the assembly .
He instinctively pushed the brick away from the assembly with his right hand , which immediately became enveloped in the blue glow that was now surrounding the plutonium .
At 9:55 , Daghlian partially disassembled the experiment and went to the hospital to have someone look at his tingly , glowing blue hand .
Daghlian received a total - body radiation exposure of approximately 480 roentgens ( the unit of measurement for ionizing radiation ) of soft x-rays and 110 roentgens of gamma rays .
Because of the way the accident happened , though , the distribution of radiation was n't uniform .
His left hand , which dropped the brick , received 5,000 to 15,000 rem ( rÃ¶ntgen equivalent in man , the unit of measurement for a radiation dose ) , and his right hand , which he used to push the brick away , received 20,000 to 40,000 rem .
Let 's put that in perspective : most charts explaining exposure levels and their corresponding symptoms describe 5,000 rem as 100 % fatal and do n't go any further .
Harry was , to say the least , in bad shape .
During the 25 remaining days of his life , Daghlian experienced swelling and numbness in his hand , unrelenting nausea , repeated bouts of retching and vomiting , prolonged episodes of hiccups , hair loss , reddening of both forearms , neck and face and a progressive loss of skin layers .
On September 15 , 1945 , Daghlian went into a coma and died at 4:30 PM .
Los Alamos issued a press release that said Daghlian died from " chemical burns , " rather than radiation poisoning .
This little bit of information manipulation transformed Daghlian from America 's first nuclear casualty into an obscure footnote in history ( at least until Wikipedia came along ) .
But , like me , he was a bit of a klutz ; and for that , we salute him .

To the Editor :
Your article about network management ( “ F.C.C. Weighing Limits on Slowing Web Traffic , ” Business Day , Feb. 26 ) did n’t mention how the broadband regulations suggested by a few at the Federal Communications Commission would undermine one of the most important goals that African - American civil rights organizations share : achieving 100 percent access to affordable broadband for people of color .
Unfortunately , that goal is at risk from the looming threat of bandwidth congestion because of a few heavy users of peer - to - peer technology .
If Congress were to mandate that network operators essentially observe Internet congestion , consumers would be faced with either sluggish / interrupted Internet access or pay unreasonable new fees and charges .
Therefore , the only responsible action is for Internet service providers to engage in content - neutral and transparent management of their broadband networks that protects not just free speech , but also the opportunity of affordable broadband unperturbed by the few peer - to - peer users .
We ’re pleased to see that the F.C.C. is reviewing the network management issue and look forward to a reasonable and appropriate finding .

Veteran CBS News Anchor Dan Rather speaks out on BBC Newsnight tonight
The veteran CBS News anchor and reporter Dan Rather has for the first time attacked the climate of patriotism in the United States , saying it 's stopping journalists asking tough questions .
In an exclusive interview with BBC TWO 's Newsnight tonight ( Thursday 16 May ) , he admits he has held back from taking the Bush administration to task over the so - called war on terror .
Rather says : " It is an obscene comparison - you know I am not sure I like it - but you know there was a time in South Africa that people would put flaming tyres around people 's necks if they dissented .
And in some ways the fear is that you will be necklaced here , you will have a flaming tyre of lack of patriotism put around your neck .
Now it is that fear that keeps journalists from asking the toughest of the tough questions , and to continue to bore in on the tough questions so often .
And again , I am humbled to say , I do not except myself from this criticism . "
Rather admits self - censorship : " What we are talking about here - whether one wants to recognise it or not , or call it by its proper name or not - is a form of self - censorship .
It starts with a feeling of patriotism within oneself .
It carries through with a certain knowledge that the country as a whole - and for all the right reasons - felt and continues to feel this surge of patriotism within themselves .
And one finds oneself saying : ' I know the right question , but you know what ?
This is not exactly the right time to ask it '. "
He tells Newsnight : " I worry that patriotism run amok will trample the very values that the country seeks to defend ...
In a constitutional republic , based on the principles of democracy such as ours , you simply cannot sustain warfare without the people at large understanding why we fight , how we fight , and have a sense of accountability to the very top . "
He declares himself a patriot , but for him the essence of being American is being able to bring the government to account : " It 's unpatriotic not to stand up , look them in the eye , and ask the questions they do n't want to hear - they being those who have the responsibility , the ultimate responsibility in a society such as ours , of sending our sons and daughters , our husbands , wives , our blood , to face death , to take death .
Now , in my position my view is not to ask the tough questions in this kind of environment is the height of lack of patriotism . "
Rather is also stinging about the lack of access and information the Bush administration is giving news journalists over the war : " There has never been an American war , small or large , in which access has been so limited as this one .
" Limiting access , limiting information to cover the backsides of those who are in charge of the war , is extremely dangerous and cannot and should not be accepted .
And I am sorry to say that up to and including the moment of this interview , that overwhelmingly it has been accepted by the American people .
And the current administration revels in that , they relish that , and they take refuge in that .
" What 's being done practically in real terms is in direct variance with the Pentagon 's stated policy .
The Pentagon stated policy is maximum access and maximum information consistent with national security . "
Rather is dismissive about the new trend in American television - " militainment " - mass market reality shows about life in the military .
The Pentagon has given unprecedented access to RJ Cutler to make Military Diaries for VH1 , which airs later this month .
It features service men and women talking personally about the music they listen to away from home , and includes exclusive footage of Operation Anaconda .
Rather says : " The belief runs so strong in both the political and military leadership of the current war effort that those who control the images will control public opinion .
They realise what an entertainment - oriented society ours has become .
Therefore one way of looking at it is quite natural , they would say to themselves : ' Hey , we 've had the Hollywoodisation of the news , we have had the Hollywoodisation of almost everything else in society , why not the Hollywoodisation of the war ? '
" And I want to say quietly but as forcefully as I can that I hope this does n't go any further , it has gone too far already .
I am appalled by it , I do think it is an outrage , this is a personal opinion . "
RJ Cutler - the maker of the Oscar - nominated documentary , The War Room , on the 1992 Clinton campaign - responds : " I always think what we do is more real than conventional news coverage .
I think that journalism has extraordinary merits and its place , but that the work of documentary filmmakers is really to get to the core of something both more dramatic and more human . "
Other " militainment " TV shows include the upcoming Profiles From the Frontline by Jerry Bruckheimer for ABC and the CBS drama documentary JAG about life in the US Navy ( which recently featured a military tribunal ) .
CBS has already aired - and pulled - the reality TV show American Fighter Pilot .

Blogging can help you feel less isolated , more connected to a community and more satisfied with your friendships , both online and face - to - face , new Australian research has found .
The research , from Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne , found after two months of regular blogging , people felt they had better social support and friendship networks than those who did not blog .
Researchers James Baker and Professor Susan Moore have written two papers investigating the psychological benefits of blogging , regularly updating personal web pages with information that invites others to comment .
The first , published in the latest issue of the journal CyberPsychology and Behaviour , compares the mental health of people intending to blog with that of people not planning to blog .
Moore says the researchers messaged 600 MySpace users personally and directed them to an online survey .
A total of 134 completed the questionnaire - 84 intended to blog and 50 did not .
" We found potential bloggers were less satisfied with their friendships and they felt less socially integrated , they did n't feel as much part of a community as the people who were n't interested in blogging , " Ms Moore said .
" They were also more likely to use venting or expressing your emotions as a way of coping .
" It was as if they were saying ' I 'm going to do this blogging and it 's going to help me ' . "
And it seemed to do the trick , as the researchers ' second study shows .
This study , which is yet to be published , was conducted two months later .
The researchers sent out questionnaires to the same group of MySpace users - this time 59 responded .
Bloggers reported a greater sense of belonging to a group of like - minded people and feeling more confident they could rely on others for help .
All respondents , whether or not they blogged , reported feeling less anxious , depressed and stressed after two months of online social networking .
" So going onto MySpace had lifted the mood of all participants in some way , " Ms Moore said .
" Maybe they 'd just made more social connections . "
With storm clouds hanging over the U.S. economy , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has gone on the offensive , slashing the federal funds target rate by 3 full percentage points — to 2.25 percent — since September .
But despite the central bank 's aggressive action , prospective homebuyers are left scratching their heads .
After all , the average interest rate on a 30 - year , fixed - rate mortgage has fallen by only about half a percentage point , to 5.85 percent , since mid-September .
So what gives ?
Here 's a look at the factors influencing today 's mortgage rates and a peek at where rates might be headed .
Does the Fed set mortgage rates ?
No .
The Fed is responsible for setting the federal funds target rate , which is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans .
" A bank 's balance sheet needs to balance every day , " says Ken Mayland , president of ClearView Economics .
" If a bank needs funds , it will borrow .
If it has a surplus , it will lend — at the federal funds rate . "
Interest rates on short - term certificates of deposit and commercial paper are closely linked to the federal funds rate , Mayland says , but its influence on fixed - rate mortgages is less direct .
Does the federal funds rate affect mortgage rates ?
Only indirectly .
The fed funds rate affects a lender 's borrowing costs .
When the federal funds rate is cut , lenders pay less for the funding they need to finance loans .
As such , they can reduce the interest rates they charge on mortgages without hurting their profit margins .
" You 're not looking at any kind of direct relationship , " says Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics .
" When you think about a fixed - rate mortgage , you 're talking functionally about a 30 - year bet of which the short - run costs of capital are but a minute part . "
So what are the key factors that determine mortgage interest rates ?
Fixed mortgage rates typically track the yield on the 10 - year treasury note .
" The 30 - year mortgage tends to have roughly the same [ sensitivity to interest - rate changes ] as a 10 - year treasury , " says T.J. Marta , a fixed - income strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
" On average , people pay off their mortgage roughly every 10 years . "
The outlook for inflation plays a key role in determining the yield on the 10 - year treasury , Marta says .
In order to compensate lenders and investors for the risk that home loans will not be repaid , mortgage interest rates are set higher than the yields on 10 - year treasuries , which are essentially risk free .
Historically , the typical difference between mortgage rates and the 10 - year treasury yield — known as the spread — has been roughly 1½ percentage points .
In the mortgage industry , the difference between these two rates is often referred to as a " risk premium . "
How have those factors influenced mortgage rates lately ?
Although 10 - year Treasury yields have declined in recent months , risk premiums have widened dramatically .
The spread between the average 30 - year fixed mortgage rate and the 10 - year Treasury yield has ballooned nearly 60 percent over the past year , to about 2 ½ percentage points , according to HSHAssociates.com , which tracks mortgage rates .
" That spread — the normal 1.5 percentage points — has gone haywire , " says Orawin Velz of the Mortgage Bankers Association .
What is driving up those risk premiums ?
Before the housing crisis , mortgages were considered safe investments , so risk premiums were slim .
During the housing boom , huge swaths of home loans were pooled together and sold to investors in the form of mortgage - backed securities .
But rising delinquencies on subprime home loans led to large - scale losses for investors holding such products .
With demand for mortgage - backed securities evaporating , higher returns were required to attract new buyers , who were fleeing to safer investments like treasury securities .
Meanwhile , banks — which have absorbed billions of dollars in losses since the onset of the crisis — have been requiring tougher underwriting standards and wider spreads on new mortgages .
" The spreads [ between the 10 - year treasury yield and mortgage rates ] are wide because of a pickup in defaults and delinquencies and an expectation of more to come , " says Michael Darda , chief economist at MKM Partners .
As a result , the recent declines in the yield of the 10 - year treasury have been more than offset by the escalating risk premiums .
That has prevented mortgage rates from falling as much as they otherwise might .
Will these risk premiums decrease anytime soon ?
As portfolios begin to heal from the housing market 's wrath , risk premiums should begin to decrease , says Keith Gumbinger , vice president of HSHAssociates.com .
" We 'll start to get to a point where lenders will feel more comfortable passing along more of those declines in interest rates [ to customers ] and certainly expanding — nibbling at the fringes — of lending they used to embrace wholeheartedly , " Gumbinger says .
" So you should see some of those risk premiums start to decline , especially for the best credit quality borrowers . "
Indeed , the risk premiums have decreased recently — although they remain well above historical norms .
Gumbinger credits the narrowing in part to recent changes allowing government - sponsored mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase their holdings of mortgage - backed securities .
" Lots of liquidity is becoming available to good credit quality borrowers , " he says .
What 's the outlook for the 10 - year treasury ?
While risk premiums may decline , the 10 - year treasury yield is expected to increase .
Marta of RBC Capital Markets expects the yield to be about 3.9 percent by the end of the year , up from its current yield of about 3.5 percent .
" Back in January , on the [ Société Géneralé ] meltdown , we made our second - lowest yield in [ modern ] history , " Marta says .
" I do n't really see that yields are going to get a whole lot lower than this . "
So where will mortgage rates be at the end of the year ?
Velz of the Mortgage Bankers Association expects the rate on the 30 - year fixed mortgage to be just over 6 percent at the end of the year .
Rates could go lower , she says , should the economy slip into a protracted recession — which she does not expect .
How attractive are current mortgage rates ?
Up to 1,000 men , some suspected of being members of the Serbian Ministry of Interior police , crossed into northern Kosovo yesterday amid rising fears that minority Serbs living in the new state 's north would attempt effectively to partition Kosovo along the Ibar River .
After two days of rapidly rising tensions between Serbs and Albanians following Kosovo 's declaration of independence from Serbia on Sunday , eyewitnesses counted close to 200 cars and buses crossing from southern Serbia full of men .
In a day of high drama , masked Serbs also torched two border posts separating Serbia from Kosovo , located at Jarnije and Banja about 18 miles north of Mitrovica , with bulldozers and plastic explosives .
Nato troops later closed down the roads leading to the checkpoints , cutting off the only link between northern Kosovo and Serbia .
Several incidents were reported overnight , including masked attackers throwing grenades at UN and Albanian - owned buildings .
No one was reported injured .
UN and Nato officials seemed to have been taken largely by surprise by yesterday 's events , which saw KFor troops being sent in to rescue personnel trapped at the border posts .
Protesters also tipped over metal sheds that housed Kosovo 's customs service and sent them sliding down a hill and into a river .
They also vandalised and set fire to passport control booths .
" It was very dangerous and the police had to withdraw and call for help from Nato peacekeepers , " said Veton Elshani , a spokesman for Kosovo 's multi-ethnic police force .
In Belgrade , the Serbian government minister for Kosovo , Slobodan Samardzic , hailed the attacks , saying : " Today 's action is in accordance with the general [ Serbian ] government policies .
" Belgrade has the intention to take over the customs in northern Kosovo , " Samardzic told private B92 television .
" The customs points were intended to become part of [ Kosovo 's ] state border and we are not going to let that happen . "
The attacks and arrival of the convoys from Serbia were an ominous reminder of the enduring potential for violence in the new nation of Kosovo as it embarks on European - supervised independence .
The EU's new envoy , Pieter Feith , arrived in Pristina yesterday , accompanied by the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , to mark the beginning of Kosovo 's new era .
Feith will lead a " stability mission " of 1,800 EU police and legal experts who will run the country 's court system for the next few years .
In the coming days , Feith , a Dutch diplomat with extensive Balkan experience , will also take over leadership of the International Civilian Office , which will give him the power to overturn legislation and sack Kosovan officials .
European officials insisted he would try to keep a low profile and use his powers only in extreme circumstances when , for instance , the country 's democracy or minority rights were in jeopardy .
Yesterday 's incidents were an illustration of the central problem facing Feith and the Albanian majority government in Pristina - the refusal of Kosovo 's Serb minority and the Belgrade government to acknowledge the former province 's sovereignty .
Elsewhere in the Serb - dominated north witnesses also spoke of police stations once occupied by the joint Serb - Albanian Kosovo police service now displaying the Serb flag .
The fears that Serbia is intending to put its police force into the north follow rumours being circulated among Kosovo police service officers in Mitrovica that Serb members are planning to resign en masse in the coming days .
The attacks and the arrival of a convoy from Serbia come as further demonstrations are planned against the declaration of independence in Mitrovica and Serbian cities this week .
Your Flag Decal Wo n't Get You Into Heaven Anymore

While digesting Reader 's Digest
In the back of a dirty book store ,
A plastic flag , with gum on the back ,
Fell out on the floor .
Well , I picked it up and I ran outside
Slapped it on my window shield ,
And if I could see old Betsy Ross
I 'd tell her how good I feel .
Chorus :
But your flag decal wo n't get you
Into Heaven any more .
They 're already overcrowded
From your dirty little war .
Now Jesus do n't like killin '
No matter what the reason 's for ,
And your flag decal wo n't get you
Into Heaven any more .
Well , I went to the bank this morning
And the cashier he said to me ,
" If you join the Christmas club
We 'll give you ten of them flags for free . "
Well , I did n't mess around a bit
I took him up on what he said .
And I stuck them stickers all over my car
And one on my wife 's forehead .
Repeat Chorus :
Well , I got my window shield so filled
With flags I could n't see .
So , I ran the car upside a curb
And right into a tree .
By the time they got a doctor down
I was already dead .
And I 'll never understand why the man
Standing in the Pearly Gates said ...
" But your flag decal wo n't get you
Into Heaven any more .
We 're already overcrowded
From your dirty little war .
Now Jesus do n't like killin '
No matter what the reason 's for ,
And your flag decal wo n't get you
Into Heaven any more . "
“ I like to plant flower boxes , and I change them weekly and water them if the owner forgets to , ” she said .
“ I often go to the flower district early in the mornings or out to the big nurseries on Long Island to get just the right thing to put in a pot on a brownstone stoop .
But , then , I ’m a bit of a perfectionist . ”
Ms. Goldman also routinely buys new trash cans and paints the street address on them in an effort to make the best impression when prospective buyers arrive to see a listing .

Other brokers emphasize luxury services .
Karen Heyman , a broker in the SoHo office of Sotheby ’s International Realty , always hires car services to ferry potential buyers to see her Brooklyn listings .
She says it ’s worth it to her , in the end , to cover this expense herself .
“ The bottom line is that we ’re all independent contractors , ” she said .
“ Our offices have certain budget formulas , but I find those restrictive .
If I think there ’s something I can do to increase the likelihood of a sale , I ’ll do it , no matter what . ”
Agents also use their commissions as leverage in making deals happen .
“ Say a seller ’s at $ 900,000 , and a buyer wo n’t go higher than $ 895,000 , ” said Michael Signet , director of sales at Bond New York , which has five offices in Manhattan .
“ Our broker might call the other broker and say , ‘ You pick up $ 2,500 , and we ’ll pick up $ 2,500 . ’
That way we do n’t lose the deal . ”
Because the New York City market is growing increasingly stressful  sellers worry the peak has been reached and potential buyers are reluctant to commit for fear of paying too much  more is being asked of brokers .
BRISTOL ( Reuters ) - Airbus is planning to fly an A380 , the world 's largest airliner , on alternative fuel for the first time , the planemaker said on Friday .
A double - decker aircraft loaded with special fuel derived from natural gas will take off from the Airbus plant at Filton near Bristol in western England at 1400 GMT ( 9 a.m. EST ) and perform a three - hour test flight ending at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse , southwest France , it said .
The A380 entered service with Singapore Airlines late last year after an 18 - month delay caused by difficulties in installing the mammoth aircraft 's complex wiring .
But Airbus hopes the plane will become the centerpiece of efforts to adapt planes to the next generation of cleaner , alternative fuel at a time when the aviation industry is under pressure over the impact of aircraft emissions on the climate .

The authorities are inspecting the statue to see if it can be repaired The authorities on Easter Island have detained a Finnish tourist on suspicion of trying to steal an earlobe of one of the world - famous moai stone statues .
Police on the Pacific island , which is an overseas territory of Chile , said a woman had seen him rip off the earlobe , which then fell and broke into pieces .
Marko Kulju could face seven years in prison and a fine if convicted under laws protecting national monuments .
The statues of Polynesian ancestors are believed to be up to 1,000 years old .
There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island , in various stages of construction , some of them more than 10 m ( 33 ft ) tall and weighing more than 80 tons .
The island 's Rapa Nui National Park , in which the moai are situated , became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1995 .
Fortunately , this type of thing does not happen everyday , but it does happen , and it is almost impossible to control
Liliana Castro
Easter Island government Mr Kulju was visiting Anakena beach on Sunday when he was allegedly seen using his hands to tear off the earlobe of a 4 m ( 13 ft ) high moai , Easter Island Police Chief Cristian Gonzalez told the Associated Press .
The earlobe then fell to the ground and broke into 20 - 30 cm pieces , at least one of which Mr Kulju allegedly attempted to steal , Mr Gonzalez added .
" Fortunately , this type of thing does not happen every day but it does happen and it is almost impossible to control because on Easter Island there are sites of great archaeological value everywhere and the park guards cannot prevent all such incidents , " government official Liliana Castro said .
Authorities on the island are inspecting the statue to see if it can be repaired .

NASA 's Cassini spacecraft tasted and sampled a surprising organic brew erupting in geyser - like fashion from Saturn 's moon Enceladus during a close flyby on March 12 .
Scientists are amazed that this tiny moon is so active , " hot " and brimming with water vapor and organic chemicals .
New heat maps of the surface show higher temperatures than previously known in the south polar region , with hot tracks running the length of giant fissures .
Additionally , scientists say the organics " taste and smell " like some of those found in a comet .
The jets themselves harmlessly peppered Cassini , exerting measurable torque on the spacecraft , and providing an indirect measure of the plume density .
" A completely unexpected surprise is that the chemistry of Enceladus , what 's coming out from inside , resembles that of a comet , " said Hunter Waite , principal investigator for the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio .
" To have primordial material coming out from inside a Saturn moon raises many questions on the formation of the Saturn system . "
" Enceladus is by no means a comet .
Comets have tails and orbit the sun , and Enceladus ' activity is powered by internal heat while comet activity is powered by sunlight .
Enceladus ' brew is like carbonated water with an essence of natural gas , " said Waite .
The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer saw a much higher density of volatile gases , water vapor , carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide , as well as organic materials , some 20 times denser than expected .
This dramatic increase in density was evident as the spacecraft flew over the area of the plumes .
New high - resolution heat maps of the south pole by Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer show that the so - called tiger stripes , giant fissures that are the source of the geysers , are warm along almost their entire lengths , and reveal other warm fissures nearby .
These more precise new measurements reveal temperatures of at least minus 93 degrees Celsius ( minus 135 Fahrenheit . )
That is 17 degrees Celsius ( 63 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer than previously seen and 93 degrees Celsius ( 200 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer than other regions of the moon .
The warmest regions along the tiger stripes correspond to two of the jet locations seen in Cassini images .

" These spectacular new data will really help us understand what powers the geysers .
The surprisingly high temperatures make it more likely that there 's liquid water not far below the surface , " said John Spencer , Cassini scientist on the Composite Infrared Spectrometer team at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colo .
Previous ultraviolet observations showed four jet sources , matching the locations of the plumes seen in previous images .
This indicates that gas in the plume blasts off the surface into space , blending to form the larger plume .
Images from previous observations show individual jets and mark places from which they emanate .
New images show how hot spot fractures are related to other surface features .
In future imaging observations , scientists hope to see individual plume sources and investigate differences among fractures .
" Enceladus has got warmth , water and organic chemicals , some of the essential building blocks needed for life , " said Dennis Matson , Cassini project scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" We have quite a recipe for life on our hands , but we have yet to find the final ingredient , liquid water , but Enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more . "
At closest approach , Cassini was only 30 miles from Enceladus .
When it flew through the plumes it was 120 miles from the moon 's surface .
Cassini's next flyby of Enceladus is in August .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The mission is managed by JPL for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .

First thing Friday morning , before anyone showed up to rent a television for the Super Bowl , Deborah Williams walked in the door of the Rent - A - Center store under the Broadway el in Bushwick , Brooklyn .
She was delivering $ 109 in cash , her February payment for a 27 - inch television that she is buying over time .
If she does not miss any payments , she will own the television by the summer , for a total of about $ 900 .
Such televisions can be bought retail for well under $ 400 , but that would require more money than Deborah Williams can put her hands on at one time .
This is a big week in the television rental business .
Fliers were slipped under the doors at the Astoria Houses in Queens that urged people to hurry to the Rent - A - Center on Steinway Street so they could have a big new TV for the football game .
Among the offers was a 40 - inch Bravia , with payments of $ 47.51 a week .
In 117 weeks , the customer would own the set outright , for $ 5,558 .
If this were set up as a loan , the interest rate would be 71 percent and illegal under the usury laws .
But this deal is called “ rent to own . ”
In all other particulars , it is much like a subprime mortgage for pull - out sofas and television sets .
How long before feminists try to censor this ?
Last week , Science Daily reported on a study from Northwestern University which proved “ that girls have superior language abilities than boys ... and gender differences in language appear biological . ”
Through MRI scans , the researchers discovered that girls ’ brains work harder and use more areas during language tasks than boys ’— leading them to conclude that “ boys ’ and girls ’ brains are different . ”
This is bad news for feminists , who insist that men and women are really the same ( besides the obvious physical distinctions ) , and that any differences are the products of socialization , “ gender roles ” and discrimination — and any scientist who suggests otherwise will be punished .
We ’ll probably never know how great a role biology plays in gender differences , because feminists try to prevent anyone from researching it .
That ’s exactly what happened at Harvard University in 2005 .
During an academic conference , Harvard ’s then - president Larry Summers discussed several theories about why there are fewer female math and science professors .
In addition to gender discrimination , Summers floated the possibility of “ different availability of aptitude at the high end ” — in other words , there are more men than women with the top - notch math and science abilities expected of elite professors .
He also noted that more research was needed to explain the gender discrepancy .
But , apparently , more research is the last thing feminists want .
At the mere suggestion of innate gender differences , a few feminists in the audience literally ran from the room crying .
One professor , Nancy Hopkins , said she had to leave the room “ or else I would ’ve either blacked out or thrown up . ”
( While Hopkins never responded to Summers with a scientific argument , she did manage to reinforce the stereotype that women are too emotional to handle scientific debate and will respond to difficult situations by bursting into tears .
Thanks , Nancy ! )
A few months later , Summers was forced out of his presidency in order to appease the science - averse feminists .
Predictably , scholars who are n’t intimidated by feminists are ridiculed and ostracized .
Last year , Louann Brizendine , a neuropsychiatriast at the University of California San Francisco , published her book The Female Brain , which is based on more than a thousand studies from the fields of genetics , neuroscience , and endocrinology .
After decades of research , Brizendine concluded that male and female brains are both structurally and hormonally different .
As she wrote , “ there is no unisex brain … girls arrive already wired as girls , and boys arrive already wired as boys . ”
Feminist book reviewers and columnists — who do n’t have degrees in neuroscience , just a faith - based belief that socialization accounts for all gender differences — savagely attacked Brizendine and the book , calling it “ garbage ” and “ scary . ”
Displaying feminists ’ typical open - mindedness to scientific facts , one reviewer claimed that “ I found my self slamming the book down and walking out of the room in an aggressive and angry mood . ”
With this level of censorship , it ’s no wonder that scientists are expected to hide research that suggests men and women are innately different .
We can rest assured that a book like The Female Brain will never be assigned reading in a college classroom .
Meanwhile , sociology and women ’s studies textbooks are filled with laughably false assertions about gender .
Legitimate scholarship is being sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
Of course , not all feminists reject scientific explanations for gender differences — but they ’re often out - screamed by the ones who do , allowing the denial to reach absurd new heights .
In their book Professing Feminism , women ’s studies professors Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge described a confrontation with a fellow feminist .
The feminist was angry over suggestions that women should breast - feed babies , because — in her words — “ research shows that men can lactate , too . ”
Given their current level of anti-science hysteria , I ’m looking forward to the day when some feminists start angrily denouncing the idea that women have ovaries and men do n’t .

The material can rapidly switch from being rigid to flexible and vice versa .
Writing in the journal Science , US researchers describe how species of the sea creatures " tense " when threatened .
The new material mimics this ability , and could be used to make advanced brain electrodes which are stiff when implanted , yet supple inside the body .
Adding water changes the state of the material .
" The water acts as a chemical switch , " Dr Christoph Weder , one of the team who developed the material , told the BBC News website .
This is important as the brain is around 75 % water .
Chemical change
The material consists of naturally occurring nanofibres , or " whiskers " , carefully embedded in a polymer .
The cellulose fibres , each just 25 nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) in diameter , are harvested from a different sessile sea creature known as a tunicate or sea squirt .
The nanofibres are taken from filter - feeding tunicates
" There are many sources of nanofibres such as cotton or wood [ which could be substituted ] , " said Dr Weder .
The structure of the as yet un -named material mimics the skin of sea cucumbers which have collagen nanofibres embedded in a soft connective tissue .
" These creatures can reversibly and quickly change the stiffness of their skin , " explained Dr Jeffrey Capadona , another member of the team .
" Normally it is very soft ; but for example in response to a threat , the animal can activate its ' body armour ' by hardening its dermis . "
Changes to the stiffness of the sea cucumber 's skin are thought to be triggered by chemicals secreted by the animal 's nervous system that rearrange the collagen threads .
" Our architecture is the same , but the chemistry is different , " explained Dr Weder .
In the absence of water , the nanofibres are held together by chemical links known as hydrogen bonds .
This gives the material its rigidity .
There is a mechanical mismatch - the electrode is rigid but the brain is more like jello
Christoph Weder
When exposed to water , the water molecules " competitively bond " with the fibres .
" The water also likes to stick to the cellulose , " said Dr Weder .
This has an effect of " ungluing " the fibre - to - fibre bonds , and the material becomes about 1,000 times softer , with the consistency of rubber .
When the water evaporates , a network of cross - linked whiskers reforms , stiffening the material .
Brain aid
This ability to morph could help build therapeutic devices to be implanted into the brains of patients who suffer from Parkinson 's disease , stroke or spinal cord injuries .
At present , there are a number of research teams hoping to develop " artificial nervous systems " that aim to treat these disorders .
These systems need to " plug " into nerve cells within the brain - known as cortical neurons - to record electrical activity .
But animal studies have shown that the quality of the brain signals recorded by implanted electrodes often degrades after a few months .
One hypothesis is that stiff electrodes damage the surrounding brain tissue .
" There is a mechanical mismatch - the electrode is rigid but the brain is more like jello , " said Dr Weder .
The team believes that an implant built on a substrate of the new material could overcome this problem , by being rigid during implantation , and softening once in the body .
Dr Weder also has his eye on other applications for the material .
Potentially , electricity rather than water could be used to switch its state .
" Smart bullet proof vests , prosthetics - the list goes on and on , " he said .
What can you really say about this ?
It 's simply the most delicious looking 8 - bit console we 've ever laid eyes on .

Victoria Cave
Discovered by Michael Horner in 1837 and excavated by Joseph Jackson and the British Association .
Victoria Cave was originally known as the Fox Holes .
During excavations 9 m of deposits were removed , changing the entrance from the original narrow crawl to 10 m high by 30 m wide .
The original entrance was to the top left of the current entrance .
A smaller entrance is to the north .
Several passages lead off from the main chamber , which was originally two caves , Chamber A to the left and Chamber D to the right .
At the far end of the right wall a 2 m climb up leads to a crawl , which eventually becomes too tight .
From the main chamber , the first passage left passes the second smaller entrance and drops down to join the other two passages left in Chamber B .
Two passages from here , one a crawl and the other accessed by a 1 m climb , lead into a low chamber with a pool , Chamber C .
Birkbeck Gallery is a narrow passage at the back of the main chamber , which passes over several holes and lowers to a crawl before reaching a 10 m pitch .
Remains of animals found include the bones of mammoth , brown bear , reindeer , hippopotamus , straight - tusked elephant , spotted hyena , lion , narrow - nosed rhinoceros and giant deer .
Other finds include Bronze Age pottery , Romano - British jewelry , tools and over 100 coins dating from 83 BC to 346 AD .
A sign outside the cave indicates the roof is unsafe .
Madonna 'a 26th album , Hard Candy , is out on 28 April
Madonna has admitted to sleeping with her Blackberry in case she remembers something during the night .
Speaking to monthly magazine Elle , the 49 - year - old revealed her husband , Guy Ritchie , also tucks his handheld computer under the pillow at night .
" It 's not unromantic , it 's practical .
I 'm sure loads of couples have their Blackberrys in bed with them . "
The singer , who is about to release her next album Hard Candy , denied reports about her marriage being on the rocks .
" I had to marry someone as tough as me .
Guy 's definitely tough .
I had to marry a challenge , otherwise I would just get bored , " she said .
" Whatever else Guy is , he 's never boring . "
The couple married in December 2000 and have one child together , called Rocco .
They have since adopted a baby boy from Malawi .
Madonna already had a daughter , Lourdes , by a previous relationship ,
The pop star also rubbished claims she was about to move back to the US , she added : " I think of Britain as my home .
And I love the weather .
All that rain and moisture is so good for the skin . "

When the cost of bandwidth is virtually next to nothing these days , couples who find themselves apart are using Skype to recreate that “ at home ” feeling .
It even has a name – Ambient Skype .
Basically you leave the app constantly running on your computer as background noise .
Since Skype - to - Skype calls are free , it does n’t cost you a dime ( except maybe electricity to keep the computer up ) .
You do n’t have to talk to your partner all the time ( who talks to one another non -stop 24/ 7 anyway ? ) .
Skype just stays running and if the webcam is on , you can drop off to sleep together , listening to one another breathing , snoring , talking in their sleep , farting … just like a real “ together ” couple !
As I said , this would be good if couples found themselves apart due to business trips but it would also be good for long distance relationships or families who are scattered across the globe for one reason or another .
As well as dropping off to sleep together , you can also leave Skype on to listen to your kids screaming their heads off in the background or generally listen to comforting sounds of home .
Anything to avoid those pangs of homesickness .

Last week the Daily Telegraph of London ran a photo of food protests in Haiti to accompany a story on how the West ’s production of bio-fuels had contributed to the world hunger crisis .
Facing down the protestors in the photo was a solider in a blue helmet , identified in the caption as a U.N. peacekeeper .
Observant readers might have wondered what a U.N. soldier was doing in Haiti in the first place .
In fact , the soldiers ’ presence there preceded the current world food crisis .
Detachments of U.N. troops have been in Haiti since 2004 , when the country went into what the New York Times described as “ international receivership ” after its president , facing a revolt , was forced to flee .
Today , according to the Heritage Foundation ’s Index of Economic Freedom , Haiti is one of the world ’s most volatile , least free , and poorest countries , “ plagued by corruption , gang violence , drug trafficking , and organized crime . ”
It lacks property rights and its explosive political situation discourages foreign investment , while payoffs to customs officials raise the cost of imported goods .
Haitians are tragically starving , in other words , not because of the West ’s misguided bio-fuels policies .
To read media coverage and commentary of the world ’s growing hunger crisis , one would assume that the problem is largely the doing of Western democracies .
We ’ve been reminded any number of times , by commentators on the left and the right , that misguided efforts to convert grains into fuel have robbed the world market of precious foods .
Meanwhile , that noted climatologist , Paul Krugman , has blamed the crisis in part on the West ’s failure to address global warming , which he assures us has caused the drought that has curtailed food production in Australia .
Even worse , the meat - eating proclivities of Westerners , critics tell us , have robbed others of food because it takes 700 calories of animal feed to produce 100 calories of beef .
It ’s startling , however , the degree to which this kind of thinking is at odds with the geography of hunger around the world .
If there is one thing which the countries where -- according to the United Nation ’s World Food Programme -- hunger is rampant share in common it is that they resemble Haiti .
They are places where people are often enslaved , where free markets do n’t operate , where property rights are not respected and corruption is widespread , where foreign investment dares not tread , where thugs and revolutionaries often appropriate for themselves aid that is meant for others .
But these are problems which the Western media can hardly speak of when addressing hunger , as if it ’s unseemly to say that people are hungry because their own leaders are failing them — often despite our efforts , not because of them .
Political turmoil and the retreat of freedom have managed to make people hungry even in places where many previously were not .
Heading the U.N. ’s list of countries where people are most undernourished , for instance , is Zimbabwe .
When the country became independent in 1980 it had , according to the Index of Economic Freedom , “ extensive natural resources , a diversified economy , a well developed infrastructure , and an advanced financial sector , ” as well as networks of productive farms .
But the increasingly repressive regime of strongman Robert Mugabe has destroyed property rights , allowed favored government officials to seize control of farm lands , and been hostile to Western investment , in the process transforming the country “ from the breadbasket of Africa into a starving , destitute tyranny , ” according to the Index of Economic Freedom .
In many places , hunger is prevalent even though natural resources are plentiful .
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo , where two - thirds of the country ’s 62 million people are undernourished , citizens lived amid constant chaos after war broke out in the mid-1990s and the country became a battle ground for troops from eight nations in the so - called African World War , in which more than 5 million people died mostly from starvation and disease .
Tragically but perhaps not surprisingly , despite abundant resources including copper , cobalt and diamonds , as well as “ enormous agricultural potential ” according to the United Nations , the DRC is one of the world ’s poorest countries , where production of food has declined some 40 percent since war broke out .
Conflict is at the heart of the struggles and starvation of many of the world ’s poorest people , especially those whom Oxford University economist Paul Collier calls “ the bottom billion . ”
Collier argues in his book of the same name that while much of the developing world marches toward a better future , about one - sixth of the Earth ’s population is being left behind in large part because of political turmoil and bad government .
In all , Collier estimates , more than seven in 10 people in the bottom billion have lived through civil war , while border conflicts are common among countries where this group lives .
Many of the nations that engaged in the widespread conflict that devastated the Democratic Republic of the Congo are themselves places where the population is suffering from extreme hunger , including Angola , Zimbabwe and Rwanda .
Elsewhere in Africa Ethiopia , where nearly half the population of 69 million are starving , has warred with its neighbor to the north , Eretria , where starvation is also widespread , and invaded Somalia , a country which has no had a national government for some 17 years and where hunger is assumed to be extensive , although data are hard to come by because of the country ’s instability .
Faced with such massive governmental breakdowns , Western aid agencies have focused much of their energies on places like China , Brazil and India -- where economic progress is already lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty -- while truly destitute places languish and their standards of living decline .
“ The World Bank has large offices in every major middle - income country , but not a single person resident in the Central African Republic , ” writes Collier , who once headed development research for the World Bank .
“ Every development agency has trouble getting its staff to serve in Chad or Laos . ”
Collier has several recommendations for the West , including tying aid to political and economic reforms , giving the poorest countries preferential treatment to Western markets until their products can compete on a level playing field with those from other developing countries like China , and finally , when all else fails , military intervention to reestablish order and save lives .
Needless to say , that is his most controversial solution , though one that is finding increasing support even from unlikely sources , like New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , who has traveled extensively in Africa and sees little else that may make a difference to people in the direst circumstances .
He argues that had the West intervened in Rwanda in 1994 and averted massacres there , the number of lives saved would have far surpassed anything accomplished by more traditional forms of aid .
Perhaps it ’s because military intervention seems so unlikely — after all , the U.S. is preoccupied in Iraq and most European armies today resemble glorified police forces incapable of operations around the world — that the media prefer to focus on how Western policies have contributed to the growing hunger problem .
But the West ’s shortcomings have had a marginal impact , at best , and as free markets engage around the world , they are likely quickly to offset those failings .
Even now in the United States farmers who have been paid by the government for years not to farm their land are ratcheting up production to meet growing demand .
What wo n’t change , even as the business cycle turns and markets respond , is the plight of the most destitute , who are also almost universally the world ’s most enslaved people .
They need democracy and free markets of their own , and until they get those , the world ’s hunger crisis wo n’t disappear .
This painting was done for my fiance for his birthday / anniversary present , of his grandmother who passed away a few years ago and all 3 of our girls ( 2 of which she never met ) as well as me , unfortunately , I never had the pleasure to meet her .
He loved his granny very much and she was his favorite person and influence in life !
I just wanted to capture a moment we thought was impossible a picture of her and all our girls !
He never cries very very rarely and this definitely made him cry and full of emotions .
It melted my heart to know I gave him something to cherish for the rest of his life !!
Thank you so much for capturing this beautiful moment we thought impossible

The lesson seemed clear : create an authentic blog or do n’t create a blog at all .
Wal - Mart employees began developing Check Out ( subtitled “ Where the Lanes Are All Open ” ) a year ago and recruited a handful of buyer - bloggers last fall , giving them rudimentary training on how to post their writing , upload videos and create hyperlinks .
The focus of the Web site , the novice bloggers decided , would be electronics , given the reliable appetite for gadget reviews and news on the Web , with a sprinkling of posts on the environment , toys and furniture .
After heeding the lessons of Wal - Mart ’s earlier blogs and consulting with several well - known bloggers from sites like the Huffington Post , the buyers decided the site would succeed only if they wrote in their own voice , free from censorship and corporate review .
“ Readers can tell if people are being genuine or monitored , ” said Alex Cook , the merchandise manager for Wal - Mart ’s entertainment division , who blogs about computers and electronics ( and who wrote the lukewarm review of Windows Vista ) .
Anil Dash , a blogger at Six Apart , which makes blogging software , said the evolution in Wal - Mart ’s thinking about blogs was typical .
“ You start with this total lockdown , suits read everything , one post a month model , ” he said .
“ Then you evolve .
A year later , you get one that is more open .
A year after that , they start to do something that is far more authentic . ”
Mr. Dash said Wal - Mart ’s decision to let buyers do the blogging reflected a growing recognition that “ trying to control who can speak and what they can say does not work . ”
Mr. Agarwal said the company had no problems with any of the posts so far .
“ If you are a vendor and you talk to your Wal - Mart buyer all the time , you are going to know their likes and dislikes anyway , ” he said .
( Money Magazine ) --
You 've tried staring your computer down , but it 's not blinking .
No matter how many times you go over the figures , you get the same answer .
That number on your screen - what you 're paying the IRS this year - is more than your dad earned in his five best years .
You can't help thinking , Why am I such a chump when other people must be getting off scot - free ?
Brace yourself .
Last year 49.2 million U.S. households filed returns that obligated them to pay absolutely no federal income taxes - and they did n't necessarily do anything illegal .
Before you start gnashing your teeth at the injustice , however , you should know that there are many reasons to be happy that you 're not one of the tax escapees .
For starters , avoiding U.S. income taxes is n't easy .
Citizens can't wriggle out of their bills by moving to another country because , almost alone among nations , the U.S. taxes all income , no matter where on earth it 's earned .
And although the tax code offers plenty of deductions and exemptions , if you take too many you 'll be skewered by the alternative minimum tax ( AMT ) .
Almost all the tax shelters of yesteryear disappeared when Congress closed loopholes in 1986 .
Even running your own business is not the shelter it was when you could deduct yourself down to zero by saddling your company with bills for luxurious travel , cars and meals out .
" Those days are over , " says Charles Hayes , a C.P.A. and financial planner in Coronado , Calif .
" Expenses have to be necessary and reasonable . "
If they are n't , the IRS will likely disallow them .
So how do the 49.2 million do it ?
That 's what Money Magazine set out to learn .
What we found offers a glimpse into the workings of the immensely complicated U.S. tax system , as well as valuable lessons in the dos and don'ts of cutting your own taxes .
Among them :
Do whatever you can to shave income from your 1040 but , perhaps most important , do n't cut off your tax nose to spite your financial face .
You can find plenty of ways to collect tax - free income , but you 'd likely find unacceptable the trade - offs it takes to get all the way to zero .
How we got here
From its beginnings in 1913 , the income tax system was designed to be progressive ; the more you make , the more you pay .
The top bracket then was 7 % , and it applied only to those who earned above $ 500,000 a year , which is about $ 10.6 million in today 's dollars .
Congress also recognized that some were too poor to pay taxes , so it exempted the first $ 3,000 in income .
In 1913 that exclusion liberated all but 1 % of the population from taxes .
Those principles still hold today .
" Our tax system still is progressive , " says Len Burman , director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington , D.C.
In 2005 the 10 % of taxpayers with the highest incomes provided 70 % of income - tax revenue , which cost them on average 25 % of their income , more than any other group , according to the IRS .
That 's not to say that many wealthy people do n't shelter immense chunks of money , but getting to zero is difficult even for them .
Fewer than 2 % of earners in the top 20 % ( average income : $ 99,500 ) escape taxes altogether .
That comes to about 400,000 filers .
( Plus , even those who sidestep federal income taxes may have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes , state and local levies , property taxes and sales tax . )
Forget about story , or character development .
When it comes to selecting your science fiction reading material , you want a story that spans millions of years , if not billions .
Or why not trillions , while you 're at it ?
A truly grand space saga needs a lot of elbow room across history to unveil its cosmic events .

And then in the year 3000 , humans start merging with each other , and with cybernetic consciousnesses , into a kind of Borg - esque collective , which treats individual humans as cells in a body .
And then finally in the year one hundred billion , one member of the Bulero family is " re-individualized " from the Macrolife collective to help figure out how to survive the end of the universe .
He discovers some Macrolife survivors from previous universes .
Time span : one hundred billion years .

Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon .
Perhaps realizing that he was never going to win this contest with a paltry two billion years , Stapledon went back to the drawing board and came up with this 1937 story about a disembodied consciousness who leaves Earth and roams time and space .
The story includes the thoughts of sentient clouds in the early universe , and roams all the way up to the heat - death of the cosmos .
At one point , the main character meets the " Star Maker , " the dispassionate creator of the universe .
Time span : billions and billions of years .
OK , I 'm sure I missed some vital and awesome time - spanning storylines .
What did I miss ?
Dr. Michael Egnor , a neurosurgeon who has decided to take on a second career as an intelligent design proponent , has been embarrassing himself over at the Discovery Institute propaganda blog .
He has dropped some real gems , like the claim that if evolution were true then brain cancer should evolve a better brain .
Recently he has been taking me on over the question of the materialist vs dualist concept of the mind .
On Friday he posted his latest reply , nicely illustrating that he can apply the same logical fallacies favored by the intelligent design proponents to the question of dualism .
In response to this statement that I wrote in my previous blog entry on this topic :
The materialist hypothesis — that the brain causes consciousness — has made a number of predictions , and every single prediction has been validated .
Dr. Egnor replies :
A bit of advice : whenever a scientist says of his own theory that “ every single prediction has been validated ’ , you ’re being had .
No scientific theory has had ‘ every single prediction ’ validated .
All theories accord with evidence in some ways , and are inconsistent in others .
Successful scientific theories prevail on the preponderance of the evidence , not validation of “ every single prediction ” .
Real science lacks the precision of ideology .
This is one of those statements that seems reasonable on the surface , but with a bit of thought , and a modicum of scientific knowledge , we can see that it is just deceptive rhetoric .
Science progresses chiefly by formulating hypotheses to explain observed phenomena , and then testing those hypotheses with observation and experimentation .
It is true that often the data does not point entirely in one direction – depending upon the type of data that is being collected and the complexity of the question .
But this actually misses the point I was making , which is this : in order for a theory to survive it must be validated by every observation or experiment that has the potential to falsify it .
It is a trivial application of logic to say that in order for a theory to be considered true it cannot have been falsified or found to be untrue .
Theories that are falsified are either modified or discarded .
A “ preponderance of evidence ” cannot rescue a theory that has been disproven even by a single piece of incompatible evidence .
It is also historically true that many scientific theories have been validated “ by every single ” piece of evidence that bears upon the basic question of whether or not the theory is true .
Let ’s take special relativity , for example .
Einstein proposed this theory in 1905 , and his claim that space and time are relative makes a number of specific predictions .
In the last century every single prediction made by special relativity has been validated .
There is not one observation that falsifies special relativity .
( That would be big news if there were . )
I guess Egnor thinks that all physicists are not “ real ” scientists and are just conning the public .
The same is true of evolutionary theory .
The evolution deniers ( creationists / intelligent design proponents ) often point to those details that evolutionary scientists have not yet fleshed out in order to claim that the evidence for evolution is lacking .
In addition to this being an argument from ignorance , they also are missing the point .
We need to separate the lines of evidence for the question of did life on earth evolve from the questions of how it evolved or what particular evolutionary paths life took .
If we focus just on the question of did life evolve we see that this theory makes a number of predictions .
So far , every prediction that flows from the evolutionary hypothesis has been validated .
There is no evidence that falsifies evolution , or is incompatible with evolution .
Here are some examples .
The fossil record exists in an evolutionary pattern .
There is not a single fossil that falsifies evolution – no horses in the Cambrian strata .
Genetic evidence is also found to exist in an exquisitely evolutionary pattern – one of branching relationships among groups that closely follows the pattern we would infer from morphology .
Intelligent design proponents argue , falsely , that if evolution were true than evolutionary scientists should be able to explain exactly how every structure , biochemical pathway , and organism evolved .
They then conclude that the inability of scientists to explain exactly how everything evolved falsifies evolution .
What they are doing is just taking the “ god of the gaps ” logical fallacy and trying to reformulate it to make it sound like a scientific prediction .
This exposes several problems for the ID proponents and the logical fallacies they employ to cover them over .
First , as I said , they cannot point to any positive prediction made by evolution that was falsified .
So they invent one by claiming that evolutionary theory is falsified if it cannot currently explain every tiny detail of how evolution occurred .
They can then link this fallacy to the moving goalpost logical fallacy – as evolutionary scientists make new discoveries , just keep moving the goalpost back and proclaiming that evolution is falsified .
The second problem is that ID does not make any positive predictions for itself .
It therefore can not be specifically falsified and that is why it is not a scientific theory .
But ID proponents are adept at fixing these nagging logical problems by simply lying .
So they pretend that ID can be falsified – all you have to do is prove every last detail of evolution .
Saying that proving evolution falsifies ID does not make ID a scientific theory – it is simply committing the false dichotomy logical fallacy .
This is the claim that either evolution is true or ID is true ( the false dichotomy ) and therefore until you prove evolution 100 % ID wins by default .
This also relates to the third major problem with the ID line of argument – it is dependent upon what has not been discovered .
There is no evidence against evolution , so ID proponents point to evidence that does not yet exist and treat it as if it is positive evidence against evolution .
On top of that they get the context of the evidence wrong – they point to the lack of evidence for how evolution occurred , not if it occurred .
As we will see , Dr. Egnor applies the exact same intellectual strategy to the question of strict materialism vs dualism .
He writes :
“ We have a vast knowledge of neuroscience .
Yet what is the scientific evidence supporting this most fundamental prediction of materialism — that every thought is reducible at the molecular level to a discrete and unique brain state ?
There is n’t a shred of evidence that any discrete mental state — any specific thought — can be reduced at the molecular level to a unique material brain state .
Not a shred . ”
Egnor ’s strategy here is to claim that neuroscientists have not yet proven that every specific thought reduces to a specific molecular brain state , and that materialism predicts that we should .
This is as absurd as arguing the evolution predicts we should be able to explain every single biochemical pathway , and that until we do evolution has problems .
Egnor ’s statement is actually false , but even if it were n’t it makes no logical sense , and does not address my claim that all predictions made by materialism has been validated .
The materialist theory of mind does not predict that we will have the technology to examine brain function at the most reducible molecular level .
What it predicts is that once we do what we find will be compatible with materialism .
Egnor can present no evidence that thought does not reduce to specific material states of the brain .
Any current lack of evidence is not a reflection of problems with the materialist theory but just limitations of our current technology .
But Egnor ’s claim that there is “ not a shred ” of evidence that mental states correlate with specific material states in the brain is demonstrably false .
We can now look at the brain with functional MRI scanning – we can create an image of which neural networks within the brain become active with a specific thought or mental task .
When we do this we find that there are specific material brain states that correlate with specific thoughts .
To use Egnor ’s example , if subjects were made to think “ the White House is in Washington , D.C. ” that would produce a different pattern of activity than thinking , for example , “ ID proponents are a bunch of baboons . ”
To give one example , two years ago Adrian Owen published an article in Science in which he used fMRI to examine the brain function of a young woman in an apparent vegetative state .
During the study she was asked to either imagine herself playing tennis or to imagine herself walking through her house .
These two distinct thoughts created distinct patterns of activation on the fMRI – indicating that she was actually capable of thought .
But the relevance to this discussion is that different thoughts correlate to different functional states of the material brain .
In fact this is was all fMRI research shows .
Therefore , within our current technology , to the limits of resolution that we can now image brain function , the materialist theory is validated – specific thoughts do correlate with specific patterns of brain activity .
Egnor is quite simply wrong .
But you can see the “ moving goalpost ” strategy he is implying as well .
He is acknowledging , to some degree , that current evidence supports materialism .
He writes :
“ Both dualists and materialists recognize that matter influences the mind .
Wine affects dualists just as it does materialists .
The difference in viewpoint is this : dualists propose that the mind is in part caused by matter , and in part caused by something else .
Mental causation is dual .
Materialists believe that the mind is entirely caused by matter .
There is nothing else . ”
What evidence does Egnor present that dualism is necessary ?
None .
What evidence does he present of an observation , phenomenon , or experiment that cannot be explained by materialism , and therefore requires that there be “ something else ? ” None .
Materialism explains all currently available evidence .
Egnor simply pulls the ID strategy of pointing beyond current technology and evidence to say that materialism has not produced this evidence .
He then moves the goalpost beyond current evidence , and will keep doing so forever , because our scientific knowledge will never be complete .
Let ’s get back to my core claim – that all predictions made by mental materialism that can be falsified scientifically , and for which we have evidence , have been validated .
There are no predictions that have been falsified .
If Egnor disagrees with this he needs to give a counter example .
He ca n’t do it , which is why he made up his intelligent design of the brain deception .
I listed the specific predictions in my previous post on this topic .
Egnor was not able to counter any of the examples I gave .
Here they are again :
If the mind is completely a product of the material function of the brain then :
– There will be no mental phenomena without brain function .
– As brain function is altered , the mind will be altered .
– If the brain is damaged , then mental function will be damaged .
– Brain development will correlate with mental development .
– We will be able to correlate brain activity with mental activity – no matter how we choose to look at it .
All of these predictions have been resolved in favor of materialism .
“ Every single one ! ” Dualism makes predictions too – that some mental function will be documented to exist separate from brain function .
The evidence for this ?
None .
Egnor claims that dualism predicts that neuroscience will fail to find specific molecular states for thoughts , and then declares victory on this score .
This is not a positive prediction , however , just a negative prediction .
This is exactly like saying that ID predicts evolutionary theory will fail to explain every last biochemical pathway .
A negative prediction for some other theory is not the same as a positive prediction for your pet theory ( again , the false dichotomy logical fallacy ) .
Egnor ’s intelligent design gambit for dualism fails .
Materialism is not falsified because he have not yet developed the technology to image brain function at the molecular level .
The ways in which we can currently image brain function , fMRI , shows that specific thoughts do correlate with discrete material brain states .
So Egnor is also ignorant of the current facts of neuroscience ( and he ’s a neurosurgeon ) .
Not content with the degree of nonsense Egnor has so far spewed forth , he decided to add a few bonus absurdities .
He wrote :
“ The materialistic hypothesis creates even more problems .
Imagine that Dr. Novella and I are both simultaneously thinking “ the White House is in Washington , D.C. ” .
Do we both simultaneously have exactly the same brain state , defined in terms as acetylcholine , dendrites , etc. ? ”
This is a complete non-sequitur .
The materialist model of neuroscience does not predict that the same thought will correlate with the exact same molecular state in different people .
This is such utter nonsense it is almost surprising – except that Egnor has already demonstrated his capacity for such nonsense .
Different brains certainly have much in common – the same basic anatomical structure and biochemical function .
But there is good reason to believe that there are also significant differences in detail .
The name “ Washington ” is probably not coded in my brain ’s language center exactly the same as anyone else ’s brain .
Plus we know that human memory is contextual and works largely through pattern recognition .
The word “ Washington ” conjures up in my brain a different set of memories , images , ideas , and thoughts than any other person .
Although human brains generally follow the same rules , the specific manifestation for any individual is likely to vary considerably .
Egnor next brings up the notion that consciousness is an “ emergent property of the brain . ”
However , in this context this is a straw man .
Emergent property does not need to be invoked to explain the fact that we do not yet have a specific molecular model for specific thoughts .
This is purely a technological limitation , not a conceptual failing of materialism .
To be clear ( in case he tries to bring this up ) I have invoked the “ emergent property ” argument before , but that was to explain how the subjective experience of consciousness emerges from brain function – not as an excuse for the alleged absence of discrete molecular states .
The sloppy thinking on the part of Dr. Egnor is profound , but it can be understood as an application of intelligent design sloppy thinking to the question of materialism and dualism .
What Egnor has not done is counter my claim that all predictions made by the materialist hypothesis have been validated .
If he wishes to persist in his claims , then I openly challenge Egnor to name one prediction of strict materialism that has been falsified .
To be clear , that means one positive prediction for materialism where the evidence falsifies strict materialism .
This does not mean evidence we do not currently have , but evidence against materialism or for dualism .
I maintain that such evidence does not exist – not one bit .
Prove me wrong , Egnor .
Many intelligence scholars and analysts outside the government say that today ’s expiration of certain temporary domestic wiretapping laws will have little effect on national security , despite warnings to the contrary by the White House and Capitol Hill Republican leaders .
With the Protect America
Act expiring this weekend , domestic wiretapping rules will revert to the 30 - year - old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , which requires the government to obtain a warrant from a special court to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance in the United States .
The original FISA law , these experts say , provides the necessary tools for the intelligence community to eavesdrop on suspected terrorists .
Timothy Lee , an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute , said the last time Congress overhauled FISA — after the September 11 terrorist attacks — President Bush praised the action , saying the new law “ recognizes the realities and dangers posed by the modern terrorist . ”
“ Those are the rules we ’ll be living under after the Protect America Act expires this weekend , ” Mr. Lee added .
“ There ’s no reason to think our nation will be in any more danger in 2008 than it was in 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , or 2006 . ”
Ben Wittes of the Brookings Institution said because existing warrantless surveillance begun under the temporary laws could continue for up to a year , the “ sky is not falling at all . ”
Not everyone agrees .
The issue has been one of the most fiercely contested in Washington in several months , with Democratic leaders and the Bush administration accusing one another of playing political games with national security .
White House press secretary Dana Perino said the expiration of the Protect America Act “ will harm our ability to conduct surveillance to detect new threats to our security , including the locations , intentions and capabilities of terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets abroad . ”
But House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer , Maryland Democrat , called the White House ’s warning “ categorically false . ”
“ In fact , a wide range of national security experts has made clear that the president and our intelligence community have all the tools they need to protect our nation , if the Protect America Act — temporary legislation passed last August — expires . ”
The Protect America
Act allowed the U.S. intelligence community to conduct surveillance on domestic phone and e-mail correspondence in the U.S. without a warrant .
Congress passed the law in August after it failed to reach a compromise on a permanent measure .
It was set to expire Feb. 1 , but Congress last month agreed to another 15 - day extension .
The Bush administration and Capitol Hill Republicans have pushed for permanently expanding the Act , arguing that changes in telecommunications technology have forced the government to obtain warrants for some spying abroad , because foreign phone calls and other electronic communications now often travel through U.S. networks .
Requiring intelligence officials to seek court approvals for foreign communications routed through the United States would cost precious time and create a “ dangerous intelligence gap that we temporarily closed with passage of the [ Protect America Act ] last August , ” Mrs. Perino said .
But Democrats deny requiring warrants will handcuff intelligence officials , saying warrants can be obtained from the FISA court within minutes .
Officials also have three days to retroactively obtain a warrant .
“ We believe the president ’s rhetoric is inaccurate and divisive , and an attempt to stampede the House of Representatives to rubber - stamp legislation by stoking the fears of the American people , ” Mr. Hoyer said .
“ We will not be stampeded . ”
Mr. Wittes also said he was “ somewhat bewildered by the apocalyptic rhetoric ” of the White House .
Another big dispute in updating the FISA is a Republican demand to give telecommunications companies legal immunity for their participation in a domestic spying program the president began shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks .
The secret program circumvented the FISA court .
About 40 lawsuits have been filed accusing AT&T ; , Verizon and Sprint Nextel Corp. of violating privacy rights while participating in the program .
Republicans and Mr. Bush , who supports a Senate bill passed Tuesday that includes the immunity provision , say phone companies should not be penalized for helping defend the nation against terrorism .
Civil liberties activists and many Democrats say Mr. Bush ’s program was unconstitutional because warrants were n’t required .
But the House on Wednesday rejected a Democratic proposal for a 21 - day extension .
Republicans say any further extensions will cause telecommunications companies to hesitate in cooperating with intelligence officials , thus compromising national security .
“ Without their voluntary cooperation , this important intelligence gathering wo n’t occur .
And it cannot occur if they get hauled into court and have to answer these lawsuits that preclude them from helping the United States government in this operation , ” said Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl , Arizona Republican .
The issue wo n’t be resolved until at least Feb. 25 , when Congress is scheduled to return from its February recess .

The gas company BOC said the hydrogen - powered Ech2o car needed the input of 25W for a 25,000 - mile global trip .
This is the energy equivalent of less than two gallons of petrol .
Emissions would consist of water .
But with a top speed of 30 mph , the journey would take more than a month , even if the car was driven flat out .
On Thursday , the Ech2o will make a shorter journey to try to break the world fuel efficiency record .
Jack Dex , 13 , of Southam College , Warwickshire , will drive the prototype at the Shell Eco Marathon at Rockingham Raceway , near Corby , Northamptonshire .
Small and light , he is also an experienced go - kart driver .
Most Eco Marathon vehicles run on petrol or diesel , but the record , 5,385 km/ l ( just over 15,000 mpg ) is held by a hydrogen - fuelled Swiss car .
BOC designed the hydrogen storage system for the Ech2o , OSCar Automotive designed the body , chassis and steering system , and the electric power train was developed by Oxford University .
The car is made of carbon fibre and aluminium .
The concept of hydrogen fuel cells was invented in 1839 by Sir William Grove .
BOC 's director of sustainable energy , John Carolin , said : " The lessons from this and other projects will show that hydrogen fuel cell - powered vehicles could be a practical , attractive and a viable economic alternative to diesel- or petrol - fuelled vehicles . "
[ digg - reddit - me ] Reuters is reporting that in an absolutely outrageous and despicable move , Israel ’s internal security service has refused to provide assistance to the Secret Service guarding President Jimmy Carter in Israel after he met with the leaders of Hamas .
I did n’t think that Mr. Carter should have been meeting with Hamas on principle as they have never renounced terrorism .
I can see why Mr. Carter believes someone must talk with them , but I think Mr. Carter ’s meeting would only serve – at this time – to give the group international legitimacy .
Of course , I would not refer to Israel ’s difficult situation as “ apartheid ” either .
Mr. Carter has his own opinions , and although I trust his intentions , I think his actions and words in regards to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict are ill - advised .
But despite these actions , it is difficult to believe this story is true – that a close ally would refuse to assist a former American president ’s security detail .
According to the Reuters piece :
Another source described the snub as an “ unprecedented ” breach between the Israeli Shin Bet and the U.S. Secret Service , which protects all current and former U.S. presidents , as well as Israeli leaders when they visit the United States .
Carter included the southern Israeli town of Sderot on his itinerary .
The area is often hit by rockets from the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip and one of the sources described the lack of Shin Bet assistance there as particularly “ problematic ” .
Although the Bush administration opposed Mr. Carter ’s meeting with Hamas , the president must take action regarding this refusal to assist in providing security to a former president .
The Israeli government ’s behavior is unacceptable for an ally – let alone one of our closest allies .
This is an issue on which all Americans should unite .
Israel has every right to criticize President Carter and to denounce him ; but as an ally of the United States , they should not be messing with his security .
That is far – very far – over the line .
I think this is an issue on which all of us – from Bill O’Reilly to Michael Moore – can agree .
In the spirit of the web and political engagement , how can we make our position known , take some action to affect the situation ?
Updated : Some reactions around the blogosphere :
Ed Morissey over at Hot Air is sympathetic to the Israelis but critical :
It gives the State Department a little more leverage about Carter ’s trip .
They could use the danger into which Carter would lead the Secret Service as a means to ask the Department of Homeland Security to refuse to allow them to accompany Carter .
Carter could choose to go without the Secret Service , but without Israeli security , it would present a huge risk — and if he did go and got killed , it would be an explosive issue for the Bush administration .
Quite frankly , although I understand the Israeli ’s action , I think it sets a bad precedent .
Cooperation in security should not be predicated on agreement of political policies .
Jimmy Carter may be the worst ex-president in American history , but he is still our ex-president , and the Secret Service detail that accompanies him deserves Israeli cooperation .
The snub from the political class is well - deserved , but the Israelis should consider how Americans will view them if their refusal to cooperate on security leads to American deaths on this trip .
Over at LiveJournal some random guy who has one of the top Sphere links suggests that the United States arrest Mr. Carter for meeting with foreign governments against the interests of the United States pursuant to the Logan Act .
Regarding security , he says :
Let Hamas help protect their friend .
Charming .

I ’ve spent quite a bit of time researching how to filter drinking water effectively .
Originally , I was interested in filtering the rainwater that falls on my roof .
But I had to put that project on the back burner for now .
During my research I noticed that there is little unbiased information available on water filters and filtration techniques .
Update : I discovered a good book on the subject of drinking water filtration : The Drinking Water Book .
The author , Colin Ingram , includes a comprehensive collection of water filter reviews .
He rates filter from “ Acceptable ” to “ Excellent ” .
See our review The Best Water Filters Of 2009 for more information .
I like clean tasting water , and pure water is quite important to one ’s health .
Filtering your own water at home is really the most effective way of ensuring good water quality .
As you may know , bottled water is extremely inefficient , and tends to be of lower quality than municipal tap water .
However , tap water often picks up contaminants on its way through the pipes to your house .
But with proper filtering , it can be made quite pure .
There are six types of contaminants you want to remove from municipal tap water :
Chlorine and chloramines Volatile Organic Compounds ( pesticides , herbicides , etc. )
Heavy metals ( Lead , Mercury , Aluminum , Cadmium , Chromium , Copper ) Bacterial and viruses ( Giardia and Cryptosporidium ) General Sediment Fluoride
In terms of personal health , chlorine and VOCs are the most toxic contaminants commonly present in municipally treated drinking water .
You can remove most of these contaminants using water filters ( except for fluoride and MTBE , but more on that later ) .
There ’s really no need for elaborate filtration systems like reverse - osmosis or distillation .
These systems are expensive , and they are not needed when filtering tap water , plus they also remove useful minerals from the water and give it a “ flat ” taste due to the lack of minerals and oxygen .
Moreover , the distillation process does not remove VOCs in the water .
There are a lot of water filters out there , and most will do their job reasonable well , but only if they are replaced every six months , and this can be quite costly ( I ’ll let you know about less expensive filters below ) .
The editors at ConsumerSearch .
Com compiled water filter reviews from various magazines , and the consensus seems to be that Pur brand are the best faucet - mount filters and pitcher filters , and Whirlpool has the best whole - house filters .
NSF International certifies water filters — this certification ensures that the filters do their job , and do not re-contaminate the water with bacteria .
Most filter manufactures will advertise that their filters are NSF certified .
However , many commonly available filters will let quite a few contaminants through .
For example , granular filters do not utilize the chemical adsorption process , allowing several contaminants to pass through .
Likewise , rapid water filters do not give the water adequate contact time with the filter media , limiting the number of contaminants that may be removed .
For example , in - fridge or faucet - mount filters may not filter VOCs and chlorination by - products like Trihalomethanes ( THMs ) .
Generally , slow filtration tends to be best .
Drip filters will remove a wider range chemicals , pesticides and MTBE ( a gasoline additive ) .
In my home , I use a British Berkefeld drip filter , which is made by Doulton ( pictured above ) .
I like drip filters because they provide great quality filtration , and they are inexpensive to use , because they only need to be replace every six months .
You can clean them with a stiff brush if they become dirty with sediment .
To use a drip filter , you pour tap water in the top , and the water slowly drips through the filter to the bottom compartment .
The process takes a couple of hours .
My Berkefeld drip filter contains two SuperSterasyl self - sterilizing ceramic elements .
The elements are made with diatomaceous earth ( a silica - like sediment originating from kiesel algae ) , silver and activated carbon .
It ’s important to have self - sterilizing elements because they can easily become contaminated with bacterial , especially while cleaning them .
The sterilization is achieved by impregnating the filter with silver .
Another good ceramic drip filter is made by Stefani ( pictured above ) .
I like their French Provence inspired design .
The filters are manufactured in Brazil , and the units are hand made by local clay potters .
The clay cools the water , due to an evaporative cooling effect .
These filter remove 95 % of chlorine , pesticides , iron , aluminium and lead ; and 99 % of cryptosporidium , guardia and sediment .
The filters lasts six months or 300 gallons .
Stefani filters are available at Amazon .
Let ’s address some the contaminants that can only be removed using specialties filters : fluoride , arsenic , and MTBE .
These special filters are typically added in series to a standard water filter .
Fluoride is commonly added to municipal water in the U.S.
The reason given is that it supposedly improves the health of children ’s teeth .
However , many people ( including me ) would rather not have fluoride in their drinking water , for a variety of health reasons .
The Fluoride Action Network has a lot of relevant information on this topic .
Fluoride is actually quite difficult to remove from water , almost all water filters will not remove it .
It can be removed with an “ activated alumina ” filter .
Doulton and other companies offer activated alumina filters .
MTBE ( a gasoline additive ) has contaminated much of the groundwater in the U.S.
In drinking water , even trace amounts of MTBE can cause taste and odor problems .
The potential long - term health effects of MTBE are not understood at this time , however , initial studies indicate MTBE may cause kidney and liver problems .
You can remove MTBE using a specialty filter , for example this one .
Arsenic is another common contaminant that can only be removed at significant levels using a specialty filter .
For more information about arsenic in drinking water see this page .
Filtration through activated carbon ( which many water filters use ) will reduce the amount of arsenic in drinking water from 40 – 70 % .
Anion exchange filters can reduce it by 90 – 100 %
More information can be found in The Drinking Water Book .
GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee endorsed Colorado's " egg as a person " state ballot measure on Monday , but for whose benefit -- Zygote Americans or his own dwindling political fortunes ?
GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee endorsed Colorado ’s “ egg as a person ” state ballot measure on Monday , but for whose benefit — Zygote Americans or his own dwindling political fortunes ?
Huckabee made the announcement after spending time in Colorado Springs last weekend wooing religious conservative voters between a paid speaking gig at a Leadership Program of the Rockies event and a private chat with his old buddy , Rev. James Dobson , head of Focus on the Family .
While Huckabee ’s endorsement is being ballyhooed in the press as a boon to the ballot measure , the Baptist minister and former Arkansas governor has a long record of attempting to not just ban abortion but also contraception .
Likewise , Arkansas has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the nation and there is a staggering need for contraceptive services in a state where nearly half the women have no access to publicly funded family planning programs , as noted by the Guttmacher Institute .
His support of Colorado ’s proposed Amendment 36 is hardly a revelation to anybody paying attention .
Consequently , the endorsement begs a larger question :
Who exactly is this helping ?
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

The citizen initiative process to get a statewide measure on the ballot is fairly easy , some might say ridiculously so .
Witness proposed Amendment 49 to impeach Sen. Hillary Clinton for spying on Americans with a “ Superman camera ” that can see through bedroom and bathroom ceilings .
That ’s Colorado - style democracy in action .
Or maybe inaction , depending upon your point of view .
In the meantime , Kristi Burton , the 20 - year - old student at a Bible - based correspondence law school , and her organization , Colorado for Equal Rights , are working to get the “ egg as a person ” initiative on the November ballot .
Proponents are about halfway through the six - month time frame to collect the fairly low threshold of 76,047 signatures of valid registered voters .
A couple of brisk weekends patrolling the parking lots of Colorado ’s mega churches could take care of the petitions .
Enter Huckabee .
He won a scant 13 percent of the vote in the Colorado GOP caucuses and was positively clobbered by a 3 - to - 1 margin by ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in El Paso County — the hotbed of the state ’s social conservative movement .
All told the Huckabee bully pulpit consists of fewer than 9,000 voters statewide — or 8.5 percent of the signatures needed to get the measure on the ballot .
With Romney now out of the race and Huckabee trailing badly in the national hunt for delegates , is Team Huck ( gasp ) pandering for the votes of Romney supporters among the religious right who ca n’t abide Sen .
John McCain , the party ’s presumptive nominee ?
Trouble is , it ’s not a leap of faith to assume that the “ values voters ” crowd who want an abortion ban and drastic curtailing of family planning services were already on the Huckabee bandwagon since Romney waffled on the issue so as not to offend his pro-business bloc , who are less driven by social issues .
So , there ’s just not a lot of voters to be won there .
But in the madcap world of campaign publicity , it ’s quite common for the darkest of the dark - horse candidates to take a controversial position in order to generate some badly needed press , which often turns into flush campaign coffers .
And on this score , Huckabee may very well declare “ mission accomplished . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil rose sharply on Thursday after a bomb attack on a major Iraqi crude pipeline slashed exports from the country ’s southern oil port for the first time in years .
U.S. crude settled up $ 1.68 to $ 107.58 a barrel , boosting this week ’s gains to more than 6 percent .
London Brent crude rose $ 1.01 to $ 105.00 .
“ Today ’s action was driven up by the explosion and catching fire of a pipeline in Iraq , ” said Nauman Barakat , oil trader and senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA .
The attack on the pipeline happened amid heavy fighting between Iraqi forces and Shi’ite militants in the area .
A shipping source at Iraq ’s Basra export terminal said the pipeline attack cut flows on the line to around 1.2 million barrels per day , down 300,000 bpd from average levels , in the first disruption to shipments from Iraq ’s south since 2004 .
An Iraqi oil official said shipments from the Basra export terminal , which accounts for the bulk of Iraq ’s crude exports , could be cut by a third .
Iraqi officials said efforts were under way to get shipments back to normal , but opinions varied widely on how long the disruption to the pipeline would last .
“ Independently , the terrorist - related blast in Basra will not take a significant amount of oil off the market .
However , the possibility that this event could be the beginning of another string of attacks on infrastructure has tended to crank up the fear premium in this market , ” said Jim Ritterbusch , oil analyst at Ritterbusch and Associates .
Crude was also pulled up by heating oil , which rose more than 3.5 percent .
Dealers said the late - season gains were supported in part by news an outage at a major South Korean refinery run by S - Oil forced the company to cancel supply contracts in April .
The jump in oil prices Thursday added to a nearly $ 5 surge on Wednesday that came after a government report showed declines in U.S. fuel stocks as the nation ’s refineries slowed to their lowest pace since 2005 .
Gasoline inventories fell by a larger - than - expected 3.3 million barrels last week and distillates dropped 2.2 million barrels , the Energy Information Administration said .
Analysts said the weak U.S. dollar has also prompted investors to buy oil and other commodities as a hedge against inflation .
Dell XPS M1530 vs. Apple MacBook Pro
I was in the market to buy a new laptop earlier this year and I came down to comparing to machines : the Dell XPS M1530 and the Apple MacBook Pro .
I compared both of them to every aspect I could possibly come up with .
Anyways both machines recently have received some upgrades so I thought I should update both comparison lists for those of you who might be looking for a new 15 - inch notebook .
Update 4/20/08 : Dell is now offering a 1440×900 LED and 1920 × 1080 Full HD displays .
I gave Apple a point for the Screen since they offer a non-glossy option which I truly prefer due to glare .
Dell was expected to push out a LED screen over a month ago , however it has n’t happened yet .
The body of the MacBook Pro is cleaner , simpler , and lighter compared to the XPS 1530 .
In terms of Operating Systems , if you want OS X Leopard , chances are you wo n’t be able to get it working on a XPS ; however it should a breeze to install Vista / XP on a MacBook Pro with Boot Camp .
Leopard can use 4GB of RAM ; however you ’ll need 64 - bit editions of Vista or XP to utilize all of it .
Dell offers many more options for HDDs including a 64GB SSD which would be unusual for a 15 - inch laptop .
Dell also lets you turn your XPS into a Blu-ray player with an optional Blu-ray read / write drive which is great for watching high definition movies .
I was irritated to find out that the XPS did n’t have gigabit Ethernet , which is great for transferring large files on a local network , especially when most new laptops have it .
Apple won the keyboard war with its beautiful backlit keyboard with an ambient light sensor .
However the XPS makes up with a Finger Print Sensor , which is great for bypassing typing passwords when people are around , and a better Web Camera .
The XPS comes with a media remote control which tucks away into the express card slot while Apple now charges an additional $ 20 for their Front Row remote .
The XPS M1530 can also be configured with a Sprint or Verizon mobile broadband card which will utilize the laptop ’s antennas for better signal gain .
I choose the 6 - cell battery for the XPS since it was the best one which did n’t stick out .
It offered only 2.5 hours of work time while the MacBook Pro gets about 3 hours .
If you did n’t already notice , there ’s one major factor I left out on the chart : price .
This part is what made me make my final decision which was to go with the Dell M1530 .
Dell offered a pretty good student discount in addition to their constant promotions .
Apple also offers such discounts , but are incomparable to what Dell offers .
With both configured to the highest similar specifications , the MacBook Pro was getting very close to $ 3000 while the Dell XPS was about $ 500 cheaper costing about $ 2500 .
In addition for those of you on a strict budget like I was , there ’s more flexibility to remove unneeded components with the Dell to bring the price down .
Anyways , that ’s my two cents so please feel free to make comments .

Apparently not content to let a mere rumor scare Yahoo , Microsoft came out today with an official declaration of hostility .
Yahoo will have 3 weeks to enter into acquisition talks with Microsoft , or it will take the matter to Yahoo ’s shareholders , Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer states in an open letter to Yahoo ’s board .
The letter ( pasted in full below ) , is basically a direct , strongly - phrased reiteration of various rumors that have been floating around about Microsoft ’s plans .
Microsoft is giving
Yahoo one last chance to come to the table to talk about the deal , or it will begin to engage in a hostile takeover — with a new offer that will be less fair to Yahoo .
The firm deadline is new : 3 weeks .
We ’ve known this hostile approach would be coming eventually , but for Microsoft to come out and declare it with such gusto is a bit surprising — especially since the company suggested only a few days ago that it was n’t yet interested in hostile maneuvers ( our coverage ) .
If the Internet community at large perceived Microsoft as the abusive partner in its relationship with Yahoo before , this letter certainly will not help matters any .
Other companies engage in this sort of hostile activity all the time , and it ’s not necessarily a bad move , from a business perspective .
But most other companies do n’t have hundreds , if not thousands , of bloggers writing about their every move .
Millions of readers have long seen Microsoft as a bully , and this can only serve to prove the point , negating some recent efforts from the company to get good press .
The efforts by other companies , including Google , to save Yahoo from Microsoft just got a lot more urgent .
Will Google respond again just as they did after Microsoft ’s initial offer to Yahoo ?
It ’s also interesting that Microsoft would release such a letter on a Saturday — Monday ’s stock trading could be very tumultuous , as LiveSide points out .
[ Below : The letter from Ballmer ]
Dear Members of the Board :
It has now been more than two months since we made our proposal to acquire Yahoo !
at a 62 % premium to its closing price on January 31 , 2008 , the day prior to our announcement .
Our goal in making such a generous offer was to create the basis for a speedy and ultimately friendly transaction .
Despite this , the pace of the last two months has been anything but speedy .
While there has been some limited interaction between management of our two companies , there has been no meaningful negotiation to conclude an agreement .
We understand that you have been meeting to consider and assess your alternatives , including alternative transactions with others in the industry , but we ’ve seen no indication that you have authorized Yahoo ! management to negotiate with Microsoft .
This is despite the fact that our proposal is the only alternative put forward that offers your shareholders full and fair value for their shares , gives every shareholder a vote on the future of the company , and enhances choice for content creators , advertisers , and consumers .
During these two months of inactivity , the Internet has continued to march on , while the public equity markets and overall economic conditions have weakened considerably , both in general and for other Internet - focused companies in particular .
At the same time , public indicators suggest that Yahoo ! ’s search and page view shares have declined .
Finally , you have adopted new plans at the company that have made any change of control more costly .
By any fair measure , the large premium we offered in January is even more significant today .
We believe that the majority of your shareholders share this assessment , even after reviewing your public disclosures relating to your future prospects .
Given these developments , we believe now is the time for our respective companies to authorize teams to sit down and negotiate a definitive agreement on a combination of our companies that will deliver superior value to our respective shareholders , creating a more efficient and competitive company that will provide greater value and service to our customers .
If we have not concluded an agreement within the next three weeks , we will be compelled to take our case directly to your shareholders , including the initiation of a proxy contest to elect an alternative slate of directors for the Yahoo ! board .
The substantial premium reflected in our initial proposal anticipated a friendly transaction with you .
If we are forced to take an offer directly to your shareholders , that action will have an undesirable impact on the value of your company from our perspective which will be reflected in the terms of our proposal .
It is unfortunate that by choosing not to enter into substantive negotiations with us , you have failed to give due consideration to a transaction that has tremendous benefits for Yahoo ! ’s shareholders and employees .
We think it is critically important not to let this window of opportunity pass .
Sincerely , Steven A. Ballmer
Chief Executive Office
Microsoft Corp .

The recently - launched SitePoint CSS Reference ( and its print version , The Ultimate CSS Reference ) contains extensive coverage of some of the more obscure areas of CSS .
One such area that is going to become very important with the release of IE8 later this year is CSS tables .
For years now , enlightened designers who have embraced CSS layout have had to bend over backwards to produce complex designs that would have been trivial to produce using the HTML table - based layout techniques of the past .
The lengths to which designers must go to produce , say , a simple three - column layout using CSS techniques are so extreme that many web designers simply give up on CSS and resort to HTML tables for their layout .
The Tech Times # 142 and # 143 were devoted to this issue .
With the release of IE8 coming this year , the stage is set for all that to change .
IE8 will be the last of the major browsers to add support for CSS tables , which will enable designers to use table - based layout techniques without misusing HTML table markup .
To demonstrate this , I ’ve produced the following 3 - column page layout example using CSS tables :
View the example in your browser
This layout is hardly unique ; what makes it special is how easily it has been achieved .
Rather than using absolute positioning or fragile and counterintuitive floating techniques , I ’ve produced it using relatively easy - to - understand CSS tables .
Each of the three columns in the layout is a < div > with a unique ID .
From left to right they are " navigation " , " content " , and " sidebar " .
All three are contained within another < div > with ID " body " .
The magic comes in using CSS to make these three unremarkable < div > s display as if they were cells in a table row .
First , we set the containing < div > to display as a table :
# body { border - collapse : collapse ; display : table ; table - layout : fixed ; }
And then we set each of our three < div > s to display as a table cell , with the width we ’re after :
#navigation , # content , # sidebar { display : table - cell ; } #navigation { width : 200 px ; } #content { width : 66 % ; } #sidebar { width : 33 % ; }
With the addition of a few borders and background colors , as well as a little padding to give it that final polish , we ’ve got ourselves a perfectly usable layout .
A longstanding bug in Firefox makes it necessary to add a second containing < div > inside the " body " < div > and set it to display : table - row .
Otherwise , the layout will often break when it initially loads .
Not only is this code exceedingly simple , but the result is also far more robust than your typical three - column layout achieved with earlier CSS layout techniques .
Each column extends the full height of the page no matter which column has the most content , and the layout does n’t fall apart at extreme font or window sizes .
The layout just works — in the same way that HTML table - based layouts have always just worked .
As soon as IE8 is out and we can begin to justify leaving IE7 behind , we can start to use these simple and powerful techniques , since all other major browsers already support CSS tables .
Suddenly , CSS - based page layout will be something almost anyone can understand !
Of course , we ca n’t just throw away current CSS layout techniques the day IE8 is released , can we ?
After all , IE7 and its predecessors will be around for years to come .
If you want your site to look as good in those browsers , you ’ll still have to break out the more complex and fragile layout techniques that work with them .
But if you can justify letting the experience slip just a little for users of IE7 and earlier , you may be able to minimize the amount of twisty CSS you need in your site .
If you view the above example in IE7 , for instance , you ’ll see a simplified , two - column version of the layout that avoids the need to mix pixel - width columns with percentage - width columns , thus simplifying the code required to make the layout work in IE7 and earlier .
CSS tables will finally make page layout with CSS every bit as easy as the HTML table layout techniques of yesteryear .
Barring support for older browsers , there will no longer be any excuse for designers choosing to abuse table markup for quick and easy layout work .
And as shown in the above example , with a little extra planning , you should even be able to give a reasonable experience to users of older browsers while taking advantage of CSS tables in your layout .
WASHINGTON - Fannie
Mae 's former chief executive says the Bush administration helped orchestrate an accounting scandal that cost him his job , and he wants to use White House documents to defend himself in a shareholder lawsuit .
Franklin Raines argues in court documents that the administration decided the government - chartered agency wielded too much power in the mortgage industry .
His attorneys say the White House pushed regulators to weaken Fannie Mae and triggered a $ 6 billion accounting scandal .
Raines subpoenaed the White House for documents in July .
Justice Department lawyers will go before a federal judge today to fight the subpoena .
Relying primarily on articles by financial journalists and the testimony of industry analysts , Raines describes in court documents an unofficial task force dubbed " Noriega " that was formed to weaken Fannie Mae and drive down its stock price .
Fannie Mae is the largest US buyer and backer of home loans .
It was created by Congress but its stock is publicly traded .
Raines says the Bush administration wanted to undermine confidence in the agency so it could push for tighter government controls .
Raines names as task force members Assistant Treasury Secretary Wayne Abernathy ; presidential economic adviser Keith Hennessey ; Kevin Warsh , a special assistant to President Bush for economic policy ; Jeffrey Kupfer , who served in 2003 as special assistant to Bush 's chief of staff ; Associate White House Counsel Reginald J. Brown ; and Stephen S. McMillin , an official in the president 's budget office .
He accuses the task force of influencing an investigation by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight .
Raines is also seeing documents related to former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card .
In 2004 , OFHEO released a report detailing widespread accounting errors at Fannie Mae .
The scandal swept Raines and CFO Timothy Howard from office and led to a massive shareholder lawsuit .
Regulators are also suing Raines and others , seeking fines and the return of millions in bonus money .
Raines believes he can show that regulators were aware of - and approved of - the company 's accounting practices until the White House got involved .
The Justice Department is urging US District Judge Richard J. Leon to throw out the subpoenas .
Government lawyers say Raines " seeks a fishing expedition through the files of the president and the Executive Office of the President . "
The documents Raines is seeking are n't relevant to the shareholder lawsuit and Raines has offered no evidence they even exist , Bush administration lawyers argue .
Raines also served as President Bill Clinton 's budget director .

Wikipedia is frequently touted as a marvel of collaboration , a model of peer production .
But it may be more instructive as a laboratory of pathologies of social interaction .
While perhaps - like sausages - it 's better not to see the product being made , any familiarity with how Wikipedia operates should give rise to enormous scepticism about its alleged example of harmonious collective action .
Wikipedia 's success has led to many sites focused on its foibles .
One such site , the " Wikipedia Review " , was the locus of much investigation into the " EssJay " scandal in which a highly ranked administrator falsified academic degrees and lied to the New Yorker ( tinyurl.com/22an3d ) .
It also mocks Jimmy Wales 's repeated denial of co-founder status to former employee and Wikipedia creator Larry Sanger ( larrysanger.org/roleinwp.html ) - now running rival site citizendium.org - by dubbing Wales the " Sole Flounder " .
The combination of feuds and relentless focus on negatives associated with Wikipedia creates an obsession by some devoted Wikipedians about the evils visited upon them .
Tensions can also be intensified by the fact that since Wikipedia supports accounts with no identity verification , nobody can ever be sure if a pseudonymous user 's opinion is sincere or a sham .
You could in theory have several such accounts ( called " sock puppets " ) , and operate them to give the impression of having several supporters for one viewpoint .
Abusing this facility is against policy , though preventing it is difficult .
This toxic mix of paranoia , fear of infiltrators and a social system where status can be acquired by fighting off threats ( real or imagined ) exploded recently into a governance scandal familiar to any observer of bureaucratic politics .
A prominent Wikipedia administrator unilaterally revoked the account of a highly regarded contributor .
When questioned , the response claimed the evidence was too sensitive to be released to the public , but had been vetted at the highest levels .
Shortly after , the administrator reversed the action , apologising and citing new information .
The end of the matter ?
No .
It had barely begun .
The secret dossier was leaked , and turned out to be a deeply flawed quasi- profiling purportedly establishing the suspected contributor as , paraphrased , a sleeper agent for an enemy cell ( that is , from Wikipedia Review ) bent on disruption .
Yet official actions were taken to stop the leak from being posted in Wikipedia discussion under the pretext of " policy and violating copyright " ( tinyurl.com /ytj9qo ) .
Of course , the material was immediately available on Wikipedia Review ( tinyurl.com /2sjrmj ) and another site , Wikitruth .info , thus giving those sites redeeming value , whatever their flaws .
Jimmy Wales himself was none too pleased .
Although he preaches that Wikipedia is built on trust and love , he can be notably unloving to those untrusting of his pronouncements .
One long - time editor who posted the leaked evidence was said by Wales to be trolling ( being deliberately disruptive ) : " He knew he was trolling , and I doubt if he will last much longer at Wikipedia because of it " ( tinyurl.com / 2q9jdg ) .
A formal attempt was made to virtually ban that editor , which narrowly failed .
The administrator stepped down , and quasi- judicial proceedings ended with several admonishments .
It 's not that Wikipedia participants are expected to transcend humanity .
Rather , it 's that looking beyond the rosy marketing picture reveals little but bureaucracy implemented poorly - including fiefdoms , cliques and sycophancy to the charismatic leader .
For all Jimmy Wales 's self - promotion regarding his supposed ability to build good communities , it 's apparent his skill is instead in knowing how to sell a dysfunctional community effectively .
One subtext of the Wikipedia hype is that businesses can harvest an eager pool of free labour , disposable volunteers who will donate effort for the sheer joy of it .
The fantasy is somewhat akin to Santa 's workshop , where little elves work happily away for wages of a glass of milk and a cookie .
Whereas the reality is closer to an exploitative cult running on sweatshop labour .

The World from Berlin Bush Has ' Understood Nothing , Learned Nothing '
Bush 's plan for global warming ?
Wait until 2025 .
Only then , he said in a Wednesday speech , should the US cap greenhouse gas emissions .
Germany is not impressed .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese authorities have launched mass arrests of Tibetans in Lhasa for interrogation about the fiercest anti-Chinese uprising for decades , a Beijing - based source told Reuters on Wednesday .
President George W. Bush urged Chinese President Hu Jintao by phone to open dialogue with the exiled Dalai Lama .
Hu said China would not talk to the man it accuses of fomenting deadly riots and trying to sabotage the Beijing Olympics .
The province of Qinghai , hundreds of kilometers ( miles ) from Lhasa , was the latest area to see unrest .
Ethnic Tibetans staged a sit - down protest after police stopped them from marching , said the Beijing - based source who had spoken to residents .
“ They ( police ) were beating up monks , which will only infuriate ordinary people , ” the source said of the protest on Tuesday in Qinghai ’s Xinghai county .
A resident confirmed the demonstration , saying paramilitaries had dispersed the 200 to 300 protesters after half an hour , armed security forces had filled the area and that workers had been kept inside their offices .
The Tibetan uprising and China ’s response are at the centre of an international storm ahead of the Olympics in August .
The head of the European Parliament on Wednesday questioned whether European leaders should attend the opening of the Games and invited the Dalai Lama , the exiled leader of Tibetan Buddhism , to address the EU legislature on events in Tibet .
The unrest began with peaceful marches by Buddhist monks in Lhasa more than two weeks ago .
Within days , riots erupted in which non-Tibetan Chinese migrants were attacked and their property burned until security forces filled the streets .
China says 19 people were killed , at the hands of Tibetan mobs .
The Tibetan government - in - exile says 140 died in Lhasa and elsewhere -- most of them Tibetan victims of security forces .
Protests have spread to parts of Chinese provinces which border Tibet and have large ethnic Tibetan populations .
The Beijing - based source said authorities were now rounding up Tibetans in Lhasa in the wake of the unrest .
“ It ’s very harsh .
They are taking in and questioning anyone who saw the protests , ” the source said .
“ The prisons are full .
Detainees are being held at prisons in counties outside Lhasa . ”
The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since fleeing Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule .
He denies masterminding the latest demonstrations .
BUSH TALKS TO HU
U.S. President George W. Bush telephoned Chinese President Hu Jintao on Wednesday , a White House spokeswoman said .
“ The president raised his concerns about the situation in Tibet and encouraged the Chinese government to engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama ’s representatives and to allow access for journalists and diplomats , ” she said .
Hu asserted that the Dalai Lama was behind the violence and “ efforts to disrupt the Beijing Olympics ” , and so Beijing could not conduct talks , according to a Chinese government Web site .

Hu , former Communist Party chief in Tibet , crushed unrest there in the late 1980s .
He defended the latest crackdown .
“ Any responsible government , faced with such violent criminal acts that are a serious violation of human rights , that seriously disrupt social order and seriously jeopardize people ’s lives , property and safety , would not just sit there and watch , ” the Web site paraphrased him as saying .
International calls have grown for China to show restraint in its response to the unrest , but few urge an outright boycott of the Beijing Games .
The speaker of the Tibetan parliament in exile said the Games should go ahead but be used to pressurize Beijing .

Beijing - backed scholars vowed to press ahead with “ patriotic education ” of the rebellious monks in Tibet ’s monasteries .
“ The purpose of patriotic education is because the Dalai clique has been trying hard to disrupt development in Tibet and disrupt the normal practices of Tibetan Buddhism , ” Dramdul , who heads the Religious Studies Institute at the China Tibetology Research Centre in Beijing , told a news conference .
LHASA RAILWAY
Protests continued elsewhere .
A Tibetan man tried to set himself on fire in eastern India , as Indian security forces stopped him and hundreds of other marchers from entering Sikkim state , which borders China , according to a local police officer .
A small group of foreign and Chinese reporters arrived in Lhasa on Wednesday , tightly supervised by Chinese authorities .
The Dalai Lama expressed surprise .
“ Really ?
Then very good , but it should be with complete freedom -- only then you can assess the real situation , ” he told reporters in New Delhi .
In a letter circulated by the Washington - based International Campaign for Tibet , a Lhasa resident described tight controls on religion and resentment over the influx of Han Chinese residents since a rail link was built to the remote , mountain region .
Lhagpa Phuntshogs , head of the China Tibetology Research Centre , accused protesting monks of wanting to restore the serfdom of Tibet ’s pre-communist past .
“ What do they want ?
I think it ’s very clear that they want to try to restore the old theocracy in Tibet .
The separatist elements are not happy with the end of theocracy in Tibet ... and they are not happy with the end of backwardness in Tibet . ”
In 2007 , the British Prime Minister commissioned an independent review of how parents and children are being affected by the rise of new technology , such as increased access to the Internet and gaming consoles .
Dr. Tanya Byron , a psychologist with experience in child behavior , led the review , and spent several months exploring the research literature and meeting with parents , children , and industry leaders .
The results of the work have now been released in a report that makes comprehensive recommendations regarding the role the government can play in helping parents make technology a safe and effective part of their child 's development .
In places , the report is remarkably blunt in its analysis .
Dr. Byron argues that unsupervised exploration and the pushing of boundaries are a natural and essential part of childhood .
In her view , UK society has become increasingly risk - averse , which has resulted in parents that let kids explore the outdoors only through carefully supervised and structured activities .
Left with few boundaries to push , children are turning to games and the Internet as the only locations they can undergo this form of development .
Byron suggests that parents should treat technology as they do more traditional areas of childhood development , and makes two informative comparisons : crossing the street and learning to swim .
Each of these is associated with risks , but parents manage them in stages , with education , followed by supervised exploration that ultimately leads to allowing children to explore largely unsupervised .
Technology largely presents a problem because it lacks the intuitive and widely understood aspects of education and risk .
" There is a generational digital divide which means that parents do not necessarily feel equipped to help their children in this space , " Byron writes , " which can lead to fear and a sense of helplessness . "
Dr. Tanya Byron
The report contains extensive recommendations for eliminating the fear and helplessness aspects , divided between efforts targeted towards games and those focused on Internet use .
In general , the recommendations focus on voluntary self - regulation by the relevant industries and educational programs that will help parents understand the challenges and benefits of the technology .
In terms of Internet use , Dr. Byron recommends pervasive access to parental control software .
Retailers should provide this at the point of purchase , and ISPs should include the software as part of their service .
Search companies should agree to provide a " safe search " option that 's easily accessed from the main search portal , and can be locked in on a given machine .
Content providers should also agree to strict takedown times for potentially harmful content .
All of these efforts would be coordinated by a governmental council that works with the relevant industry groups .
Byron avoids recommending any new laws , but suggests that the council be charged with evaluating existing laws to determine how they could be modernized or clarified to cope with technological advances .
The existing research on gaming and childhood development , in Byron 's view , mostly indicates that factors beyond gaming content can be critical : " there is a strong body of ethnographic research which argues that context and the characteristics of each child will mediate the effects of playing video games . "
This , ultimately , means that parents should determine what gaming content is appropriate for their children .
To make parents ' job easier , the report calls for improvements in the existing game ratings system , along with improved enforcement of age limits .
Byron 's report also places significant emphasis on education and the role of schools .
It calls for teacher training and certification programs to include information on the safe use of technology , and to expand the educational material offered to include programs targeted at parents to help them understand how to monitor and assist their children .
Overall , the recommendations are refreshingly short on fear - mongering , and the report recognizes a number of things that many people seem reluctant to admit : each child is a unique , so one - size - fits - all rules are ineffective ; parents need to educate themselves so that they can set intelligent limits ; and risk can never be eliminated , so their role should include developing their child 's resilience .
Given these realities , its recommendations appear to appropriately focus on how the government and industry can work to make a parent 's job easier .

Background from our friends at Election 08 :
Geraldine Ferraro— usually a class act — made recent statements that seem to establish a pattern : the Clinton campaign using surrogates to invoke and inject race in this campaign .
The Ferraro event … the leaks to Drudge … BET founder Robert L. Johnson … Bill ’s South Carolina non-sequitur .
But for a classic moment of a Clinton rep ( in this case Mark Penn ) quietly inserting loaded language , check this out ( about 3:50 in ) .
They play dirty .
While groups such as Factcheck.org have made compelling arguments against the likelihood the Clinton camp intentionally altered Obama ’s image …it ’s an odd argument that assumes anything in campaign commercials happens by accident .
Check out the debate , judge for yourself .
I have read all of the e-mails and am starting the process of responding .
However , I will not be able to respond to all the e-mails , so I 've added a " December 14 , 2003 update :
In early December this page was featured on numerous popular websites ( Slashdot , luminous - landscape , imaging - resource and others ) , and I was flooded with hundreds of e-mails as a result .
Thanks to everyone who has written with comments , congratulations , suggestions and ideas .
I am grateful for all the interest .
I have read all of the e-mails and am starting the process of responding .
However , I will not be able to respond to all the e-mails , so I 've added a " Frequently Asked Questions " section at the bottom of this page .
If you do n't get a response from me , it is n't personal !
It is probably because your question is answered below , or elsewhere on my site .
Introduction .
This page contains what I believe to be one of the highest resolution , most detailed stitched digital images ever created .
It is the view from Bryce Point in Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah .
It consists of 196 separate photographs taken with a 6 megapixel digital camera , and then stitched together into one seamless composite .
The final image is 40,784 x 26,800 pixels in size , and contains about 1.09 billion pixels ... a little more than one gigapixel .
I have been unable to find any record of a higher resolution photographic ( i.e. non-scientific ) digital image that has been created without resizing a smaller , lower resolution image or using an interpolated image .
How was it created ?
The first step in the creation of the image was to choose an appropriate subject .
There are a number of technical issues that I had to consider that are not normally encountered when taking single images .
For example , it took me 13 minutes simply to take all the photographs , and I was shooting as fast as my camera could write images to its memory card .
So , I needed a subject that was relatively static .
Secondly , I knew that I would have to use a very long focal length lens to take the image , otherwise the final composite would end up with an extremely wide field of view ... something I did n't want .
This also presented challenges due to the extremely short depth of field when using very long lenses .
The second step was to assemble the images .
This was a complex and lengthy process .
My normal procedure ( using PTAssembler , Panorama Tools and Photoshop ) was not sufficient in this case for a number of reasons because of the size and number of images I was working with .
For example , the version of Photoshop that I use cannot work with images with pixel dimensions of more than 30,000 .
So , my solution was to modify some of the existing programs in my workflow , and write a number of new software programs to create this image .
Technical Details .
Here are some facts and figures about this image : Final image dimensions : 40,784 x 26,800 pixels
Number of pixels in final image : 1,093,011,200 ( 1.09 gigapixel )
Final image file format : RGB
Tiff using deflate compression
Final image file size : 2,068,654,055 bytes
Number of source images : 196
Number of pixels in source images : 1,233,125,376 ( 196 images * 3072*2048 )
Lens focal length : 280 mm ( equivalent to 450 mm on a 35 mm camera )
Aperture : F9 .
Shutter speed : 1/400
Number of control points in PTAssembler project : 779
Number of seams that were manually blended after stitching : 364
Horizontal field of view of final image : 63 degrees
Time required to capture component images : 13 minutes
Time required to set control points : 2 hours
Time required to optimize project : 2 days
Time required to stitch project : 4 days
Time required to blend seams / correct misalignments / finalize image : 3 days
How much detail does it contain ?
Much , much more than would be captured by any conventional digital camera ... even those that cost more than a new car .
For example , the Canon 1Ds ( about $ 8,000 ) captures 11 megapixels , while the BetterLight Super 10 K - 2 scanning back ( camera not included ! ) captures 140 megapixels , but costs about $ 25,000 .
I also believe that a gigapixel image surpasses what even die - hard admirers of large format photography argue is possible with large format cameras .
For more thoughts on this subject , you might also want to read this essay .
Here 's another way to think about it .
Given that the resolving power of the human eye ( under ideal conditions at the center of the retina ) is about 1 arcminute ( 1/60th of one degree ) , this image captures considerably more detail than I ( or any other normal sighted human ) was able to see with my eye when standing on the overlook at Bryce Point .
Assuming one pixel per arcminute , an image with dimensions of 3780 x 2485 would suffice to capture the amount of detail that the naked eye could resolve .
This image has more than 100 times this detail .
Looking at the full sized digital image , one is able to see things that might have been difficult or impossible to spot , even when using binoculars .
Here is full sized crop from the original image .
It is 40784 pixels wide , but only 100 pixels tall .
It covers the entire width of the full size image , and illustrates the amount of detail captured .
It has not been sharpened , and is saved as a low quality 380 KB file ( to save bandwidth ) .
You may need to save it to your hard - drive and view it using an image viewer if your browser cannot open it successfully .
Below are some crops to simulate the amount of detail that would be captured using cameras of different resolutions ( I do n't own any of these higher resolution cameras , so the crops below are simulated , and due to the resizing algorithm used to create these crops , they may over - estimate the amount of detail actually captured by these cameras ) .
Why Bother ?
Good question .
The short answer is " why not ? "
As digital camera resolutions have increased , and the hardware , techniques and software for stitching multiple images into composites have improved , there has been speculation about when gigapixel images would become possible .
This seemed like an interesting challenge to me .
( I still think that it will be a long time before true gigapixel cameras will become available . )
However , this is n't the only reason .
I 've been producing and printing stitched images consisting of 20 - 150 megapixels for several years .
I 've become addicted to the amazing detail that is visible in large prints from these images !
Gigapixel images present the possibility of producing some of the most amazingly detailed prints at sizes of 10 - 15 feet wide .
A 300 ppi print of this image would measure about 11 feet wide , while a 240 ppi print would be close to 15 feet wide .
Even printed at this size , the image would appear very sharp upon close inspection .
Another advantage to an image this size is the ability to crop very small portions of this image in a number of different ways and still produce extremely high resolution large prints .
How Do You Print It ?
Another good question .
The short answer to this is that there appear to be a number of alternatives , but none that I 've discovered that I 'm completely happy with .
So , I 'm still thinking about it !
However , I 'm interested in hearing from anyone who would like to partner with me on printing this image .
I think it would be an excellent match for ( and an excellent demonstration of ) large format printing technology .
If you have an idea or a proposal , please let me know ( e- mail me ) .

Frequently Asked Questions .
Where can I download the full size image ?
Will you e-mail it to me ?
I 'm not making this available for a number of reasons .
First , it would take you close to a week to download it over a 56 K modem or about 6 hours over a good DSL connection .
Second , each download would cost me ( in bandwidth charges ) enough money that it would probably be more cost effective for me to burn and mail you a DVD with the image .
Third , giving away the full sized digital image would be similar to a film photographer giving away his negative ... something I 'm not quite ready to do yet !

The crop that I downloaded is corrupt ... it wo n't open in my browser / image editor / favorite program .
The crop is n't corrupt .
Rather , many programs ( including some web browers ) are simply not capable of opening up images with extremely large dimensions .
I 'd recommend irfanview as a good freeware program that can open this crop .

Ca n't a local office / copy store print the image ?
My inkjet printer prints on paper up to 13 inches ... I can do it .
Most copy store / home inkjet printers are n't wide enough to produce a 300 or 240 ppi print of the image in one piece .
They 'd have to print it in a number of tiles or strips .
The widest printer that I 've seen promises output at sizes up to 72 inches wide ... over a foot too narrow to produce a 300 ppi print of this image , and about 3 feet too narrow for a 240 ppi print .

Ca n't a billboard printer print the image ?
Probably .
But I do n't think that the image quality of these printers will do justice to this image .
Remember , billboards are n't desiged to be viewed from 6 inches away .
The whole point of my gigapixel image is that it contains so much detail that it can be viewed from 6 inches , 6 feet or 60 feet ... it will look very sharp at any distance .

How did you do it ?
Did you move the camera ?
What kind of tripod do you use ?
etc...
My general process for stitching images is outlined in my PTAssembler tutorial .
However , I should warn you that I had to adapt this process significantly , and write some additional programs to work around a number of bugs in the programs that I use ( interestingly , PTAssembler did not need to be modified ) .
I used a Manfrotto tripod with a Bogen 3028 tripod head .
I did not use a special spherical tripod head , nor did I did not use any sort of indexed or " click - stop " head to assist in precise rotation .
Everything was so far away from the camera in this shot that the parallax errors introduced by not using a spherical tripod head were essentially zero .
My procedure was simple ... take an image , rotate the tripod head so that the image overlaps the previous image slightly , and repeat 196 times .
I 've been using this technique for about 5 years , which allows me to do it quickly and precisely .

What kind of supercomputer did you use ?!
Nothing too fancy .
I used a generic PC with a ( modest by today 's standards ) AMD Athlon 1800 processor and 1.5 GB of RAM .
The OS is Windows XP .

How does this compare to 8x10 or 11x14 large format ?
I 'm not an expert in large format photography .
However , in a recent post on the rec.photo.equipment.large - format ( and other ) newsgroup Brian Caldwell made some interesting comparisons , suggesting that this image might compare quite well to those produced by cold war spy cameras , and concluding that " ordinary large format equipment can't even begin to compare with these examples of cold war excess " .

Can I get high resolution wall - paper of this image ( or others ) ?
I am considering selling a collection of my images as high resolution wall paper , including panoramic format images suitable for multi-monitor displays .
However , I am not currently offering high resolution images for download .

Is the gigapixel image for sale ?
Once I 've figured out how to print this to my satisfaction , then I may offer prints for sale .
I already offer prints of some of my images ( recent images only ) for sale on my web site .

I am obsessed with not wasting time and being as productive as I can .
After all , my income is directly linked to my ability to produce quality work at a rapid rate .
This November will mark the 3 - year anniversary of the launch of this blog , and the experience has led me to Bly ’s Theory of Blogging and Personal Productivity , which states :
“ Personal productivity is inversely proportional to time spent blogging . ”
Is blogging fun ?
Yes .
Intellectually stimulating ?
Can be .
Useful ?
Opinions vary .
But the more time you spend blogging , the less work you get done .
This leads me to Bly ’s Rule of Blogging Time , which states :
“ Anyone who blogs more than 10 minutes a day — or more than an hour a week — is spending way too much time reading and writing on blogs . ”
What ’s your reaction to my Theory and Rule of blogging ?
Can one spend too much time — or conversely , too little time — in the blogosphere ?
How many hours a week do YOU spend blogging — both writing your own blog , responding to comments on your blog , and participating in discussions on other people ’s blogs ?
And really , you do it for fun , perhaps for research , or to establish yourself as a thought leader …
But you do n’t think blogging is the new Marketing Miracle that ’s going to Change the Face of Business As We Know It , right ?

If Anonymous has his or her way , hundreds of demonstrators will launch ' the London Scientology Raid ' on the ' church 's ' British HQ this morning .
He or she is promising an ' EPIC to show that we actually give a damn ' and whoever he or she is , the British Anonymous is n't alone .
Anonymouses around the world are using Facebook and chatrooms to co-ordinate protests and cyber-attacks on Scientology websites .
They say they wo n't give their names because they want ' to show that we are everyone and everywhere ' , but I suspect fear of the Scientologists ' expensive lawyers is an equally powerful argument for discretion .
Anonymous says the sect provoked the assault by seeking to suppress a video of Tom Cruise attacking psychiatrists and doctors for their failure to stop drug addiction and crime .
To Cruise and his co-believers , medics are idiots who can't supply effective treatments because they do n't understand that humans are haunted by the souls of mentally ill aliens dumped in volcanoes off Hawaii by Xenu , the evil ruler of the Galactic Confederacy 75 million years ago .
( I 'll spare you the rest . )
It is not Mr Cruise 's most polished performance .
He 's occasionally incoherent and at one point emits an unhinged laugh .
Scientologists claimed they owned the copyright to the film that had been edited to make Cruise look silly and demanded YouTube remove it .
As soon as they did , Anonymous posted it back .
Outsiders may wonder why they care so much about one sect .
The supernatural stories of all religions are ridiculous to those who do n't believe them and Scientology only sounds more sinister than most because it is a modern invention .
True , there are well - sourced accounts of Scientologists persuading converts to part with large sums of money , but all religions can lighten the pockets of the faithful .
All in all , Rowan Williams seems a more deserving target for mass protests this weekend .
Say what you will about Scientologists , but at least they have n't come out against the emancipation of women and equality before the law .
They have , however , exploited a trend as dangerous as the retreat from liberal values in the face of the threat of Islamism .
They have learnt that rich organisations and rich men can use British courts to suppress the freedom democratic societies rely on , both here and abroad .
The pay - off line to a 2005 episode of South Park said it all .
The show was a satire on Scientology in which a cartoon Cruise was exposed to near - continuous ridicule .
In the final scene , he cries : ' I 'm going to sue you ... in England !'
The real Cruise can't sue the makers in the US , where freedom of speech is protected but , like his cartoon counterpart , he could be confident our judges would gladly shelter him under our authoritarian libel laws if he found an excuse to come here .
The same thought struck TV executives and the Scientology episode of South Park has never been shown by a British station .
Even though you can see it on the web , lawyers would turn pale if I suggested repeating South Park 's running gag at Cruise 's expense in a British paper .
South Park was n't a one - off .
Andrew Morton , chronicler of the Windsor - Spencer divorce , has just produced a biography of Cruise which says much about his relationship with his strange church .
Not only can you not buy a copy here , you can't order one from abroad .
Try to buy a copy online and the US Amazon site will tell you that ' the publisher has authorised the distribution of this book only to customers within the United States and Canada ' .
The Economist has all but accused St Martin's Press of cowardice , but I think its editors know about the key modern censorship case of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz v Rachel Ehrenfeld .
For several years now , bin Mahfouz , a billionaire Saudi banker , has used the English libel courts to punish a succession of newspapers and publishers .
In 2004 , Mr Justice Eady ordered Rachel Ehrenfeld , a New York - based academic , to pay him $ 225,000 in damages and costs and destroy all copies of her book .
The novelty lay in the fact that Dr Ehrenfeld was n't a British citizen , but an American .
Her book had n't been printed in Britain or publicised in Britain .
She offered no defence because she did n't think Eady had the power to tell an American what she could and could n't write .
More extraordinarily , bin Mahfouz was n't a British citizen either .
He has adopted Irish nationality and agreed to pay New York authorities $ 225 m in return for the dropping of charges about his role in the collapse of the fantastically crooked Bank of Credit and Commerce International .
Despite this , Eady ruled that bin Mahfouz had a reputation worth protecting in England .
He then decided the sheikh could sue Ehrenfeld because a few copies of her book had slipped into the country via Amazon .
The net , which was meant to encourage openness , became the excuse for a pulping order .
Publishers and every variety of American journalist from left winger to neo-con are demanding court judgments and new laws from US politicians to protect them from Eady and his kind .
They have grasped that , far from promoting freedom , the net is allowing Saudi billionaires , Scientologists and soon , I imagine , Vladimir Putin 's stooges and the agents of sovereign wealth funds to come to London and secure a banning order that could be enforced anywhere in the world .
Today 's anti-Scientology protesters may seem obsessive .
Although they promise to be non-violent , their planned raids could turn nasty .
But they understand better than bowdlerising judges and appeasing archbishops that the freedom to speak , argue , examine and satirise is the best defence against all the cults that seek to indoctrinate and subjugate our fellow citizens .
· This article was amended on Tuesday February 12 2008 .
We mentioned a censorship case that featured Ruth Ehrenfeld when we mean to say Rachel Ehrenfeld .
This has been corrected .

Clifford Algebras
A Clifford - algebra combines and generalizes the scalar product and the vector product .
When you multiply two elements in a Clifford - algebra , the result can be decomposed into a symmetric scalar product and an antisymmetric vector product as follows :
\( \renewcommand{\vec} [ 1]{{\bf{ #1}}}\ )
\begin{align}ab&=a\cdot b+a\wedge b, \\
a\cdot b&= ( ab+ba ) /2 , \\
a\wedge b&=( ab-ba)/2.\end{align}
In one dimension , the Clifford - algebra reduces trivially to the algebra of real numbers , and the vector product is identically zero .
In two dimensions , things start to get interesting .
One way to generate a Clifford - algebra is through a slightly unconventional application of complex numbers : instead of ordinary multiplication , we may use multiplication on the left by the complex conjugate of the first multiplicand .
The result can be decomposed as follows :
\ begin{align}a&=a_1+a_2\vec{i} , \\
b&=b_1+b_2\vec{i} , \\
ab&=(a_1-a_2\vec{i} ) ( b_1+b_2\vec{i} ) =( a_1b_1+a_2b_2 ) +( a_1b_2-a_2b_1)\vec{i}.\end{align}
The scalar and vector products , respectively , are $ ( a_1b_1+a_2b_2 ) $ and $ ( a_1b_2-a_2b_1 ) \vec{i}$ .
There is , however , a more conventional way to represent the two - dimensional Clifford - algebra , a way that makes more structure evident .
Instead of starting with complex numbers , we start with two unit vectors , $ \vec{e}_1 $ and $ \vec{e}_2 $ ( $a=a_1\vec{e}_1+a_2\vec{e}_2 $ , $ b=b_1\vec{e}_1+b_2\vec{e}_2 $ ) .
The following multiplication rules apply :
\begin{align}\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_1&=\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_2=1 , \\
\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2&=-\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_1=\vec{e}_1\wedge\vec{e}_2.\end{align}
From this we can compute the Clifford product :
\[ab=(a_1b_1+a_2b_2 ) +( a_1b_2-a_2b_1 ) (\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2 ) .\]
Now is a good time to notice an important coincidence :
\[(\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2 ) ( \vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2)=-( \vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2 ) ( \vec{e}_2\vec{e}_1)=-\vec{e}_1(\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_2)\vec{e}_1=-\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_1=-1.\ ]
Here we made use without proof or closer scrutiny of the fact that Clifford multiplication is associative .
The result is that $ ( \vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2 $ ) can be identified with the imaginary unit $ \vec{i}$ , in which case the product of two 2 - dimensional " pure " Clifford numbers ( no scalar component ) is an ordinary complex number .
Generally , an $ n$ - dimensional Clifford - algebra can be represented using $ n$ unit vectors $ \vec{e}_1 ...\vec{e}_n$ , the scalar unit 1 , and the pseudoscalar $ \vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2...\vec{e}_n$ .
In some cases , the pseudoscalar will be equal to 1 ; when it is n't , the algebra is called a universal Clifford - algebra .
In three dimensions , some real fun begins .
To produce a three - dimensional Clifford - algebra , we need three basis units , $ \vec{e}_1 $ , $ \vec{e}_2 $ and $ \vec{e}_3 $ .
The multiplication rules are derived from anticommutativity :
\begin{align}\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_1&=\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_2=\vec{e}_3\vec{e}_3=1 , \\
\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2&=-\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_1,\end{align}
and similarly ,
\begin{align}\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_3&=-\vec{e}_3\vec{e}_2 , \\
\vec{e}_3\vec{e}_1&=-\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_3.\end{align}
From this , the multiplication rule follows :
\[ab=(a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3 ) +( a_1b_2-a_2b_1)\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2+(a_2b_3-a_3b_2)\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_3+(a_3b_1-a_1b_30\vec{e}_3\vec{e}_1 .\]
What we recovered here is the dot product and cross product of ordinary three - dimensional geometry .
But notice something : in the cross product part , instead of the base vectors $ \vec{e}_1 $ , $ \vec{e}_2 $ and $ \vec{e}_3 $ , we have the product terms $ \vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2 $ , $ \vec{e}_2\vec{e}_3 $ and $ \vec{e}_3\vec{e}_1 $ .
The meaning of this is very important .
Forget what you were taught in high - school : the cross product is not a vector .
It is a bivector .
It so happens that in three dimensions ( and only in three dimensions ) a bivector is also three dimensional , so we have a convenient way to identify bivectors with ordinary vectors , but unfortunately when we do so , we hide some real geometric meaning .
Just as a vector represents the direction and the length of a line segment , a bivector represents the orientation and area of a disk .
And unlike the 3 - dimensional cross product concept , the concept of bivectors naturally generalizes to higher dimensions .
Anyway , back to Clifford algebras .
They 're generally represented by two numbers :
The Clifford algebra $ Cl ( p , q ) $ has $ p+q $ base vectors , the square of which will be +1 in $ p$ cases and – 1 in the remaining $ q$ cases .
Clifford algebras can always be represented by matrices , but in some cases , simpler representations are possible : for instance , $ Cl ( 0,1 ) $ can be represented by the complex numbers , and $ Cl ( 0,2 ) $ by quaternions .
So what makes a Clifford - algebra so special ?
Take a look at what multiplication by the pseudoscalar does to a unit vector in the two - dimensional case :
\ begin{matrix} ( \vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2)\vec{e}_1=-(\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_1)\vec{e}_1=-\vec{e}_2(\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_1)=-\vec{e}_2,&\vec{e}_1(\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2 )=( \vec{e}_1\vec{e}_1)\vec{e}_2=\vec{e}_2 , \\
( \vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2) \vec{e}_2=\vec{e}_1(\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_2)=\vec{e}_1,&\vec{e}_2(\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2)=-\vec{e}_2(\vec{e}_2\vec{e}_1)=-( \vec{e}_2\vec{e}_2)\vec{e}_1=-\vec{e}_1.\end{matrix}
This , curiously , has a geometric interpretation .
If we take $ \vec{e}_1 $ and $ \vec{e}_2 $ to be the unit vectors in the plane pointing in the $ x $ and $ y$ direction , multiplying on the left rotated $ \vec{e}_2 $ from the $ y$ - direction to the $ x$ - direction , and $ \vec{e}_1 $ from the $ x$ - direction to the $ - y$ - direction , i.e. , performed a clockwise rotation by 90 º .
Similarly , multiplying on the right is equivalent to a counterclockwise rotation by 90º .
A rotation of a vector $ \vec{a} $ by an arbitrary angle $ \phi$ can be expressed as
\ [\vec{a}'=R\vec{a}R^\star , \ ]
where $ R=\cos\phi/2+\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2\sin\phi/2 $ and $ R^\star=\cos\phi/2-\vec{e}_1\vec{e}_2\sin\phi/2 $ .
This is very similar to the way rotations in 3D - space were associated with elements of the group SU ( 2 ) , with one crucial difference : this technique can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions , and does n't depend on the unique correspondence between SU ( 2 ) and SO ( 3 ) .
Wow .
Washington
IF Barack Obama wins in November , we could have not only our first president who is an African - American , but also our first president who is a civil libertarian .
Throughout his career , Mr. Obama has been more consistent than Hillary Clinton on issues from the Patriot Act to bans on flag burning .
At the same time , he has reached out to Republicans and independents to build support for his views .
Mrs. Clinton , by contrast , has embraced some of the instrumental tacking of Bill Clinton , whose presidency disappointed liberal and conservative civil libertarians on issue after issue .
Mr. Obama made his name in the Illinois Legislature by championing historic civil liberties reforms , like the mandatory recording of all interrogations and confessions in capital cases .
Although prosecutors , the police , the Democratic governor and even some death penalty advocates were initially opposed to the bill , Mr. Obama won them over .
The reform passed unanimously , and it has been adopted by four other states and the District of Columbia .
In the Senate , Mr. Obama distinguished himself by making civil liberties one of his legislative priorities .
He co-sponsored a bipartisan reform bill that would have cured the worst excesses of the Patriot Act by meaningfully tightening the standards for warrantless surveillance .
Once again , he helped encourage a coalition of civil - libertarian liberals and libertarian conservatives .
The effort failed when Hillary Clinton joined 13 other Democrats in supporting a Republican motion to cut off debate on amendments to the Patriot Act .
That was n’t the first time Mrs. Clinton tacked to the center in a civil - liberties debate .
In 2005 , she co-sponsored a bill that would have made it a federal crime to intimidate someone by burning a flag , even though the Supreme Court had struck down similar laws in the past .
( Mr. Obama supported a narrower bill that would have satisfied the Constitution . )
And Mrs. Clinton opposed a moderate proposal by the United States Sentencing Commission that would have retroactively reduced the draconian penalties for possession of crack cocaine  a proposal supported by Mr. Obama , and by liberal as well as conservative judges .
Time 's Michael Scherer asks : Has McCain flip - flopped on torture ?
Simple answer to a simple question : Yes .
In 2005 he sponsored the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) that prohibited military interrogators from inflicting " cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment " upon prisoners by limiting interrogation techniques to those approved in the US Army Field Manual .
However McCain was nearly silent as the grave when George Bush attached a signing - statement to the law that neutered it .
Since then , he has not joined others in Congress who are pushing for the DTA to be tightened and expanded .
In particular , while campaigning in Ohio on Feb .
10 McCain urged Bush to veto a Democratic bill that would have extended the coverage of the DTA to CIA personnel - who frequently interrogate prisoners held by the military at Guantanamo as well as at secret prisons around the world .
Bush did veto the bill on March 8 .
So it 's abundantly clear that McCain has flip - flopped on torture .
For all his preening on the issue , he has backed down shamefully in the face of Bush 's intransigence .
Last month DemFromCT highlighted McCain 's flip - flops on torture :
Maybe McCain 's barbecue buddies in the press will pin straight talkin ' John down and highlight the doubletalk .
My take is that McCain is confident he wo n't be pressed on it .
Oddly , Michael Scherer manages to reach the opposite conclusion from the truth .
When it comes to McCain scandals , Scherer has staked out that territory before .
Referring to the Democratic bill that McCain rejects , Scherer states ( my emphasis ) :
But on this latest piece of legislation , which arose during the heat of the primary campaign and may surface again later this month , McCain sided with Bush in opposing a further restriction of CIA techniques .
Despite the claims of some partisans , McCain 's decision was not a flip - flop , but rather the continuation of a position he took in 2005 when he first championed a bill to restrict the Bush Administration 's ability to mistreat detainees .
" Further restriction ... "
Interesting phrase ; we know of no legal restrictions on CIA interrogation techniques - at least , none that the CIA accepts as binding on it .
The Bush administration long ago tossed aside federal anti-torture statute and international treaties banning torture and abuse .
Scherer is pretending that the CIA 's claim that it is not now using waterboarding , constitutes a " restriction " .
Even if he 's gullible enough to take the CIA 's word without proof , the term he 's looking for is " pause " .
It 's a pause in waterboarding , since the White House has stated it does not rule out a resumption of that torture technique .
So how in the world can McCain 's opposition to the Democratic bill be described as a " continuation of a position he took in 2005 " when he introduced the DTA ?
This is where Scherer 's argument jumps several levels on the absurdity scale and enters the rarified realm of sheer perversity :
In the spring of 2005 , McCain began the process of formulating legislation to prevent a use of such extreme techniques and some of the sanctioned abuses at Abu Ghraib .
Initially , McCain 's staff proposed and circulated a bill remarkably similar to the Democratic language McCain now opposes .
In a draft proposal , dated May 17 , 2005 , and obtained by TIME , McCain 's staff specifically outlined a plan to make the Army Field Manual " the basis for a uniform standard adhered to by all elements of the United States Government . "
Another section said that no person under U.S. control could be treated or interrogated with techniques " not authorized by or listed in " the manual .
But in the end , after consultation with fellow senators and others , McCain and his staff did not adopt this draft language ...
When McCain publicly introduced his bill , which was later called the Detainee Treatment Act , he had narrowed the scope to require the field manual 's use only for the military interrogations or interrogations on military property .
Yes , Time has identified damning evidence .
McCain 's original draft of the DTA tried to extend its applicability to the CIA and all other government officials , but he backed down in the face of opposition and restricted the bill to the military .
The Democratic bill vetoed in March by Bush would have instituted the across - the - board restrictions that McCain originally sought .
But now McCain does n't want them .
And Scherer tells us that is not a flip - flop .
Chiz .
What would McCain have to do to get the traditional media to acknowledge his hard - earned reputation for flip - flopping ?
This article is a start , but its candor is remarkable only because of its rarity .
Update :
By some technological quirk , the original post was an older draft rather than the final one .
I 've now posted the version that should have appeared , which differs only by adding a few further phrases and links in the second and last paragraphs .

A shocking new energy powder designed and marketed to look like cocaine is set to cause a storm of controversy when it hits the shelves in Britain .
The white substance , which contains caffeine and other stimulants , is called I Love Blow and comes in a box complete with a mirror and fake credit card .
It is already on sale in ordinary grocery shops in the USA where angry parents have sending endless complaints to makers of the product and advertising watchdogs .
Now it is feared teens and even young children could start buying the fake drugs if the company finds an outlet in Britain .
A spokesman for I Love Blow revealed : " We have received a tremendous amount of inquiries from the UK and are actively speaking to potential distributors . "
And the company added : " We are currently in the process of getting approved in the Netherlands which gives us approval into most of the European Union . "
Advertising material on the company 's website shows the products heavy reliance on drugs imagery , including pictures of white blocks and lines of chopped up powder I Love Blow , which can already be bought over the internet , is actually a white powder designed to be dissolved in water to make an energy drink but its marketing is completely based on cocaine use .
It has already received outrage among American drugs counselling services and widespread coverage in the US media .
One American substance abuse expert Mike Gimbel said : " It is the most unbelievable product I have ever seen .
" It is the worst I have ever seen in using drugs lingo and drug imagery to sell the product to teenagers and young adults . "
" Blow " is a reference to the street name for class A drug cocaine but the powder actually contains 240 miligrammes of caffeine - more than four cups of strong coffee - and 2,000 miligrammes of the dietry supplement taurine , which is also contained in energy drinks such as Red Bull .
Former police drugs agent Ronald Brogan , who now works for the US drugs charity DARE , said : " One of the ingredients is inisotol , a vitamin type amino acid which looks almost identical to real cocaine because it has the same crystalline snowy appearance .
" It comes from the drugs culture and that 's what it is appealing to . "
But makers of I Love Blow defended the product by saying the marketing was specifically designed to appeal to the over 18's - even though it is freely available in grocery stores , tobacconists , off licences and trendy boutiques .
Imagery on the company 's website in particular appeals to clubbing culture , showing scantily dressed girls , while describing the product as " pure , uncut , energy " .
A spokesman said : " There is currently no US regulation preventing minors from purchasing Blow or any other energy drink so technically we can't prevent minors from purchasing Blow .
" Minors may be exposed to our marketing in much the same way they may exposed to advertisements for tobacco and or alcohol .
" But the bottom line is that our product is intended for adult consumption .
Our distribution into night clubs and adult stores supports our position .
" We absolutely discourage anyone from snorting Blow .
Our package has a clear warning to customers not to snort . "
This has not prevented a flood of complaints and the company receives a barrage of angry emails every day , along with even death threats from some consumers .
The spokesman admitted : " The news has brought attention to the brand and helped sales .
in many stores , we sell a case of Blow every single day .
" Unfortunately , it has provoked groups of people to pressure many retailers to quit selling Blow . "
Blow comes in different sized packaging containing from two to several dozens phials of powder .
It costs £ 5 for a two pack sampler pack and £ 18 for 12 phials , which come in a box shaped to look like a block of cocaine .
The energy drink is described as being " powerfully effective " and has already sparked investigation by food and drink standards agencies in the US , although it is still on sale .
A new textbook published by an entity of the Chinese Communist Party has changed the John 8 story of Jesus and the adulterer .
Originally a story of mercy and grace , the altered version says that Jesus stoned and killed the woman as He asserted that He , too , was a sinner .

If you are new to investing and asset allocation , you might see some recommendations to invest in International Stocks .
Still , every person you ask seems to give you a different answer about what percentage of your portfolio should be in international stocks , and why .
Personally , I have about 30 % to 35 % of my portfolio invested internationally ( or roughly about 40 % of my stocks allocation is non -US ) .
Here is another view showing 40 % of my stocks investments are outside of the US .
How Much International Stock Allocation is Best ?
Let ’s do a quick search …
According to The Balance ’s , How Much International Exposure Should You Have ?
The U.S. accounts for roughly $ 33 trillion of the world ’s $ 68 trillion total stock market value , or about 49 % .
So if you wanted to divvy up your portfolio in the same manner as our imaginary pie , you would simply invest 49 % of your money in U.S. stocks , and the rest in foreign markets … [ but ] most financial advisers recommend putting 15 % to 25 % of your money in foreign stocks , making 20 % a good place to start .
According to Capital Idea ’s
How much international equity do you need ?
At Capital Group , we developed 13 objective - based model portfolios covering a range of investment goals …
Almost half of the model portfolios have an international allocation of 25 % or higher — significantly more than the 14 % of overall assets in international funds and ETFs .
According to Forbes ’ How Most Investors Get Their International Stock Exposure Wrong
On average , U.S. investors hold around 15 % of their stock portfolios in foreign companies , but academic research suggests that the correct level might be at least double that …30 % may be a good starting point for international stock exposure .
Our expert , Larry Swedroe , is even more aggressive with his international stocks recommendation :
I believe investors should consider having 50 percent of their equities in international stocks and have at least 30 percent .
My personal opinion is similar to what Larry suggested ; we should invest about half in US stocks and half in non-US stocks , or at least 30 % of our portfolio should be in international stocks .
Why 50 % International ?
Labor Capital
The first time I heard the term “ Labor Capital ” clearly explained was in an article by Larry Swedroe .
So what is labor capital ?
Basically , it ’s your ability to generate income by trading your labor for money .
Larry advises that investors should consider their labor capital when deciding their asset allocation percentages .
Why You Should n’t Invest in Your Company Stock
One of the most common investing pitfalls is investing a significant amount in your own company .
You should n’t do this is because 100 % of your labor capital is already invested in it .
If you invest a significant amount in your own company , you risk losing both your job and your investment at the same time — i.e. , Enron , Lehman Brothers , etc .
Sure , you could cite Microsoft , Google , and eBay as a counter - point to the above argument , but remember that for every Microsoft , there are hundreds ( if not thousands ) of companies that failed .
However , this should n’t stop you from taking a calculated risk if you are in the right place at the right time .
Why You Should Invest Internationally
The same concept applies to domestic versus international asset allocation .
People who have a significant amount of labor capital domestically should leverage foreign investments to spread out the risk .
For example , if your job is affected by a weak economy , your globally diversified investment should help soften the blow to your financial well being .
Why Younger Investors Could Take More Risk
Lastly , the concept of labor capital explains why a younger investor could take a higher risk with his investment portfolio .
Since his investment is a small portion relative to his income , he could take on more risk and invest in more aggressive investment vehicles .
This allows his investment to grow at the maximum potential , and any loss could be offset by adding more money to the investment .
As the investment grows in proportion to the investor ’s income level , he should limit the loss by seeking less risky investment vehicles .
Bottom Line
Most US investors are probably allocated too high of a percentage in US Stocks and should invest more internationally .
Based on various viewpoints , I believe the ideal percentage of international investments is at least 30 % of your portfolio up to as much as 50 % of your stock allocation .
The hunt for superheavy elements has focused banging various heavy nuclei together and hoping they ’ll stick .
In this way , physicists have extended the periodic table by manufacturing elements 111 , 112 , 114 , 116 and 118 , albeit for vanishingly small instants .
Although none of these elements is particularly long lived , they do n’t have progressively shorter lives and this is taken as evidence that islands of nuclear stability exist out there and that someday we ’ll find stable superheavy elements .
But if these superheavy nuclei are stable , why do n’t we find them already on Earth ?
Turns out we do ; they ’ve been here all along .
The news today is that a group led by Amnon Marinov at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has found the first naturally occuring superheavy nuclei by sifting through a large pile of the heavy metal thorium .
What they did was fire one thorium nucleus after another through a mass spectrometer to see how heavy each was .
Thorium has an atomic number of 90 and occurs mainly in two isotopes with atomic weights of 230 and 232 .
All these showed up in the measurements along with a various molecular oxides and hydrides that form for technical reasons .
But something else showed up too .
An element with a weight of 292 and an atomic number of around 122 .
That ’s an extraordinary claim and quite rightly the team has been diligent in attempting to exclude alternative explanations such as th epresence of exotic molecules formed from impurities in the thorium sample or from the hydrocarbon in oil used in the vacuum pumping equipment ) .
But these have all been ruled out , say Marinov and his buddies .
What they ’re left with is the discovery of the first superheavy element , probably number 122 .
What do we know about 122 ?
Marinov and co say it has a half life in excess of 100 million years and occurs with an abundance of between 1 and 10 x10 ^ - 12 , relative to thorium , which is a fairly common element ( about as abundant as lead ) .
Theorists have mapped out the superheavy periodic table and 122 would be a member of the superheavy actinide group .
It even has a name : eka - thorium or unbibium .
Welcome to our world !
This may well open the flood gates to other similar discoveries .
Uranium is the obvious next place to look for superheavy actinides .
I ’d bet good money that Marinov and his pals are eyeballing the stuff as I write .

Yasmin Hai is an award - winning journalist who has worked on BBC2's Newsnight and documentaries for Channel 4 .
In a brilliant new book - by turns funny , poignant and unsettling - she recalls the challenges and tensions of growing up as a young British Asian in the Seventies and Eighties .
This is the first of three extracts ...
Our parents might have ordered us not to leave the house , but we still found a way to sneak out .
Giggling , we scrambled through the kitchen window , clambered over the garden fence and into the side alley .
Alerted by the noise , our mother appeared at the window .
Battling through huge swathes of white net curtains , which kept on getting caught in her sari , she shouted at us to come back .
And did we listen ?
Well , usually we would have , but not today .
Today we were on a mission .
We ran and ran , serenaded by bursts of excited TV commentary wafting out of the houses on our road .

English rose : Yasmin pictured as a baby with her parents Syed and Noorjehan
When we turned the last bend , the full spectacle , what we had been waiting months to see , finally revealed itself .
Our mouths dropped in awe .
A sea of brightly - coloured banners , waves of red and white crashing into shores of blue and white , was rolling off the motorway , driving right past us .
The noise was deafening , a cacophony of car horns , drumbeats and sirens ; men whistling , chanting , shouting - it was like Disneyland ( not that we had ever been there ) and the Queen 's Silver Jubilee celebrations all rolled into one .
Except that this ecstatic parade was making its way to Wembley Stadium - the great sporting arena in whose shadow we lived .
" ARRRRRSSSSSENAL ! " a spotty guy with long sideburns suddenly cried out drunkenly at us from his car , as his friend exposed his big hairy bottom from the window .
" Did you see that - did you see it ? " cried my brother , Yasir .
Of course we had - it was the rudest thing we had ever witnessed .

Childhood memories : Yasmin ( right ) in the garden with her brother Yasir and sister Farah
Those match days had a special place in our memories - days when people from mysterious faraway places with strange names like Huddersfield , Liverpool , Sheffield and Cardiff came to Wembley to celebrate their team .
It looked like really good fun , we thought , to belong and care for something , even if it was just a football team .
But for us , that was as far as it went .
Just watching .
Never for one minute did we dream of joining in , for we knew it was n't our party to join .
Football was an English people 's game , and we were not English .
But what were we ?
I would spend much of my early life trying to find out .
My father , Syed Samsamul Hai , a former professor of English in Karachi , came to London in 1964 , shortly before his 50th birthday .
Like many other immigrants , he had grown up with an incredibly romantic idea of what Britain was all about .
He arrived in England loaded with facts and figures to help him adjust to his new country .
He knew all the words of the national anthem , he could reel off all the bank holidays ( and give the historical reasons as to why they came about ) and he knew , inside out and back to front , English sayings such as " ' fair play " or " an Englishman 's home is his castle " .
His first home was a cramped bedsit in Holloway , North London , in a house filled with other Asian men like himself .
There was Dr Hasan , training to be an eye surgeon .
Mr Ali , a leading Bengal journalist .
Dr Patel , a heart specialist .
My father found a job as a teacher and in 1969 - after much whispering and match - making by eager in - laws - he travelled back to Pakistan to marry my mother , Noorjehan Begum .
She arrived to join him in Holloway that winter .
I was born a year later at the London Hospital , followed a year after that by my brother .
In 1972 , with a third baby on the way , our family moved from the bedsit in Holloway to a proper house in Wembley .

Baby Yasmin , pictured with her proud father in 1972
With its just - about - affordable terrace houses and postage - stamp front lawns , the area was a much sought - after location for aspirational immigrants .
Moving to Wembley said : " Hello , I 've arrived . "
It was a major step on the road to becoming English .
" Ahh ! " my father and his friends would say admiringly to each other whenever English manners , English clothes , English education or English toys were mentioned .
" English " , it seemed to me as a little girl , was something good , something to be proud of .
In fact , " English " sounded so nice that when I imagined what it could look like , I would see a bright , white light and I would hear the comforting sound of children laughing and playing .
I once told my mother my description of " English " .
She looked at me slightly bemused , before returning her attentions to Farah , my newly - born baby sister .
The discovery that the neighbours on both sides of our house in Wembley were white delighted me .
Perhaps , if I observed them carefully , I might learn what " being English " meant exactly .
Mrs Campbell lived in the house next door to the left , and demonstrated all the signs of being a real English person .
She had grey hair like everyone white in my area , and a beautiful garden full of flowers .
This was very unlike our own garden - which was soon shaping up perfectly as model Asian garden of the year : unkempt , scattered with discarded furniture and strewn with sad roots , a legacy of my mother 's sole attempt to grow some tomatoes .
Mrs Campbell also had a piano - the most important single thing that established her in my mind as English .

Growing up English : A 14 - year - old Yasmin soaks up some sun while lying in grass in Camden
Every Sunday morning , our house would be flooded with Mozart and Beethoven wafting through the adjoining walls .
I would dance around our living room , pretending I was a fairy .
I later found out that Mrs Campbell was not really English .
She was Scottish .
Every now and then her husband , William , wore a skirt when he went out .
" Hello Jazmine , " he 'd cry whenever he saw me .
I 'd wave back .
For some reason I never bothered to correct him about the pronunciation of my name .
Mr Campbell was really nice .
But Mrs Campbell quite clearly did not like us , often telling us that we were an example of how the neighbourhood was going downhill , pointing to our garden as evidence of this .
As we grew a bit older and more spirited , we frequently became the focus of her wrath .
This would often end with her having a full - scale argument with my mother over the garden fence or banging on our walls with a stick to show her displeasure .
My father told us to just ignore her .
But my mother would not let matters lie .
We would often find her , the folds of her sari falling off her shoulder , her hair bun starting to unravel , smashing her biggest cooking spoon against the wall , in response to Mrs Campbell 's banging .
My brother , my sister and I would stand watching her in silence , not daring to distract her .
Only when the banging from Mrs Campbell 's side finished would my mother stop and calmly return to her cooking .
Mrs Sherman , from further down the street , could not have been more different .
She would always smile whenever she saw us .
She was the mother of a very pretty little girl , whose shiny blonde hair always made my mother and her friend Mrs Khan go weak at the knees .
" Like gold thread , " they would say dreamily to each other .
The girl 's name was Britt , after Britt Ekland .
My mother and Mrs Khan named Mrs Sherman , " Jean Wali " .
The Jeans One .

Yasmin in her early days on the job interviewing for TV Asia
Jeans , for them , as for many other Asians , were synonymous with being rebellious , modern , sexually permissive and risque .
They were something only rebels and teenagers wore - bad people .
Asian girls were banned from wearing them .
But here was Mrs Sherman , a responsible mother who always smiled at them , wearing jeans .
Perhaps all those people who wore jeans were not such bad people after all .
It was a revelation to my mother and Mrs Khan .
" I am telling you , " Mrs Khan would cry at my mother ( though only when my father was out of earshot , for she had figured out that he would not always share all her opinions ) , " English people are dirty .
All they think is sex filth !
Sex filth , sex filth ! "
My mother would nod uneasily at Mrs Khan .
Sex was one of those things that she never discussed in public .
Who talked about sex so openly , anyway ?
Well , the English did , according to Mrs Khan , and all the time .
" And they bathe in their own dirty water , " Mrs Khan would say with contempt .
" English , dirty people . "
Mrs Khan 's comments about the English never failed to shock me .
She was the first person I had ever come across who had anything bad to say about them .
And while I felt uneasy listening to her , part of me was intrigued by what she had to say .
" Oh yes , I saw it on TV .
Yes , sitting in bathtub in dirty water .
Have you ever heard of anything so disgusting ? " continued Mrs Khan , her body writhing in disgust .
" I made Ali stand in front of the TV . "
" Standing in front of the TV " was something I had often seen Ali do whenever I was over at the Khans ' watching television .
Whenever a lewd scene came on the screen - and this encompassed everything from a mild kiss to a woman having a baby - three - year - old Ali would be instructed to jump up and dance in front of the screen , his arms flapping madly to ensure our vision was truly obstructed .
Why no one ever thought of just changing channels , I do n't know .
That was the strange thing about Mrs Khan .
While she desperately wanted to be modern and emulate the English , at the same time she could n't help getting all worked up whenever the issue of Western hygiene or morality came up .
You can just imagine the heart attack she nearly had when she saw Fiona McGuinness lean against her garden fence and snog her boyfriend .
( The McGuinnesses lived on the other side of us , and , according to Mrs Campbell , had an even worse garden than ours ) .
Mrs Khan 's net curtains were literally quivering with rage .
In fact , once Fiona and her paramour moved on , Mrs Khan felt obliged to go out and inspect the spot where they had done " it " .
Yasmin only wore ' traditional ' clothes on special occasions such as when she was visiting Pakistan as a 20 - year - old woman
I suppose , looking back , we did n't necessarily have the best British role models in Wembley .
But our family was lucky .
We always had Uncle Aslam and Aunt Hilda to show us the right way to do things .
Uncle Aslam , a former professor and Indian diplomat , was a great friend of my father 's who had married Hilda Hulme , a lecturer at London University and one of Britain 's leading authorities on Shakespeare .
Aunt Hilda and Uncle Aslam lived in a big house in Highgate , and came to lunch with us every fortnight , on Sundays .
On those special days we would wake to the sound of a Hoover whirring somewhere in the background and the musty smell of frying ghee - the clarified butter used in Asian cooking .
While my mother prepared the feast , my father busied himself making the house look nice even though , like most Asian homes of the time , there was not much to show off .
Our living room was papered in yellow - green flock with yellow nylon curtains to match .
The furniture was all second - hand , and filled the room .
On one side was a tired - looking red nylon - upholstered sofabed .
When guests came to visit , we kids had been well trained to hastily direct them to the mustard - coloured fake leather three - piece suite instead .
To get to there , they had to negotiate the brown Formica coffee table .
Still , once seated , they could admire from the settee my father 's much - cherished book collection ; works by Shakespeare , Dickens and Milton jostling for space on the shelf , alongside more practical books like the Urdu / English dictionary , or the hardback guide on How To Write An English Letter .
The centrepiece of the living room was an enormous wardrobe , a must - have for all Asian houses .
Inside , one would find all the family 's belongings : clothes , sheets , pillowcases , an ironing board , books , paperwork , matches , sacks of spare coal and more .
If you still needed space to store away your possessions , then you could always put them into one of the suitcases that permanently resided on top of the wardrobe .
After the vacuuming , my father would arrange the plastic flowers , dust the bookshelves , puff up the cushions and hammer in the red sofa 's springs - all before throwing us into the bathroom so that we were nice and clean for when the honoured guests arrived .
Uncle Aslam and Aunt Hilda were obviously very much in love .
I knew this because whenever they spoke to each other , they always called each other " darling " : " Darling , what do you think ? "
" Will you pass the salt , darling ? " " I agree , darling . "
I did n't know any Asian adult who spoke to their spouse in such a manner .
Well , not in public , anyway .
I must admit that whenever I heard them say the " d " word , I would go red with embarrassment .
But then that was the thing about Uncle Aslam and Aunt Hilda : whenever they came , they brought the English world with them .
Through them we were introduced to a whole host of fun activities : going to the panto at the Old Vic , visiting Windsor Castle during summer holidays , watching Punch and Judy on Brighton beach , making daisy chains in Hyde Park and tossing pancakes on Shrove Tuesday .
I remember how privileged I felt to have an Uncle Aslam and an Aunt Hilda to help us out .
I mean , who did the families at No 15 and No 7 or even Mrs Khan 's daughter Afshan ( even though she was meant to be modern ) have to show them the finer details of being English ?
No one .
Who was going to teach them about Christmas stockings , Enid Blyton , tea and cakes , tiddlywinks , poppy day , table manners ?
No one .
One Sunday , my sister Farah and I carefully laid the table out .
Not the way my mother did it - self - service , Asian style - but in the English way that Aunt Hilda had taught us .
Knives on the right , forks on the left , spoons on top and napkins by the side .
We even laid out a set for my mother who usually ate with her hands .
The table looked proper - to my mind our small kitchen had an air of grace that it had never enjoyed before .
" The table looks so nice , girls , " Aunt Hilda said as she entered the kitchen .
" Oh , and what lovely flowers , " she added , looking at our carefully arranged centrepiece .
Once everyone was seated , we took our cue from Aunt Hilda and put our napkins on our laps .
My uncle tucked his into his neckline , so that it looked like a bib .
But we'd been told that this was fine , too .
My aunt was served first , and then us three children .
But that day , for some reason , instead of picking up the knife and fork that I had so carefully arranged on either side of my plate , I plunged my right hand straight into my food .
My fingers nimbly cut into a piece of chicken , which I then mixed into a bit of rice , just how my mother ( and Uncle Aslam ) often did .
Then I dipped it into the dish of raita - yoghurt , mint , cucumber and spices - before shoving the whole delicious morsel into my mouth .
To my horror , I suddenly heard Aunt Hilda 's voice : " Yasmin , what exactly do you think you are doing ? "
The room had gone silent .
I did n't need to look up to realise what I had just done .
My fingers were coated in bits of rice and chicken .
" You know , only Pakis eat with their hands , " said Aunt Hilda very calmly , without looking up .
My world turned upside down .
I did n't want my Aunt Hilda to think that I was a Paki .
Young as I was , I knew that " Paki " was a bad word , a very upsetting word , that made you scared when you heard it .
I also knew that it had become synonymous with being uncivilised , primitive , savage , ignorant , backwards , uneducated , illiterate and uncultured .
In other words , not English .
Still no one had spoken .
Maybe everyone was reeling with shock at the utterance of that dreaded word at the dinner table .
I felt deeply ashamed .
But Aunt Hilda had n't finished .
" Are you a Paki ? " she asked me .
Her watery blue eyes locked into mine .
I shook my head .
From the corner of my eyes , I could see my father shaking his head in despair .
The word did n't offend him one bit .
I could see he even agreed with her .
" Only Pakis eat with their hands , do n't they ? " my aunt continued .
" I think , madam , that you should go and wash your hands . "
When I returned to the table , Aunt Hilda smiled encouragingly at me .
I smiled back and warmth flooded through me .
Aunt Hilda was so kind - all she really wanted was the best for me , I thought .
When I next looked up again from my food , I noticed that my uncle and mother were using their cutlery , too .
Despite my unfortunate little lapse at the kitchen table , I was soon growing into the perfect little English child .
" It 's a case of when in Rome do as the Romans do , " my father now took to saying to us .
And I began to see things that way , too .
What use were Indian ways in England , anyway ?
Soon I was even trying to look English .
My sister and I stopped wearing Asian clothes unless it was a special occasion .
And to perfect our English look , my father suggested to my mother that she should keep our hair short .
My mother agreed .
She did n't want her daughters to look as if they had been plucked out of some Indian village .
So , one Saturday , off went my long , wiry curls .
When my mother had finished snipping I looked in the mirror and saw a perfect little bob , just like Milly - Molly - Mandy , the English heroine of the book I was reading .
I looked like a proper English girl .
That Saturday , I followed my mother to the shops , desperate to show off my new hairstyle .
Mr Campbell said that it looked really nice .
Afshan asked her mother if she could have her hair cut , too , and Gary McGuinness , Fiona 's brother , burped in my face , which meant he had also noticed .
Someone else seemed to have noticed my transformation .
One day , Mrs Sherman , Jean Wali , invited my mother and me to her house for tea .
I was thrilled .
Britt was the most English girl I had ever seen .
The next day my mother , all dressed up in her best red sari and carrying a box of Quality Street Gold , took me to Mrs Sherman 's house .
" Come in , come in , " our hostess cried , ushering us through the door and greeting my mother like a long - lost best friend .
As we entered Britt 's hallway it suddenly occurred to me that this was the first time that either of us had ever been inside an English home .
Britt 's living room was perfect .
There was no creaky sofa - bed for Mrs Sherman to quickly guide us away from .
There was no clashing colour scheme to give you an instant headache .
And , most notably , there was no wardrobe dominating the centre of the room .
Instead , the whole place was tastefully done up in primrose and maroon , with soft furniture that had been bought new .
" Please , sit down , " Mrs Sherman said , pointing vaguely into the room , so that my mother could make her own choice about where she wanted to sit .
She glanced around the room and chose a mock - Georgian paisley armchair .
But then , suddenly realising that she had forgotten to give Jean Wali the chocolates , she quickly got up again .
" Mrs Sherman , " she announced , presenting her with the box of chocolates as if participating in an elaborate ceremonial ritual .
" Oh , thank you , " said Mrs Sherman .
" But please , call me Faye . "
My mother smiled shyly back , and sat back down on the armchair .
" So what shall I call you , Mrs Hai ? "
Faye said .
My mother looked at her , puzzled .
" Mrs Hai , " she said abruptly .
" Oh , " Faye replied , quickly sitting up , as if she had just been caught off guard .
Then , jollying things along : " So , Mrs Hai , where are you from ?
India ? "
" Pakistan , " my mother replied , just a bit too fast .
I could feel that she knew that she had just made a blunder , but was n't sure what it was .
" Oh , sounds lovely , " Faye enthused .
" My top is Indian , " she said , pointing to it .
My mother nodded , unsure of what to say next .
Those tops were one a penny back in Pakistan .
An awkward silence followed .
" Do you have any other family here ? " Mrs Sherman asked enthusiastically .
I could feel my mother looking at me .
It was my cue to give a translation .
I often had to do this .
It was n't that my mother did n't understand English .
It was just that sometimes the English accent confused her - especially when she got nervous .
So I repeated what Mrs Sherman had just asked .
Before I had a chance to finish , Mrs Sherman was oohing and ahhing at my Urdu language skills .
And then my mother suddenly burst out laughing .
" Oh , silly me , " she now piped up , laughing , having finally figured out her earlier mistake .
" My name is Noor . " '
My mother 's laugh was so infectious that soon Faye was laughing too , which made Britt and me fall about as well .
I suddenly felt very proud of my mother 's ability to entertain .
That evening , my mother and I returned home full of inspiration .
" Mr Hai , you should have seen their kitchen .
It was beautiful , like TV , " my mother chirped .
" We could do that to ours . "
The following Sunday I eagerly recounted the details of our visit to Uncle Aslam and Aunt Hilda .
" Slow down , slow down , " they cried out , as I raced through the high points .
" And do n't eat with your mouth open ! "
Later on that afternoon , when we were in the living room , I overheard my uncle mention Britt 's name again , followed soon afterwards by the words " mother tongue " .
I instantly sat up .
Mother tongue was a thing that I often heard my father and his friends talk about and it always seemed to get them very worked up .
From them I had come to understand that mother tongue was n't a proper language as such ; it was something that Asian people spoke , especially Asian mothers , because they did n't know how to speak English .
I sensed that the conversation that was about to take place was not really for my ears .
My mother came in with some tea and halwa - a traditional sweet - and my father asked her to sit down .
He had something to ask her .
My ears strained to make out what the elders were talking about .
I missed something and then I heard my mother say in English : " This is n't my country .
I not know . "
Then it was Aunt Hilda 's voice .
" The children could always pick Urdu up later - that is , if they are still interested in speaking it .
" Just think about Mrs Sherman .
What must she have thought when Yasmin started speaking in Urdu and then English and then back in Urdu again ? "
My mother began to explain how much Mrs Sherman really liked my Urdu .
But Aunt Hilda interrupted her .
" The problem is not now .
It will be later , " she said .
" Yasmin starts school next autumn - we can't allow her to be confused , " ' Uncle Aslam added .
My mother nodded understandingly .
Uncle Aslam did have a point .
Suddenly , my father sat bolt upright , looking very excited .
He said he had a solution : my mother should carry on speaking to us in Urdu , but we children should only speak to her in English .
By doing this , he explained , my mother could still communicate with her children , but our English - and also her English - would improve .
My mother liked this idea .
Everyone relaxed and the halwa was passed around .
It was settled .
Urdu had to go .
Over the next few months we did indeed gradually stop speaking Urdu .
It was n't hard - I did n't even miss it .
If we ever did slip up , my father was always on hand .
"
Ahh uh , not in Urdu , in English please , " he would say .
We would quickly correct ourselves .
My father was right - our English did improve .
My mother 's English got better , too .
She was very pleased with her progress .
And so were we .
But something else changed once we dropped Urdu , something quite fundamental .
It just became too frustrating trying to explain complex matters of the head and heart to my mother in English .
After dropping Urdu , sadly , she became lost to me for years .
I had n't even started school yet - but learning to be English was already coming at a high price .

WASHINGTON , April 29 : The World Bank chief warned on Tuesday that 100 million people have already been pushed into poverty due to a man-made food crisis while as many as two billion are on the verge of disaster .
“ This is not a natural disaster , ” said Robert B. Zoellick , president of the World Bank .
“ Make no mistake ; there is nothing natural about this .
But for millions of people it is a disaster . ”
He noted that hunger and malnutrition were already the underlying causes of death of over 3.5 million children every year , robbing the future potential of many millions more .
In Washington , a US government commission is investigating claims that big investors who buy large quantities for future trading are largely responsible for the current unprecedented hike in food prices across the world .
The use of corn and soyabean as bio - fuel also contributed to this crisis by moving farmers away from food to cash crops and by driving food prices beyond the reach of common people .
After an annual meeting in Washington earlier this month , the bank warned that the world is facing an unprecedented food crisis which may cause riots and wars if not checked .
“ The next few weeks are critical for addressing the food crisis , ” said Mr Zoellick on Tuesday .
“ For 2 billion people , high food prices are now a matter of daily struggle , sacrifice and for too many , even survival . ”
Mr Zoellick , who issued the statement after attending a meeting of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination in Berne , Switzerland , said the bank believes that already some 100 million people may have been pushed into poverty as a result of high prices over the last 2 years .
For the immediate crisis , the bank urged governments to fill the $ 500 million food gap identified by the UN World Food Programme .
The bank also launched an emergency management programme called the “ new deal , ” pledging to nearly double agricultural lending to Sub - Saharan Africa over the next year to $ 800 million to substantially increase crop productivity .
“ Donors must act now to support the WFP ’s call for some $ 755 million to meet emergency needs , ” said Mr Zoellick .
He also warned donors to fulfil their pledges , noting that roughly $ 475 million have so far been pledged .
“ But pledges wo n’t feed hungry mouths , ” he said .
“ Donors must put their money on the table , and give WFP maximum flexibility – with a minimum of earmarking – to target the most urgent needs . ”
Mr Zoellick said that the proposed ‘ new deal ’ must embrace a short - , medium - and long - term response : support for safety nets such as school feeding , food for work , and conditional cash transfer programmes .
He also called for increased agricultural production ; a better understanding of the impact of bio-fuels and action on the trade front to reduce “ distorting subsidies , ” and trade barriers .
“ We are urging countries not to use export bans .
These controls encourage hoarding , drive up prices and hurt the poorest people around the world who are struggling to feed themselves , ” he said .
The international community , Mr Zoellick added needs to commit to working together to respond with policy initiatives , “ so that this year ’s crisis does n’t become a generation ’s fact of life . ”
Arguments in favour of the legalisation of torture have not lost their capacity to shock .
The fact that US attorneys - general and the senior legal adviser at the state department have said they are in favour of it seems proof to many of America 's slide into barbarism .
In reality , however , their pro-torture arguments are no different from the claims made in favour of " humanitarian war " and of other forms of military intervention - arguments that , unfortunately , have become increasingly popular since the end of the cold war .
Torture and " humanitarian war " are similar in many ways .
Both involve the inflicting of violence in order to force a change of behaviour .
Both are predicated on the assumption of guilt : torture is justified because the victim is said to be a terrorist , or an " illegal combatant " who has committed or is about to commit a terrible crime , while pre-emptive war is justified because a state is said to be " a rogue state " violating international law ( Iraq ) or committing crimes against humanity ( Yugoslavia ) .
It is therefore no coincidence that the US administration that justifies its wars in the name of claims about humanity and its right to liberty also advocates the use of torture to protect these .
Torture and war have been the subject of absolute or near - absolute interdiction in international law .
In the aftermath of the second world war , the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials established the principle that crimes against peace are the supreme crime .
Aggressive war " contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole " , said the Nuremberg judges , who understood that once war starts , war crimes will inevitably follow .
It was therefore better to ban it completely .
This was done by the UN charter , which declared all war , including so - called humanitarian war , illegal .
War is allowed only in the very restricted and clear - cut cases of self - defence and when authorised by the security council .
Torture was similarly banned by UN convention in 1985 .
Any attempt to legalise torture or war was simply regarded as the thin end of the wedge .
Today , however , many people who say they shudder at the abuses committed by the Spanish Inquisition , or by the Americans at Guantánamo , campaign actively in favour of war .
Humanitarian intervention became fashionable as soon as Iraq was bombed in 1991 " to protect the Kurds and the Shia " .
Now the trump question put to anti-interventionists is : " What would you have done about Rwanda ? "
Yet this is the same argument as that advocated by the torturer who says he is trying to save lives .
Activists in favour of international judicial and military intervention denounce peacemaking and amnesty laws as acts of appeasement , and they typically strive to break down antiwar sentiment by getting people to admit that intervention might be justified in some extreme cases .
But if it is , then why not torture too ?
This unwelcome campaign to give war a chance persists in spite of the fact that the very abuses that inspired the universal ban on war in 1945 have indeed been committed by the Americans and their allies in their assault on the old postwar sovereignty - based system of the UN charter .
There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and there was no genocide in Kosovo ( Milosevic was never charged with it ) , but many people still regard war as something at least potentially civilised .
We need instead to renew the deep conviction that seized the collective conscience of mankind in 1945 that the international system , and the ideas that underpin it , should be structured so as to ensure peace at any price .

When cold medicine containing a poison made in China killed nearly 120 Panamanians in 2006 and early 2007 , Americans could take some comfort in the belief that a similar epidemic could never happen here , not with one of the best drug regulatory systems in the world .
Then last spring , hundreds if not thousands of pets died or were sickened in the United States by a Chinese pet food ingredient that contained lethal levels of melamine , an industrial product used to artificially boost protein levels .
That was followed quickly by the discovery that Americans were brushing their teeth with Chinese toothpaste containing a poisonous chemical used in antifreeze .
Still , no Americans died from the chemical .
And then came heparin .
A hugely popular blood thinner used in surgery and dialysis , heparin turned out in some cases to contain a mystery substance that sophisticated lab tests earlier this month determined to be a chemically modified substance that mimics the real drug .
The United States Food and Drug Administration has linked it to 19 deaths and hundreds of severe allergic reactions , though the agency is still investigating whether the contaminant was the actual cause .
What a difference a year makes .
After many near misses and warning signs , the heparin scare has eliminated any doubt that , here and abroad , regulatory agencies overseeing the safety of medicine are overwhelmed in a global economy where supply chains are long and opaque , and often involve many manufacturers .

' Maximum Number of Emails Per Hour Has Been Exceeded ? '
What the hell ?
The head of Golficionados was not pleased .
He called James to get it fixed .
James and team had just launched the web site for Golficionados , a small golf supply business , the day before .
As a part of the contract , James had to set up their email server and create accounts for all 30 users .
He was surprised to be woken up at 6:30 by an angry client call .
He sleepily shambled to his computer and remoted in to the mail server .
Sure enough , when he tried to send an email via the command line , he got a bounce back to his inbox with the same error his client was experiencing .
Damn it , he thought as he looked up the number for the hosting company 's support line .
While he was on hold , enjoying a muzak version of Journey 's " Do n't Stop Believin ' , " he tried to think of all the possible sources of the error .
It could be a configuration issue , but he was ensured by the hosting company that they'd be set up for a reasonable amount of email , and certainly the first people in the office at 6:30 would n't have sent enough email to cause the error .
Finally , a Tier - 1 support tech answered the call , sounding as tired as James .
James explained the issue , and the tech said he'd check the logs .
He was working for a while , interrupting the silence with the occasional " wait , that does n't make sense ... " or " hmm ... why are the inbound messages being counted ? "
A few moments later , the tech exclaimed an Archimedean " Eureka ! "
He 'd been transposing " incoming " and " outgoing " — the email was getting out and had been counted correctly .
" You 've got a mail script or something that 's been exploited , " the tech insisted .
" And spammers have taken advantage of the opening . "
Ridiculous , James thought .
He 'd created a mail script himself , but it read the subject , body , from , and to addresses from a database — there was no potential to exploit the script without changing the code , and the emails were being sent from virtually every account on the server .
James explained this to the tech , but he would n't budge on his diagnosis .
" You 're going to have to change your script .
There 's nothing we can do about this . "
After suffering through the call , James had nothing to show for it .
His phone started ringing off the hook from the client and other coworkers asking how to fix the issue , when it finally dawned on him — the " IT guy " at the client always advocated simplicity over security .
" Let 's give everyone the same password , " he said , taking a page from the Tilde Financial Services book .
" That way , if they have any problems , I can log in and help them . "
It was a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Yes , sharing a password is pretty terrible security .
But as long as a strong password is chosen , at least some risk is mitigated .
So what highly - secure , completely uncrackable password did Golficionados choose ?
" flog . " " Golf " spelled backwards .
But hey , it 's backwards , thereby making it invulnerable to a dictionary atta- oh , wait .
With a password that could be cracked by someone who googled a simple dictionary attack script , someone broke in , hijacked the accounts , and started spamming .
With the admin password ( fortunately , one more complex than " flog " ) , James was able to stop the spamming for a little bit .
He changed passwords as fast as he could type , ending the spam flood .
Moments later , the client called back , now with a new problem — no one could log in to their email .
Rather than talk to the users directly , James sent an email to his boss .
He provided instructions on how each user could select their own unique password , stressed the importance of proper security .
" Fortunately , we 've been through the worst that can happen , and now we know what to do so it wo n't happen again , " he wrote .
The mail server they used did n't have any options to enforce password complexity requirements , but the users could be trusted to follow written policy .
Hopefully .
The following morning , James woke up to a 6:30 phone call again .
" It says something about maximum emails per hour .
I thought you fixed this ! "
The Golficionados lead was even more pissed off than before .
James called support again .
And listened to Journey again .
And finally talked to the first - tier support guy again .
" So did you fix that script ? "
" No , it was n't that , " James insisted .
" But we 're still getting the same error . "
After some convincing , James got the tech to look at the logs again .
Again , " that does n't make sense ... " and " why is it counting these ? " and finally , " Eureka ! "
During the two hours that their server was sending spam , the email addresses on the server were signed up for every spam list imaginable .
The accounts went from spammers to spamees , receiving thousands of messages which the mail server was counting toward the limit .
The hosting company admitted that the software was n't behaving as it should and was only supposed to have limits on outgoing messages , and assured James that the problem would be addressed immediately .
Just overnight , though , the Golficionados lead had received over 2,000 spam messages to his Blackberry , depleting all the available memory and rendering it unusable .
The issue was fixed later that day and email was , for the most part , back to normal .
Still , Golficionados thinks that everything was James 's company 's fault .

PORTSMOUTH , New Hampshire ( Reuters ) - A teary - eyed Hillary Clinton pushed for support on Monday as polls showed her poised for a huge New Hampshire loss to Democratic rival Barack Obama , but the former front - runner vowed to carry on with her presidential quest even if she loses .
Obama warned supporters against overconfidence as a flood of new polls gave him a double - digit lead over Clinton one day before the state casts the next votes in the race for the White House .
Polls will close in the state at 8 p.m. EST on Tuesday , with results expected to begin rolling in quickly .
At a campaign event in Portsmouth , Clinton choked up and grew uncharacteristically emotional when she talked about her reasons for seeking the presidency in the November election .
“ Some of us put ourselves out there and do this , ” she said , her voice breaking and her eyes glistening with tears , “ against some pretty difficult odds and we do it , each one of us , because we care about our country . ”
“ But some of us are right and some of us are wrong , ” she said in a quaking voice .
“ Some of us are ready and some of us are not . ”
The incident resurrected memories of former Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie ’s tears during the 1972 New Hampshire campaign , credited with helping to bring down his front - running bid .
Clinton , who would be the first woman president , promised to stay in the fight until it was over , possibly on “ Super Tuesday ” on February 5 , when 22 states hold nominating contests in the fight to be the party ’s nominee in November .
“ Whatever happens tomorrow , we ’re going on , ” she told the CBS “ Early Show . ”
“ I ’ve always felt that this is going to be a very tough , hard - fought election , and I ’m ready for that , ” added Clinton , who finished third in the first contest in Iowa last week behind Obama and former North Carolina Sen.
John Edwards .
Obama rolled across New Hampshire in an effort to turn out supporters , warning there was still plenty of work needed before Tuesday ’s vote .
“ Do not take this race for granted .
I know we had a nice boost over the last couple of days but elections are funny things , ” Obama , an Illinois senator vying to become the first black U.S. president , told supporters in Claremont .
In the state ’s hard - fought Republican race , Sen. John McCain of Arizona held a more narrow lead over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in new polls .
He scrambled across the state to urge supporters to get out and vote -- and asked them to bring a friend .

‘ I’M GOING TO WIN ’
“ I need you to get out the vote tomorrow , this could be a very close election and it will depend on voter turnout , ” McCain said in Keene .
“ I ’m proud to say I ’m going to win tomorrow . ”
New Hampshire is the next battleground in the state - by - state process of picking Democratic and Republican candidates for November ’s presidential election to succeed President George W. Bush .

A Reuters /C-SPAN / Zogby poll showed Obama with a 10 - point edge on Clinton in the state , 39 percent to 29 percent , as he gained a wave of momentum from his win in Iowa .
McCain was relegated to the political scrap heap last summer after sinking polls and poor fundraising forced him to shake up his staff and recalibrate his campaign , but he now leads Romney by 5 points in New Hampshire .
Clinton and Romney are both under pressure to revive their campaigns after disappointing showings in Iowa , and a second consecutive loss for either could be devastating .
Romney , who at one time led polls in Iowa and New Hampshire , finished second in Iowa to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee .
A wealthy former venture capitalist who has pumped tens of millions of his own money into the race , Romney said he was buoyed by a Sunday night debate where he tangled with McCain and Huckabee over their records on taxes and immigration .
“ Right now it ’s a neck - and - neck race .
But with the debate last night and the support I received from that debate I anticipate winning tomorrow , ” Romney said in Stratham .
Edwards , on a 36 - hour campaign marathon around the state ahead of Tuesday ’s vote , did not respond directly when asked by reporters about Clinton emotional response .
“ I do n’t have anything to say about that .
I think what we need in a commander in chief is strength and resolve , ” Edwards said .
“ Presidential campaigns are tough business , but being president of the United States is also a very tough business . ”
The final day of campaigning in New Hampshire coincided with a bipartisan gathering of political moderates in Oklahoma attended by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , seen as a possible independent candidate for president .
But Bloomberg kept a low profile and repeated his frequent denials that he intended to be a candidate .

A recent column by Katha Pollitt , The Atheist ’s Dilemma , laments how atheists would like to take away what people value and offer nothing in return :
But if all you can offer people is reasons to quit their religion — which also often means their community , their family , their support system and their identity — you ’re not going to have many takers .
For every brilliant angry teenager you strengthen in doubt , there ’s a mosque - or churchful of people who ’ll choose the old - time religion if the only other choice is nothing .
I ca n’t disagree with Pollitt ’s point as she phrases it .
What I want to discuss instead is her apparent misconception that atheism offers no sense of community or social support system .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Admittedly , ten years ago , this would have been a fully valid concern .
As recently as a few years ago , the atheist community was still embryonic , offering plenty of rhetoric and reasoned argument but little in the way of tangible support networks for the nonbeliever .
And it ’s true that we have a lot of work left to do in this area .
But when it comes to building a secular community , we ’ve already made a great deal of progress .
Consider this recent report , Sunday School for Atheists .
The article concerns the Humanist Community Center in Palo Alto , California , which has instituted a weekly class for the children of nonreligious and freethinking parents that gives students instruction in ethics and critical thinking .
Similar community programs in other cities will begin next year .
The Palo Alto Sunday family program uses music , art and discussion to encourage personal expression , intellectual curiosity and collaboration .
One Sunday this fall found a dozen children up to age 6 and several parents playing percussion instruments and singing empowering anthems like I ’m Unique and Unrepeatable , set to the tune of Ten Little Indians , instead of traditional Sunday - school songs like Jesus Loves Me. Rather than listen to a Bible story , the class read Stone Soup , a secular parable of a traveler who feeds a village by making a stew using one ingredient from each home .
The article also notes the humanist summer camp , Camp Quest , which now has programs in five states and Canada , as well as the Carl Sagan Academy in Tampa , Florida , a public charter school dedicated to the principles of humanism .
Other humanist social programs are springing up elsewhere around the country .
The Bostonist recently ran an article on the monthly social events organized by Boston Atheists , which include dining out , conversation and community .
The organizers admit that getting atheists together can be like “ herding cats ” , but they ’ve shown dedication in their work toward building a true community .
This is an effort that always takes time to reach critical mass , whether for atheists or for the religious , but their efforts toward creating an atheist “ congregation ” have already begun to bear fruit .
In addition to these programs and others like them , atheist and freethought groups continue to gain numbers and traction around the country and elsewhere in the world .
Last month I filed my own report from the Center for Inquiry ’s diverse and well - attended 2007 convention .
The Freedom from Religion Foundation recently had its own annual , even larger convention in Wisconsin with over 750 attendees , not to mention their Freethought Radio show going national .
( I covered these developments and others in “ Finding Our Voice “ , this past October . )
And when it comes to the most important aspect of building a secular community , namely raising families , atheists have not been slack either .
There are wonderful books on humanist parenting , such as Parenting Beyond Belief , whose author I interviewed in March .
Matt Cherry of the Institute for Humanist Studies supplies another excellent example , a “ Welcome to the World ” ceremony for his newborn twin daughters , held at the Atheist Alliance International convention last September .
Evidence like this shows that a secular community is taking shape .
In true atheist fashion , it ’s organizing in a fashion that ’s spontaneous , decentralized , and dependent on no single authority , so its growth can be hard to track , but it is nevertheless happening .
Granted , we have a long way left to go until there are freethought organizations even in every city , let alone in every town .
But our movement is still very much brand - new , still finding its voice and defining itself , and the progress we have already made is an important clue that there will be more to come .
Religious people who believe their own spin sometimes erroneously conclude that the “ new atheism ” has nothing to offer but anger and vitriol .
Since they ’re not looking for what they do n’t expect to find , they tend to overlook the nascent secular community , which is why Christian apologists like this one are puzzled by our success :
I wrote earlier this year about the new atheism and Richard Dawkins .
I was hoping his form of aggressive and militant atheism would decline quickly .
It is not happening .
In reality , atheism has much more to offer than just criticism of religion .
Rationalism and naturalism can serve as a worldview in their own right , and the foundation for a true community of like - minded freethinkers .
Inspiring stories like those of Jonathan Edwards , an Olympic athlete and former devoted Christian turned atheist , show that even as a purely individual movement , atheism offers great benefits :
The upheaval of recent months has not left Edwards emotionally scarred , at least not visibly .
“ I am not unhappy about the fact that there might not be a God , ” he says .
“ I do n’t feel that my life has a big , gaping hole in it .
In some ways I feel more human than I ever have .
There is more reality in my existence than when I was full - on as a believer .
It is a completely different world to the one I inhabited for 37 years , so there are feelings of unfamiliarity .
“ There have also been issues to address in terms of my relationships with family and friends , many of whom are Christians .
But I feel internally happier than at any time of my life , more content within my own skin .
Maybe it is because I am not viewing the world through a specific set of spectacles . ”
But in a true secular community , this sense of happiness and purpose could well be multiplied manyfold .
We have all the reason in the world to encourage this budding society of free minds , and do our best to see that it continues to flourish and grow .
Most Secure Webhost
In every industry , privacy is a vital factor .
If your customer is exchanging confidential or financial information with your website that includes purchasing a product or using subscription services , all these information should be secure and well protected .
This will result in the success of your business .
That ’s why , owners are now very much concerned about site ’s security , particularly for secure hosting .
What is Secure Hosting
A secure web hosting company , clients access their website by using the secure socket layer protocol ( SSL ) .
SSL is a very advanced technology which is used to encrypt data transmitted between a web browser and your site .
Through this encryption data can be protected from attackers .
In case of any attack , without the private key , they will not be able to interpret inside your site .
If you go for secure web hosting , you will get to place SSL certificate on pages of your site .
This will indicate to all visitors about site protection by data encryption process .
You will get the double benefit of secure encryption protection and reputation for having this unique technology .
Importance of Secure Hosting :
Nowadays every business is using secure hosting to catch the attention of the customers .
Clients are now very much worried about their online privacy .
For this , customers go for SSL certified hosting providers to secure and protect the data .
So , the question is ‘ who uses Secure Hosting ? ’
Almost all eCommerce businesses are likely to be safe and sound .
Whenever data is transmitted over the net between a server and the end user , that transaction is expected to be secure .
Transmission of data includes :
Financial or Billing information - Loans , credit card , credit card number and liens
Personal information - Name , DOB , address and social security number
Confidential correspondence - Private health or education communication , instant messaging , live chat , support requests and more .
Some things to consider before choosing secure web host :
SSL Certificates Comparison :
SSL certificate is usually free with signup and offers all protections .
The popular and best secure hosting providers will require you to have a unique IP address and separate SSL certificate for each subdomain that you wish to set up safely .
On the other hand , secure web hosts offer wildcard SSL certificates which cover all subdomains for the whole domain .
Shared SSL certificate is shared with other users on the same server .
On the other hand , private SSL certificate signifies domain or subdomain security on the secure and dedicated server .
Visitors will see warning message pop up to recommend that certificate may not be reliable .
Therefore , signed SSL certificate will provide you the instant trustworthiness .
SFTP ( secure file transfer protocol ) :
SFTP is more secure than FTP ( file transfer protocol ) .
Always make sure that this option is available via your web host .
Backups :
Regular backup is necessary to secure your site in case of an issue .
Most hosts offer a tool in control panel which allows backing up your own site .
A sound backup procedure is a plus point to secure sites .
Server maintenance :
Hosting providers should make sure server is maintained to ensure attacks are limited .
List of hosting providers who offer secure hosting for their customers .
Conclusion :
Therefore , if you are running personal site or large scale business , protection is vital in both the cases .
Security is the main concern nowadays .
Lack of security can be a risk to any business and result in loss of income or identify theft .
So , it is must understand the concept of security you are looking for and which host will satisfy you .
The above may seem like a bold statement , but I believe it ’s true .
The United States of America is operated and kept alive by the American people , not the politicians that rape , pillage , and spend our money and our most precious resource , America ’s brave soldiers that fight these illegal wars .
Many of our “ volunteer military ” are not in the fight because of patriotism - but to support their families and seek GI benefits that will allow them to attend college when they leave the armed services .
Our economy is already in ruins , food and gas are becoming luxuries to the poorest families in America , and the middle - class is disappearing faster than Bush ’s approval ratings .
Millions of us are facing foreclosure , while the oil companies post profits that are obscene - and still receive huge government subsidies .
The average American is now becoming aware that Bush and Cheney are war criminals , yet Congress refuses to impeach them , even though there is a mountain of evidence that supports their immediate impeachment , indictment , and incarceration for breaking our own and international laws .
Congress is worthless , and as bad as Bush ’s ratings are , Congress rates worse , symptoms that the public has lost respect and hope that any of them will find the courage to do what ’s right !
The only thing left to stop the destruction of our country and another war is the people themselves - but first , they have to know what to do .
As we stated over a year ago , its time that America ’s premier alternative news sites , Blogs , and every individual on the Internet get busy and come together in solidarity to take back our country .
Why , as we face the utter destruction of our economy and the American way of life do we refuse to come together in solidarity ?
We have witnessed other countries fighting bloody wars to seek democracy , yet we , who used to have it all , refuse to lift a finger in a meaningful way that would bring about change ?
Have we forgotten who we are - or how powerful we are when we speak as one ?
I am not a radical ; I do n’t believe that it takes violence to retrieve our democracy - but it does take all of us to work together , and the only way that it can be accomplished is if those that disseminate the news and commentary on the Internet band together and tell the people “ how ” we can force Congress to take action .
Yes , I said force Congress to impeach Bush , Cheney , and Pelosi , a triple impeachment - and one that will send a message to the next President that believes that his will is more important than that of the people he is supposed to serve .!
It is vital that we understand what a war with Iran would mean to our country ;
Gas would likely reach five dollars or more per gallon , raising our food prices even more and would cause unimaginable suffering to the American people .
Food will become scarce , and the food riots we hear of in other countries would surely visit us with a vengeance .
The draft would likely be reinstated , and even more of America ’s sons and daughters will die in a war that is the desire of Bush , Cheney , and Israel , not the American people .
The Iraq War and mismanagement by the Bush administration has already brought us to our knees ; what would another war with Iran bring to the American people ?
What if Bush ’s folly escalates to World War III ?
What then ?
There has never been a time in the history of this nation when America has been in this much danger , all brought on by Neo- conservatives that have infiltrated our government - and still , Congress refuses to protect the people .
There is a time for talk and there is a time for action , and now it ’s time that “ we the people ” take the action necessary to force Congress to impeach all three that were named above , among several others - and then , if we want to regain any semblance of respect throughout the global community , hand all of them over to The Hague to be judged by the international community as the war criminals they are !
Be sure of one fact ;
The Hague has cells awaiting all of them , and all it takes is for the American people to act in unison to make it a reality instead of a dream !
Remember , only a dreamer can have a dream come true !
How do we accomplish this seemingly impossible feat that Congress ca n’t do themselves ?
Actually , it ’s relatively easy ; however it will take the courage and tenacity of those whom we look to for our news and commentary - and if they refuse to help , then , like Congress , their words and actions ring hollow as well …
Imagine The Huffington Post , BuzzFlash , Op - Ed News , Capitol Hill Blue , Raw Story , AfterDowningStreet.org , Rense.com , The BRAD BLOG , The Daily KOS , The Smirking Chimp , TV News and Lies , Alex Jones , Michael Moore , and the huge amount of Hollywood celebrities that could contribute to this cause !
What if they all published editorials in unison calling for a general strike that would effectively halt all commerce and services throughout the United States ?
How would Congress react then ?
What choice would they have ?
This country cannot operate without you and me , the “ average people ” who do n’t have a voice in government - but who could effectively , in a non-violent manner , shut - down this country until Congress is forced to do their damn jobs !
We could configure the strike to keep emergency services operating as usual , but non-essential transportation , stores , you name it - could all be shut - down IF all of the above sites would come together in a show of solidarity to save the American way of life .
We have the ability to force Congress to do their jobs , but in order to do so , those who are constantly going off in different directions would have to agree that our future is more important than each of their private concerns , which do nothing to stave - off this war which appears to be approaching sometime before the November elections .
I have heard on numerous occasions how cowardly the French are , and I ’ve also heard the nasty jokes that state the French never fight , but always surrender - just as our Congress has done !
Reality tells another story , one of protests , strikes and civil disobedience , traits that once were the hallmark of our democracy , yet seem to have been forgotten as we slide into fascism and complacency .
I wrote about this subject two years ago and was ignored ; in fact , it actually angered some of the sites in question ; why I do n’t know , except that none were willing to agree on anything of substance - mirroring Congress in their indecision and abdication of their sworn duty to serve the people who voted them into office .
I love my country and consider myself to be a patriot , and witnessing the country you love sliding into a police state is heartbreaking as well as frightening - but if we would only stop the partisan bickering for this one moment , we could make history , and with a little luck , survive the Bush administration , and we may actually live to see justice being served as it should .
All of you who are reading this post can make a difference .
Paste and copy this article and send it to your favorite site and ask them to participate in organizing a general strike - not two months from now , but as quickly a it can be organized .
If the majority of the Liberal / Progressive community would participate and urge all of the sites to join - in in solidarity , Bush and Cheney could be facing impeachment as soon as a couple of weeks from now , if not sooner .
This is our country , and it does n’t belong to the lobbyists , the politicians , or the corporations who believe they have the right to control our lives .
This is a fight for our freedom as well as our children ’s future .
It ’s also important to remember that paid government propagandists have infiltrated the Digg Community , Reddit , and almost all of the social networking sites to spread disinformation and propaganda .
Pay them no attention .
They are liars and traitors , each and every one of them who support this illegal government - and believe me , they will attempt to lead you in another direction , one that will guarantee that Bush and Cheney succeed in destroying the country that most of us love and cherish .

イノベーションに関する勘違い
Google Tech Talks で「 The Myths of Innovation 」 が公開されていました 。 「 The Myths of Innovation ( 和訳:イノベーションの神話 ) 」という本の著者による講演です。
イノベーションに関する勘違いや、イノベーションとは何かを説明しています。
非常に面白い内容でした。
以下、要約です。 誤訳などが含まれている可能性があるので、是非ビデオもご覧下さい。
1. 歴史
イノベーションと言う単語は好きではない
イノベーションの意味は 「 初めて何かを行ったり紹介したりすること」
イノベーションは相対的なものだ
例えば、私が全く新しいアルゴリズムなどをここで紹介すれば、会場にいるみなさんからは私はイノベーターに見える。
今度、この会場にいた人が、それに関して別の場所で話せば、それを話した人がイノベーターに見える。
そして、同様のことが繰り返される。
知っているような内容であればイノベーティブだと思わない。
ただ、その内容を知らない人が同じ話を聞くとイノベーティブだと思う。
例えば、24時間電気が通電していない地域は世界で非常に多くある。
そのような地域で24時間通電を実現することはイノベーションになる。
エンジニアの多くは、イノベーションの良し悪しは定義可能で、優劣はつけられると信じている。
しかし、それは本当ではない。
今まで調べてわかった結果だが、イノベーションはいつでもソーシャルなものである。
対象としている相手に対するものであり、適応しようとしている相手に左右される。
イノベーションと は
最初にやること ？
より良いことか ？
勝者になったことか ？
この単語を使っている相手によって、どのニュアンスで使っているかが異なる。 結構ファジーな言葉。
色々なミーティングでイノベーションという単語を聞くが、意味を確認した方が良い

The Long , Painful History of Time
Erik Naggum
Naggum Software
Oslo , Norway
ABSTRACT
The programming language Common Lisp offers a few functions to support the concept of time as humans experience it , including GET - UNIVERSAL -TIME , ENCODE -UNIVERSAL -TIME , DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME , and GET - DECODED -TIME .
These functions assume the existence of a timezone and a daylight saving time regime , such that they can support the usual expression of time in the environment in which a small number of real - life applications run .
The majority of applications , however , need more support to be able to read and write dates and times , calculate with time , schedule events at specific clock times daily , and work with several time zones and daylight saving time regimes .
This paper discusses some of the problems inherent in processing time suitable to humans and describes a solution employed by the author in a number of applications , the LOCAL - TIME concept .
0 Introduction
The measurement of time has a very long history , dating back to the first records of human civilization .
Yet , the archeological evidence suggests that the concept of time evolved no further than ordinary human needs , and any notion of time remained confined to a fairly short time frame , such as a lifetime past and future .
Expressions of measurements of time were brief and imprecise , rife with the numerous and nefarious assumptions humans bring into their communication , consistent with our tendency to suppress information believed to be redundant .
For instance , everyone knows which century they are in or that some two - digit year refers to .
Until computers came along , the assumptions held by people were either recoverable from the context or shared by contemporary communicators .
After computers came to store information for us , we still held onto the context as if the computers were as able to recover it as we are .
Quite obviously , they are n't , and in about three months , we will see whether other humans were indeed able to recover the context left unstated by other humans when they wrote down their dates with two digits and assumed it would never be a problem .
The infamous Y2 K problem is one of the few opportunities mankind will get to tally the costs of lack of precision in our common forms of communication .
The lesson learned will not be that our notations of time need to be precise and include their context , unless the general public stops refusing to be educated in the face of dire experience .
That so much attention has been granted this silly problem is fortunate for those of us who argue against legacy notations of time .
However , the inability of most people to deal with issues of such extraordinary importance when they look most harmless means that those who do understand them must be inordinately careful in preparing their information such that loss of real information can be minimized .
The basic problem with time is that we need to express both time and place whenever we want to place some event in time and space , yet we tend to assume spatial coordinates even more than we assume temporal coordinates , and in the case of time in ordinary communication , it is simply left out entirely .
Despite the existence of time zones and strange daylight saving time regimes around the world , most people are blithely unaware of their own time zone and certainly of how it relates to standard references .
Most people are equally unaware that by choosing a notation that is close to the spoken or written expression of dates , they make it meaningless to people who may not share the culture , but can still read the language .
It is unlikely that people will change enough to put these issues to rest , so responsible computer people need to address the issues and resist the otherwise overpowering urge to abbreviate and drop context .
This paper is almost all about how we got ourselves into trouble by neglecting to think about time frames longer than a human lifetime , how we got all confused by the difference between time as an orderly concept in science and a mess in the rest of human existence , and how we have missed every opportunity to fix the problems .
This paper proposes a fix to the most glaring problems in a programming language that should not have been left without a means to express time for so long .
1 Scientific Time
How long does it take the earth to face the Sun at the same angle ?
This simple question has a definite and fairly simple scientific answer , and from this answer , we can work out a long list of answers about what time is and how we want to deal with astronomical events .
The SI units ( Système International d'Unités ) , probably better known as metric units , define the second as the fundamental unit of time , and this , too , has a very good scientific definition .
Time progresses continuously and is only chopped up into units for human convenience .
Agreement on a single reference point within a scientific community has always been easy , and it is useful to count basic units , like days in the ( Modified ) Julian Day system , or seconds since some arbitrary epoch in computers .
Scientific time also lends itself to ease of computation ; after all , that is what we do with it .
For instance , we have a world - wide standard for time , called the Coordinated Universal Time , or UTC .
( The C used to be subscripted , UT C , just like the digits in UT 0 and UT 1 which are universal time concepts with slightly different reference points , but UTC has become the preferred form . )
Scientific time naturally has origin 0 , as usual with scientific measures , even though the rest of human time notations tend to have origin 1 , the problems of which will be treated below .
Most computer - related references to time deal with periods of time , which lend themselves naturally to use scientific time , and therefore , it makes sense to most programmers to treat the period of time from some epoch until some other time to be the best way to express said other time .
This is the path taken by Common Lisp in its UNIVERSAL - TIME concept , with time 0 equal to 1900 - 01-01 00:00:00 UTC , and the Unix time concept , with time 0 equal to 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC .
This approach works well as long as the rules for converting between relative and absolute time are stable .
As it turns out , they are not .
Not all languages and operating systems use this sensible an approach .
Some have used local time as the point of reference , some use decoded local time as the reference , and some use hardware clocks that try to maintain time suitable for direct human consumption .
There is no need to make this issue more complex than it already is , so they will not be granted any importance .
2 Political Time
How long does it take for the clock to show the same value ?
The answer to this question is only weakly related to the time the planet takes to make a complete rotation .
Normally , we would say the political rotation takes 24 hours , just like the scientific , but one day out of the year , it takes only 23 hours , and another day out of the year , it takes 25 hours , thanks to the wonders of daylight saving time .
Which days these are is a decision made by politicians .
It used to be made by the military to conserve fuel , but was taken over by labor unions as a means to get more daylight in the workers ' spare time , and most countries have gone through an amazing list of strange decision - making in this area during this century .
Short of coming to their senses and abolishing the whole thing , we might expect that the rules for daylight saving time will remain the same for some time to come , but there is no guarantee .
( We can only be glad there is no daylight loan time , or we would face decades of too much daylight , only to be faced with a few years of total darkness to make up for it . )
Political time is closely related to territory , power , and collective human irrationality .
There is no way you can know from your location alone which time zone applies at some particular point on the face of the earth : you have to ask the people who live there what they have decided .
This is very different from scientific time , which could tell you with great ease and precision what the mean sidereal time at some location should be .
In some locations , this is as much as three hours off from what the local population has decided , or has had decided for them .
The Sun is in zenith at noon at very few places on earth , instead being eclipsed or delayed by political decisions where the randomness never ends .
Yet , it is this political time that most people want their computers to produce when they ask for the date or the time of day , so software will have to comply with the randomness and produce results consistent with political decisions .
The amount of human input into this process is very high , but that is the price we have to pay for our willingness to let politicians dictate the time .
However , once the human input has been provided , it is annoying to find that most programming languages and supporting systems do not work with more than one timezone at a time , and consequently do not retain timezone information with time data .
The languages we use tend to shape the ideas we can talk about .
So , too , the way we write dates and times influence our concepts of time , as they were themselves influenced by the way somebody thought about time a long time ago .
Calendars and decisions like which year is the first , when the year starts , and how to deal with astronomical irregularities were made so long ago that the rationale for them has not survived in any form , but we can still look at what we have and try to understand .
In solving the problem of dealing with time in computers , a solid knowledge of the legacy we are attending to is required .
3 Notations for Time
The way we write down time coordinates appears to have varied little over the years in only one respect : we tend to write them differently depending on the smallest perceived unit of time that needs to be communicated .
For instance , it seems sufficiently redundant to include AD or BC in the dates of birth of contemporary people that they are always omitted .
Should some being with age >2000 years come to visit us , it is also unlikely that writing its date of birth correctly would be a pressing concern .
However , we tend to include these markers for the sign of the year when the possibility of ambiguity reaches a certain level as determined by the reader .
This process is itself fraught with ambiguity and inconsistency , but when computers need to deal with dates this far back , it does not seem worthwhile to calculate them in terms of standard reference points , so we can ignore the problem for now , but may need to deal with it if a system of representation is sufficiently useful to be extended to the ancient past .
Not only do we omit information that is deemed redundant , it is not uncommon for people to omit information out of sheer laziness .
A particularly flagrant example of the omission of information relative to the current time is the output from the Unix ls program which lists various information about files .
The customary date and time format in this program is either month - day - hour - minute or month - day - year .
The cutoff for tolerable precision is six months ago , which most implementations approximate with 180 days .
This reduction in precision appears to have been motivated by horizontal space requirements , a necessary move after wasting a lot of space on irrelevant information , but for some reason , precision in time always suffers when people are short of space .
The infamous Y2 K problem , for instance , is said to have started when people wanted to save two columns on punched cards , but there is strong evidence of other , much better alternatives at the time , so the decision to lose the century was not predicated on the need for space , but rather on the culturally acceptable loss of information from time coordinates .
The details of this mess are sufficiently involved to fill a separate paper , so the conclusion that time loses precision first when in need or perceived need of space should be considered supported by the evidence .
3.1 Natural - Language Notations
People tend to prefer words to numbers , and go out of their way to name things .
Such names are frequently symbolic because they are inherently arbitrary , which implies that we can learn much from studying what people call numbers .
( French has a number which means arbitrarily many : 36 , used just like English umpteen , but it is fascinating that a number has meaning like that .
Other numbers with particular meaning include 69 , 666 , and 4711 .
The number 606 has been used to refer to arsphenamine , because it was the 606th compound tested by Paul Ehrlich to treat syphilis . )
In the present context , the names of the Roman months have been adopted by all Western languages , while the names of days of the week have more recent and diverse names , probably because weeks are a fairly recent concept .
Using names for numeric entities complicates processing a natural language specification of time tremendously , yet this is what people seem more comfortable with .
In some cultures , months have only names , while in others , they are nearly always written as numbers .
The way the names of months and the days of the week are abbreviated varies from language to language , as well , so software that wants to be international needs to maintain a large repository of names and notations to cater to the vanity of human users .
However , the names are not the worst we have to deal with in natural language notations .
Because dates and times are frequently spoken and because the written forms are often modeled after the spoken , we run into the problem of ordering the elements of time and the omission of perceived redundancy becomes a much more serious problem , because each language and each culture have handled these problems so differently .
The orders in use for dates are
year - month - day
day - month - year
month - day - year
day - month
month - day
year - month
month - year
As long as the year is zero or greater than 31 or the day greater than 12 , it is usually possible to disambiguate these orders , but we are about to experience renewed problems in 2001 , when the year will probably be still be written with two digits by some people regardless of the experience of mankind as a whole at 2000 - 01-01 00:00:00 .
We live in interesting times , indeed .
Time is fortunately specified with a uniform hour - minute - second order , but the assumption of either AM or PM even in cultures where there is no custom for their specification provides us with an ambiguity that computers are ill equipped to deal with .
This and other historic randomness will be treated in full below .
Most of the time people refer to is in their immediate vicinity , and any system intended to capture human - friendly time specifications will need to understand relative times , such as yesterday , this time tomorrow , two hours ago , in fifteen minutes .
All of these forms vary considerably from culture to culture and from language to language , making the process of reading these forms as input non-trivial .
The common forms of expression for periods of time is also fuzzy in human communication , with units that fail to convert to intervals of fixed length , but instead are even more context - sensitive than simple points in time .
3.2 Language - Neutral Notations
Various attempts have been made to overcome the problems of human - to - human forms of communication between human and machine and in machine - to - machine communication .
Machine - to - machine communication generally falls into one of three categories :
Naïve binary Formatted or encoded binary Character sequences ( text )
Binary formats in general suffer from a huge number of problems that there is little value in discussing here , but it is worth noting that a binary format that is as robust as a textual format is frequently just as verbose as a textual format , so in the interest of robustness and legibility , this discussion will restrict itself to textual formats
Obviously , a language - neutral notation will have to consist of standardized elements and possibly codes .
Fortunately , a standard like this already exists : ISO 8601 .
Since all the work with a good language - neutral notation has already been done , it would be counter - productive in the extreme to reinvent one .
However , ISO 8601 is fairly expensive from the appropriate sources and also chock full of weird options , like most compromise standards , so in the interest of solving some problems with its use , only the extended format of this standard will be employed in this paper .
A language - neutral notation will need to satisfy most , if not all , of the needs satisfied by natural language notations , but some latitude is necessary when dealing with relative times -- after all , the purpose of the language - neutral notation is to remove ambiguity and make assumptions more if not completely explicit .
ISO 8601 is sufficient to cover these needs :
absolute positions in time
duration
period with absolute start and end
period with absolute start or end and duration
The needs not covered are mostly related to user convenience with respect to the present and absolute positions in time in its immediate vicinity .
E.g. , the omission of the date when referring to yesterday , tomorrow , the most recent occurrence of a time of day , and the forthcoming occurrence of a time of day .
To make this more convenient , the notation employed in the LOCAL - TIME concept described below has special syntax for these relative times .
The full , extended format of ISO 8601 is as follows :
1999-10-11T11:10:30,5-07:00
The elements are , in order :
the year with four digits a hyphen ( omitted in the basic format ) the month with two digits a hyphen ( omitted in the basic format ) the day of month with two digits the letter T to separate date and time the hour in the 24 - hour system with two digits a colon ( omitted in the basic format ) the minute with two digits a colon ( omitted in the basic format ) the second with two digits a comma the fraction of the second with unlimited precision a plus sign or hyphen ( minus ) to indicate sign of time zone the hours of the time zone with two digits a colon ( omitted in the basic format ) the minutes of the time zone with two digits
The rules for omission of elements are quite simple .
Elements from the time of day may be omitted from the right and take their immediately preceding delimiter with them .
Elements from the date may be omitted from the left , but leave the immediately following delimiter behind .
When the year is omitted , it is replaced by a hyphen .
Elements of the date may also be omitted from the left , provided no other elements follow , in which case they take their immediately preceding delimiter with them .
The letter T is omitted if the whole of the time of day or the whole of the date are omitted .
If an element is omitted from the left , it is assumed to be the current value .
( In other words , omitting the century is really dangerous , so I have even omitted the possibility of doing so . )
If an element is omitted from the right , it is assumed to cover the whole range of values and thus be indeterminate .
Every element in the time specification needs to be within the normal bounds .
There is no special consideration for leap seconds , although some might want to express them using this standard .
A duration of time has a separate notation entirely , as follows :
P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S >
P7W
The elements are , in order :
the letter P to indicate a duration the number of years the letter Y to indicate years the number of months the letter M to indicate months the number of days the letter D to indicate days the letter T to separate dates from times the number of hours the letter H to indicate hours the number of minutes the letter M to indicate minutes the number of seconds the letter S to indicate seconds
or for the second form , usually used alone
the letter P to indicate a duration the number of weeks the letter W to indicate weeks
Any element ( number ) may be omitted from this specification and if so takes its following delimited with it .
Unlike the absolute time format , there is no requirement on the number of digits , and thus no requirement for leading zeros .
A period of time is indicated by two time specifications , at least one of which has to be absolute , separated by a single solidus ( slash ) , and has the general forms as follows :
start / end
start / duration
duration / end
the end form may have elements of the date omitted from the left with the assumption that the default is the corresponding value of the element from the start form .
Omissions in the start form follow the normal rules .
The standard also has specifications for weeks of the year and days of the week , but these are used so rarely and are aesthetically displeasing so are gracefully elided from the presentation .
When discussing the read / write syntax of the LOCAL - TIME concept below , the above formats will be employed with very minor modifications and extensions .
4 Geography
It is amusing that when people specify a time , they tend to forget that they looked at their watches or asked other time - keeping devices at a particular geographic location .
The value they use for current time is colored by this location so much that the absence of a location at which we have the current time , renders it completely useless -- it could be specified in any one of the about 30 ( semantically different ) timezones employed around the planet .
This is particularly amusing with statements you find on the web :
This page was updated 7/10/99 2:00 AM .
This piece of information is amazingly useless , yet obviously not so to the person who knows where the machine is located and who wrote it in the first place .
Only by monitoring for changes to this statement does it have any value at all .
Specifications of time often has this purpose , but the belief that they carry information , too , is quite prevalent .
The only thing we know about this time specification is that it was made in the past , which may remove most of the ambiguity , but not quite all -- it could be 1999 - 07 - 10 .
The geographical origin of a time specification is in practice necessary to understand it .
Even with the standard notation described above , people will want to know the location of the time .
Unfortunately , there is no widely adopted standard for geographical locations .
Those equipped with GPS units may use ICBM or grid coordinates , but this is almost as devoid of meaning as raw IP addresses on the Internet .
Above all , geography is even more rife with names and naming rules that suffer from translation than any other information that cries for a precise standard .
Time zones therefore double as indicators of geographical location , much to the chagrin of anyone who is not from the same location , because they use names and abbreviations of names with local meaning .
Of course .
Also , the indication of the daylight saving time in the timezone is rather amusing in the probably unintentional complexity they introduce .
For instance , the Middle or Central European Time can be abbreviated MET or CET , but the summer time as it is called here is one of MEST , CEST , MET DST , or CET DST .
Add to this that the S for summer in the former two choices is often translated , and then we have the French .
The only good thing about geography is that most names can be translated into geographical coordinates , and a mapping from coordinates to time zone and daylight saving time rules is fairly easy to collect , but moderately difficult to maintain .
This work has been done , however , and is distributed with most Unix systems these days , most notably the free ones , for some value of free .
In order for a complete time representation to work fully with its environment , access to this information is necessary .
The work on the LOCAL - TIME concept includes an interface to the various databases available under most Unix systems .
5 Perspective
An important part of the Y2 K problem has been that the information about the perspective on the time stored was lost .
Trivialities like the fact that people were born in the past , bills were paid in the past and fall due in the future , deliveries will be made in the future , etc , and most of the time , meaningful specifications of time have hard boundaries that they cannot cross .
Few people have problems with credit cards that expire 02/02 , say .
This was very obviously not 1902 - 02 .
The perspective we bring to time specifications usually last beyond the particular time specified .
When dealing with a particular time , it is therefore necessary to know , or to be told , whether it refers to the past or the future , and whether the vantage point is different from the present .
If , for instance , a delivery is due 10/15/99 , and it fails to be delivered that day , only a computer would assume that it was now due 2099 - 10 - 15 .
Unfortunately , there is no common practice in this area at all , and most people are satisfied with a tacit assumption .
That is in large part what caused the Y2 K problem to become so enormously expensive to fix .
Had the assumed , but now missing information been available , the kinds of upgrades required would have been different , and most likely much less expensive .
There is more to the perspective than just past and future , however .
Most computer applications that are concerned with time are so with only one particular time : the present .
We all expect a log file to be generated along with the events , and that it would be disastrous if the computer somehow recorded a different time than the time at which an event occurred , or came back to us and revised its testimony because it suddenly remembered it better .
Modern society is disproportionately dependent on a common and coordinated concept of the present time , and we have increasingly let computers take care of this perspective for us .
Telephones and computers , both voice and electronic radio broadcasts , watches , wall clocks , the trusty old time clocks in factories where the workers depended on its accuracy , they all portray this common concept of a coordinated understanding of which time it is .
And they all disagree slightly .
A reportedly Swiss saying goes : A man with one clock knows the time .
A man with two clocks does not .
Among the many unsolved problems facing society is an infrastructure for time - keeping that goes beyond individual , uncoordinated providers , and a time - keeping technology that actually works accurately and is so widely available that the differences in opinion over what time it is can be resolved authoritatively .
The technology is actually here and the infrastructure is almost available to everyone , but it is not used by the multitude of purported sources of the current time .
On the Internet , NTP > ( the Network TIme Protocol ) keeps fully connected systems in sync , and most telecommunications and energy providers have amazingly accurate clocks , but mere mortals are still left with alarming inaccuracies .
This fact alone has a tendency to reduce the interest in accurate representation of time , for the obvious reason that the more accurate the notation and representation , the less trustworthy the value expressed .
6 Calculations with Time
The notation for duration and periods bounded by one absolute position in time and one duration described above have intuitive meaning , but when pressed for actual meaning , suffer somewhat from the distressing effects of political time .
For instance , a period of one year that starts 1999 - 03- 01 would end on 2000 - 02 - 29 or 2000 - 03-01 with equal probability of being correct .
More common problems occur with the varying lengths of months , but those are also more widely understood and the heuristics are in place to deal with them .
Less obvious is the problem of adding one day to a particular time of day .
This was the original problem that spurred the development of the LOCAL - TIME concept and its implementation .
In brief , the problem is to determine which two days of the year the day is not 24 hours long .
One good solution is to assume the day is 24 hours long and see if the new time has a different timezone than the original time .
If so , add the difference between the timezones to the internal time .
This , however , is not the trivial task it sounds like it should be .
The first complication is that none of the usual time functions can report the absolute time that some timezone identifier will cause a change in the value of timezone as applicable to the time of day .
Resolving this complications means that we do not have to test for a straddled timezone boundary the hard way with every calculation , but could just compare with the edge of the current timezone .
Most software currently does this the hard way , including the Unix cron scheduler .
However , if we accept the limitation that we can work with only one timezone at a time , this becomes much less of a problem , so Unix and C people tend to ignore this problem .
The second complication is that there really is no way around working with an internal time representation in any calculation -- attempts to adjust elements of a decoded time generally fail , not only because programmers are forgetful , but also because the boundary conditions are hard to enumerate .
Most often , however , calculations fall into two mutually exclusive categories :
calculations with the time of day possibly including days calculations with the date with no concept of a time of day
When time is represented internally in terms of seconds since an epoch , only the former is easy -- the latter is irrevocably linked with all the timezone problems .
The latter may in particular be calculated without reference to timezones at all , and indeed should be conducted in UTC .
As far as the author knows , there are no tools or packages available in modern programming languages or environments that provide significant support for calculations with dates apart from calculation with times of day -- these are usually deferred to the application - level , and appear not to have been solved as far as the application programmer is concerned .
7 Historic Randomness
The Roman tradition of using Ante Meridiem and Post Meridiem to refer to the two halves have survived into English , despite the departure from the custom of changing the day of the month at noon .
The Meridiem therefore has a very different role in modern usage than in ancient usage .
This legacy notation also carries a number system that is fairly unusual .
As seen from members of the 24 - hour world , the order 12,1,2 , ... 11,12,1,2 , ...,11 as mapped onto 0,1,2...,23 is not only confusing , it is nearly impossible to make people believe that 13 hours have elapsed from 11 AM to 12 AM .
For instance , several Scandinavian restaurants are open only 1 hour a day to tourists from the world of the 12 - hour clock , but open 13 hours a day to natives of the world of the 24 - hour clock .
The Roman tradition of starting the year in the month of March has also been lost .
Most agrarian societies were far more interested in the onset of spring than in the winter solstice , even though various deities were naturally celebrated when the sun returned Most calendars were designed by people who made no particular effort to be general or accurate outside their own lifetime or needs , but Julius Cæsar decided to move the Roman calendar back two months , and thus it came to be known as the Julian calendar .
This means that month number 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 suddenly came in as number 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 , but kept their names : September , October , November , December .
This is of interest mostly to those who remember their Latin but far more important was the decision to retain the leap day in February .
In the old calendar , the leap day was added at the end of the year , as makes perfect sense , when the month was already short , but now it is squeezed into the middle of the first quarter , complicating all sorts of calculations , and affecting how much people work .
In the old days , the leap day was used as an extra day for the various fertility festivities .
You would just have to be a cæsar to find this unappealing .
The Gregorian calendar improved on the quadrennial leap years in the Julian calendar by making only every fourth centennial a leap year , but the decision was unexpectedly wise for a calendar decision .
It still is not accurate , so in a few thousand years , they may have to insert an extra leap day the way we introduce leap seconds now , but the simplicity of the scheme is quite amazing : a 400 - year cycle not only starts 2000 - 03-01 ( as it did 1600 - 03 - 01 ) , it contains an even number of weeks : 20,871 .
This means that we can make do with a single 400 - year calculation for all time within the Gregorian calendar with respect to days of week , leap days , etc .
Pope Gregory XIII may well have given a similar paper to this one to another unsuspecting audience that probably also failed to appreciate the elegance of his solution . , and 400 more years will pass before it is truly appreciated .
Other than the unexpected elegance of the Gregorian calendar , the world is now quite fortunate to have reached consensus on its calendars .
Other calendars are still used , but we now have a global reference calendar with complete convertibility .
This is great news for computers .
It is almost as great news as the complete intercurrency convertibility that the monetary markets achieved only as late as 1992 .
Before that time , you could wind up with a different amount of money depending on which currencies you traded obscure currencies like the ruble through .
The same applied to calendars : not infrequently , you could wind up on different dates according as you converted between calendar systems , similar to the problem of adding a year to February 29 any year and then subtracting a year .
8. The LOCAL - TIME Concept
The groundwork should now have been laid for the introduction of the several counter - intuitive decisions made in the design of the LOCAL - TIME concept and its implementation .
8.1 Time Elements as Fixnums
Unix time has the advantage that it is representable as a 32 - bit machine integer .
It has the equal disadvantage of not working if the time is not representable as a 32 - bit machine integer , and thus can only represent times in the interval 1901 - 12-13T20:45:52/2038-01-19T03:14:07 .
If we choose an unsigned machine integer , the interval is 1970-01- 01T00:00:00/2106-02-07T06:28:16 .
The Common Lisp UNIVERSAL - TIME concept has the disadvantage that it turned into a bignum on most 32 - bit machines on 1934-01 - 10T13:37:04 and runs out of 32 bits two years earlier than Unix time , on 2036-02-07T06:28:16 .
I find these restrictions to be uncomfortable , regardless of whether there are any 32 - bit computers left in 2036 to share my pain .
Bignum operations are generally far more expensive than fixnum operations , and they have to be , regardless of how heavily the Common Lisp implementation has optimized them .
It therefore became a pronounced need to work with fixnums in time - intensive applications .
The decision fell on splitting between days and seconds , which should require no particular explanation , other than to point out that calculation with days regardless of the time of day is now fully supported and very efficient .
Because we are very close to the beginning of the next 400 - year leap - year cycle , thanks to Pope Gregory , day 0 is defined to be 2000 - 03 - 01 , which much less arbitrary than other systems , but not obviously so .
Each 400 - year cycle contains 146,097 days , so an arbitrary decision was made to limit the day to a maximal negative value of - 146,097 , or 1600 - 03-01 .
This can be changed at the peril of accurately representing days that do not belong to the calendar used at the time .
No attempt has been made to accurately describe dates not belonging to the Gregorian calendar , as that is an issue resolvable only with reference to the borders between countries and sometimes counties at the many different times throughout history that monarchs , church leaders , or other power figures decided to change to the Gregorian calendar .
Catering to such needs is also only necessary with dates prior to the conversion of the Russian calendar to Gregorian , a decision made by Lenin as late as 1918 , or any other conversion , such as 1582 in most of Europe , 1752 in the United States , and even more embarrassingly late in Norway .
Not mention above is the need for millisecond resolution .
Most events on modern computers fall within the same second , so it is now necessary to separate them by increasing the granularity of the clock representation .
This part is obviously optional in most time processing functions .
The LOCAL - TIME concept therefore represents time as three disjoint fixnums :
the number of days since ( or until , when negative ) 2000 - 03-01 the number of seconds since the start of the day in Coordinated UniversalTime the number of milliseconds since the start of the second .
All numbers have origin 0 .
Only the number of days may be negative .
The choice of epoch needs some more explanation .
Conversion to this system only requires subtracting two from the month and making January and February part of the previous year .
The moderate size of the fixnums allows us another enormous advantage over customary ways to represent time .
Since the leap year is now always at the end of the year , it has no bearing on the decoding of the year , month , day , and day - of - week of the date .
By choosing this odd - looking epoch , the entire problem with computing leap years and days evaporates .
This also means that a single , moderately large table of decoded date elements may be pre-computed for 400 years , providing a tremendous speed - up over the division - based calculations used by other systems .
Similarly , a table of the decoded values of the 86400 possible seconds in a day ( 86401 if we allow leap seconds ) yields a tremendous speedup over division - based calculations .
( Depending on your processor and memory speeds , a factor of 10 to 50 may be expected .
for a complete decoding )
8.2 Timezone Representation
David Olsen of Digital Equipment Corporation has laid down a tremendous amount of work in collecting the timezones of the world and their daylight saving time boundaries .
Contrary to the Unix System V approach from New Jersey ( insert appropriate booing for best effect ) , which codifies a daylight saving time regime only for the current year , and apply it to all years , David Olsen 's approach is to maintain tables of all the timezone changes .
A particular timezone thus has a fairly long table of periods of applicability of the specific number of seconds of to add to get local time .
Each interval is represented by the start and end times of the specific value , the specific value , a daylight saving time flag , and the customary abbreviation of the timezone .
On most Unix systems , this is available in compiled files in /usr / share / zoneinfo / under names based on the continent and capital of the region in most cases , or more general names in other cases .
While not perfect , this is probably a scheme good as any -- it is fairly easy to figure out which to use .
Usually , a table is also provided with geographic coordinates mapped to the timezone file .
For the timezone information , the LOCAL - TIME concept implements a package , TZ , or TIMEZONE in full , which contains symbols named after the files , whose values are lazy - loaded timezone objects .
Because the source files for the zoneinfo files are generally not as available as the portably coded binary information , the information are loaded into memory from the compiled files , thus maintaining maximum compatibility with the other timezone functions on the system .
In the LOCAL - TIME instances , the timezone is represented as a symbol to aid in the ability to save literal time objects in compiled Lisp files .
The package TZ can easily be autoloaded in systems that support such facilities , in order to reduce the load - order complexity .
In order to increase efficiency substantially once again , each timezone object holds the last few references to timezone periods in it , in order to limit the search time .
Empirical studies of long - running systems have showed that more than 98 % of the lookups on a given timezone were for time in the same period , with more than 80 % of the remaining lookups at the neighboring periods , so caching these values made ample sense .
8.3 Efficiency Considerations in Table Storage
In order to store 146,072 entries for the days of a 400 - year cycle with the decoded year , month , day , and day - of - week and 86401 entries for the seconds of a day with the decoded hour , minute and second efficiently , various optimizations were employed .
The naïve approach , to uses lists , consumes approximately 6519 K on a 32 - bit machine .
Due to their overhead , vectors did worse .
Since the decoded elements are small , well - behaved unsigned integers , encoding them in bit fields within a fixnum turns out to save a lot of memory :
+----------+----+-----+---+
+-----+------+------+ | yyyy | mm | day |dow| |hour | min | sec |
+----------+----+-----+---+
+-----+------+------+ 10 4 5 3 5 6 6
This simple optimization meant 7 times more compact storage of the exact same data , with significantly improved access times , to boot ( depending on processor and memory speeds as well as considerations for caching strategies , a factor of 1.5 to 3 has been measured in production ) .
Still , 909 K of storage to keep tables of precomputed dates and times may seem a steep price to pay for the improved performance .
Unsurprisingly , more empirical evidence confirmed that most dates decoded were in the same century .
Worst case over the next few years , we will access two centuries frequently , but it is still a waste to store four full centuries .
A reduction to 100 years per table also meant the number of years were representable in 7 bits , meaning that an specialized vector of type ( UNSIGNED - BYTE 16 ) could represent them all .
The day of week would be lost in this optimization , but a specialized vector of type ( UNSIGNED - BYTE 4 ) of the full length ( 146097 ) could hold them if a single division to get the day of week was too expensive .
It turns out that the day of week is much less used than the other decoded elements , so the specialized vector was dropped and an option included with the call to the decoder to skip the day of week .
Similarly , by representing only 12 hours in a specialized vector of type ( UNSIGNED - BYTE 16 ) , the hour would need only 4 bits and the lookup could do the 12 - hour shift in code .
This reduces the table memory needs to only 156K , and it is still faster than access to the full list representation .
This compaction yields almost a factor 42 improvement over the naïve approach
For completeness , the bit field layout is now simplified as follows .
+-------+----+-----+
+----+------+------+
| 0-100 |1-12 | 1-31 | |0 - 11 | 0 -59 | 0-59 | +-------+----+-----+
+----+------+------+
7 4 5 4 6 6
Decoding the day now means finding the 400 - year cycle for the day of week , the century within it for the table lookup , and adding together the values of the centuries and the year from the table , which may be 100 to represent January and February of the following century .
All of this can be done with very inexpensive fixnum operations for about 2,939,600 years , after which the day will incur a bignum subtraction to bring it into fixnum space for the next 2,939,600 > years .
( This optimization has not actually been implemented . )
9 Reading and Printing Time
Common Lisp is renowned for the ability to print and read back almost all of its data types .
The motivation for the LOCAL - TIME concept included the ability to save human - readable timestamps in files , as well as the ability to store literal time objects efficiently in compiled Lisp files .
The former has been accomplished through the use of the reader macros .
Ignoring all other possible uses of the @ character , it was chosen to be the reader macro for the full representation of a LOCAL - TIME object .
Considering the prevalence of software that works with the UNIVERSAL - TIME concept , especially in light of the lack of alternatives until now , #@ was chosen to be the reader macro for the UNIVERSAL - TIME representation of a time object .
This latter notation obviously loses the original time zone information and any milliseconds .
9.1 Timestring Syntax
The Lisp reader is instructed to parse a timestring following the reader macro characters .
Other functions may call PARSE - TIMESTRING directly .
Such a timestring follows ISO 8601 closely , but allows for a few enhancements and an additional option : the ability to choose between comma and period for the fractional second delimiter .
Supported formats of the timestring syntax include
absolute time with all elements , the default printed format absolute time with some elements omitted , as per ISO 8601 absolute time with date omitted , defaulting to the current absolute time with time omitted , defaulting to 00:00:00Z .
the most recent occurrence of a time of day , with a leading < .
the forthcoming occurrence of a time of day , with a leading > .
the time of day specified , but yesterday , with a leading - .
the time of day specified , but tomorrow , with a leading + .
the current time of day , with a single = .
Work in progress includes adding and subtracting a duration from the specified time , such as the present , explaining the use of the = , which is also needed to represent periods with one anchor at the present .
The duration syntax is , however , rife with assumptions that are fairly hard to express concisely and to use without causing unexpected and unwanted results .
The standard syntax from ISO 8601 is fairly rich with options .
These are mostly unsupported due to the ambiguity they introduce .
The goal with the timestring syntax is that positions and periods of time shall be so easy to read and write in an information - preserving syntax that there will be no need to cater to the information - losing formats preferred by some only because of their attempt at similarity to their spoken forms .
9.2 Formatting Timestrings
Considering that the primary problem with time formats is randomness in the order of the elements , the timestring formatter for LOCAL - TIME objects allows no options in that regard , but allows elements to be omitted as per the standard .
The loss of 12 - hour clocks will annoy a few people for a time , but there is nothing quite like shaking a bad habit for good .
Of course , the persistent programmer will write his own formatter , anyway , so the default should be made most sensible for representing time in programs and in lisp - oriented input files .
At present , the interface to the timestring formatter is well suited for a call from FORMAT control strings with the ~// construct , and takes arguments a follows :
stream -- the stream to receive the formatter timestring local - time -- the LOCAL - TIME instance universal -- if true , ignore the timezone and use UTC > .
This is the colon modifier .
timezone -- if true , print a timezone specification at the end .
This is the atsign modifier .
date - elements -- the number of elements of the date to write , counted from the right .
This is a number from 0 to 4 ( the default if omitted or NIL ) . time - elements -- the number of elements of the time to write , counted from the left .
This is a number from 0 to 4 ( the default if omitted or NIL ) . date - separator -- the character to print between elements of the date .
If omitted or NIL , defaults to the hyphen .
time - separator -- the character to print between elements of the time .
If omitted or NIL , defaults to the colon .
This argument also applies to the timezone when it is printed , and when it has a minute component .
internal - separator -- the character to print between the date and the time elements .
May also be specified as the number 0 , to omit it entirely , which is the default if either the date or the time elements are entirely omitted , or the letter T otherwise .

10 Conclusions
The absence of a standard notation for time in Common Lisp required all this work .
The presence of International Standards for the representation of time made it all a lot easier .
Time basically has the most messed - up legacy you can imagine .
Pope Gregory XIII made it a little easier on us all .
Adoption of this proposal in Common Lisp systems and applications would make time a lot easier for almost everyone involved , except users who cling to the habits that caused the Y2 K problems .
This package is far from complete .

Interlocking Directorates in the Corporate Community by G. William Domhoff
Interlocking directorates -- defined as the linkages among corporations created by individuals who sit on two or more corporate boards -- have been a source of research attention since the Progressive Era at the turn of the 20th century , when they were used by famous muckraking journalists , and future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis , to claim that a few large commercial and investment banks controlled most major corporations .
Today corporate interlocks are analyzed with bigger databases and sophisticated network programs , thanks to desktop computers .
The databases are large matrices that contain information on the linkages between persons and groups .
Either a corporate / organizational network , based on common directors , or an interpersonal / social network , based on shared board memberships , can be derived from these matrices .
That is , the matrices contain a " duality of persons and groups " ( Breiger , 1974 ) .
This is worth mentioning because this essay will discuss both " corporate networks , " that is , the linkages among corporations created by interlocking directorates , and " social networks , " that is , the linkages among people by virtue of the fact that they sit on the same corporate board .
The conclusions from the more recent studies are very different from those drawn 100 years ago , probably because the interlocks now mean something different than they did back then .
Interlocks used to have the strategic purpose of tying corporations together for economic advantage for the owners .
Today they are more the incidental by - product of recruiting a diverse and experienced group of individuals who have a variety of skills and connections to bring to the table .
It 's also important to note that most corporate directors are not interlocking directors .
Even when a large number of companies are included in the database , making the possibilities for interlocks much greater , only about 15 - 20 % of corporate directors sit on two or more corporate boards .
And even fewer , of course , sit on three , four , five , or six boards , although they are the people who tie the network together .
They are " linchpins , " as one research team puts it ( Davis , Yoo , & Baker , 2002 ) .
Before we examine how changes came about in the corporate network , let 's look at present - day interlocks in a step - by - step fashion .
Corporate Interlocks
We might as well start with Citigroup -- the largest commercial bank in the United States as of 2005 -- and the 25 corporations it is linked to .
This colorful diagram is made possible courtesy of the " Board Analyst " tool on TheCorporateLibrary.com .
It shows how 13 people create " interlocks " ( also called " links " or " network ties " ) between Citigroup and 25 other corporations .
Two of the 25 , Alcoa and Comcast , share two directors with Citigroup , so they have a " double interlock . "
None of the 25 corporations linked to Citigroup is a bank because interlocks between companies in the same business sector are illegal due to past agitation about the possible negative effects of interlocking directorships .
Next we can look at the interlocks among the 25 companies that interlock with Citigroup , an analysis that is based on all the directors of these corporations .
The linkages are first presented in Table 1 in a form that makes them easy to understand .
Notice that most of the companies are not interlocked with each other .
Twelve companies have only one or two links to the other 25 .
Two companies , Pepsico and EDS ( zillionaire H. Ross Perot 's data management company ) , have six interlocks .

For my purposes here , however , this matrix is just a way station on the path to a visual representation of the full network , which includes the interlocks between Citigroup and each of the other 25 corporations .
This network was created by Nicholas Harrigan of Australian National University using the graphic visualization software called " NetDraw , " available from www.analytictech.com.
( The two darker lines in the diagram represent the double interlocks with Alcoa and Comcast , which were mentioned earlier . )
We also can determine the interlocks that the 153 directors of these 25 companies create with still other companies .
According to TheCorporateLibrary.com , they are also directors at an additional 214 corporations .
From this example , it is easy to see why researchers claim there is one big corporate community based on interlocking directorates .
However , to make sure Citigroup is not atypical , we can glance at another big and important bank in 2005 , J.P. Morgan Chase .
What makes this bank a little extra interesting is that J. P. Morgan was the infamous financier of 100 years ago whose financial companies were said to control dozens of corporations , and probably did ( Chernow , 1990 ) .
As for the " Chase " part of the name , the Chase Manhattan Bank was the home base for the huge Rockefeller fortune from the 1930s until fairly recently .
Sure enough , J.P. Morgan has links to 23 other companies , including double interlocks with Honeywell and Merck .
It 's also noteworthy that two companies , Ford Motors and Yum !
Brands , have interlocks with both Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase , which of course means there are organizational links between those two large banks .
It 's also possible , thanks to TheCorporateLibrary.com , to examine the links between corporations and various nonprofit organizations , such as foundations , think tanks , and charities .
Some social scientists say these nonprofits are part of a " Third Sector , " implying they are an independent force separate from private corporations and government , but I think they are mistaken .
The nonprofits are linked to the corporate community , not only by the interlocks shown below , but by financial gifts from the corporations as well .
To the right is the nonprofit network around Citigroup created by its directors .
And here 's the nonprofit network created by directors of J.P. Morgan Chase .
Just to add to the complexity of these nonprofit links , let 's note that there are eight organizations that are in both the Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase networks , which means eight more organizational links between the two banks in addition to the two created by Ford Motors and Yum !
Brands .
I 'll leave it to you to spot those eight organizations if you are into that sort of thing , except to say that one of them , Catalyst , is dedicated to helping women advance in the corporate community .
Corporate Centrality
" Centrality " is a concept with two components , a large number of interlocks , plus the degree to which those interlocks are with other companies with a large number of interlocks .
In the past , banks were invariably the most central organizations in the corporate network , but not any more .
In a study of centrality using interlocking directorates among 100 corporations and 109 nonprofits , Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase , both headquartered in New York , were among the 10 most central organizations , but they were joined by Sara Lee in Chicago and 3 M in St. Paul , which by coincidence were the 104th and 105th largest corporations on the Fortune 500 list a few years ago ( Moore , Sobieraj , Whitt , Mayorova , & Beaulieu , 2002 , Table 3 ) .
According to TheCorporateLibrary.com , in 2004 Sara Lee had ten directors who linked to 31 other companies , which in turn linked to 267 companies , and 3 M had 11 directors who linked to 31 other companies , which in turn linked to 297 more companies .
In looking at the Sara Lee and 3 M networks , keep an eye out for any companies they might share in common .
So what is going on here ?
How did these two relatively minor corporations move to the center of the network ?
Before I provide the answer , which is very simple , and has to do with diversity and multiculturalism , it will be useful to look briefly at the history of interlocks .
A quick history of interlocks
The first corporate directors , and interlocking directors , appeared in the 1790s in the incorporation papers for New England textile mills owned in common by subgroups of wealthy men who were part of an overall group .
So , to take a hypothetical example , Persons 1 , 2 , and 3 owned Company A , and Persons 1 , 4 , and 5 owned Company B , Persons 2 , 3 , and 6 owned company C , and so on .
In this case it is clear that the interlocking directors are also common owners .
We also know that these people sat together on bank boards very shortly thereafter , if not immediately .
By 1845 a group of 80 men , known to historians as the " Boston Associates , " controlled 31 textile companies that accounted for 20 percent of the nationwide textile industry .
Seventeen of these men served as directors of Boston banks that owned 40 percent of the city 's banking capital , 20 were directors of six insurance companies , and 11 sat on the boards of five railroad companies ( Dalzell , 1987 ) .
It is very likely that these interlocks were used to coordinate the operations of these corporations and to look out for the overall interests of the general ownership group .
Thanks to economist David Bunting 's ( 1983 ) important original archival research on the origins of the American corporate network , we also know that the major banks and insurance companies in New York City were already tightly interlocked by 1816 .
In fact , the 10 largest banks and 10 largest insurance companies were linked into one network by their interlocking directors .
In 1836 , all but two of the 20 largest banks , 10 largest insurance companies , and 10 largest railroads were linked into one common network , with 12 of the 38 companies having an amazing 11 to 26 interlocks , 10 having 6 to 10 interlocks , and 16 having one to 5 interlocks .
Even at that time , which is often romanticized as one of small businesses , the 10 largest banks had 70 percent of the bank assets in New York City and 40 percent of the bank assets in the entire state .
Most interlocking directors were major capitalists in those days , and were using their directorship positions to coordinate their interests as much as possible .
Bunting ( 1983 ) and sociologist Bill Roy ( 1983 ; 1997 ) then carry the story to the early 20th century , showing that most large banks , insurance companies , railroads , and manufacturing companies were part of one big corporate network .
But as the 20th century unfolded , things became more complicated .
Laws were passed outlawing interlocks among competitors .
There were more and more hired managers , and they began to be included on corporate boards .
Some rich families , like the Rockefellers , hired people to sit on corporate boards for them .
So , the corporate network now included more than just owners and financiers .
Still , it remained intact , with banks at the center .
In addition , there was one other subtle change going on .
The bankers were less likely to sit on the boards of manufacturing companies , as they did when there was almost surely banker dominance in many corporations .
Instead , the heads of the manufacturing companies , sometimes men who had worked their way to the top , went to sit on the bank boards .
Maybe banks were becoming places of coordination rather than power centers ( Mizruchi , 1982 ; Mizruchi , 1983 ) .
By this point many corporations were thought by scholars and journalists to be just as powerful as commercial and investment banks .
An interview I did in the early 1980s with a retired CEO of a major bank can give us a sense of what boards looked like at that time to a person who was a member of several of them .
Talking with a corporate director about board composition
Frederick G. Larkin was the friend of a friend , or actually , kind of a foster parent or mentor to my friend .
A graduate of the Stanford Business School in 1936 , he had just retired as the CEO of Security Pacific Bank , where he had worked his way up the executive ladder .
I told him I just wanted to ask him about his board experience , and he agreed to an interview .
We met on the top floor , the umpteenth floor , of the Security Pacific skyscraper in Los Angeles , which was not a happy setting for me due to a mild height phobia .
At noon we walked down a short inside stairs to a fine lunch in the large ( and nearly empty ) executive dining room .
I think he was candid , maybe because my questions were not all that probing , but I also had promised confidentially on the names of the people he talked about .
Along the way , he vented about how environmentalists , trade unionists , and prying journalists were screwing everything up .
When I asked about why the various members were on his bank board , it was clear that they were a mix of owners , highly regarded customers , corporate lawyers , and executives whom he respected .
Two were people of note in the business world that he thought added luster and visibility to the board .
I had not been able to find information on one of the women on the board , but he explained that she was a member of the Chandler family , the super - wealthy family that owned the Los Angeles Times , among other things .
When I asked about the boards of other companies he sat on , he confidently stated why he thought each person was on the board .
For example , with one small oil company , long since merged out of existence , there were one or two big shareholders , along with a lawyer representing another major owner , and financial advisors .
At a company clearly controlled by the owning family , where a son was in charge , the other board members were the company 's commercial banker ( i.e. , Larkin ) , investment banker , and lawyers , along with two or three executives whose judgment was respected by the owner / CEO .
When we finished he got on an elevator to the roof and took off in a helicopter for the Los Angeles Airport , heading for a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco .
( And yes , he was a member of the Bohemian Club . )
I took a cab to the airport , relieved that he had n't offered to give me a ride from that scary setting that I could n't have handled .
Then things changed somewhat
In the late 1980s and 1990s , banks began to lose some of their centrality .
They were still more central than most companies , but they did not have the extensive interlocks they had in the past ( Barnes & Ritter , 2001 ; Davis & Mizruchi , 1999 ) .
From my perspective , several things seem to be going on at once .
For one , big owners and big financiers are no longer the main board sitters .
For another , top - level executives are sitting on each other 's boards .
There are also some retired political figures who provide entrée to Washington .
But there 's another issue .
Starting in the 1960s , and picking up real steam in the 1980s , corporations were under pressure to diversify their boards in terms of adding women and people of color .
My colleague Richard L. Zweigenhaft and I have spelled out this story in great detail ( Zweigenhaft & Domhoff , 2003 , Chapter 7 ; Zweigenhaft & Domhoff , 2006 ; Zweigenhaft & Domhoff , 1998 ) .
However , for all the diversification that has occurred , most corporate directors are white males .
The highest diversification figures are for the top 100 corporations , where white men held 71 % , of the directorships in 2004 , women of any color held 17 % , African - Americans held 10 % , Latinos 4 % , and Asian - Americans 1 % ( these numbers add up to 103 % due to double counting of the women of color ) .
However , these few percent tend to sit on many different boards for the biggest and most visible corporations ; for example , 67 % of the top 100 companies had at least one African - American director and 99 % had at least one woman director in 2004 ( Zweigenhaft & Domhoff , 2006 ) .
Unlike most directors in the past , the women and African - Americans serving on boards usually are not major financiers or high - level executives in major corporations .
They often come from the worlds of government , politics , sports , or celebrity , or own their own small businesses .
( Brief research digression :
For anyone who might want to do more research on this issue in a year - by - year fashion for 1987 through 1998 , there is an untapped resource that sits in many libraries as well as in the money - raising offices at large universities .
Created by Jeannette E. Glynn , a retired librarian for the Bank of America , it 's called Who Knows Who .
It has two main sections , " Director - to - Director Links " and " Organization - to - Organization Links , " for 1,066 corporations and 112 foundations by 1998 .
The Director - to - Director section provides the companies and fellow directors for each director of the corporations and foundations that are included , and the Organization - to - Organization section lists each corporation 's corporate and foundation connections , along with the name of the person who creates the link .
There is also a section that lists directors by the number of boards they sit on and a section that lists corporations by the number of organizational links they have . )
Rozanne Ridgway
So now we return to Sara Lee and 3M .
They have many interlocks with other corporations and have moved to the center because they both have women and African - Americans on their boards who also happen to sit on many other boards .
Furthermore , one of them , Rozanne L. Ridgway , a retired State Department officer , sits on the boards of both corporations .
In telling this story , I am going to move back and forth between two websites , TheCorporateLibrary.com and They Rule , whose databases are for slightly different years , and thus would show slightly different results if you compared them for yourself , due to the fact that the composition of boards can change slightly each year .
With that caution in mind , here 's the interlock network created by Ridgway based on the five corporate boards she sits on in the TheyRule .
net database :
Vernon Jordan Willie Davis
Next let 's consider two other people on the Sara Lee board with Ridgway .
First , there 's Vernon Jordan , an African - American lawyer who once headed the Urban League , but is best known as President Bill Clinton 's lawyer / confidant in the 1990s .
Jordan sits on the boards of American Express , Xerox , J.C. Penney , and Asbury Automotive Group .
Ridgway and Jordan are enough to pull Sara Lee close to the center , but any doubts are put to rest by the presence of another African - American , former Green Bay Packer defensive lineman Willie Davis , now the owner of a radio station in Los Angeles , who is a member of nine corporate boards , including five that are part of the TheyRule .
net database -- Fidelity National Financial , MGM Mirage , Wisconsin Energy , Dow Chemical , and Johnson Controls .
If we add Jordan and Davis to the Ridgway diagram -- once again using the superb tools available on TheyRule .
net -- we can see why Sara Lee is near the center of the corporate network .
Recalling my quick nonmathematical definition of " centrality , " Sara Lee is near the center because it has numerous interlocks with companies -- such as 3M , Boeing , and American Express -- that have numerous interlocks of their own .
Aulana Peters Louis Sullivan Linda Alvarado
It is also interesting to look at the interlocks created by three atypical directors who sit on the 3M board with Ridgway .
Aulana Peters is an African - American and retired corporate lawyer who once was a partner in a prominent firm in Los Angeles ( she also spent four years during the Reagan Administration working for the Securities and Exchange Commission ) .
Louis M. Sullivan is an African - American physician who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services during the presidency of George H. W. Bush .
Linda Alvarado is a Mexican - American and the CEO of her own construction company in Colorado .
Here is the corporate network these four directors alone create around 3M :
We also can stop for a minute to look at the interpersonal connections that a Ridgway and a Davis have by virtue of their presence on corporate boards .
That is , we can see the social networks created among people who have a common board membership as a " link . "
These interpersonal networks become relevant for the conclusion that I draw in a minute .
For this demonstration , we return to the database on TheCorporateLibrary.com :
As these several different examples show , it seems that since the 1990s the corporate network has been based first and foremost on the individual qualities of the people asked to join several corporate boards rather than on the desire for any formal organizational relations between corporations .
There are still some owners , financial advisors , and legal advisors on many boards , as in the old days .
But there are also fellow executives who are liked or respected , along with former government officials or political confidants who provide connections in Washington .
And then there are the women and people of color who add diversity as well as expertise and connections .
Zweigenhaft and I ( 1982 , pp. 25-43 ; 1998 , p. 191 ) summarize the situation by saying the boards are now made up of owners , executives , lawyers , financial advisors , ambassadors , buffers , and tokens .
This leads to the best current conclusion about corporate interlocks by three business school professors who study boards .
The " small world " of the corporate community is created by a combination of the interpersonal ties and expertise of the people who already sit on one or more boards .
This generates a community of directors who are not sitting on two or more boards for the purpose of cementing ties between the companies , i.e. , with what is called " strategic intent " in the quote that follows , but because they have experience with the kinds of issues that boards face :
" The upshot of these studies is that board interlocks may be a fortuitous by - product of board preferences for recruiting experienced directors , with little strategic intent ( with the possible exception of bank ties ) , yet the result is the creation of a network that is highly consequential for board decision making .
The prior experience of directors is part of the raw material of board decision making , and it is thus unsurprising that a director who has been involved in acquisitions , alliances , adopting takeover defenses , creating an investor relations office , or any other board - level decision ( including recruiting other directors ) would bring that expertise to bear ; indeed , it would be bizarre if things were otherwise . "
( Davis et al. , 2002 , p. 305 )
One further piece of evidence for this conclusion is the fact that corporate connections " broken " by the death or retirement of a director are not very often " restored " by a new director chosen from closely related companies , which is what would be expected if directorships were still used to establish relationships between companies ( Koenig & Gogel , 1981 ; Palmer , 1983 ) .
This finding helps explain why the centrality of corporations can change every few years .
When Ridgway , Jordan , and Davis leave the Sara Lee board , for example , the company could drift to the periphery of the network .
Does the interlock network still have an organizational function ?
Although most directors probably are not selected for " strategic " reasons , the network of interlocking directors still has some inter-organizational utility .
In particular , new ideas can diffuse from one company to another fairly easily .
For example , if a director at corporation A sees that the company 's new research unit is functioning quite well , she might suggest that a similar research unit be adopted at other companies on whose boards she sits .
In turn , directors from those companies may carry the idea to still other companies .
However , I do n't want to make too much of the overall network in terms of any given director 's comprehension of it .
It is too big and diffuse for any one person to see it whole unless they look for connections in big reference books ( which is actually what Who 's Who in America , Standard & Poors Register of Corporations and Directors , and the Martindale - Hubbell Law Directory are for from the point of view of the business world ) .
Subjectively speaking , it does n't mean much , if anything , to any individual that Company A is linked to Company D through Company A's link to Company B and Company B's link to Company C and Company C's link to Company D. Only students of interlocking directorships know that fact .
It 's a little overly simple , but think of it in terms of your own social networks .
Obviously , you know your friends , and you often know some of their other friends , although not all of them , as you often learn to your surprise at a reunion , wedding , or funeral .
But you certainly do n't know the friends of these " friends of friends , " i.e. , the people who are three steps removed from you ( you -> your friends -> their friends -> their friends ) .
What 's in it for the interlocking directors ?
Why do people agree to become directors of two or more corporations ?
For most of them , it 's too easy for us to say that they make good money , anywhere from tens of thousands to a few hundred thousand per board , because those high levels of compensation are fairly recent .
It 's more likely that they receive various intangibles out of it , such as prestige , information , and new connections .
Based on his interviews with corporate directors , sociologist Michael Useem ( 1984 ) concluded that service on two or three corporate boards widened the horizons of top executives , which he called " business scan . "
He also showed that those who sit on two or more corporate boards are more likely to be in policy - discussion groups and to receive appointments to government advisory committees ( Useem , 1980 ) .
Thus , becoming a director , and then an interlocking director , can help move a person to the heart of the power structure .
This finding recently has been supported by a sophisticated " small world " analysis of the interlocks among corporations , foundations , policy - discussion groups , and cultural organizations for the years 1962 to 1995 ( Barnes , 2005 ) .
It is very likely that similar motives are operative for the women and people of color who have joined corporate boards since Useem did his study .
Moreover , if they serve on five or six corporate boards , they can make over $ 500,000 a year going to several meetings once a month .
( Directors who are on crucial board committees may spend more time . )
Conclusion
The study of interlocking directors has been useful to power structure researchers in helping us to define the corporate community and to learn something about how boards function .
These studies show that many corporate leaders do n't just sit at their home corporation attending to their own business .
Through meeting together on boards of directors , those who are interlocking directors develop social cohesion and shared perspectives to go with their economic power bases .
I believe this is why such people are the core of the leadership group for the upper class and the corporate community , which I call the " power elite . "
However , as the cases of Sara Lee and 3 M show , we should not make too much out of the exact " shape " of the interlock network at any given moment because too much can change when the corporate network is no longer made up strictly of owners and financiers who are using their directorships to coordinate their economic interests .

Tim Berners - Lee developed the web while working at Cern
The world wide web is " still in its infancy " , the web 's inventor Sir Tim Berners - Lee has told BBC News .
He was speaking ahead of the 15th anniversary of the day the web 's code was put into the public domain by Cern , the lab where the web was developed .
The future web will put " all the data in the world " at the fingertips of every user , Sir Tim said .
" The web has been a tremendous tool for people to do a lot of good even though you can find bad stuff out there . "
Making the web free to use had a vital role in spreading its use worldwide .
There are now 165 million different websites around the world , according to internet research firm Netcraft .
Sir Tim said he was optimistic about the future of the web .
' Fantastic experience '
" The experience of the development of the web by so many people collaborating across the globe has just been a fantastic experience , " he said .
" The experience of international collaboration continues .
Also the spirit that really we have only started to explore the possibilities of [ the web ] , that continues . "
Sir Tim predicted that the web 's ability to engender collaboration could one day see the web being used to help manage the planet .
The difficult part was explaining to them the true nature of what the web was going to be
Robert Cailliau , Cern
Luminaries predict the future web " What 's exciting is that people are building new social systems , new systems of review , new systems of governance .
" My hope is that those will produce ... new ways of working together effectively and fairly which we can use globally to manage ourselves as a planet . "
The ubiquity of the web gives the impression that its success was inevitable but that was not always the case , said Robert Cailliau , who worked alongside Sir Tim .
The decision by physics laboratory Cern to release the web code into the public domain was not a straightforward one , he told BBC News .
Technical proposals HAVE YOUR SAY
As more people become web literate our ancient system of government will change David , London , UK Mr Cailliau helped draw up one of the early technical proposals for the web and later helped convince the directors at Cern to " give the web away " .
" The difficult part was explaining to them the true nature of what the web was going to be , " he said .
" We had to convince them that this was going to take off and it was a really big thing .
And therefore Cern could n't hold on to it and the best thing to do was to give it away . "
He added : " We had toyed with the idea of asking for some sort of royalty .
But Tim was n't very much in favour of that . "
He said competing technologies , such as Gopher , which was developed at the University of Minnesota , were also offering a method of using hyperlinks to connect documents across computers on the internet .
" If we had put a price on it like the University of Minnesota had done with Gopher then it would not have expanded into what it is now .
" We would have had some sort of market share alongside services like AOL and Compuserve , but we would not have flattened the world . "

California ( TGW ) – Utility company PG&E Corp began producing natural gas from manure , which will be used to create electricity .
The vat holding the manure covers 5 football fields and is 33 feet deep .
The Vintage Dairy Biogas Project , the brainchild of life long dairyman David Albers , aims to provide the natural gas needed to power 1,200 homes a day , Albers said at the facility 's inauguration ceremony on Tuesday .
Most of the manure comes from cows .

Fortune reports that AT&T is preparing to offer a $ 200 subsidy for buyers of the next - generation iPhone , widely expected to be introduced this summer .
It writes that since the new , presumably faster models will start at the same $ 399 base price as the current iPhones , that will drop the effective price to $ 199 .
I certainly assume that Apple and AT&T are working hard to get the iPhone to a price that puts it within reach of the most people .
Fortune writes that AT&T has found that iPhone owners spend twice as much as the average customer because they buy data plans .
( This is consistent with what AT&T said to investors on its earnings conference call last week . )
But as reported , there are some bits of the story that do n’t make sense .
Fortune wrote that AT&T will offer the subsidy to people who buy the phones in its stores , but not to those who buy in Apple stores .
I ca n’t imagine that Apple would want to sell iPhones for even a dime more in its stores than in another store .
( Apple keeps exceedingly tight control over its pricing . )
And there is no underlying economic reason for AT&T to offer anyone an incentive to buy the iPhone in its stores .
No matter where you buy your iPhone , the only way to use it legitimately is on the AT&T network , which requires a two - year contract .
What ’s more , Apple has a much greater incentive to get people into its stores — where it can try to sell them Macs — than does AT&T — which has little more to offer than the odd headset and case .
My guess is that this report may be pointing the way to one of two ( not mutually exclusive ) developments :
AT&T wants to lower the price of the phone and raise the price of the data plans .
Right now the unlimited data plan for the iPhone costs $ 20 a month , far less than the $ 45 a month the company charges for unlimited data on a BlackBerry .
Now that the iPhone can also connect to corporate e-mail networks , AT&T may not be able to justify a gap in the monthly fees for its smartphones .
To make up the difference , it could raise data rates and subsidize the phones .
My guess , however , is that the $ 200 subsidy would be available to people who buy the phones from Apple stores as well .
Apple will start selling unlocked phones .
Apple has found that an enormous number of its customers are unlocking the phones , using third - party software , to use on carriers of their choice .
If Apple were to remain in keeping with its culture , it would simply try to make the next - generation iPhone even harder to unlock .
But then again , it could decide to avoid this fight , change its business model and just sell phones .
That would mean , presumably , giving up the monthly fee it gets from AT&T and other carriers .
In this scenario , Apple might well raise the price of the iPhone to , say $ 599 .
But then it would have carriers offer subsidies in return for contracts , as most other handset makers do .
Here ’s one prediction I will stand by :
We will have more leaks that do n’t entirely make sense and are not consistent with each other until Steve Jobs ascends some stage somewhere with some answers .
solo - baric L7 are a joke .
Kicker is a joke .
Their whole gig is to get as loud as possible , sacrificing sound quality in exchange for sound volume .
I have studied acoustical engineering , and have been involved with car audio for over 8 years .
I have NO clue what Johnnyabnormal is talking about .
There are mythical brown noises that supposedly make you defecate your pants , but i highly doubt that this tone exists .
There may be discomfort caused at high decibels at low frequencies , but you 're more at risk to loosing your hearing than you are to getting sick and vomit from low frequencies .
I should know , I 've had several ported systems tuned to around 20hz and hit those notes at over 125 dB and had no ill - effects nor did my passengers over the years .

The FBI today arrested a Pentagon official and two Chinese - born residents on espionage charges for passing defense secrets to China , the Justice Department announced .
Gregg William Bergersen , 51 , of Alexandria , was arrested at his home on espionage charges .
Tai Shen Kuo , a Taiwan - born U.S. citizen , 58 , and Yu Xin Kang , a Chinese national , 33 , both of New Orleans , were arrested in New Orleans on charges of conspiracy to provide defense secrets to China .
Mr. Bergersen worked as a weapons system analyst for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency , in Arlington , which is in charge of U.S. arms sales to foreign nations .
He held a top - secret clearance .
One official said the case involved the transfer of command , control , communications and intelligence equipment originally sold to Taiwan that was diverted to China .
Court papers state that the three men conspired to transfer defense secrets during meetings with Chinese intelligence officials .
Today ’s prosecution demonstrates that foreign spying remains a serious threat , said Kenneth L. Wainstein , assistant attorney general for national security .
Mr. Wainstein said in a statement that the case has all the elements of a classic espionage operation : a foreign government focused on accessing our military secrets ; foreign operatives who effectively use stealth and guile to gain that access ; and an American government official who is willing to betray both his oath of public office and the duty of loyalty we rightly demand from every American citizen .
Such spy networks pose a grave danger to our national security , and we should all thank the investigators and prosecutors on this case for effectively penetrating and dismantling this network before more sensitive information was compromised , he said .
Meanwhile , a former Boeing engineer was arrested this morning after being indicted last week on charges of economic espionage and acting as an unregistered Chinese agent .
Dongfan Greg Chung , 72 , of Orange , Calif. , a Rockwell International engineer until the company was bought by Boeing in 1996 , was arrested at his home in Orange , Calif .
Mr. Chung , was indicted Wednesday on eight counts of economic espionage , one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage , one count of acting as an unregistered foreign agent , one count of obstruction of justice , and three counts of making false statements to FBI investigators .
A naturalized U.S. citizen , Mr. Chung held a top - secret clearance .
Certain foreign governments are committed to obtaining the American trade secrets that can advance the development of their military capabilities , ” said Mr. Wainstein in a statement .
“ Todays case demonstrates that the Justice Department is equally committed to foiling those efforts through the arrest and prosecution of those who conduct economic espionage at the expense of our economic and national security .
The case involves the illegal transfer to China of Boeing Corp. trade secrets related to the space shuttle .
The investigation grew out of the Chi Mak and family Chinese spy case uncovered in 2006 , said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity .
That case involved the transfer to China of military technology related to U.S. Navy warships and submarines .
The case is expected to lead to a further curtailing of U.S. - China space cooperation , which was halted temporarily last year after China carried out an anti-satellite weapon test that left thousands of pieces of debris in low Earth orbit .

ieri sera , come tutti i venerdì io , La Mentirosa , La Romana e Most siamo andati alla Jiribilla ..
Ad un certo punto della serata La Mentirosa mi dice “ toh.. chi si rivede ! ” .
Una persona che ho conosciuto a fine anno , con la quale si era instaurato un certo feeling , uno con il quale era nata una sorta di attrazione reciproca che avrebbe anche potuto sfociare in qualcosa ..
Qualche giorno dopo però , successe l’impensabile , la mia vita cambiò totalmente una mattina di neve , quindi dissi a questa persona che non me la sentivo di portare avanti nessun tipo di discorso , che probabilmente ci sarebbe voluto del tempo per “ guarire ” .
Ovviamente vista la drammaticità della situazione capì ; per un pò di tempo mi scrisse e mi chiamò per sapere come stavo poi .. piano piano , più niente .
Tempo dopo , ad un concerto lo rividi con la sua donna ( aveva una donna !!! aaargh ) e non ci pensai più , lo cancellai .
Esco a fumare una sigaretta , lui mi vede , mi raggiunge , scambiamo due chiacchiere , mi chiede se ho risolto i miei problemi , gli rispondo che non sono tutti a posto ma sono sulla buona strada ; una conversazione educata tra due persone che non si vedono da mesi .
Dopo qualche ballo torno a fumare e lo reincontro .
Probabilmente con qualche cuba libre di troppo in corpo mi fa un discorso
ASTRUSO :
“ vedi , voi italiani siete strani , ci tenete tanto alla monogamia , noi non siamo così possiamo avere anche quattro donne .
La differenza sostanziale tra noi e voi è che quando noi stiamo con una donna , in quel momento è la regina , ne devovo mancarle le attenzioni e tutto il resto , poi , quando lei non c’è allora c’è un’altra , che viene trattata allo stesso modo ” “ Tu potresti essere una delle mie donne ” ( e IN un orecchio , con aria sorniona aggiunge “ devi essere lusingata dal fatto che tra tante , tu hai attirato la mia attenzione ” ) .
Come avrete capito da mesi di racconti sul blog , l’ironia è una delle mie principali caratteristiche , difficilmente mi scompongo davanti ad argomenti di questo genere :
“ caro , lo sai che non sono gelosa .. potrei anche accettare ma ho bisogno di un unica garanzia : minimo una volta a settimana devi venire a bagnare l’orto , ( NON SONO STATA COSI ’ FINE , SPAZIO ALL’IMMAGINAZIONE ! ) , altrimenti non se ne fa niente ” “ Adesso però torno dentro ho voglia di ballare … ciao ” e me ne sono andata .
MA SCHIACCIATI !!!!
KISUMU , Kenya
Until he was circumcised with a machete in front of a jeering mob and then dragged off to be beheaded , Robert Ochieng had been a symbol of modern , post - tribal harmony in Kenya .
A member of the Luo ethnic group , 16 - year - old Robert had played and studied with members of another ethnic group , the Kikuyu .
They were friends .
And then Kenya erupted in rioting after a rigged election , and suddenly Luos were chasing and killing Kikuyus , and a mob of Kikuyus was running down Robert .
He claimed that he was Kikuyu as well , but the suspicious mob stripped him naked and noted that he was not circumcised , meaning that he could not be Kikuyu .
That ’s when his attackers held him down  smashing his arm when he tried to protect himself  and performed the grotesque surgery in the street to loud cheers from a huge throng .
The crowd shouted war cries and was preparing to decapitate Robert with a machete when the police arrived and rescued him .
Doctors did some repair work and say he will recover physically , but as he sat in a church shelter for the displaced here in Kisumu in western Kenya , he seethed with hostility that may never heal .
Dan Froomkin , in a column that he could have written in 2003 or 2004 or 2005 or 2006 or 2007 , dissects yet another version of the Bush victory speech , while Basra and Baghdad are in chaos ( again ) :
As fighting rages in Basra , the White House is unleashing a forceful spin campaign to frame the Iraqi government ’s offensive there as a positive outcome of the U.S. troop surge and a symbol of better days to come .
Speaking to an invitation - only audience at an Air Force base in Dayton , Ohio , this morning , President Bush argued that the Basra incursion “ shows the progress the Iraqi security forces have made during the surge ” and “ demonstrates to the Iraqi people that their government is committed to protecting them .
. . .
“ The enemy , you know , will try to fill the TV screens with violence , ” he scoffed .
“ But the ultimate result will be this : Terrorists and extremists in Iraq will know they have no place in a free and democratic society . ”
But is the bloodshed in Basra an example of a unified central government asserting itself and the Iraqi army standing up ?
Or is it further evidence of the internecine strife ravaging the country ?
Will Basra become a symbol of the restoration of the rule of law ?
Or will it turn out to be a step toward heightened violence ?
There is plenty of reason to doubt the White House spin .
Just look at what ’s happening on the ground , compare that to what the U.S. military is saying about it , and recall the administration ’s many previous statements of optimism about Iraq .

The movies give a sense of what the Apollo astronauts must have felt
Selene captures the classic " Earth rise " composition Selene runs the boundary between light and dark Lunar Terrain : Selene glides over the craters
Stunning high - definition movies of the Moon 's surface have been sent back by a Japanese space probe .
Selene , or Kaguya , arrived at the Moon late last year and carries a large HDTV camera to shoot footage as it flies 100 km above the lunar surface .
The video gives an idea of the vistas seen decades ago by the Apollo astronauts as they approached the Moon .
The very latest footage was unveiled at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston , Texas .
We want to step up our technology and move on to Mars
Prof Manabu Kato , Selene mission
It includes amazing pictures of " Earth rise " over the lunar horizon and of the " terminator " , the boundary between the Moon 's day side and night side .
" It is quite a spectacular view , " said Dr Rie Honda , from Japan 's Kochi University , a collaborator on the Selene mission .
Selene consists of one main satellite along with two smaller sub- satellites , named Ouna and Okina .
Ambitious mission
It is designed to carry out a global survey of the Moon , mapping its 3D topography , its gravity and its magnetic field .
Selene is a technological stepping stone to Mars
It is also designed to be a technology demonstrator for the Japanese Space Agency ( Jaxa ) , testing orbital insertion and correction manoeuvres and communications .
Professor Manabu Kato , science manager for the mission , told BBC News the arrival of Selene at the Moon marked a significant step for Japanese space science .
" We want to step up our technology and move on to Mars , " the Jaxa scientist explained .
" We have a near future plan that we will reach Mars by 2020 - 2025 . "
Selene carries 14 science instruments in addition to the HDTV camera .
They include spectrometers and a multi-band imager to characterise the chemical and mineral composition of the lunar surface .
The stunning pictures are primarily for educational purposes
The probe also carries a radar sounder to survey shallow subsurface features .
The reasons for the heavy HDTV camera 's inclusion on the mission was purely one of " outreach " , or education , scientists said .
" The HDTV camera has been developed by Jaxa and Japanese broadcaster NHK .
" We have been thinking that HDTV itself is not accurate enough for scientific purposes .
But for giving a hint for other scientists of [ wide areas ] , it will be , " said Dr Honda .
Ice question
The probe has already flown over an impact depression known as Shackleton crater , where some scientists believe stores of water - ice may be held - of possible use to future lunar colonists .
The HD camera in preparation before its launch to the Moon Mission scientists are still analysing the data from their over - flight of Shackleton , but have found no firm evidence of ice as yet .
" Our principal investigator is looking at this again and again , because there are many people interested in this [ question ] , " said Dr Kato .
The spacecraft has already flown over Apollo landing sites , leaving some to wonder whether the probe might be able to image hardware left by the US Apollo and Russian Lunokhod missions .
Selene is mapping the lunar surface Professor Kato said the craft 's terrain camera could resolve geographical features up to 10 m , so it was " not easy to determine traces of Apollo or Russian vehicles " .
Selene was launched on 14 September 2007 and entered an observation orbit 100 km above the lunar surface on 18 October .
It finished the final check - out of its mission instruments on 20 December .

Acting White Black and Hispanic students who earn high grades face social costs in terms of their popularity .
In the United States , the academic achievement of the average black child lags that of the average white child at kindergarten entry and the achievement difference grows throughout the school years .
A typical black 17 year old reads at the same level as a typical white 13 year old .
On the Scholastic Aptitude Test , the average black student scores more than a standard deviation below the average white student .
Crafting effective public policies to address the achievement gap requires understanding its causes .
Various possibilities have been advanced , including differences in family structure and poverty , differences in school quality , racial bias in testing or teachers ' perceptions , genetics , and differences in peer culture , socialization , or behavior .
In An Empirical Analysis of " Acting White " ( NBER Working Paper No. 11334 ) , co-authors Roland Fryer and Paul Torelli find that black and Hispanic students who earn high grades face social costs in terms of their popularity .
Fryer and Torelli define " acting white " as any " statistically significant racial differences in the relationship between [ student ] popularity and grades . "
Participants in student focus groups say that a number of behaviors are condemned as " acting white , " including enrollment in honors or advanced placement classes , speaking proper English , wearing the wrong clothes from the wrong stores , or wearing shorts in the winter .
To quantify " acting white , " the authors construct a popularity index using data from the Addhealth survey , a nationally representative sample of 90,118 students in grades 7 through 12 in the school year 1994 - 5 .
Addhealth interviewed the same students in 1995 , 1996 , and 2002 .
Along with collecting information on parental education , socioeconomic status , school characteristics , and grade point average , the survey asked students to list up to five friends of each sex , ordered from their best friends to more casual acquaintances .
Fryer and Torelli 's popularity index assigns popularity to a student based the number of students who list them as a friend , weighted by the popularity of each student .
The weighting scheme ensures that if two students ( A and B ) have the same number of people who list them as friends , then student A will have a higher popularity index if his friends are more popular , meaning that more people list them as friends .
The resulting popularity indexes demonstrate that " the relationship between social status and achievement is categorically different between racial groups , a difference that is robust to changes in specifications , data sub- samples , and definitions of social status or achievement . "
At a GPA of roughly 2.5 , racial differences begin to emerge , and Hispanic students lose popularity rapidly .
Popularity peaks at a GPA of about 3.5 for black students .
Whites continue to gain popularity as their grades increase .
The social cost of " acting white " is more severe for black males than for black females .
It is larger for blacks in public schools , but nonexistent for blacks in private schools , " a finding that may partially explain why black kids in private schools do especially well . "
Finally , the burden imposed for " acting white " is greater for students with more interracial contact .
Blacks in more segregated schools " incur less of a tradeoff between popularity and achievement . "
The toll for " acting white " is " particul arly salient among high achievers and those in schools with more interracial contact . "
The authors find that two of the most common explanations for black underachievement -- that white society holds talented blacks back so much that they develop coping devices that limit their striving for academic success , and that blacks sabotage their high achieving peers -- fail to explain the fact that academically excellent students of all races retain their popularity at segregated and private schools .
Fryer and Torelli conclude that the patterns in their data accord best with a model in which investments in education are thought to be indicative of an individual 's opportunity costs of peer group loyalty -- Linda Gorman
