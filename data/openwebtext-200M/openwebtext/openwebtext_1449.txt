The VSS Enterprise was unveiled last December , and today flew for the first time out of Mojave Spaceport in California , as captured in the image above .
" VSS Enterprise remained attached to its unique WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft , VMS Eve , for the duration of the 2 hours 54 minutes flight , achieving an altitude of 45,000ft ( 13716 metres ) . "
Both crafts are developed for Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic by Burt Rutan and team at Mojave - based Scaled Composites .
The VSS Enterprise test flights will continue through 2011 , progressing from " captive carry " ( that 's what today 's experiment was ) , to " independent glide , " and then fully powered flight , before commercial operations begin .
More photos ( in glorious wide - o- vision ! ) from the dawn liftoff and flight are after the jump .

The man who heckled Rep. Bart Stupak for voting for health care reform by shouting " baby killer " has come forward , despite his fellow House members protecting his identity .
Rep. Randy Neugebauer : " pro-life " and a birther !
In a just - issued statement , the West Texas congressman said ,
In the heat and emotion of the debate , I exclaimed the phrase ' it 's a baby killer ' in reference to the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership .
While I remain heartbroken over the passage of this bill and the tragic consequences it will have for the unborn , I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself .

Right .
Well , as long as that 's cleared up .
The rest of you are still baby - killers .
It 's not exactly a departure for Neugebauer , who has a 100 % rating from the National Right To Life Committee .
Plus , he co-sponsored a bill requiring presidential candidates to show proof of citizenship .
Asked if he believed the President was a U.S. citizen , Neugebauer said , " You know I do n't know .
I 've never seen him produce documents that would say one way or another . "

Apparently Jolie was all set to reprise her role as the very much deceased assassin Fox in Wanted 2 , but now her decision to leave the project has forced Universal to pull the plug rather than recast the film .
Jole is now intent on starring in Warner Bros . ’
Gravity , a space thriller to be directed by Children of Men ’s Alfonso Cuarón from a script he wrote with his 28 - year - old son , Jonás .
All thats known about the film so far is that Jolie 's character will be alone on - screen for much of the movie , playing the sole surviving human member of a space mission , desperately trying to return home to Earth and her daughter .
Sounds very like the little seen but absolutely brilliant Sam Rockwell movie from last year , Moon .
Anyway , I 'm a big fan of Cuarón and Children Of Men was class so i'm looking forward to this ..a lot more than I was Wanted 2 anyway !
The director of a new documentary on overfishing says Australia needs to act now to protect its fish stocks or it will suffer dire consequences .
Rupert Murray is in Sydney to promote the film The End of The Line , which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and opens to Australian audiences in April .
The film warns that 70 per cent of global stocks are now in trouble and there could be no seafood by the middle of the century unless practices change .
He says the depletion of fish stocks worldwide is a major environmental problem .
" The reason why I made the film is I love eating seafood , " he said .
" I want the oceans to be full of fish and [ be ] healthy and beautiful .
I want there to be a viable fishing industry as well .
I want there to be recreational fishing .
" But if we continue on the way we 're going , all of that is going to end . "
Murray says Australia must keep watch , with 16 species already overfished .
" Overfishing is one of the biggest environmental problems , but it 's the one that people know the least about , " he said .
Government action
The Federal Government is considering setting up marine sanctuaries along the Australian coast , which Murray says are urgently needed .
Only 5 per cent of Australia 's coastline is protected and environmental groups want the Federal Government to take note of Murray 's message .
WWF biologist Gilly Llewellyn says the Government must act now .
" This year , this is the time that we need the Government to put its hand up to be a leader in marine conservation and put in large networks of no take zones for that region , and for the whole of the rest of Australia , " she said .
The seafood industry acknowledges the problem , but warns the documentary focuses on overfishing in Europe , the United States and Asia .
Brian Jefferies from the Commonwealth Fisheries Association says there is no doubt that many countries are facing overfishing problems .
But he says Australian fisheries are much better run .
" The issue in Australia is fisheries management has been around for a lot longer - over 50 years , " he said .
" In Europe it 's been there for three or four years - that 's the difference .
And we 've got into a position in Australia where things are stable and improving all the time . "
Audiences can make up their own minds when the film opens in Australia in April .
All the years I ’ve been in TV news , I ’ve observed that every story has a tipping point .
In news , we know when it has reached that point when we say it “ has legs ” and the story takes on a life of its own .
The story may have been ignored or glossed over for weeks , months , or years until some new piece of information is posted and starts to galvanize people .
The IPCC glacier melt scandal was the one that galvanized the collective voice that has been saying that the IPCC report was seriously flawed and represented a political rather than scientific view .
Now people are seriously looking at AR4 with a critical eye and finding things everywhere .
Remember our friends at World Wildlife Fund ?
Those schlockmeisters that produced the video of planes flying into New York with explicit comparisons to 9/11 ?
Well it turns out that the WWF is cited all over the IPCC AR4 report , and as you know , WWF does not produce peer reviewed science , they produce opinion papers in line with their vision .
Yet IPCC ’s rules are such that they are supposed to rely on peer reviewed science only .
It appears they ’ve violated that rule dozens of times , all under Pachauri ’s watch .
A new posting authored by Donna Laframboise , the creator of NOconsensus.org ( Toronto , Canada ) shows what one can find in just one day of looking .

But since they play for the No Fun League , we had to bleep them .
( We did n’t want anyone to get fined . )
First it was an address to the National Press Club .
Now Ferret , the spokesman for the United Motorcycle Council , is taking his message about how bad the state government 's anti-bikie laws are directly to the country 's potential future legislators .
Ferret , whose real name is Mark Anthony Moroney and who is a member of the Finks outlaw motorcycle club , yesterday addressed law students at the University of Sydney .
BAG OF TRICKS
The NSW opposition 's WasteWatch chairman , the Davidson MP Jonathan O'Dea , is obviously feeling a little neglected by the media .
This week he sent a press pack to journalists containing a brown paper bag .
'' Unfortunately brown paper bags are synonymous with the perception in NSW of politicians receiving corrupt or inappropriate payments .
This brown paper bag is NOT about delivering money to buy influence , but SAVING MONEY for all NSW taxpayers . ''
The stunt was designed to draw attention to the end of another stunt : in December O'Dea announced a reward of $ 1000 would be paid to whomever brought him the best example of '' government waste and mismanagement ' ' .
The winner , announced yesterday , was Ken Quick of Castlecrag , who brought to O'Dea 's attention '' the costs associated with the unnecessary and very expensive desalination plant ' ' .
LAPTOP LAMENT
Speaking of such things , John Agius , SC , who revealed to the Industrial Relations Commission this week that his laptop containing three years of work had been stolen from his office by '' some miscreant ' ' , has announced his own reward .
He told The Diary : '' I have offered a substantial reward for a return of the laptop , no questions asked ; together with an offer of a free day 's court appearance in a court of the miscreant 's choice .
Given that I hold a photo of the culprit he may need to take up the offer sooner than he might otherwise believe . ''
He added : '' Seriously though the loss of the content on the laptop has caused enormous distress .
The content has no value to anyone but myself .
I would be very grateful for its return and the reward offer is genuine . ''

WITH RADIO'S LAWS OF GRAVITY WHAT comes up , must come down - even for the king of the airwaves , Alan Jones .
The latest Nielsen radio survey results reveal 2 GB 's morning host recorded an audience share of 17.2 per cent - down 2.8 percentage points on his stellar ratings result of 20 per cent from the first survey of 2010 .
But there was plenty to keep the glass more than half - full at the station , which celebrated Jones and Ray Hadley once again topping their respective broadcast slots on the ratings table .
'' Only last week Alan celebrated 25 success - filled years on Australian radio and today , not even a week later , he celebrates his 50th consecutive radio survey win , '' Macquarie Radio Network chairman Russell Tate crowed .
2GB led the survey with a total overall audience share of 14.7 per cent , a drop of a percentage point on the previous survey .
Nearest rival 702 ABC
Sydney rose 0.6 percentage points to take second place with 11.1 per cent of the total market , ahead of 2Day FM at 10.3 per cent and WSFM at 6.6 per cent .
While others were waxing congratulatory , the mood was more circumspect at dmg Radio , where Classic Rock inherited all but one week of the ratings result from predecessor Vega , which bowed out on March 11 .
It recorded an audience share of 3.2 per cent between January 31 and March 20 .
WITH A STAR FOR RUSTY THE man who once did the walk of shame from a New York cop shop is about to be honoured with a spot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .
The phone thrower , Oscar winner and actor Russell Crowe is to become the 2404th star to shine in the pavement of Hollywood Boulevard in a ceremony outside the Kodak Theatre next month .
The event is a much more promising publicity coup for the release of Crowe 's film , Robin Hood in May , than that suffered by Cinderella Man in 2005 .
Crowe demonstrated his ability to hurt the film's box office takings when he threw a phone at a hotel concierge , at an additional cost of an assault charge and a fine .
But if he 's thinking of taking the promotion of this role as the prince of thieves literally , he might like to bear this in mind : surveillance cameras are reportedly being placed in the walk district to catch star thieves .
WITH DUETS THE anti-establishment rockers Rage Against the Machine have offered to perform a duet with the Scottish singer Susan Boyle as a way of burying the hatchet with the talent judge Simon Cowell .
The US band spoiled Cowell 's Christmas after an internet campaign and their track Killing In The Name kept his X Factor star Joe McElderry out of the top spot on the British charts .
The Sun quoted the Rage frontman Zack de la Rocha as saying the group would be happy to perform the track accompanied by Boyle at their free London concert on June 6 , organised to thank fans for the win .
'' The truth is Simon 's shows occasionally produce talent .
We love Susan Boyle - she is hot , '' de la Rocha was quoted as saying .
'' Everybody knows her in the US , and she can add her vocals to anything .
It would be an honour for us . ''
( CNN ) --
The international space station now has a room with a view -- and oh , what a view it is .
Astronauts from space shuttle Endeavour installed a connecting module , or node -- sort of an orbiting sun porch -- that will provide additional room for crew members and the space station 's life - support systems .
The node 's crowning feature is a cupola -- a robotic control station with six windows around its sides and another in the center .
NASA expects the windows to provide a panoramic view of Earth , celestial objects and visiting spacecraft .
Endeavour Pilot Terry Virts opened the window shutters one at a time early Wednesday , giving spacewalkers Robert Behnken and Nicholas Patrick a peek into the room they had helped install .
Behnken and Patrick wrapped up their third and final planned spacewalk , a 5 - hour , 48 - minute effort , at 3:03 a.m. EST .
They removed insulation blankets and launch restraint bolts from each of the cupola 's seven windows .
Inside the cupola , Virts opened and then closed each window in turn , beginning with the circular 31.5 - inch center window .
He was the first to look out of that largest station window , on the station 's Earth - facing port , NASA said .
Near the end of the spacewalk , all the windows were opened simultaneously .
Mission Specialist Kathryn
Hire congratulated the spacewalkers for " raising the curtain on a bay window to the world . "
President Obama called the astronaut crews of Endeavour and the space station late Wednesday afternoon from the White House to congratulate them on their ongoing mission .
Obama also turned over his telephone to visiting middle school students , who asked questions of the astronauts .
Watch astronauts chat with president , students
The cupola will house controls for the station 's robotic arms and will allow crew members to monitor spacewalks and other exterior activities .
The window shutters that can be closed to provide protection from orbital debris .
The space station , which orbits the Earth at a height of some 250 miles , is due to be completed next year .
It 's now about 90 percent complete .
Much of my personal motivation for letting new nations bloom is the desire to live in a society whose rules are aligned with my morality .
I have an intuition that our enormous mismatch between morality and legality is a bad thing , that it causes moral rot and corruption and makes for an unhealthy culture .
I am used to thinking of law - breaking as a good thing , because I disagree with the majority of laws , but would n’t it be far better to live in a world where every person did n’t need to find their own internal moral compass ?
This is fuzzy and hard to quantify , and because I have no experience with a moral society , it is hard to be sure whether my intuition is right .
But John Locke seems to agree with me .
In his piece Some Considerations of the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising the Value of Money , he says :
I fear I may reckon it as one of the probable Consequences of such a Law , That it is likely to cause great Perjury in the Nation ; a Crime , than which nothing is more carefully to be prevented by Lawmakers , not only by Penalties , that shall attend apparent and proved Perjury ; but by avoiding and lessening , as much as may be , the Temptations to it .
For where those are strong , ( as they are where Men shall Swear for their own Advantage ) there the fear of Penalties to follow will have little Restraint ; especially if the Crime be hard to be proved .
All which I suppose will happen in this Case , where ways will be found out to receive Money upon other Pretences than for Use , to evade the Rule and Rigour of the Law :
And there will be secret Trusts and Collusions amongst Men , that though they may be suspected , can never be proved without their own Confession .
I have heard very sober and observing Persons complain of the Danger Mens Lives and Properties are in , by the frequency and fashionableness of Perjury amongst us .
Faith and Truth , especially in all Occasions of attesting it upon the solemn Appeal to Heaven by an Oath , is the great Bond of Society :
This it becomes the Wisdom of Magistrates carefully to support , and render as sacred and awful in the Minds of the People as they can .
But if ever Frequency of Oaths shall make them be looked on as Formalities of Law , or the Custom of straining of Truth ( which Mens Swearing in their own Cases is apt to lead them to ) has once dipt Men in Perjury , and the Guilt with the Temptation has spread it self very wide , and made it almost fashionable in some Cases , it will be impossible for the Society ( these Bonds being dissolved ) to subsist :
All must break in Pieces , and run to Confusion .
That Swearing in their own Case is apt , by degrees to lead Men into as little Regard of such Oaths , as they have of their ordinary Talk , I think there is reason to suspect , from what has been observed in something of that kind , Masters of .
Ships are a sort of Men generally Industrious and Sober , and I suppose may be thought , for their Number and Rank , to be equally Honest to any other sort of Men :
And yet , by the Discourse I have had with Merchants in other Countries , I find , That they think in those Parts , they take a great Liberty in their Custom - house Oaths , to that degree , that I remember I was once told , in a Trading Town beyond Sea , of a Master of a Vessel , there esteemed a sober and fair Man , who yet could not hold saying , God forbid that a Custom - house Oath should be a Sin .
I say not this , to make any Reflection upon a sort of Men , that I think as uncorrupt as any other ; and who , I am sure , ought in England to be cherished and esteem ’d as the most industrious and most beneficial of any of its Subjects .
But I could not forbear to give this here as an Instance , how dangerous a Temptation it is , to bring Men customarily to Swear , where they may have any Concernment of their own .
And it will always be worthy the Care and Consideration of Law - makers , to keep up the Opinion of an Oath High and Sacred , as it ought to be , in the Minds of the People ; which can never be done , where frequency of Oaths , biassed by Interest , has establisht a neglect of them ; and Fashion ( which it seldom fails to do ) has given Countenance to what Profit rewards .
Republican Legislator Matt Wingard Plagiarizes Entire Global Warming Speech
MATT WINGARD AND HAMBURGLAR : ONE STEALS CLIMATE CHANGE DIATRIBES , THE OTHER ONLY STEALS " HAMBURGERS ... "
As I listened to Wingard 's speech , it struck me as being a little odd .
On the floor of the Oregon House , he talked about the winter in Scotland , a professor at the University of Victoria , the Russian view of some British research .
It was all a bit curious .
So , I got to Googling , and now we know why : Matt Wingard 's entire speech was plagiarized .
Well , all of it except for a single six - word sentence - and a bunch of minor wording changes designed to hide the plagiarism .
COINCIDENCE ? YEAH ... NO ...
Good on Kari Chisholm , editor and publisher at Blue Oregon .
He appears to have caught State Representative Matt Wingard with his hands in the cookie jar — plagiarizing a speech he gave on the house floor last week about global warming .
Chisholm writes : Oooh .
We 've got a call in to Wingard seeking comment , in the mean time , here 's a comparison of the speech with a recent editorial in the Washington Times , courtesy of Chisholm .
Chisholm has a nice little snippet about " why plagiarism matters , " too .
As opposed to hat - tipping with credit , I suppose , which is what the internet is all about .

If you ’re new to the Tournament of Books , here ’s how it works :
Over the course of 18 matches — one each weekday — two works of fiction go head to head , with one of our judges deciding which book moves forward in the brackets , according to whatever criteria matters to them .
Along the way , the judges reveal their biases and interests , any connections they have to the participating authors , and , most importantly , an elaborate explanation of how they decided between the two books .
From the eight opening round matches to the four quarterfinal matches through the two semifinal matches — and the potentially Tournament - disrupting “ Zombie Round ” — our original field of 18 competitors is whittled down to two finalists that will enter our championship match .
There our entire judging panel weighs in , each judge picking their favorite of the two final books , and the book that receives the most votes takes home the Rooster .

Sony has revealed that the first piece of DLC for Heavy Rain ; ‘ The Taxidermist ’ , will be released on April 1 , no joke apparently .
An expanded and updated version of the game ’s demo Quantic Dream showed back in ’08 , The DLC revolves around Madison Paige ’s early leads in the Origami Killer case and features a variety of different ways to play out .
The Taxidermist is already available for those who pre-ordered the title , for everyone else Chapter 1 of the Heavy Rain Chronicles will arrive with the April 1 PSN update and will run $ 4.99 .
From the description :
The Taxidermist chapter provides an additional backstory to Heavy Rain and features one of the main characters from Heavy Rain , journalist Madison Paige , on one of her early leads from her investigation into the Origami Killer .
In a similar manner to the unique , cinematic gameplay style of Heavy Rain , you will play Madison , and be presented with a number of tense situations and decisions , as she digs further into the case , which of course , will determine one of many different outcomes .
Parabolic troughs focus sunlight on liquid - filled receivers suspended over the mirrors to create steam that drives an electricity - generating turbine .
Parabolic trough technology has been in modern use in solar power plants since the early 1980s , but Alcoa executives said they saw an opportunity to refine the technology and get a foothold in the rapidly expanding renewable energy market .
“ If you go out and look behind large parabolic troughs , you ’ll find an elaborate truss structure , ” said Rick Winter , a technology executive with Alcoa .
“ From our understanding of aerospace structures , we said if we can modify the wing box design used in aircraft and integrate a parabolic reflector , it would give us a light and stiff structure that would fundamentally affect the cost equation . ” ...
Aluminum manufacturing , however , is the nation ’s most energy - intensive industry , according to the Energy Department .
Mr. Kerns said Alcoa had not performed a life - cycle analysis of the total energy costs and benefits of deploying such parabolic troughs , but noted that the company planned to use recycled materials to make the solar collectors .
“ We can take the energy intensity out , as much of the structural elements have the potential to use recycled aluminum , ” Mr. Kerns said .
...
The Alcoa executives said the company planned to have its solar trough in commercial production within two to three years .
WASHINGTON , D.C. -
As the House of Representatives prepares to vote Sunday on a package that Democrats say will make health care more affordable , critics insist the " big government takeover of health care " is not only unwarranted , but that a part of the solution is so obvious it 's a crime Democrats failed to embrace it .
It 's called tort reform , or putting the brakes on junk lawsuits .
If doctors and hospitals do n't need to worry about defending themselves against baseless malpractice lawsuits , they 'll stop ordering needless , duplicative tests and halt the practice of defensive medicine , Republican congressional leaders say .
It 's an easy and necessary way to bring down costs for all Americans , they say .
The problem is , Ohio has already taken that step , as have many other states .
Yet five years after a difficult but successful fight in Columbus to pass tort reform , health - care costs in the state have not gone down .
And health policy analysts say it may not be possible to say whether costs would have spiked even higher had Ohio not passed lawsuit reform .
Costs climbed even after the legislature limited the size of jury verdicts for pain and suffering to $ 250,000 except in catastrophic cases , restricted punitive damages , and made it tougher to take a case to trial .
In 2004 , the year Ohio passed lawsuit liability reform , average premiums for employer - based family health plans were $ 9,590 , according to data from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation .
By 2008 , average family premiums were $ 11,425 .
This means that four years after the state passed reform , health insurance for Ohio families in employer plans had gone up by 19 percent .
That compared with a national average rise of nearly 22 percent during that time .
While Ohio's cost hike was smaller , too many other factors go into health - care spending to conclude that the limits on lawsuits accounted for that difference , policy analysts say .
The American Association for Justice , a trade group that represents trial lawyers , notes with the same data that while health insurance premiums in Ohio rose more slowly than the national average , the Ohio pace still outstripped the hikes in neighboring Kentucky .
And Kentucky did not put caps in malpractice verdicts , so tort reform could not explain its savings .
That 's not to say that by limiting lawsuits against doctors and hospitals , the Ohio legislature did not make any dent .
Malpractice insurance premiums for doctors have dropped on average by 22 percent since 2006 , according to the Ohio Department of Insurance .
Explanations for that vary .
The trial lawyers ' lobby says the main reason liability premiums spiked in the first place was because of a big downturn in the stock market , requiring high premiums to shore up insurance reserves .
The medical industry counters that a wave of malpractice suits drove up the premiums .
Regardless , tort reform in Ohio has reduced the number and size of malpractice cases .
In 2005 , 5,051 claims were filed against doctors and hospitals .
By 2008 , the number dropped by 39 percent , a decline that the Ohio State Medical Association attributes to lawsuit reforms .
Doctors and hospitals have testified in Washington that when they fear being sued , they practice " defensive medicine . "
They say they order expensive diagnostic tests and screenings , such as computed tomography or CT scans , when a simple x-ray might do because they do n't want to risk a lawsuit .
So when they no longer have that fear , medical industry spokesmen say , doctors no longer have to practice defensively .
" No one can argue that tort reform in Ohio has n't brought down the practice of defensive medicine , " said Jason Koma , spokesman for the Ohio State Medical Association , which represents doctors and other health care providers .
But health care costs nevertheless keep rising .
Whether their growth rate has slowed -- and whether care in Ohio would cost more had it not been for liability reform -- is difficult for researchers to pinpoint .
" I 'm not aware of any analysis or study or anything empirical that does that , " said Doug Anderson , chief policy officer for the Ohio Department of Insurance .
National organizations that study health - care spending , including the Kaiser Family Foundation , say the same .
One reason for that is the lack of uniform , up - to - date data on private - sector health spending in every state .
Spending figures for Medicare , the government 's insurance program for seniors , are available for as recently as 2006 , and show that Ohio 's per-enrollee reimbursement for medical care was $ 8,249 , barely below the national average of $ 8,304 .
But malpractice suits can take several years before verdicts are reached or judges dismiss the claims , so the 2006 Medicare figures are believed to show little if any impact from Ohio 's tort reforms .
One of the best examples of why it is so difficult to identify savings from tort reform -- and why blaming lawsuits misses other components of health spending -- was cited by William Hayes , president of the Health Policy Institute of Ohio .
Hayes pointed to data from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice , which found that Medicare spending per-enrollee in 2006 was $ 8,377 in Cleveland , $ 8,153 in Akron , $ 7,930 in Dayton -- and a stunning $ 9,612 in Elyria .
How to account for that 15 percent difference over the course of the 30 miles separating Cleveland and Elyria ?
One theory cited in the New England Journal of Medicine is that in areas with a lot of doctors , hospitals and testing equipment , patients are more likely to be referred for treatment or tests , especially if their diagnoses fall within a gray area .
The New York Times noted earlier that in Elyria , an abnormally high number of angioplasty procedures , which involve enlarging an artery with a balloon and inserting a stent to keep the artery open , were being performed .
And , said the Times , " nearly all the procedures at the Elyria hospital are performed by a group of cardiologists who dominate coronary care in this city and have an unabashed enthusiasm for angioplasties , the highly profitable procedure in which they specialize . "
Similar theories for wild health - care spending have been cited in Texas , a state that had tort reform similar to Ohio's -- and has some of the highest - cost cities in the country when measured for Medicare spending .
" So states that set limits on suing may only be able to go so far , " said Hayes .
This is not to discount entirely the relationship between lawsuits and medical costs .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in October told U.S. Sen .
Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican who favors tort reform , that if caps on civil damages were imposed nationwide , it could reduce national health care spending by about $ 11 billion a year .
Because the government pays a large share of that , nationwide liability reform could cut the federal deficit by $ 54 billion over 10 years , the CBO said .
" From our perspective , tort reforms do have an impact on lowering health insurance costs , and should be a part of the discussion , " said Tim Maglione , senior director for government relations at the Ohio State Medical Association .
" And not according to us but according to the CBO , it can result in savings of $ 54 billion over 10 years . "
But spending on health care is so much greater than that , and 35 states already limit lawsuits in some way .
So those billions , while substantial , would shave only about 0.5 percent off health - care spending nationwide , the CBO said .
That 's not enough to bring down spending anywhere near where economists say it should be .
Health - care spending already accounts for one sixth of the nation 's economy .
" Assuming that the CBO is accurate , or even if they 're off by 100 percent , it still is less than 1 percent of the total cost of the health - care system , " said Dennis Mulvihill , a Cleveland trial attorney and president - elect of the Ohio Association for Justice .
President Barack Obama , who came to Strongsville last week to promote his health - care reform package , has already announced that $ 23 million in grants will be awarded " in the near future " for states that want to work on alternatives to going to court over medical disputes .
Obama told bipartisan congressional leaders on March 2 that he would expand that to $ 50 million if Congress will support it .
But he made clear that he does not believe nationwide tort reform will solve the cost problem .
Nor will it automatically make health insurance more affordable for Americans , experts say .
" And that 's why I think tort reform is not a single panacea , " said Hayes .
" I think it will help on provider insurance rates more than consumer insurance rates . "
ANAHEIM , Calif . --
Teemu Selanne became the 18th player in NHL history to score 600 goals , reaching the milestone Sunday night in the Anaheim Ducks ' 5 - 2 victory over the Colorado Avalanche .
The only other European - born players in the 600 - goal club are Finnish countryman Jari Kurri ( 601 ) and the Czech Republic 's Jaromir Jagr ( 646 ) .
Teemu Selanne is the fourth player to reach the 600 - goal plateau in the last four seasons , joining Jaromir Jagr , Brendan Shanahan and Joe Sakic .

The 39 - year - old Selanne is the fourth player to reach the milestone in the last four seasons , along with Jagr , Brendan Shanahan , and Joe Sakic .
Selanne connected 34 seconds into the second period on his fifth shot of the game , scoring into a wide - open net during a power play with goalie Craig Anderson out of position after a furious scramble in front of the crease .
" I guess that was the easiest I 've had in a while , " Selanne said .
" I 've had a lot of chances the last three games , but nothing went in .
Then you get one of those .
It 's amazing the way my teammates have been feeding me the puck .
I think they wanted this more than I did .
Obviously , it 's a great feeling , and I do n't have to think about it anymore . "
Anderson became the 133rd goalie that Selanne has scored against in the regular season .
Selanne 's first NHL goal came against San Jose 's Jeff Hackett on Oct. 8 , 1992 .
" I remember that like it was yesterday -- Cow Palace against the Sharks , " Selanne said .
" There have been a lot of goals between one and 600 .
Time is flying .
It 's unbelievable how fast it goes .
If somebody would have told me at that time that that I was going to score 600 goals in this league , I would call the doctor . "
Selanne assisted on a power - play goal win by Ryan Getzlaf , the 648th assist of Selanne 's career and the second - lowest total among players who have scored 600 goals .
Bobby Hull had 560 assists -- but son Brett finished his career with just two more than Selanne has now .
Selanne also was on the winning side when he scored his 100th , 200th , 300th and 400th NHL goals .
But the Ducks lost 3 - 2 at Colorado in a shootout when he got his 500th goal on Nov. 22 , 2006 .
Selanne holds the Ducks ' record with 373 goals , most of them with Paul Kariya as his linemate .
His latest milestone came just three days after Kariya got his 400th goal .
" I texted him after that game and told him : ' Maybe I 'll get my 600th soon , too , ' " Selanne said .
" Numbers - wise , I had my best years here with Paul and we helped each other so much .
Not very often can you find the same chemistry that we had .
It was amazing , and they were great memories . "
Selanne burst upon the NHL landscape with the Winnipeg Jets -- now the Phoenix Coyotes -- after being taken with the 10th overall pick in the 1988 draft .
Selanne finished his rookie season with 76 goals , tying Alexander Mogilny for the league lead .
In addition to shattering Mike Bossy 's previous rookie record of 53 goals , Selanne had 110 points to break Peter Stastny 's rookie record and run away with the Calder Trophy .
The 10 - time All - Star was the recipient of the first two Maurice " Rocket " Richard trophies as the NHL's top goal scorer in 1997 - 98 ( 52 ) and 1998 - 99 ( 47 ) and won his first Stanley Cup with the Ducks in 2007 .
Selanne has 21 goals this season , which probably will be his final one in the NHL .
He missed 17 games because of a broken hand , another seven with a fractured jaw , and one more because of flulike symptoms .
Last season , he sat out the first half of the schedule while contemplating retirement .
Selanne , Luc Robitaille and Mario Lemieux are the only players ever to score 600 goals after winning the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year .
Robitaille also reached the milestone at Anaheim , on Nov. 9 , 2001 , while playing for Detroit .
The US Tax Court ruled yesterday that a Massachusetts woman should be allowed to deduct the costs of her sex - change operation , a decision that could have wide implications for transgender people .
Rhiannon O’Donnabhain , who was born a man , sued the Internal Revenue Service after the agency rejected a $ 5,000 deduction for approximately $ 25,000 in medical expenses associated with the sex - change surgery .
The IRS said the surgery was cosmetic and not medically necessary .
In its decision yesterday , the tax court said the IRS position was “ at best a superficial characterization of the circumstances ’’ that is “ thoroughly rebutted by the medical evidence . ’’
The legal group , Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders , which represented O’Donnabhain , said the ruling could potentially affect thousands of people a year in the US who undergo similar operations .
“ I think what the court is saying is that surgery and hormone therapy for transgender people to alleviate the stress associated with gender identity disorder is legitimate medical care , ’’ said Jennifer Levi , a GLAD attorney .
IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge declined to comment on the ruling .
In a 2007 interview with The Associated Press , O’Donnabhain said she underwent gender - reassignment surgery at age 57 , after a tormented existence as a father , husband , Coast Guardsman , and construction worker .
She wrote off the $ 25,000 in medical expenses on her taxes , but the IRS disallowed the deduction , saying the procedure was not a medical necessity .
O’Donnabhain , now 65 , said she brought the lawsuit in an attempt to force the IRS to treat sex - change surgeries the same as appendectomies , heart surgeries , and other deductible medical procedures .
“ It is not OK for them to do this to me or anyone like me , ’’ she said .
O’Donnabhain ’s lawyers argued that because gender - identity disorder is a recognized mental disorder that is generally treated with hormones and surgery , the costs are legitimate medical deductions .
The tax court agreed .
“ The evidence amply supports the conclusions that petitioner suffered from severe GID , that GID is a well - recognized and serious mental disorder , and that hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery are considered appropriate and effective treatments for GID by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who are knowledgeable concerning the condition , ’’ the court said in its ruling .
An estimated 1,600 to 2,000 people a year undergo sex - change surgery in the United States , according to the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association .
The tax court said O’Donnabhain could deduct as a medical care expense the costs associated with treating her gender - identity disorder , except for the costs of breast augmentation surgery , because she had achieved breast enhancement through hormone treatments .

Winter winds howl off the Dakota prairie through Minnesota , turning the 1,100 megawatts worth of wind turbines in Xcel Energy 's system in that state .
By 2020 , the utility expects to more than triple that amount in a bid to avoid more polluting energy sources .
But the wind does n't always blow and , even worse , it often blows strongest when people are n't using much electricity , like late at night .
So Xcel Energy , Inc. , has become one of the first utilities in the U.S. to install a giant battery system in an attempt to store some of that wind power for later .
" Energy storage might help us get to the point where we can integrate wind better , " says Frank Novachek , director of corporate planning for the Minneapolis - based utility with customers in Colorado , Kansas , Michigan , Minnesota , New Mexico , the Dakotas , Oklahoma , Texas and Wisconsin .
" The overall cost of electricity might be lower by using energy storage . "
The energy storage in question — a series of sodium–sulfur batteries from Japan's NGK Insulators , Ltd. — can store roughly seven megawatt - hours of power , meaning the 20 batteries are capable of delivering roughly one megawatt of electricity almost instantaneously , enough to power 500 average American homes for seven hours .
" Over 100 megawatts of this technology [ is ] deployed throughout the world , " Novachek says .
The batteries " store wind at night and they contract with their utility to put out a straight line output from that wind farm every day . "
That removes one of the big hurdles to even broader adoption of wind power : so - called intermittency .
In other words , the wind does n't always blow when you want it to , a problem Texas faced earlier this year when a drop in wind generation forced cuts in electricity delivery .
But with battery backup , the 11 - megawatt wind farm outside Luverne , Minn. , can deliver a set amount of electricity at all times , making it more reliable or , in industry terms , base - load generation .
Plus , the battery effectively doubles the wind farm's output at any given moment — both the megawatt being produced by the wind farm itself ( that would otherwise have gone to charging the battery ) and the megawatt delivered by the battery .
But it is expensive , costing roughly $ 3 million per megawatt plus millions for start - up and testing .
" Right now , they 're a little too expensive , " Novachek says .
But " it 's getting in the ballpark where it looks like the economics might be there .
Testing will help us understand the value . "
So far the battery has been through five charging and recharging cycles and testing will continue through next year , Novachek says .
Other utilities , including the Long Island Power Authority in New York State and American Electric Power in Ohio , have used similar or the same batteries to better manage their grids , but this would represent the first battery to store wind power in the U.S .
The battery is not the only storage experiment Xcel Energy is running :
It has been testing using electricity from wind and solar installations to generate hydrogen and then burn the hydrogen in a generator to turn it back into electricity when as needed .
And the utility has paired with the city of Boulder , Colo. , to test plug - in hybrid electric cars as a means of providing electricity during the day when people are at work and not driving .
" The Midwest is a great [ wind ] resource and we are strategically placed to use that and reduce our carbon footprint , " Novachek notes , by replacing some of the 16 coal - fired plants and 28 natural gas power plants the company now operates .
" New technologies that are out there might really help us get more green than people had hoped — and energy storage is one of those . "
* Editor 's Note ( posted 12/30/08 ) :
As noted by a few of our commenters , it would have been useful to know the specific total cost of the battery system .
We asked Xcel Energy for that figure , but they would not say , and NGK Insulators could not be reached for comment .
Although a woman 's role in the home varies , a recent study shows that people favor not only a mother , but also her child and their relationship when she is not employed outside the home full time .
A Kansas State University study evaluated the perceptions people have of women and their children based on the woman 's work status .
The findings showed that people value , and do not differentiate between , mothers who stay in the home full time and mothers who find a compromise between working and at - home motherhood after they have a child .
People also devalue mothers employed full time outside the home , relative to their non-employed counterparts , and perceive their children to be troubled and their relationships to be problematic .
" The most interesting , and potentially dangerous , finding is the view that if a child has a working mother , people do n't like that child as much , " said Jennifer Livengood , a K - State graduate student in psychology from Sweet Springs , Mo . " People really devalue a mom who works full time outside the home in comparison to a mom who does n't .
People like mothers who fulfill traditional stereotypes , like staying at home .
That 's just not a reality and not a preference for women as much as it used to be . "
Livengood did the study for her master 's thesis and collaborated with K - State 's Mark Barnett , professor of psychology .
The research was presented by Tammy Sonnentag , doctoral student in psychology from Edgar , Wis. , at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology conference in January .
Previous research has shown that people rate stay - at - home moms as more likeable than mothers employed outside the home .
While studies have shown that many women now would like more of a compromise between staying home full time and working outside the home full time , Livengood said there is little research on the perceptions of mothers who pursue this middle ground .
" I 've always been interested in how women are viewed based on their choice to work outside the home , or not , after they have a child , " Livengood said .
advertisement
The researchers did a study involving undergraduate students , all of whom were single , and 99 percent of the sample had no children .
Each participant first listened to one of three interviews that reflected a working mother , a stay - at - home mother and what the researchers called a middle mother .
The working mother said in the interview that she went back to work two weeks after giving birth and worked more than 40 hours per week .
The stay - at - home mother reported having stopped working outside of the home after giving birth .
The middle mother described taking 18 months away from work after giving birth and then going back to work part time and gradually increasing her work hours .
" As a cover story , the participants were led to believe that there were many mother - child pairs being evaluated to see if people could tell if there were problems in the relationship , " Livengood said .
Then , each participant watched the same video of a mother and her 4 - year - old son completing a puzzle and playing a game together .
Because of the audiotape , the participants either thought she was a working mother , a stay - at - home mother or a middle mother .
The participants then filled out a questionnaire that evaluated their perception of the mother .
They rated statements like , " She does a good job as a mom . "
They also filled out a questionnaire about their perceptions of the child and responded to statements like , " This child is well - adjusted . "
The last questionnaire regarded their perception of the mother - child relationship , such as if they thought the pair worked well together .
advertisement
The findings showed that the participants did n't differentiate between the stay - at - home mother and middle mother , but they did devalue the working mother in comparison .
Livengood said the similar ratings for the two mothers might indicate that individuals understand women need a compromise .
Findings also showed that not only did the participants devalue the mother who worked outside the home full time , but they also extended that negative perception to the child and their relationship .
" By just telling them the mother 's work status -- by just manipulating that one variable -- it was strong enough for participants to discriminate between the children of working mothers and the other two mothers , as well as between their relationships , " Livengood said .
She said these findings might indicate that people perceive the child of a working mother to have a higher incidence of behavioral and adjustment problems and their relationship to be relatively cold and troubled .
She said this perception might be specific to the sample of undergraduate students .
If not , it could mean that people treat children of working mothers differently and have negative expectations , which could initiate a self - fulfilling prophecy with the child .
" Women are going to continue working , and they 're going to continue having children , " Livengood said .
" Knowing how their decisions in these arenas are perceived by others may help us understand the foundations of these potential biases and identify ways to support mothers in their work - family decisions . "

If you think about it , a hamburger is essentially a meatloaf for one , and vis a vis , a meatloaf is just a GIANT HAMBURGER .
Thus , the base of this meatloaf comes from my recipe for Japanese Hamburgers , which is actually the first dish I ever learned to make .
My aunt would make them whenever she visited from Japan , and I remember writing the recipe down in this old notebook back when I was a kid thinking , “ ONE DAY THIS WILL BE FILLED WITH RECIPES AND I WILL BE AWESOME . ”
That was the only recipe I ever wrote down , so FAIL .
But anyway , this recipe essentially combines Japanese Hamburgers with Curry Pan , which is a popular bread in Japanese bakeries that ’s essentially a bun filled with curry , crusted in panko , and fried ; a curry donut if you will .
Some variations of the curry bun have a cube of mozzarella in the center , and it ’s AWESOME .
So I figure , mix cubes of mozzarella into the meatloaf itself , and envelop the whole thing in a curry panko crust .
Yeah , yeah , yeah ?
SO LET ’S BEGIN .
— WuNotWoo
Test Kitchen Notes
This is the best meatloaf I have ever made .
This is also the best meatloaf I have ever eaten .
This can't even be put into the same boring category as every other meatloaf that has ever been made , period .
Tim 's instinct to make a Japanese hamburger into a meatloaf , and then add the curry sauce and then , of all things , mozzarella , is simply inspired .
This is a crunchy little flavor bomb .
It 's simply a great fusion of Japanese flavors and down - home country - comfort cooking .
I had a great time making it , and though the ingredients needed may not be in every chef 's pantry , it 's worth tracking them down to not only cook this dish but to open up new flavor profiles for those who do n't cook with mirin , dashi , and Japanese curry every day .
A+ , and well done .
Note : S&B curry is the most well - known " oriental curry powder " , apparently .
Finding instant curry roux was easy in NYC , but I might include the " from scratch " method as well ( making the roux from flour , curry , butter , etc. ) for those who do n't have access to Japanese grocers .
I assumed that Tim was cooking with liquid dashi , but his use of instant curry roux almost had me thinking of using instant ( powdered ) dashi as well .
If the recipe were to be revised a bit I 'd explain what dashi he used , and / or how you can make it from scratch ( which is what I did , since I had konbu and bonito on hand already ) vs. buying the instant version .
Overall , I loved it .
And I will be cooking his recipes again .

Visualizing Maps Using Incanter
When I first saw Mathematica 's WorldPlot function I was impressed , its a nice way to visualize various forms of geographical data , for some time I thought this should be a very labor intensive task , who would go around labeling each pixel .
Couple of days ago I somehow ended up reading the Processing article on Wikipedia , it contains an example which shows a map of the results of the 2008 USA presidential election , turns out using Scalable Vector Graphics implementing WorldPlot functionality is extremely easy .
We will be plotting how population moved between different regions in Turkey ( in to and out of a region ) .
I am using data provided by The Turkish Statistical Institute , you can grab the map I used from Wikipedia here .
( ns worldplot.core ( :use [ incanter core processing ] ) ) ;;
Data for 2009 ( def pop- taken [ { :id 1 : name " Marmara " : population 582771} { :id 2 : name " Iç Anadolu " : population 297919} { : id 3 : name " Ege " : population 164896 } { :id 4 : name " Akdeniz " : population 188441} { :id 5 : name " Karadeniz " : population 256654} { :id 6 : name " Güneydoğu Anadolu " : population 171910} { :id 7 : name " Doğu Anadolu " : population 214082} ] ) ( def pop - given [ { :id 1 : name " Marmara " : population 677395 } { :id 2 : name " Iç Anadolu " : population 310293} { :id 3 : name " Ege " : population 181459} { : id 4 : name " Akdeniz " : population 193231} { :id 5 : name " Karadeniz " : population 247397} { :id 6 : name " Güneydoğu Anadolu " : population 118611} { :id 7 : name " Doğu Anadolu " : population 148287} ] )
Turkey is divided in to seven geographical regions , pop -taken represents how many people moved in to that particular region and pop - given represents how many people moved out of that region during 2009 .
( defn region - color [ val min max ] ( lerp - color ( color 0xffd120 ) ( color 0x920903 ) ( norm val min max ) ) )
In order to paint the map like a heat map , we need to assign colors using the amount of people moved in or out of a region , given a min , max and a value in between norm will normalize a value to exist between 0 and 1 , lerp - color on the other hand will calculate a color between the given range using the normalized value .
So our map will go from yellow to dark red depending on the people moved .
( defn map - region - color [ regions ] ( let [ min ( apply min ( map #( : population % ) regions ) ) max ( apply max ( map #( : population % ) regions ) ) ] ( map #( vector ( : id % ) ( region - color ( : population % ) min max ) ) regions ) ) )
Now all we need to do is calculate min and max values in the data set , iterate over the data set and return a sequence of [ id color ] pairs .
( defn sktch [ regions ] ( sketch ( setup [ ] ) ( draw [ ] ( let [ tr - map ( load - shape this " MapTurkishProvincesNumbers.svg " ) ] (. shape this tr-map 0 0 ) ( doseq [ region ( map- region - color regions ) ] ( let [ [ id color ] region child ( . get Child tr-map ( str id ) ) ] ( .disableStyle child ) ( . fill this color ) ( . noStroke this ) (. shape this child 0 0 ) no - loop ) ) ) ) ) )
Using incanter - processing library , we can load and access parts of the SVG map .
Processing sketches are made up of the functions setup and draw , in setup as its name suggests you setup your stuff frame rate , stroke properties etc .
Draw will be called once or multiple times depending on your frame rate , we load the map as a shape then paint it on the canvas , then we iterate over the data set , using getChild method of the PShape class we can access parts of the image , the map we are using has 7 children named 1 through 7 corresponding to the geographical regions of the country , we get the child then paint it using the color we calculated on to the canvas .
One thing to note , sketch macro just returns a PApplet so for any function not implemented in incanter , you can access them just like any other Java function .
Now lets see the results ,
( view ( sktch pop - given ) : size [ 1052 744 ] )

The horrible earthquake in Haiti , again very starkly and sharply , raises the question , the issue , about God and God ’s relationship to the world .
In particularly God ’s relationship to what we call natural calamities , earthquakes , floods , fires , tsunamis , tidal waves , all destructions of storms , hurricanes like Katrina .
Everytime those horrible things happen and especially when you have very large , vivid , images before your eyes on television , seemingly endlessly , of all this terrible terrible suffering and we do n’t even know how many are yet dead in Haiti , over 100,000 perhaps , millions homeless , suffering .
We have to think about all of these things especially those that are believers .
Those who claim to believe in God .
Of course when these things happen you hear all kinds of things , people give their opinion about why they happen .
I ’ve come across already opinions of everyone , from Pat Roberton to Patriach Kiril of Moscow and the Russian Orthodox Church .
They ’ll say things about it .
When the tsunami happened there were magazine articles by Orthodox thinkers like David Bentley Hart who wrote about these things and this issue of , some times called Theodicy , how do we square the existence of God , particularly a good God , a beneficent God , a wise — strong God .
A God who can allegedly do whatever he wants .
Why does he do what he does ?
And of course there are people who say these kind of things really prove that there is no God .
That we are just at the mercy of nature and how nature acts and there is really no ultimate meaning to any of this at all .
The best we can hope for is some kind of pleasure and long life on earth and if that would be the case we ’d much rather live in San Francisco than in Haiti or somewhere else in Africa or Asia .
I mean I say San Francisco because virtually all of us know that the San Francisco area is an area for earthquakes .
But we also know that there was an earthquake in San Francisco in the 1990s , I ca n’t remember the exact year , 1998 , 1993 .
But in any case , very recently , where it was exactly the magnitude of what hit Haiti and in San Francisco 63 people died .
63 not 110,000 or however many will finally be added up .
63 people are still 63 people who have perished , which leads to a first reflection about dealing with calamities .
You know , in my life time you hear many people who would say , for example , they say about England and Europe generally that , I read this when I was reading about Darwin for my other talks here on the radio , that people had a very progressive , optimistic , positive view of human life and then the Lisbon earthquake hit .
Many many people were all of a sudden killed and that made people have very great troubles about optimism and faith and God or human progress or whatever , and then you hear certainly the same type of things about the 20th century .
How can there be a God when billions of people were slain and killed and were put to death to gas chambers by Nazis .
Millions of Jews and homosexual people , slavs and who knows who .
And then in Russia you have all this massive death in these prison camps .
Solzhenitsyn is said to have said , that communism , marxism in Soviet Union brought 70 million deaths .
70 million if you count the war dead , the famine dead , the prison camp dead , the people dead from famine and hunger and stress and decease and so on .
So this fact of death , and then of course we have in our country America , people still reacting to the terrorist attack on America on Sep 11 2001 .
They ’ll say , “ Oh look at this terrorist attack .
Why did God do it ?
Why did God allow it ? ” and in that terrorist attack little over 3000 people perished , 3000 people died .
And other people will take that statistic , like I myself will do , and say “ You know more people than that die all the time all over the place by calamities and by murders and by human evil and by natural disaster ” .
The things that sometimes insurance companies call “ Acts of God ” — floods and fires and so on .
I can honestly say that from my youth , in my young years , I always could n’t quite understand why calamities of tremendous magnitude bring out these questions and cause questions and even cause a lot of people to lose their faith — ” ( God ) After Auschwitz ” and all those kind of books .
When as a matter of fact you could ask the same questions about , what about God after the death of my child ?
What about God after the death of my mother ?
What about God after the death of my neighbour ?
What about God after anybody ’s death ?
And whether that death is violent , tragic , by murder or rape or whether it ’s surrounded by family in a bed at home at the age of 90 .
Death is still death and then if you add the addition of suffering , and how much suffering you see .
If you want to see tremendous suffering just walk into a hospital ward , go to an intensive ward .
Go into a , especially , go into a institution for the mentally ill who are also physically ill .
You ’ll see sights you ’ll not want to see .
Not to speak of all that we see on TV like in Rwanda , in Ethiopia and those places , Darfur and so on .
We are surrounded by calamities all the time , every day they are happening .
Calamities which seem just to happen because of plates under the earth that move and cause the earth to quake and cause the sea to rise and huge waves and tsunamis come and wipe people out , and then you have all kinds of tragedies .
Then you have the human tragedy .
Some crazy person who shoots 15 children or something like this .
This is going on all the time , all the time .
I think it would be true to say , as someone once said , “ one death is a tragedy , a thousand deaths , a hundred thousand deaths , a million deaths is a statistic ” , because each human being died himself , herself .
Each person died and then when you see death that is preceded by incredible suffering , terrible suffering , and then when you see death that is connected with torture , like people being caught under buildings for days on end and screaming and finally die .
You can even think of the death , I always think of the death of St Elizabeth — the Grand duchess , that great modern saint of the Russion Orthodox Church , who was thrown with her friends , the nun Barbara and others , in to a mine shaft and the witnesses said you could hear them singing down there .
They were singing “ Holy God , Holy Mightly , Holy Immortal have mercy on us ” , singing the Cherubic hymn or something until they died .
Knowning that they were going to die and starving and not being able to breathe , I mean , you could imagine all kinds of suffering , like you do n’t even want to imagine .
But when we look at all of that there are some things that we have to see .
First things that we have to see is that different people do it differently .
Different people understand it differently .
There was a survivor of the Jewish Holocaust , Victor Frankl who wrote in a book , I ca n’t remember the name of the book right now , he said that , what a difference he had observed in the prison camp between those who believed , who had hope and those who did n’t .
Those who did n’t easily and quickly and bitterly and he said he saw people walking to the gas chambers on their two feet saying the Shema Yisrael , “ Hear , O Israel : the LORD he is one , ” or saying the Lord ’s Prayer , “ Our Father who art in heaven … ” and they walked in and died .
And many of them died not cursing the people who killed them .
That would be of course the ideal for a Christian martyr .
That you not only die for what you believe , and you not only die praising God , and you not only die in the midst of horrible suffering but you die actually forgiving the persons who did this .
But then the question would be , what if it seems to be that there is no persons who did this ?
What if it is God who did this ?
It ’s God who made the earthquake and got everybody perishing and some people say it is because they were sinners and God wanted to punish them or something .
That is some kind of interpretation you might hear which in my opinion is absolutely outrageously blasphemous , just absolutely unacceptable .
But at the same time even if the crimes are , as they say on TV , perpetrated by evil doers , still somehow people could ask why did God allow that .
Why did he even make a world with evil doers in it ?
Why did he do it the way he did and could he have not stopped it ?
Could God have not stopped those terrorists for example for blowing up the World Trade Center and the Pentagon or the hotel in Mumbai or wherever else ?
Could God not have stopped Nazis with Hitler and Stalinist troops and Marxists madmen and I do n’t know what , people who do genocides and so on , could God have not stopped it ?
Well , most people would say , sure he could have stopped it if he wanted to but then that raises the question , if he could have stopped it why did he even start it in the first place ?
Why did he allow it in the first place .
When you see in the scripture the Lord Jesus can walk on water in the midst of storms you say , well that ’s great but you could also ask the question , why did God make storms in the first place ?
Why should there be storms in which people would perish ?
If you could say , Jesus Christ fed the hungry , who were in the desert , you could say , well that ’s great , but you could also ask the question , why if there is God , did God make the world in which people would be hungry in the first place ?
Why did n’t he make a world where there would be no hunger and no rich or poor , no evil doers and so on .
These are the questions that rise all the time .
How do you answer them ?
What is the response ?
Now , it seems to me , and this Ancient Faith Radio gives me the opportunity to express my opinions , which I always say could be totally wrong , please dear listener know that !
I can only say on the radio how I understand things .
How I believe things to be and then of course , how I understand things and believe things to be , I would even dare to claim are the teachings of Holy Scriptures and the teachings of the Saints , the teachings of the Orthodox Church .
The teachings that you gleam from the Church ’s prayers , that you say in Church .
How we pray , how we act .
Certainly what you see in the lives of Saints .
So when we try to answer the questions , when I would try to answer the question I have to honestly say to you , I am trying to answer the question as a person who believes in the Orthodox Christian faith .
Who goes to an Orthodox Christian church .
Who identifies with the tradition and teaching and scriptures and saints and services and sacraments of this Church .
So if somebody would corner me and say to me , ok you go to that Church and you believe in those scriptures and you serve those services and you celebrate those sacraments and you honour and emulate and even try to imitate those saints , what would you say about all this ?
What would you say about Haiti , that horrible suffering , that earthquake ?
What would you say about tsunamis and disasters both natural and humanly caused or directly humanly caused , like prison camps and so on .
What do you say , what do you say about how your God , how do you believe in God if you believe in those things ?
And I ’ve said on the radio before that my opinion is that there is only three possible answers .
One answer is , there is no God at all , and all of this is just sound and fury , it signifies nothing , it is purely accidental .
Earthquakes depend completely and solely on plates under the earth and how they move around , how they move the earth and how they move the waters and how they produce tidal waves .
Air and fire and water and earth they all have their own ways of behaving which are chaotic and are connected to all kinds of forces in the universe and there is nothing controlling it , there is no meaning to it ultimately , we just hope for the best .
That if you are going to be in an earthquake , that you are going to be in San Francisco and not Haiti , where in San Francisco they have buildings that are built to withstand earthquakes and then you hope that you are in one of them .
You do n’t pray to God that you would be , you just hope that you would be by pure accident so that you would not perish like those children and those poor people in Haiti because their houses were so poorly done and they were in such poverty and had such terrible economics that once an earthquake strikes there then the death toll is unbelievable .
That is one way .
Another way would be to say that there is a God but he is a monster .
And that he just picks and chooses what he wants to do .
That he decides .
I ’ll have an earthquake in Haiti !
I think I ’ve blast out Haiti !
I ’ll just do it , they are not any better / worse than anybody else and I do n’t even care about that , I am a monster .
I just want to terrorise people .
So , I ’ll have this one be saved and I ’ll have that one die and I ’ll have this one lose their legs and I ’ll have that one go blind and it will be my sovereign will to do whatever I want with people and I will it do as I want it and maybe even this God would say , if there are people who believe in me and follow my commandments I ’ll spare them and then I ’ll smash the other people and then hopefully some lesson will come out of that .
That is a way of looking at it .
All those ways are possible ways of looking at it if you are going to have a deity at all .
But then I think there is a third way and I personally subscribe to the third way and I believe ancient Christianity does too and that is , that you understand everything through the crucifixion of Christ .
You understand everything through Christ .
Christ and him crucified .
Christ and him suffering .
Being beaten , mocked , spit upon , scourged , whipped , thorns on him head , nailed to a cross , tied to a tree , nailed to the cross through his hands , spear in his side and dying the most vile , radical death that a human being can die .
That is the key to understanding everything .
And it is the key to understanding everything , with the additional claim , that this man is God ’s son .
That this man is God .
He is God from God .
He is divine .
He has exactly the same divinity , the same nature as they say in theology , the same exact identical divinity as God his father .
That is begotten of God .
He comes forth from God .
He is not a creature .
He is begotten not created , as the Nicene Creed says , and that he is the one by whom , through whom , for whom , and toward whom everything exists .
Everything .
The hundred billion galaxies with the hundred thousand billion stars .
He is the key to understanding — everything .
And so this , this crucified Jew , is God ’s son and he ’s born of a virgin .
He is born on earth of a virgin .
That means that he is not a mere human being .
He is born as real human being .
He is really human and here I have to just add parenthetically , every day as the clock ticks , I am more and more convinced that Christians generally and even Orthodox Christians , do not really believe in the Incarnation .
That a lot of people who came to be Christians — well , there are a lot of people claiming to be Christians who do n’t believe that Jesus is divine , that is one thing , but even those who believe that Jesus is divine , they especially , do not believe that he really became a man , really born of a virgin , really the suffering servant , really endured what he did , really had a human life with a human brain and a human body and human feelings and human passions , human emotions and that means human ignorance , that means human limitations .
I really , honestly — especially when I get these emails from the listeners of Ancient Faith Radio , I have this impression that they do n’t really believe in the Incarnation .
“ Oh , Jesus was God but he really knew , he could have done this , he could have smashed everybody , could have done this , could have done that . ”
Well there is a sense that humanly he could have done a lot of things .
He himself even said , he could call angels and wipe out the Roman Empire , he said that .
He said that he has power over the waves and the water , he showed that .
He showed that he could feed poor people in the desert .
He showed that he could heal every manner of decease .
He showed that he could raise the dead .
He did , and he did that in his humanity .
In his divine humanity .
He , being God , becoming man through his humanity , he did these things .
But he did them as a man .
He did them as Jesus of Nazareth and therefore for Christians , the Incarnation of the Son of God in human flesh as a real human being , for the sake of being crucified , suffering , dying , and then rising the dead and recreating creation , that is the prism through which we understand everything .
That ’s how we understand everything that goes on , no matter what it is .
That ’s how we understand it .
That ’s how we try to understand it at least .
That ’s how we come to understand it , if understanding is even possible , and there many things that are just not possible for us to understand .
You know , the Saints of the Church say we ca n’t understand everything , and when it comes to God we ca n’t understand in fact most things .
But there are things we can understand .
And then they also say , there are some things that given our present state of humanity , in the fallen world — this corrupted world we live in , you might even put this way , given to the state to which we have progressed and evolved as a human race , we are still not even capable of understanding certain things .
We just do n’t have the ability or the capability of understanding certain things .
And here I ’d even take it a step further , I would say that according to the lives of Christian Saints and the Holy Scriptures , it ’s only those who really do n’t want to understand those things but trust God that he knows what he is doing , they are the ones to come to understand it .
I gave a little sermon on this on St Anthony day which was just recently in our church .
St Anthony the Great , when he asked God he said , why do things happen the way they do ?
Why are there some who live long and some who die young ?
Why do some suffer and some do n’t ?
Why are some good and seem to be suffering all the time ?
Why are there evil people who seem to be just having a wonderful life , and he could have asked , why are there hurricanes here or there ?
Why are there earthquakes , why are there fires ?
Why do these people perish ?
You know that question was even in the New Testament , the 13th chapter of Luke .
In the 13th chapter of Luke , Jesus kind of refers to this in his teaching because there was the Galileans who suffered — I ’ll read it to you ,
“ There were some present at that very time who told him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with the sacrifices ” , in other words Pilate had killed these Galileans and Jesus said to them , “ Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all of the other Galileans because they suffered this way ?
I tell you no .
But unless you repent you also will perish likewise .
And the eighteen upon whom the tower of Saloam fell and killed them , do you think they were worse offenders than all the others who dwelled in Jerusalem ?
I tell you no .
But unless you repent you ’ll also likewise perish . ”
Now , did he mean perish in some kind of calamity or did he mean ultimately perish ?
The one thing he said for sure , Jesus Christ himself , he said , you ca n’t say because these people perished and those did n’t that they were better and they were worse .
He says no .
That ’s not so .
Jesus said so .
And very often he says , “ two will be in bed , one will be taken , one will be left .
Two women at the mill , one taken , one left . ”
You know there is this mystery about , we do n’t know how it goes .
We know that God is behind it , at least the believers believe that God is behind it but how he is working it and what he ’s doing , it remains a great mystery but it cannot be said , well this is happening to them because they are evil and this does n’t happen to them because they are good .
I mean just look around you .
How many evil people prosper and how many good people do n’t .
How many evil people are healthy and live long , and never are in an earthquake and how many good people are standing in Church praying and the earthquake smashes the building and they all perish .
I was recently in a mission in California , the ruins of a mission , where an earthquake hit and it fell on all the people while they were at mass and they perished , including the priest .
Ok , figure that one out .
But you ’ve got to face those things .
So St Anthony , getting back to him , when he asked God and said , “ why are these things this way ? ” , well it is very important to know that God said to Anthony , “ Anthony , pay attention to yourself , it is of no benefit to you at all to know anything about these things .
You live your life as you should and you keep the commandments and let me take care of the rest . ”
But in my opinion that ’s not the end of the story .
The story kind of continues .
You know why ?
Because Anthony did do that , he did pay attention to himself .
He did pray , he did fast , he did everything and boy , he got beaten up by demons and he was left half dead , all that he went through and finally he said to God , “ where the heck are you God ” — this is in the life of St Athanasius , Life of Anthony , it is written , — and God comes and says , “ Anthony I ’ve been here the whole time watching your suffering ” and you know you might be able to add if you are a biblical person , “ who do you think was sending you the suffering ?
who was sending the demons to you ?
You think a demon can test you without my permission without my sending ?
Oh no , that is not so . ”
He said , “ But since you have endured , since you have believed , your name will be known for ever all throughout the whole world ” and here we are in 2010 contemplating the Haitian earthquake and raising the name of Anthony to try to come to terms with it .
Well , the thing is this , Anthony followed God ’s advice and guess what ?
He came to know , he came to have insight into divine providence .
St Maximus says that if we look at things through the prism of Christ with faith , we can actually have insight into divine providence .
We can actually see the hands of God in things for good that otherwise would never see .
One thing you will never see , never , is that God simply , capriciously , decides to have some perish and some live or that he punishes some because he thinks they ’re evil and then lets other live because he thinks they are good .
That ’s not it at all .
Because the crucified Christ died for everybody .
And there are n’t any good .
If Pat Robertson thinks he is good and therefore he is spared , he ought to read the parable of the Publican and the Pharisee and be a little bit more careful .
Have a little more fear of God .
Because who knows , a person could be allowed by God to live a long life only to perish in hell , where the person who suffers terribly in his human life and is caught even in the midst of an earthquake , he may be saved .
And it is amazing how many of those Haitians are still praying , still singing , and still thanking God .
It ’s amazing .
And how many people there are in happy suburban homes in America where they have everything they can possibly want and they are in despair and they curse
God their only pleasure in life is sex and money and pleasure , and they do n’t even get pleasure out of that .
So it is a great mystery here what is going on .
But you can only , at least if an Orthodox Christian would say , you can only , somehow , come to terms with it when you understand and believe in Christ , crucified Christ , crucified !
St Paul said , what we preach is Christ and him crucified .
Scandal to those who want the power God who just takes care of his own , folly to people who think that there can be a God that is governing the universe the way they see it , with all of it ’s capricious calamities and all of these kind of stuff .
But for us who believe , Christ crucified and glorified , is he wisdom and the power of God and it is in him , as St Paul has also written , that the mysteries hidden from before the foundation of the world are ultimately revealed for what they are .
The mystery hidden even from the angels , made know in the Church , is revealed for what it is .
Now , what is it ?
What could you possibly say that it is ?
Well , my opinion , God forgive me , you have to decide , my opinion is that it is something like this .
The truth is somewhere around here .
Around this view , if you are a Christian .
First of all , you do n’t begin with your idea of God .
And you do n’t begin with how you think our God ought to be and then question whether he exists or not .
If you are a Christian you take the God of Jesus .
And the God of Jesus is the one who sent his Son into the world to perish and when that Son was hanging on the cross , betrayed by his own people , killed by gentiles , all alone , a spectacle to God and man , and he screams out , “ My God , my God , why have you abandoned me — why have you forsaken me ? ” and that is the first line of Psalm 22 that says , but I know you are there , I know you are with me .
I know that you are my God .
But why is this happening ?
Well you ’ve got to do that .
You ’ve got cry out , why ?
If you do n’t cry out why you ’ll never come to see and Jesus came to see why .
I mean the answer that he probably came to hear was , “ because you are the bride groom .
The one by who , through who , for whom , all things were made .
And you ’ll have to suffer all these things so that the world could actually exist . ”
Which leads us then to another very , very , central dogma , this is a dogma of the Orthodox Christian Church .
And that is , that God created heaven and earth and all things visible and invisible knowing that all these things would be this way .
That there would be hurricanes and tsunamis , and earthquakes and tragedies and injustices and persecutions and prison camps .
God did all that !
Yeah , God did it !
If you are a Christian you ca n’t get off the hook .
You believe in God — God did it .
He did it .
But you could even go to the next step and you could maybe even speculate , on the basis of scripture and the divine revelation that is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus hanging on the cross , is that God creates everything that can possible be created .
I think that that , in my opinion , could even be a Christian doctrine .
If anything could possibly exist , God creates it .
And he creates everything , including evil .
Everything he creates is good , he does n’t create evil .
But he certainly creates creatures that he knew would be evil .
Take for example , the Christian teaching about the noetic realm , the angels .
It is certainly the Christian teaching that God created the “ cosmos noetos ” ( Gr. “ Κόσμος Νοητ ό ς ” ) — the bodiless powers , billions and billions of spiritual beings without bodies , pure intellects , that he knew would rebel .
That some of those angels , the symbolic number is a third of them , they plunge and become demons .
They become devils .
They pollute the universe .
They are infecting everything , they are trying to destroy everything .
Why did God do that ?
Well he did it because he creates everything that can exist , even those that would be evil .
You can almost say , according to the Sermon on the Mountain , God does n’t just love those who love him .
He loves everybody .
He loves the unjust as well as the just .
He creates people that he knows will be unjust and maybe burn forever in hell .
He creates them anyway and gives them that choice , that freedom , how to act and interact with him .
And if he did not do that he would not be just .
God does not say , if you are good I ’ll like you and I ’ll take care of you and I ’ll keep from earthquakes .
That ’s just ridiculous .
Because first of all there are n’t any people , beginning with I do n’t know who , Pat Robertson and who ever it might be , me or you .
There are n’t any such persons .
We are all sinners , we are all in need of salvation .
Even the most righteous person , the Holy Theotokos Virgin Mary — who gave birth to Christ , call God her Saviour because she is part of this world that is perishing .
And you are part of this world and you are perishing no matter how good you are or how bad you are , you are in it .
However it is the teaching , that God created all things , and certainly the planet earth , and animals and plants and fishes and birds and ants and barnacles and earthworms and God knows what Charles Darwin studied and everything else , he created all of that for his glory and to live and to exist , and to be beautiful , and to be splendid and it will be that way .
Ultimately Christians believe it will be that way .
Christians also believe that it can only be that way .
When it is governed and cared for by Christians who are good , who are true , who are God like .
Who believe in God , and here we believe in saying nowadays that it might even mean people who do n’t believe in God but are good people because they are all screwed up because of the people who do believe in God , like you and me .
St Paul says “ many good people blaspheme God because of us ” .
God says in Isaiah , “ My name is blasphemed amongst the nations because of you , who claim to be my believers and say all kinds of stupid , disgusting , wrong things because you ’ve made up your own God and you give him my name . ”
We are in trouble if we do that .
But in any case , I believe the Christian teaching is that God created — you know if you read Genesis , it ’s like chaos in the beginning .
It ’s formless , it ’s invisible .
There is the waters , primal , God ’s word and spirit are over the waters and then all things come into existence , and we can discuss how they are going to come into existence — we ’ll do that on our reflections on Darwinism , but in any case , Christians believe that God ’s hands are in it all .
But the Genesis story is very clear too .
At one point God , himself , acts and brings into the world a creature called human , called man — anthropos .
And it is man and woman , male and female , and according to the story he puts them in paradise and where they are , it ’s paradise and they can now be with God .
They can now have divine powers , they can be as God .
As long as they are with God , they can be with God and they can take care of everything and in a sense even they can spread the paradise , and they can overcome all the chaos of the cosmos or to put it another way , they can transform chaos into cosmos .
Disorder into order .
And it might even be , some people think so — I think C. S. Lewis thought so , that he fall of the angels and their corruption of the created order , antedated the emergence of man on earth .
That the demons fell when God created man in his image and likeness and the symbolic theology would say they were envious or jealous or they rebelled against God , but one thing is for sure .
If you take the Genesis story as it is written the devils are already there before Adam and Eve appear , because the serpent comes to them and the serpent tempts them and says , “ Follow me .
Follow me .
Do n’t follow God .
God does n’t want you to be like God .
Or if you follow me , you will be like God but God does n’t want that . ”
That ’s the fundamental lie of evil .
So we might say that the plan , if you look at it through the prism of the cross , is that we were all made to care for the earth .
We were made to cultivate the earth , to bring the Shalom , the peace of God to the earth .
To bring the peace of God to the animals , to the plants , to nature and nature itself was in a kind of vicious cycle and that somehow maybe even how animals and plants are supposed to be .
Maybe that ’s even the way God wants them to be .
But man is supposed to care for them and use them and cultivate them and bring peace to them .
That was the vocation of man according to the scripture .
And it is a vocation humanity miserably failed .
So we could actually say , if we jump over a whole lot of intermediate points , that if human beings , were human beings , the way God created human beings to be , in other words we could put it as Christians , if we were the way Jesus is , if we remain sons of God , male and female , before God , filled with the Holy Spirit , not listening to the Devil , facing all the temptations of evil but not succumbing to them , we would control the universe .
We would control earthquakes , floods , fires and so on , and we even have saints who did it .
We have saints who stopped earthquakes .
We have saints who were able to show that they could bring peace to the animals and to the plants and so on .
In other words , when we are with God we can control this earth .
We can control it , to a very large degree , even without God because we are made in God ’s image and likeness and we have all these powers .
For example , we can have seismographs .
We can tell where earthquakes are going to happen .
We can warn people to flee away .
They say that in the tsunami that happened a year ago , where all those people perished , they say that if those men had been on duty and made the warning come on time , the way it should have , the loss of life would have been incredibly less .
We also know that , like we said already about San Francisco , if we knew our universe , if we knew how things were , if we knew how to predict happenings , like winds and rains and storms and hurricane Katrinas and all that stuff , and if we knew the universe and if knew how to handle it , and if we knew how to protect ourselves from it , there could be no disasters .
There would be magnificent natural happenings .
We ’d see violent storms and tsunamis but they would n’t hurt anybody or we would have control over them , or we ’d know how to deal with them .
So when all is said and done , in the Christian view , all of this is our fault .
Haitian earthquake , Haiti , that ’s our fault .
If we , human beings , controlled the universe the way God created us to do it , no one would perish , ever , of anything .
And we would n’t even have died .
Maybe the animal world would be cyclical , the plant world would be cyclical — some of the early Church Fathers thought so , like St Irenaeus for example — that plants have to grow and die and people have to eat them and after Noah we even eat the animals and there is a kind of strife in the animal world .
But we are the ones that are supposed to govern and care for them .
No contribute to it .
Not make it worse .
But to heal it , to cure it .
Now , with that view , we Christians would definitely say that we believe that because of Jesus .
Because Jesus , the Christ , showed us .
The life of a man , who has power over all nature .
That ’s the reason of the miracles of Jesus .
My professor of New Testament used to say , “ We call them Wonders .
The Wonders of God , we call them miracles and then we define them as things contrary to nature . ”
But maybe they are not really contrary to nature .
Maybe the real miracle is to know how to handle nature , how to deal with nature , how to relate to nature and maybe even to have some kind of power over nature because of the powers that are in inherent in us that are given to us by God , when they are used properly , when they are used for good .
When they are used for God ’s glory and the good of our neighbour .
And we all know , it just would be hypocrisy and lying to say , we all know that if we , human beings , used the knowledge and the powers and the wisdom that we have , we could so reduce suffering and evil on this earth it would n’t be funny .
I doubt if we ’d raise the dead but that would be also in what we ’d need to do with Jesus .
The dead have to be raised .
And here this would be another teaching of ours .
Everyone who perished in the Haitian earthquake will be resurrected .
That ’s a Christian teaching .
Everyone who perished in a prison camp will be resurrected .
The good and the evil will be resurrected , on the last day , that ’s the Gospel .
Those who have done good will come forth to a resurrection of life and those who have done evil , and not only done evil but allowed evil to happen because they did n’t do the good they could do — the sin of omission as well as commission — they will give an answer for what they have done .
Take the abortion of children that we ’re thinking about here in these days .
We could just as easily not abort them .
We could just as easily care for them .
We could just as easily find ways to take care ourselves and not have the hubris of trying to be God without God and making everything a million times worse mess than it ever could possibly be .
No , the buck ultimately ends with human beings .
And that is even the meaning of the Adam and Eve story .
It seems to me , the whole meaning of the Adam and Eve story is , human beings were created to govern and care for the earth in communion with God , by keeping his commandments .
St Basil said this in the anaphora of his Eucharist .
That we were created to glorify God and to enjoy everlasting life in the keeping of the commandments .
But when we blew it , when we apostatized , when we took things into our own hands , when we listened to the serpent , which is not only an image of the devil or demons , its an image of earthly wisdom .
I think that in the Bible actually you could say the serpent is the image of wisdom , earthly wisdom , which St James in his epistle called , earthly , psychic and demonic .
Wisdom that is wisdom without the wisdom of God.
Wisdom of creatures made in the image and likeness of God who turn on God .
Well , when you listen to all that you destroy everything and you have no power over everything , anything at all .
So , when all is said and done , you ca n’t blame the disaster on God .
You can ’t .
Not in the beginning and not ultimately .
And here by the way , it ’s important to know that the genesis story , the protology , is always an image of eschatology .
What what means in everyday language is , the vision that we are given in Genesis , of human beings living in paradise and increasing and multiplying and filling the earth and taking care of all creation , that is what we believe is going to happen at the end .
The real Adam is going to be the crucified one who is Jesus .
Because the original Adam and Eve are going to blow it , and they do blow it and that ’s why we are in the pickle we are in right now , and that ’s why we have Haitian earthquakes and tsunamis and prison camps and all that kind of thing .
But if the human being would be with God , then we would have the powers that we have and these things would not harm us .
I believe that that ’s the Christian teaching .
Now , you still have the question .
Why did God do it ?
Could still God be behind all this ?
He made the world with humanity knowing that there would be apostasy .
He created the world with angels and demons — angels that would become demons .
He created the world with you and me in it knowing how we would be .
He did the whole thing knowing everything and he did it anyway .
Why did he do it anyway ?
Here I think the simplistic answer is that , it was either this way or no way .
If you could say , why did that earthquake happen in Haiti , the answer could be because God decided in the beginning to have a world .
God decided to create .
God decided there would be beings in addition to himself , so to speak , or there would be those to whom he would give being .
But God gave the being , not capriciously or indiscriminately but he did give it to everyone without condition .
He said , “ I will allow you to be ” and I think we can say he will allow everything to be that can be .
But , those who will ultimately enjoy creation , the way it was originally meant to be , at the end when it will finally be what it was originally meant to be , because it has been recreated by the blood of Christ on the Cross , only those will be there in glory who trust God , believe God , know that it ’s not God ’s fault , know that we are the ones that have failed , trust God in everything and then even believe that there is a providence .
There is a providence .
St John of Damascus said it clearly .
God does n’t want tsunamis , earthquakes , floods , fires , storms .
He does n’t want kids being dragged out of rubble in Haiti or San Francisco or anywhere else .
He does n’t want any of that .
He does n’t want Rwandas and Darfurs , and holocausts and Auschwitzes and gulags .
God does n’t want that .
But , in order to get finally what he wants for us , we have to get through that .
As one of my students at St. Vladimirs used to say , “ That ’s the bad news of the Good News . ”
The good news is , God created it good .
The bad news is , we messed it all up .
The good news is God saved it .
The bad news is , we only partake of that salvation if we are trusting him , believing in him and suffering with him .
Suffering with him .
Going through all of the sufferings with him , not accusing him , but accusing ourself , so that at the end — as the prayer of Shadrach says in the fiery furnace — we ’ll say to God , “ you are just in all that you have done for us , all . ”
And Dostoevsky ’s creature in his story , Karamazov , he says , “ that ’s disgusting .
You mean some little girl who was sexually abused then molested and put in a outhouse and smeared with feces , that that girl is going to end up in the end and glorify God ? ”
And the beleving brother says , “ That ’s the only thing we can say . ”
And that ’s the miracle .
That ’s the miracle .
The miracle that there can be Haitians who dance and sing and praise God in the midst of terrible disaster .
And there are those who themselves will suffer and die , with their last words being , “ Thank you Lord for saving me .
Thank you Lord for raising me from the dead .
I ’ve got to go through this . ”
And we do n’t know why people go through what they have to do .
One of our own daughters just contracted , well she had it all the time — we did n’t know , an awful decease .
Of tumors growing on her nerves and so on .
How many people we know , every day my phone rings about another person with cancer .
Or another person died suddenly .
One of my friend ’s priest ’s daughter was jogging in California and just dropped dead .
Just the other day , the funeral was last Saturday .
Thirty two year old girl , just married , no children and then mums die who have lots of children .
Children die .
You know , all of this is crazily mixed up because of creatures and Christians would still believe it ’s all worth it .
You ’ve got to go through it .
You ’ve got to believe through it , that in the end all manner of things will be well as Julian of Norwich said — the English mystic woman .
And she even said , “ we ’ll not even be surprised at how marvelous and wonderful things are at the end when the Lord comes in glory .
But part of the delight , a huge part of the delight will be that we will see how he pulls it off . ”
Because we do n’t know how he is going to pull it off .
But another part of the tremendous delight will be , that every creature will bow and say to God , “ you are just in all that you have done .
All that we have gone through , you can imagine how horrible it is , but still compared to the eternal weight of glory as St. Paul writes , it ’s incomparable . ”
Now it is easy for me to sit here in my nice little room in Elwood City with the heater on , my teacup beside me , looking out the window , watching the clocks seeing when it is time to go for vespers .
You know , it ’s nice for me to say that while I look at TV and see all those people suffering , or read about prison camps and all that kind of stuff .
I do n’t know why I am spared .
I do n’t know why others are not .
I just do n’t know .
But as a believer I have to say several things .
Number one .
God knows .
Number two .
It ’s his business .
Number three , my business is to be as virtuous and good and holy and helpful as I can possibly be .
Especially to those who are suffering .
Another point is that I should endure my own suffering with faith , hope and love in God .
I should believe in the resurrection of the dead and I should believe that God ’s hands are in everything for good .
And I should believe that here is some kind of providential plan that involves all these evil things .
But I should not believe that they are capriciously given by God because , you know , earthquakes Haiti because they are bad and spares New York City because they are good or something .
That is just absolutely ridiculous .
Anyone that looks at reality , do n’t even read the darn Bible , look at reality and you can see that that ’s just not true .
The injustice is flagrant .
If you just look at things without the eyes of faith , it ’s totally capricious .
It seems to make no sense whatsoever and to the human mind , in some sense it does not make sense .
But as one protestant writer of my youth , Reinhold Niebuhr , said , “ I am stil a Christian because when I look at reality and when I read the Gospel , the Christian Gospel makes the most sense of the most facts . ”
And the fact of the matter is , this world is a corrupted , unjust , terrifying world outside human control .
But another fact is , it ought not to be that way and if it is , it ’s the fault of humanity .
And another fact would be , God knew that and had mercy on humanity .
Another fact would be , God saves everyone , including the unjust and shows mercy to everyone .
And another fact would be , if you love that and believe that and want that , you will have an ever lasting life of bliss .
There cannot even be compared to the amount of time we spend on this fallen , corrupted earth .
That goes to the tragedies and calamities and disasters because of us .
Now we pray .
We pray not to be victims of earthquake , flood , fire , storm .
We pray for a favourable weather , we pray for all these things , because we know that they ’re what God wants .
But we pray so that we can handle them .
We pray so that we could prevent them .
We pray so that when they happen we can endure them .
That ’s our prayer .
But we always say to God , “ This is what we will , this is what you will , but providentially your will be done .
And no leaf falls from the tree , no bird from the air without your hand somehow being in it . ”
So it ’s certainly the case that if God does not want it , he certainly permits it .
And in some sense he even sends it the way that he does , in this mystery hidden before the ages that ’s revealed to us in Christ crucified and only in Christ crucified .
So I think the final word for right now is this .
If we are going to try to figure out what God is doing with all this stuff , including the Haitian earthquake , we ca n’t make up a God of our own or a God as we think a God ought to be .
And we can not make up our own version of God or our own version of reality .
Not if we are Christians .
If we are Christians we have to take the version of God and the version of reality that is given to us in Jesus Christ , and him crucified , and in the interpretation of the Law , the Psalms , and the Prophets of the Old Testament through the prism of the crucified Christ who when he is raised from the dead he opens our eyes to the understanding of the scripture .
That ’s the way we have to look at it .
And who knows , we may not ever understand it all .
We ca n’t understand it fully , most certainly .
But one thing seems to be for sure , at least to me .
That all this would be senseless , is unacceptable .
That all of this would be a moster God just playing with us , killing one , capriciously raising up another and so on , that ’s also just absolutely unacceptable .
But the Gospel of God in Jesus Christ , tragic and hard and difficult as it is , and unexpected , surprising , shocking as it is , when all is said and done , this seems to be the only choice of a human being who wants to say that this world is good , and destruction and death is not the final word .
May God help us to understand .

Judge John Paul Stevens could be retiring soon , if the reports are accurate .
Jeffrey Toobin writes a profile on him in The New Yorker and wonders about what the court would be like without him .
I 'm sure conservatives are glad to see him go since Gerald Ford picked him .
What will the Supreme Court be like without its liberal leader ?
With the election of Barack Obama , the question of Stevens ’s retirement has become more pressing .
Even though Stevens was appointed by a Republican President , many assume that he would never willingly have turned his seat over to George W. Bush .
I asked Stevens about his plans .
“ Well , I still have my options open , ” he said .
“ When I decided to just hire one clerk , three of my four clerks last year said they ’d work for me next year if I wanted them to .
So I have my options still .
And then I ’ll have to decide soon . ”
On March 8th , he told me that he would make up his mind in about a month ... read on
Huff Post :
In an interview with NPR today , Toobin gave his prediction for an eventual successor to Justice Stevens : " I think it 's going to be Elena Kagan , the current solicitor general and the former dean of Harvard Law School .
She has a reputation as a consensus builder .
She is someone who brought vigorously fighting factions at Harvard together .
She worked in the Clinton administration and had good relationships with Republicans in Congress at the time .
She has never been a judge , which I think is a point in her favor for Obama .
There are all former judges on the court now , and I think Obama wants people of more different backgrounds .
So I think she 's the likely choice . "
President Obama needs to pick a strong liberal to replace Stevens if and when he leaves and not worry about the media 's obsession with bipartisanship .
A major reason activists did everything they could to help get him elected was for the Supreme Court .
Pick a strong liberal , let the attack dogs do their thing and then let the process play out .

Sardinia
More commonly referred to as maggot cheese , this delightful Italian sheep 's milk cheese is made and then placed outside for several weeks with a hole cut into the top of it .
Cheese flies settle in , lay their eggs , and maggots begin to live in there .
The maggots eat the cheese , then excrete predigested fats , proteins , and sugars .
In other words , they 're fermenting it , making the cheese soft and full of flavor .
Now it 's bad enough that there are maggots living in the cheese , but what 's worse is that Italians believe that it 's unsanitary to eat the cheese after the larvae have died , thus you must eat while they 're still alive .
And on top of that , they do n't like their cozy home being disturbed and can jump up to six inches into the air when threatened .
Therefore , diners must hold their hand over the cheese as they lift it to their mouths .
Just think , that rotten , maggot - filled cheese you 're about to put into your mouth may just jump up and hit you in the eye .
Maybe they should equip all diners with some protective goggles ?

Around the globe , it ’s mostly girls who lack educational opportunities .
Even in the United States , many people still associate the educational “ gender gap ” with girls left behind in math .
Yet these days , the opposite problem has sneaked up on us :
In the United States and other Western countries alike , it is mostly boys who are faltering in school .
The latest surveys show that American girls on average have roughly achieved parity with boys in math .
Meanwhile , girls are well ahead of boys in verbal skills , and they just seem to try harder .
The National Honor Society says that 64 percent of its members  outstanding high school students  are girls .
Some colleges give special help to male applicants  yes , that ’s affirmative action for white males  to avoid skewed sex ratios .
A new report just issued by the Center on Education Policy , an independent research organization , confirms that boys have fallen behind in reading in every single state .
It found , for example , that in elementary schools , about 79 percent of girls could read at a level deemed “ proficient , ” compared with 72 percent of boys .
Similar gaps were found in middle school and high school .

Tea partiers attack convention
NASHVILLE – Four Tennessee tea party activists who said they could n’t afford the $ 550 tickets to the National Tea Party Convention staged a guerilla news conference just outside of the event to challenge its representation of the movement .
“ There are a lot of citizens in the state of Tennessee today who could not afford to be here … particularly in this economy , ” said Antonio Hinton , a 37 - year old tea party activist from Knoxville .
“ They ’re just as patriotic .
They ’re just as concerned .
They care just as much about what ’s going on as the folks that are in that room . ”

The convention ’s steep ticket price , combined with its top - down organizational structure and the $ 100,000 speaking fee its organizers paid keynote speaker Sarah Palin all fly in the face of the grassroots tea party movement , Hinton and his three cohorts asserted in a quickly put - together press conference outside the convention hall .
About 40 journalists and camera people from the heavy media contingent covering the convention gathered around the four dissidents in a hotel lobby outside the entrance to the banquet room hosting most convention activities , as curious convention - goers crammed their necks to get a look at the spectacle , after which some challenged assertions made by the four .
All four of the men protesting the convention are part of a recently formed coalition of 34 tea party groups from around Tennessee that does not include the group behind the convention .
The four contended the coalition , the Tennessee Tea Party Coalition , is more representative of the conservative populist movement , whose members have nonetheless chafed at being associated too closely with the Republican Party and its political leaders .
The coalition recently held its own , less lavish convention at which it formalized a mission statement drafted by 58 delegates from around the state .
It states “ our objective is to restore the United States Constitution to that direct authority which our Founders , and the Consent of the Governed , originally intended , ” and calls it “ the duty of the governed to take back the reins of control , and to remove the shackles forged by our own apathy , that have chained our Liberty . ”
The Tennessee group has greater claim to the tea party banner than does the Convention , which was tightly controlled by a handful of organizers , said protester Jim Tomasik , a 47 - year - old iron worker from Cordova , Tenn .
Tomasik credited the convention organizers with landing Palin , who he said is “ probably not going to show up to talk to us because we could n’t afford her . ”
“ We do n’t need Sarah Palin to be the face of our movement , ” he said .
“ We do n’t need Newt Gingrich or any of these other people , because these people are humans and they can fail .
Our values will never fail us as long as we adhere to them . ”
Two of the activists , Anthony Shreeve and Mark Herr , were involved in the early stages of planning the convention , but said they resigned in protest after disputes with lead convention organizers Judson and Sherry Phillips .
Sherry Phillips contends that they and others were banned from the group planning the event for incivility and indiscretion .
After the impromptu press conference , Judson Phillips , fired back at Shreeve and Herr .
“ Since we announced this convention back in October , their whole focus has been against us , not to do something good or to advance the conservative cause , ” said Phillips .
“ They do n’t like me ?
Fine , I do n’t care .
If they want to go out and do events that are going to help our movement go forward , God bless ‘ em .
Because of the personal relationships , I ’m not going to be a part of what they ’re doing .
They probably do n’t want me .
And that ’s fine with me . ”
Phillips has taken heat from his former allies and others in the conservative movement for the unusual finances of the group running the convention , Tea Party Nation , and its $ 100,000 contract with Palin ’s speaking agency .
As first reported by POLITICO , Tea Party Nation is a for - profit company that also operates a social network site by the same name .
Phillips intends to turn a profit from the convention , with the stated goal of seeding a so - called 527 group that would air ads praising conservative candidates or criticizing their opponents .
But on Saturday he said there likely would n’t be much profit , and whatever money is made will go to a second convention he ’s planning for July .

Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer unveiled the slate PC at CES in January .
" Tens of millions " of tablet computers will be sold in 2010 , according to technology analysts at Deloitte .
The keyboard and mouse - free devices are likely to be a top trend among consumers , they anticipate .
Deloitte 's prediction fuels rumours that Apple is set to unveil a tablet - style computer at a press event it is hosting on 27 January .
However , the impact of tablet sales on the burgeoning e-reader market could be substantial , the report said .
" For every million net tablets sold there will be a corresponding impact on e-readers , " said Jolyon Barker from Deloitte 's Technology , Media and Telecommunications department .
The company 's report , which forecasts the tech trends for 2010 , describes tablets as " the Goldilocks of devices ( not too big , not too small ) " .
It said that previous attempts to launch tablet PCs - notably by Microsoft - had been largely unsuccessful for many reasons .
" The graphics , software , and user interface were underwhelming , not well connected to cellular or WiFi networks , and , most important , they have largely served as work - oriented data - entry devices . "
" By contrast , an easy - to - use , consumer - focused device used primarily for media and web browsing is much more likely to be widely accepted by the market . "
The report also explored other technologies .
Despite a focus on environmentally - friendly technology at this year 's Consumer Electronics
Show held in Las Vegas earlier in January , Deloitte predicts that cheaper electricity rates may put a dampener on the demand for alternatives - particularly solar power .
" Solar power technology could struggle in 2010 due to the cost of solar equipment , tools and raw materials , overcapacity and weak economics , " said Jim Sloane , Deloitte 's lead technology partner .
The firm also predicts that the computer chip industry is going to focus on size and low - cost rather than performance and power .
Deloitte says that this move is driven by portable devices such as netbooks and laptops - especially as the more economical chips require less electric power .
Tiny Swarming Robots Coming Soon to Eat your Data
Scientists often study nature to solve complex engineering problems .
Such is the case with these tiny robot prototypes ; scientists from several countries are cooperating to develop microbots that can act as a swarm , just like insects .
The tiny robots will measure less than 4 mm in each direction and be powered by a small solar panel on their backs .
Individually , they are small and simple .
But together , an entire swarm of these microbots could establish hive intelligence , communicate with each other via infrared sensors , perform complex tasks and relay important information back to their home base .
They move on three vibrating legs while a fourth acts as a touch sensor .
The team overcame the trickiest manufacturing problem that has plagued previous attempts to build tiny swarming robots : the use of solder to hold components together .
By using conductive adhesive instead of solder , the circuit board is able to be folded , resulting in a much smaller bot than was previously possible .
By mass - producing the robots , the cost of each individual unit would quite small , meaning that mission - related losses of a few would n’t spell financial disaster for the entire mission .
The project , called I - SWARM ( intelligent small - world autonomous robots for micro-manipulations ) was based on the behavior of biological insects .
The team conducting the project is made up of researchers from Spain , Sweden , Italy , Germany and Switzerland .
Though the robots are n’t quite ready for mass production , the team is looking for funding to start building commercial prototypes .
Senate Republicans late this afternoon blocked the confirmation of labor lawyer Craig Becker to fill a vacancy on the National Labor Relations Board .
The vote was 52 - 33 , eight short of the 60 votes needed to force final consideration of Mr. Becker ’s appointment .
Two Democrats , Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , voted with 31 Republicans to reject Mr. Becker , who had served as a top legal adviser to major labor unions .
Fifteen senators were absent due to deteriorating weather conditions .
Republicans said they feared that Mr. Becker would try to use his seat on the board to ease union organizing in the workplace ; Democrats said Republicans were abusing their power to block presidential appointees due to their deep anti-labor views .
Republicans have slowed the confirmation process for dozens of President Obama ’s nominees , raising the prospect that the president will install some through so - called recess appointments when the Senate adjourns for a holiday break at the end of the week .
Republicans immediately called on Mr. Obama not to place Mr. Becker on the board in that fashion .
“ I sincerely hope the White House does not circumvent the will of the Senate by appointing him when the Senate is out of session , ” Senator Orrin Hatch , Republican of Utah , said .
The timing of the vote meant that one of the first official acts of Senator Scott Brown , the newly elected Republican from Massachusetts , was to sustain a Republican filibuster against a presidential nominee .
Plans have been ditched for three cubicle dairying operations in the Upper Waitaki , with the companies behind the proposals claiming they have been the victims of misinformation .
Southdown Holdings Ltd ( SHL ) , Williamson Holdings Ltd ( WHL ) and Five Rivers Ltd ( 5RL ) have withdrawn the effluent applications because of the estimated $ 2.63 million cost of funding the required ministerial call - in for the project and the open - ended nature of the process .
SHL , WHL and 5RL had to pay for all Environment Ministry costs associated with the call - in of the effluent applications .
The ministry 's preliminary non-binding estimate of costs was $ 2.63 m , and the applicants ' own costs were estimated at a further $ 500,000 .
The applicants had asked for the effluent call - in process to be put on hold until the outcome of water hearings associated with the project were known , but the request was refused .
A statement issued by the three companies last night said they had already spent about $ 2 m removing 1200 hectares of wilding pines and more than $ 1.8 m on hearing costs and regional environmental science analysis .
They were not prepared to fund the costs associated with the call - in that SHL director Richard Peacocke considered premature in the overall process .
" Our silence to the criticism and misinformation in the press to this point was driven by the view that it was inappropriate to have this matter litigated through the media , and in respect of the legal ECan - driven RMA process . "
Mr Peacocke said they had always been aware of the environmental fragility of the area and had set about developing a world - class proposal to minimise and mitigate any potential negative environmental effects of dairy farming .
Although the stables option had a higher capital cost , there were long - term benefits through improved control and management of effluent , impact on waterways , improved animal welfare and enhanced production .
He said housing cows in stables in New Zealand would increase , but the size of their application might have been two or three years too soon .
" It is apparent that more work on educating the Government and the public on the positive affects of the use of stables to house cows would be beneficial for all .
" The irony of our situation is that stable - style farming is the way of the future if New Zealand is committed to environmentally sustainable farming .
Farmers and the environment would benefit during cold wet climatic conditions experienced right throughout New Zealand .
" Providing stables for cows is the most effective environmental and robust animal welfare solution for the region and one that , eventually , traditional dairy farmers will be forced to consider as they come under ever - increasing pressure in the management of effluent by regional councils throughout New Zealand . "
The companies said there had been a public misinformation campaign around their plans , including comments claiming the stable approach was damaging to the environment ; the 18,000 cows in the project equated to only a 0.2 per cent increase in the New Zealand dairy herd , and the effluent was not equivalent to that produced by Christchurch City as often quoted , but only 6 or 7 per cent of that amount .
The " emotive term of factory farming " was used to create negative images similarly to poorly managed forms of battery hen and piggery operations , when the reality was the planned open - sided , roofed barns provided comfortable , free - range style movement for cows .
Of the 4800 submissions opposing the companies ' applications , only 1600 were from individual objectors .

The government wants to replace the ageing Scimitar scout vehicle
US defence firm General Dynamics has won a contract to build a new light tank for the British army .
The firm , which plans to manufacture most of the new tank in the UK , beat rival bidder BAE Systems - where 500 jobs will now be lost .
The news is a blow for BAE 's factory in Newcastle , which was earmarked to build the company 's tank .
General Dynamics claims that the contract will safeguard or create 10,500 jobs in the UK .
The contract is reported to be worth £ 4bn ( $ 6 bn ) .
General Dynamics said its product was not only the best option , but was a patriotic choice too .
" The programme is British to its bootstraps , delivering a military off - the - shelf vehicle with British design by British engineers to the British Army , " said Sandy Wilson , president and managing director of General Dynamics .
Welsh secretary Peter Hain said the deal would see 200 new jobs created at the company 's plant in Newbridge , south Wales .
A further 250 existing jobs will also be safeguarded at the plant , he said .
The new light tank is designed to replace the Scimitar scout vehicle , providing troops with more protection and firepower .
Jobs blow
BAE had planned to build its contender at its Newcastle plant , protecting or creating 800 jobs in the region .
However following the tank decision 500 job losses , first announced last year , will now go ahead across England .
The firm had hoped to prevent the job losses if the new contract was secured .
The jobs will be lost at BAE sites in Newcastle , Leicester and Telford .
BAE has already announced the closure of its Telford and Leeds sites .
Announcing the tender decision , the Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth said replacing the older vehicles was " one of the highest equipment priorities for the Army " .
He said that General Dynamic 's bid had been favoured because it represented " value for money " .
He also said that the majority of manufacturing would take place in the UK , ensuring UK skills and capabilities in the armoured vehicle sector were retained .
Also notable is that the Leaf would require a special charging dock , which costs around $ 2,200 -- though a federal tax credit will also cover half of that .
The Volt , however , can be plugged into a standard outlet .
Of course , the Leaf can boast zero tailpipe * emissions , but the Volt cannot .
Still , Affordability Matters
The Leaf will be available in some markets as soon as December .
That 's around the same time the Volt will hit the streets .
At that time , the U.S. economy is still expected to still have pretty high unemployment and consumers will probably still be apprehensive about spending a lot on a new vehicle .
So the Leaf 's cheaper price tag could go a long way in giving Nissan a distinct advantage .
Think about the monthly payment for each .
At the after - rebate prices listed above , with a 5 - year loan and a 6 % interest rate , the Volt would cost $ 628 per month .
The Leaf 's payment would be just $ 500 ( including charging station ) .
The Leaf also goes further on one battery charge , so its energy costs would likely be cheaper , since Volt owners would have to rely on gas whenever they drive more than 40 miles .
Leaf vs. Corolla
When the Volt news broke back in August , I explained why that price was still too high to be affordable for most Americans , even if you figure in the fuel cost savings .
Let 's do a similar analysis for the Leaf , compared to a Corolla .
According to Nissan , the Leaf would get around 100 miles per charge , which should cost " less than $ 3 . "
Since that 's also about the current price of gas , we just need to consider the Corolla 's gas mileage -- about 30.5 mpg ( the average of its city and highway rates ) -- and its $ 15,450 price .
Under those assumptions ( and including the after - rebate charging station cost ) , the Leaf 's break - even compared to the Corolla for total price , including power , comes after driving around 155,000 miles .
For the Volt , that jumps to around 200,000 miles , given its reported 230 mpg estimate and assumed price of around $ 32,500 after rebate .
Of course , both those estimates assume that gas does n't increase in price more than electric power , which may or may not be true .
If that happens , then fewer miles would need to be driven to make their purchases more cost - effective .
So for consumers who can stomach the 100 - mile limit between charges , I think the Leaf should do quite well .
Of course , wealthier Americans looking for a green vehicle might be willing to pay a higher price tag for the convenience that the Volt will provide through its hybrid flavor .
For the record : Nissan has been running a prominent ad for LEAF on this site .
* Another note : I added the word " tailpipe " here after receiving a few e-mails from readers who find this distinction important .
Of course , the process for creating electricity for homes involves emissions , but the vehicle itself does not create emissions by burning gasoline .
I never meant to suggest otherwise , but thought this fact was already generally understood .
Sorry for any confusion .

Just how does Pep Guardiola improve on the most successful club side in a calendar year ?
We detail the tactical changes the Barcelona coach has made to his side to make them even better .
______________________________________________________________________________
After Barcelona ’s 1 - 0 win over Estudiantes in the Club World Cup in which the Catalan side recorded a never before paralleled , six cup wins in a calendar year , manager Pep Guardiola turned to his assistant Tito Vilanova , with bleary eyed with tears of joy , seemingly asking “ where do we go from here ? ”
Just how does Pep Guardiola possibly improve upon perfection ?
In truth , Guardiola has been planning his quest to create a footballing monster team since he served his apprenticeship as a rookie coach , among others paying a visit to Arsenal ’s training ground to see just how Arsene Wenger grants his side the capacity to play with such a euphoric spontaneity and the audacity although he did n’t have to look further than the Dream Team he was an integral part of in the early nineties .
He soon took over as Barcelona B coach in 2007 and not coincidentally in one of this season ’s group stage matches his starting eleven featured seven La Masia graduates .
And when he took over the senior squad a year later he made it the team mantra “ diversity in counsel , unity in command , ” and then proceeded to strip off the negative influences and shirkers such as Ronaldinho and Deco .
That continued at the start of this season also , as he almost unthinkably got rid of a key component of his treble winning side in Samuel Eto’o in a gargantuan part exchange deal to bring in Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the opposite direction .
That move people said was going to give Barcelona a Plan B , the option to play direct especially after the way Chelsea shackled them in last year ’s Champions League semi-final first leg by playing an ultra - defensive game .
And it worked , with Barcelona putting all three past Sporting Gijon in their first game of La Liga from headers but as each match wore on , Guardiola was indicating he had in mind , more than a Plan B , Plan C or even a Plan D .
He was looking to add more variety to his Plan A than a Muttiah Muralitharan over , all at the seamless barking of instructions .
Against Stuttgart , in the Champions League Second Round First Leg , Barcelona became unstuck against the German side ’s pressuring high up the pitch .
Stuttgart , playing a 4 - 4 - 2 against the default Barcelona 4 - 3 - 3 was able to profit from attacking the wings with speed and the forwards dropping into space with movement – just as Athletico and Villarreal have done in previous season and indeed this season .
For the return leg , however , Guardiola switched to what looked like a 4 - 2 - 4 and with Lionel Messi revelling behind the forward the Argentine hit a superb hat - trick ( and also doing the same the following game against Real Zaragoza ) .
Pep Guardiola is adamant though that this formation has n’t a name and its asymmetry lends itself to the strengths of the team to cause unpredictability .
“ Our rivals have studied us a lot and we have to look for alternatives , ” said the captain Carlos Puyol .
“ The important thing is the intensity [ we play ] ; the tempo and that we want the ball . ”
Indeed this maxim is what makes the layout and Guardiola ’s men were able to cause havoc to Stuttgart ’s planning in the way they were set - up .
In the centre of midfield , Seergio Busquets and Yaya Toure played alongside each over though not in the same lines , with Toure slightly higher up and slanted towards the left .
Iniesta was deployed as the half - winger out wide , used more for his intricacy and link up while Pedro was the more dynamic on the right , looking to engage the full back and pin him back .
The result saw a collection of hard to mark individuals in attack and a system which was almost all about chain reactions in the defensive phase to make staying compact easier .
“ This new look was implemented so that Messi could connect into the game more often because it ’s good for us when does , ” explained Guardiola when using the same system earlier this season in a 2 - 1 win over Malaga – though the scoreline hardly reflected the complete domination Barcelona had on the match .
“ We found him more often than in other games .
It also to puts him closer to Ibra .
It ’s as if Messi were an ‘ interior . ’
They ( Xavi and Busquets ) were never on the same line .
We have never played with a double pivot .
However , we did make a small adjustment with the wingers and their defensive roles . ”
So in essence the formation was a 4-1- 1- 1- 1-1- 1 but numbers will never portray what Guardiola wanted to outline .
[ Carlo Mazzone ’s quote on between - the - lines players may help : “ There are trends in football .
This is a time of between - the - lines players .
From a classic 4 - 4 - 2 , we now have a 4 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1- 3- 0 as we have at Roma . ]
Barcelona ’s formation as per the 4 - 0 win over Stuttgart in the Champions League Second Round Second Leg .
At varying moments in this season , Guardiola has also deployed a back three with either a defensive midfielder dropping back or in introducing another centre - back .
The full - backs then become wing - backs and depending on his personnel at disposal , the formation resembles a 3 - 4 - 3 ( used by Johan Cruyff when coach and was very confident in minimising the risks because of the team ’s ability to keep the ball ) or a 3 - 1 - 3 - 3 .
The tinkering though does n’t stop there because in the signing of Zlatan Ibrahmovic is a player who creates room for others by roaming around the pitch , doubling up or dropping deep to cause uncertainty in marking and pulling defenders out of position .
That tactic enables players like Xavi and Keita to get in the box unmarked which the neither the system of zonal or man-marking has got to grips with yet .
The biggest point argued in the loss of Samuel Eto ’o , however , is said to be the ability for the forward to get behind the defense otherwise Barcelona may lead themselves to a trap of over - elaborateness .
The stats do seem agree with Eto ’o fans to some degree as according to OPTA Ibrahimovic has been caught offside the most this season in La Liga yet that stat also may highlight the fact that the Swede just needs to time his runs better .
But as displayed in the Champions League win over Manchester United , does this switch indicate a move away from the false nine – the role Messi deployed in the final ?
Indeed , with Eto ’o , the interchange of positions is seamless but with Ibrahimovic it can only be used in periods .
Nevertheless , that has n’t detracted Guardiola from doing so and in doing so presents another problem to the opposition which so far , no - one has been able to answer .
Much of contemporary anarchism is impossible to distinguish from a soggy leftist workerism and we seemed to have abandoned the libertarian impulses of anarchism .
Take the ‘ free speech ’ issue .
Yesterday some anarchists were aligned with the UAF in calling for the banning of Geert Wilders visit .
Since when did anarchists call for government bans and prosecriptions ?
I would no more call for a ban on Wilders visit than I would for Louis Farrakhan or ask the government to ‘ ban the burkha ’ or ban cartoons offensive to Islam or for that matter ‘ ban fox hunting ’ or smoking in bus shelters or ban marches of people I disagree with .
Yes .. free speech is indivisible and is not qualified by a ‘ but … ’ .
And free speech certainly includes blaspheming others holy texts .
Tough shit cry babies – live with it .
We have left campaigning against political correctness to right wing idiots like Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Littlejohn , bumbling Boris and the Daily Mail and become associated with a killjoy leftist miserabilism .
We have abandoned much of our natural political constituency to the right and in doing so have allowed the EDL to pose as the champions of traditional English liberties .
Leave alone libertarian impulses what happened to our hedonistic impulses – where are they in contempoary anarchist propaganda ?
Actually comrades we are against the state – so we should make no demands of it to discomfort our opponents .
Now I ’m with the Hunt Sabs every time or anyone who chucks an egg at Farrakhan … … but do it yourself comrades – do n’t ask for your enemy to do it for you .
And while we ’re at it comrades … ’ Who put the ram in the ramma lama dingdong ’ ?
Beijing 's Tiananmen Square was shrouded in orange dust
Beijing has been shrouded in orange dust as a strong sandstorm blew hundreds of miles from drought - struck northern China to the nation 's capital .
The authorities have issued a level - five pollution warning and urged people to stay indoors .
In Tiananmen Square , clouds of dust obscured monuments and visitors wore masks to avoid the dust and soil .
The storm has already caused havoc in Xinjiang , Shanxi , Shaanxi and Hebei regions and is heading to South Korea .
Residents of the South Korean capital , Seoul , as well as those in central and western regions , have been advised to stay indoors .
' Improving situation '
By Saturday , the storm had spread over an area of 810,000 sq km ( 313,000 sq miles ) with a population of 250 million , state news agency Xinhua reported .
It was expected to last until Monday , the meteorological agency said in a statement on its website .
Guo Hu , head of Beijing 's meteorological agency , said the storm came from the deserts of Inner Mongolia .
Beijing has long - suffered from sandstorms - including a single instance in April 2006 when 300,000 tons of sand poured down on the city , Xinhua reported .
But Mr Guo said the storms had become less frequent in recent years .
" The situation improved tremendously after [ the 2006 storm ] , " he told Xinhua .
" Thanks to the mild climate and conservation efforts , Beijing had only one sandstorm last year . "
Experts say the storms are , in part , caused by deforestation and the rapid expansion of urban areas in recent decades .
Google and China may not be fighting over science , but their feud could have unintended negative consequences for researchers in the country .
A Nature News survey of Chinese scientists found that 84 percent of them thought losing access to Google would " somewhat or significantly " hurt their work process .
Like their American counterparts , Chinese researchers use Google and Google Scholar to find papers and related information .
" Research without Google would be like life without electricity , " one Chinese scientist told Nature .
In January , Google announced it would stop following censorship rules required by the Chinese government after its servers came under attack .
It remains to be seen whether the Mountain View company will be thrown out of the country for that stance .
When Google 's initial announcement broke , media blogger Robin Sloan of Snarkmarket pondered the possibility of the splitting of the famously world - circling internet .
" Is the Chinese internet going to be largely parallel ?
The othernet ? " Sloan asked .
If events do continue in that direction , truly global enterprises like science could suffer as information becomes harder — even if only moderately — to exchange .

Galaxy or Yorkie ?
Walkers Sensations or McCoy's ?
The choices we make at the supermarket checkout are less down to personal taste or preference than we might like to think .
Forget sexual stereotyping , gender targeting is the latest mantra as food marketers exploit the hidden cues in the packaged foods and drinks we buy .
It 's what makes Food Doctor Easy Goodness Roasted Basil Chicken with Puy Lentils & Spelt more appealing to many women than the prospect of a bowl of Mr Brain 's Pork Faggots .
Take Eve , a light alcoholic drink being launched nationally by brewing giant Carlsberg next month .
It 's not just in the name .
The drink is flavoured with exotic fruits like lychee and passion fruit , the logo is looped and curling .
Eve is , the company boldly declares , " a synonym for women and femininity " .
Or Koko by Cadbury , the confectioner 's recently - launched chocolate gift selection which aside from the passing nod to Coco Chanel in its name underlines its fashionista credentials with luxurious pink and brown , ribboned packaging , and was sold alongside exclusive Koko - inspired silver necklaces designed by fashion label PPQ in Selfridges at launch .
Then consider Pot Noodle Doner Kebab with its meaty promise of Turkish lamb in a black plastic tub and neon logo described by Graham Walker , flavour development manager at Unilever , the food company behind it , as " the ultimate man - food snack " .
Or Wrigley 's 5 , the eponymous gum manufacturer 's new sugar - free gum .
With assorted flavours boasting names like Cobalt and Pulse , and its predominantly black , ribbed packaging , some have likened the packaging design to a box of condoms .
" Food companies have many cues to play around with when it comes to making sure they attract the particular consumers they want to appeal to .
Actual content , flavour , and consistency are just the beginning , " says consumer psychologist Cathrine Jansson - Boyd of Anglia Ruskin University .
" We tend to purchase things that are an extension of who we are and who we want to be seen to be – that 's why much marketing is still channelled along gender lines , albeit increasingly subtly , and food is just another extension of this . "
In the drinks market , for example , lager is predominantly , if not exclusively , marketed at young men and – surprise surprise – in the UK it is 18 to 34 - year - old men who predominantly drink it .
Trouble is , sales are falling – down 10 per cent between 2004 and 2009 – due to people cutting back on their drinking , plus the recession and beer companies ' failure to broaden their appeal beyond this core audience .
" British beer marketing has a long tradition of targeting men through male humour and sport .
The bitter flavouring of many domestic beers , meanwhile , means far fewer women drink beer here than in other countries like Ireland , the US and parts of Asia , " says Harriet Easton , a Shrewsbury - based student entrepreneur who in her gap year developed a pale ale for women called Harry 's Beer , which she now hopes to roll out nationally .
Attempts by established brewers to woo women drinkers are a " logical next step " , she says , and long overdue .
Molson Coors , for one , recently trialled a women 's lager flavoured with dragon fruit and green tea , and has since launched a campaign to encourage women 's appreciation of beer .
Foster 's has come up with Foster 's Twist , " an easy drinking beer with a hint of citrus " , designed to appeal to the female palate .
Heineken , meanwhile , has developed a ladies ' sparkling cider called Charli .
Yet while a number of brewers have talked about developing women 's lagers , there has been a tendency to hold back from overtly positioning them as such – perhaps for fear of alienating the male drinkers they already have .
It 's a suggestion that Easton reluctantly endorses .
Though Harry 's Beer has been designed to appeal to women – each bottle features women 's silhouettes – the name , inspired by her own , was chosen to be gender - neutral so as not to alienate men .
Chocolate , in contrast , is a product category dominated by female - focused brands , despite being consumed by both sexes in equal numbers .
The more indulgent the product , however , the more feminine - focused the brand , according to Jill McCall , Cadbury brand manager for Koko .
She draws a clear distinction between chocolate intended for self - indulgence and what she calls " hunger bars " like Boost or Double Decker , which by being big and chunky appeal more to the male desire to use chocolate to satisfy hunger .
" A large proportion of boxed chocolates are bought by women for women because men are often scared of getting it wrong , " she adds .
" Women , however , tend to follow a debit - credit system when it comes to chocolate consumption , which means that if they indulge now they must compromise on something else later .
So , if they are going to indulge , it had better taste , look and feel perfect .
It 's a trade - off which women readily understand , but which many men do n't and worry about it when buying chocolate . "
Colour is a common gender cue found in a wide array of food and drinks packaging , and so is shape .
" Whether a bottle or packet is curved or straight matters .
Women are naturally drawn to rounded contours , even if they claim otherwise ; sales prove it .
Labels , too , tend to be more decorative , with more detailed patterning and lighter colour tones , " says Jansson - Boyd .
On - pack messaging also has a role to play , she adds , with products clearly marked " low - calorie " or " healthy " predominantly aimed at , and bought by , women .
Any suggestion of a health expert 's endorsement or nutritionist 's advice – for example , the perceived connotations that can be drawn from the brand name Food Doctor – also creates female appeal .
" As soon as you put ' Diet ' or ' Light ' in a name , the product is generally perceived as being aimed more at women , even though many men are now as calorie - conscious , " says Penny Segal , head of strategy at brand development consultancy Brandhouse .
" It 's why Pepsi and Coke have been doing smart jobs with Pepsi Max and Coke Zero – offering the low - cal benefit desired in a new , male way . "
That said , not all products presented to appeal to women are solely intended for women to consume .
" Although more men are living alone , and more men than ever now share domestic chores , the majority of grocery shopping is still done by women and food brands simply can't afford to ignore that , " says Jon Howard - Spink , strategy and planning director at advertising agency Quiet Storm , whose clients include Kerry Foods .
David Williamson , the marketing director at Kerry – whose brands include Mr Brain 's Pork Faggots and LowLow cheese – endorses this .
" A product like LowLow has a female skew because we position it as healthier , but that 's so that we appeal to her as the primary shopper , who acts as gatekeeper and guardian of her family 's health , " he explains .
" While there is some male bias given to products with meaty textures , our aim is to push the appeal of all the food products we make to as wide a market as possible . "
Mr Brain 's Pork Faggots is , he says , a case in point .
Although it is a product eaten more by men than women , it is packaged and marketed with cues carefully balanced to appeal to both .
" Given the product 's name , the yellow pack and its bright red logo that looks like it 's come straight out of the Beano , Mr Brain 's is not a brand that takes itself too seriously , " Howard - Spink observes .
In the Mr Brain 's commercial now running on TV , the man of the house is presented as a hero for fixing the stair carpet and rewarded accordingly , and the product is presented to women as " a real man 's meal " .
" There is a recognition that we know you know this is irony , " he adds .
" Yet there is a grain of truth in the old idea that satisfying the stomach is the quickest way to a man 's heart . "
Sexual stereotyping or gender targeting ?
The jury remains out .
Sex sells :
His n' hers brands
Walkers Sensations or McCoy's ?
Ads with Victoria Beckham launched Walkers ' posh crisps , Sensations , but the range has been extended to include meatier flavours for the menfolk .
United Biscuits ' McCoy 's brand – known for flavours like Steak & Ale Pie – is just what it says in its latest TV ad : " man crisps " .
Galaxy or Yorkie ?
Though Galaxy promised British consumers " a share of country goodness " throughout the Eighties , it has since been re-positioned as " true chocolate indulgence " by its manufacturer , Mars , playing on a perceived female need for ' me time ' and a desire to ' self - reward ' .
In contrast , Nestle 's Yorkie was aimed at men from the outset .
Big and chunky enough to fulfil a man 's appetite , it also capitalises on its ' It 's not for girls ' positioning .
The Food Doctor Easy Goodness Roasted Basil Chicken or Mr Brain 's Pork Faggots ?
Healthy - eating associations for ready meals such as The Food Doctor range appeal mainly to women .
Contrary to first impressions , however , Mr Brain 's – with its tongue - in - cheek name , no nonsense packaging and humorous marketing – is also aimed at women wanting to give their man the meal he deserves .
Diet Coke or Coke Zero ?
Dubai Multi Commodities Centre ( DMCC ) has proposed to the UAE Central Bank , the launch of a legal tender gold coin which if approved , will be the first of its kind in the Middle East .
Existing legal tender gold coins such as the Australian Nugget and the South African Krugerrand are popular among buyers as a vehicle to invest in pure gold .
The proposed design depicts the image of the UAE President Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan , on one side of the coin and that of the Burj Khalifa , the world ’s tallest tower in Dubai , on the other .
The recently inaugurated tower was dedicated to the leadership of Sheikh Khalifa by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai , on the anniversary of his accession on January 4 , 2010 .
The 828 – metre Burj Khalifa is a symbol of international co-operation , an unparalleled fete of engineering and a work of art .
The tallest free standing man-made structure , with over 160 storeys , is also one of the most recognised landmarks in the world .
Ahmed Bin Sulayem , DMCC executive chairman , said : ' We are confident that this design represents the face of modern UAE and its aspirations .
This is a great time to launch a reliable , easily transacted legal tender gold coin , since the current level of interest in gold investment is the highest it has ever been globally , the timing could n’t be better . '
' As the only commodities centre in the region , DMCC has all the required expertise and experience to lead such a prestigious , path - breaking project .
We would consider it a unique honour to be associated with it , ' he added .
DMCC had launched the UAE ’s first souvenir , commemorative gold coin in September 2007 , under the ‘ Visions of Dubai ’ series .
The 22 - carat coin that was available in 34 gram , 17 g , 8.5 g and 3.4 g , proved to be highly popular with buyers .
Designed to reflect Dubai ’s visionary leadership and the emirate ’s innovative projects , the first edition carried the image of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum on one side and that of Burj Al Arab , the iconic landmark , on the other .
A second series of the ‘ Visions of Dubai ’ coin in 24 carat gold carries the image of Sheikh Mohammed ’s image on one side and that of the Palm Jumeirah , the world famous island development .

Radiohead have confirmed that information in an email circulated by fans supposedly containing details about their next album is “ made up ” .
Yesterday ( March 7 ) music website Tinymixtapes.com reported on an email , which seemed to originate from the band ’s W.A.S.T.E. website , that when decoded revealed that the band ’s next album would be named ‘ Tehrangeles ’ .
It was acknowledged on the website that the information had not been confirmed by the band , and that it should be treated with suspicion .
The email also revealed a supposed 11 - song tracklisting .
However , a spokesperson for the band has now confirmed that the information is false .
“ Most of it is made up and there is no album or album title , ” Radiohead ’s spokesperson told NME.COM .
The false tracklisting contained some genuine Radiohead songs including ‘ The Daily Mail ’ , ‘ Give Up The Ghost ’ and ‘ Supercollider ’ .
Frontman Thom Yorke played ‘ The Daily Mail ’ , ‘ Give Up The Ghost and another new song , ‘ Lotus Flower ’ , at a solo gig in Cambridge recently .
Radiohead picked up work on their new album in January , with guitarist Ed O’Brien telling fans , “ I am so genuinely excited about what we ’re doing , but for obvious reasons I ca n’t divulge anything more .
Anyway , we all love surprises do n’t we ? ”

Nonrel - search released
Update 2 : Post outdated .
See the documentation or reference for usage info .
Basically you should index your models in a separate file " < app_name>.search_indexes " using the function search .
register .
This keeps the indexes independent of your models and you do n't have to modify your models anymore to make them searchable .
Update : SearchIndexField has been removed .
In order to index and search your data you have to add a SearchManager to your model definition which takes the same arguments as SearchIndexField before .
We are happy to release our first port of gae - search to django - nonrel :)
Nonrel - search is a simple full text search engine for nonrelational databases like App Engine using native Django .
This is especially useful for users of gae - search which want to switch to django - nonrel .
So let 's see how to use nonrel - search .
Indexing and searching your data
In nonrel - search you can make your entities searchable by indexing them .
You do so by adding a SearchManager to your model definition :
from django.db import models from search .
core import SearchManager , porter_stemmer class Post ( models .
Model ) : title = models .
CharField( max_length=500 ) content = models .
TextField ( ) author = models .
CharField(max_length=500 ) category = models .CharField( max_length=500 ) rating = models .
IntegerField ( choices = [ ( 0 , ' zero ' ) , ( 1 , 'one ' ) , ( 2 , ' two ' ) , ( 3 , ' three ' ) , ( 4 , ' four ' ) , ( 5 , ' five ' ) , ] , default=0 ) # index used to retrieve posts via the title , content or the # category .
search_index = SearchManager ( ( ' title ' , ' content ' , ' category ' ) , indexer=porter_stemmer )
As you can see , you can make posts searchable by specific fields , in the above case the title , content and the category leaving the author aside .
The indexer argument specifies that we want to use the Porter Stemmer algorithm that is to allow searching your entities using word stems e.g " strangely " will also match " strange " .
We include stemmers for English and German .
Nonrel - search is not limited to allow only one index .
You can create multiple independent indexes ( each with its own fields ) for one single model .
One possible application of this is to have an index for the title only and another index for all fields .
Like on Ebay which allows their users to include " title and description " into the user 's search you can now allow your users to search only by title or by all fields .
So now let 's assume we have a post with the title ' Greetings ' and the content ' Hello little world ' saved in our database , then we can find it by calling
# saving an entity will create the search index Post ( title= ' Greetings ' , content = ' Hello little world ' ) . save ( ) # ... results = Post.search_index.search ( ' hello greeting ') # results [ 0 ] should be our first " Hello little world " post
Here , " greeting " ( without " s " ) matched the title because of the porter stemmer and obviously " hello " matched the content .
The result is a Query like object you can add additional filters to :
# ... results.filter ( author= ' Itachi ') # now results should only contain entities with author set to ' Itachi '

There 's never a dull moment in the wonderful world of Radiohead ...
Aside from a variety of Thom Yorke remixes , a Phil Selway solo tour , and rumors of a recently completed studio session , the most exciting piece of Radiohead news we ’ve received of late was word that the band would be covering Peter Gabriel ’s “ Wallflower ” as part of the Scratch My Back song exchange .
Or so we thought .
As Gabriel revealed in a new interview with The Sun , he has yet to hear back from Yorke and co since they initially agreed to record the cover .
Sigh .
“ I still have n’t had a response from Thom Yorke , ” Gabriel explained .
“ He originally wrote to say he wanted to do a version of ‘ Wallflower ’ , but I have n’t heard what he thinks of my version of ( ‘ Street Spirit ’ ) . ”
“ Not everyone likes it and I ’ve no real idea whether he likes it or hates it , ” he continued .
“ We have a little clue , though …
We gave out codes for the artists to listen to their songs on a stream and we could see how many times they ’ve heard them .
I think he ’s only streamed ‘ Street Spirit ’ once , which is n’t a good sign , but who knows ? ”
Perhaps it ’s not matter of dislike , but because the Radiohead frontman has a few other things on his plate these days .
In fact , if you take much stock in a recent tweet by Scott Eric Olivier , a Los Angeles based musician and producer , Yorke could be planning both upcoming tour dates — in addition to an appearance at this year ’s Coachella Music Festival — and some studio time .
Thank goodness for Twitter .
Of course , nothing is confirmed , but one thing is for sure : there ’s never a dull moment in the wonderful world of Radiohead …
One in every 10 children is acutely malnourished and a quarter of all women of child - bearing age are malnourished , according to the survey by the UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
Yemen has recently been faced with a series of humanitarian challenges , including conflict in its north , an influx of refugees from the Horn of Africa and an increase in the poverty rate .
WFP is currently providing food assistance to 1.5 million people every month , including a quarter of a million people displaced by the fighting in the north pitting the Government against the Al Houthi rebel movement .
As part of the humanitarian aid effort , the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) earlier this week approved a nearly $ 5 million bridging loan to continue providing life - saving assistance to some 250,000 civilians who have been uprooted since clashes erupted in 2004 .
High - speed passenger rail service on dedicated tracks along the Interstate 25 and Interstate 70 corridors will cost $ 22 billion and likely require up to 50 - percent funding by Colorado taxpayers , a Rocky Mountain Rail Authority ( RMRA ) spokesman said this week .
The RMRA ’s Harry Dale , speaking ahead of today ’s release of a $ 1.5 million feasibility study funded mostly by the Colorado Department of Transportation ( CDOT ) , said the higher cost of building dedicated lines rather than using existing freight lines or right - of - ways makes long - term financial sense .
High - speed trains traveling in excess of 100 mph would command premium fares allowing for a model of $ 2 in fare revenue for every $ 1 of operational costs .
That means a private company could operate a Colorado franchise at a profit , eliminating the need for annual operational subsidies .
Upgrading freight railroad tracks or building adjacent tracks in freight rail corridors would be cheaper in terms of capital costs , but the system would run at a huge deficit requiring taxpayer subsidies , Dale said .
And ridership would suffer because passenger trains traveling on freight lines go much slower and do n’t necessarily wind up where people want to go .
“ [ Freight lines ] were never designed for moving passengers at high speeds to the destinations people want to go to , ” Dale said .
“ In the West , our cities and towns are newer and we ’ve really grown up along highway corridors in the last 50 years , and the railroad corridors are where they were before the highways . ”
That means they go to industrial areas , freight distribution centers or power plants .
A passenger train using existing freight corridors near I - 25 , for instance , could stop in Littleton and Castle Rock , but would miss the Tech Center .
A dedicated high - speed rail line could stop in Lone Tree and connect to existing Regional Transportation District ( RTD ) light rail at Lincoln Avenue .
Another problem with using freight lines is the railroad companies charge heavily to use their tracks or even be near their tracks — a problem RTD ran into when negotiating light - rail right - of - ways .
And the freight companies want to be absolved of liability in case of collisions or derailments .
The Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA ) requires “ buff - strength compliant trains ” that can survive such accidents , whereas European and Asian passenger trains have crumple zones that allow for lighter construction that can absorb the energy of collisions .
They can also tilt and therefore travel at higher speeds on the curvier tracks freight trains use .
Heavier , sturdier trains means slower speeds .
Upgrading freight lines on the Front Range to 110 mph systems ( on which Euro - style trains could travel an average of 50 to 60 mph ) would cost $ 3 billion .
The current system is only rated 79 mph , which means passenger trains could only travel 25 to 30 mph , which is prohibitive over long distances .
And even upgrading to 110 requires using currently non-compliant Euro - style trains like the Spanish Talgo T - 21 , meaning there would need to be significant FRA rule changes .
“ When you take the 100,000 foot view of this , you say , ‘ Why on earth would we want to use freight railway right of ways for passenger rail service , ' ” Dale said .
“ Leave them alone .
Let them run freight trains .
There ’s a great benefit in moving freight on rail , and if we ’re going to build passenger rail infrastructure , let ’s build it in the highway corridors and on state - owned or federally - owned highway right - of - ways . ”
The cost of dedicated , high - speed passenger rail along I - 25 is $ 6 billion .
High - speed rail from Denver International Airport to the Eagle County Regional Airport 40 miles west of Vail would be $ 16 billion .
An alternative is DIA to Summit County , where the majority of Front Range day - skier traffic goes , which would cost $ 9 billion .
Using freight rail lines and heavy Amtrak - style passenger cars works in some corridors on the East and West Coasts because distances are relatively short and traveling 30 mph is still better than sitting in impenetrable gridlock on the highways .
But longer commuter routes out into the suburbs , especially in the much more spread - out West , makes such speeds problematic for the kind of realistic ridership needed to sustain such a system .
The Obama administration , Dale said , needs to change its thinking on passenger rail .
“ The corridors themselves as a wide swath makes sense , but using freight railroad alignments in those corridors is where you ’re problem is .
You will never get true high - speed rail if you ’re sharing track with American freight trains .
The two are not even compatible . ”
Wiretaps of Silvio Berlusconi haranguing a broadcasting official over what he saw as politically hostile programming have prompted new criticism of the Italian premier for attempting to stifle the media .
The new transcripts , published in Italy for the first time yesterday , suggest that Mr Berlusconi telephoned a commissioner on the country 's independent broadcast regulator , Agcom , after he learned that a show examining corruption cases against him was due to go out on state broadcaster Rai .
" What the fuck are you doing with all this ? " the irate Prime Minister shouted at the commissioner , Giancarlo Innocenzi .
In another call Mr Berlusconi demands that a show looking at his alleged mafia links be muzzled .
Mr Innocenzi's responses appear largely obsequious .
As a result of the wiretaps , excerpts of which were printed in the centre - left La Repubblica , Mr Berlusconi is under investigation , along with Mr Innocenzi , for possible abuse of office .
Agcom , Italy 's official communications regulator , is supposed to be an " independent and autonomous " authority , accountable to parliament .
Rai's director - general , Mauro Masi , also features in the transcripts , in which he appears to say Rai " is doing all it can " to placate the Prime Minister .
Mr Masi tells
Mr Innocenzi that it has " a strategy in operation " that would resolve the " problem of Santoro , who is a particular type of problem " .
Michele Santoro is the high - profile host of the Annozero show that has led Rai TV 's examination of corruption charges against the premier .
The publication of the transcripts prompted a new round of criticism for the embattled Mr Berlusconi yesterday .
Head of the opposition Democratic Party Pierluigi Bersani snapped : " If he wants to change the TV programme , I 'd suggest the Prime Minister use the remote control not the telephone . "
Rai , which Mr Berlusconi frequently accuses of bias against him and his government , runs three of Italy 's six terrestrial TV channels .
Mr Berlusconi's own Mediaset empire owns the other three .
Critics note that the media mogul premier has a history of interfering with the state broadcaster .
In 2007 transcripts emerged of Mr Berlusconi ringing Rai's then head of drama , Agostino Sacca , and cajoling him to cast his favourite starlets in order to " raise the boss 's [ Mr Berlusconi 's ] morale " .
The publication of the latest tapes came as Rai chiefs confirmed it would implement a controversial , government - initiated ban on political chatshows ahead of the elections on 28 - 29 March .
The respected Corriere della Sera newspaper said that Mr Berlusconi was showing signs of desperation now that the wheels appeared to be falling off his PDL party ahead of the vote .
The Prime Minister is seeing poll ratings fall at the same time as an arch rival on the centre right , Gianfranco Fini , makes threatening political manoeuvres .
Daniele Capezzone , a spokesman for Mr Berlusconi's PDL party , called the wiretaps probe and the " fuss " over the talks shows " part of a worrying plot staged by people who hate Berlusconi " .
The Prime Minister himself claimed that judicial cases against him were whipped up " like clockwork " at election time and " blown up by obliging dailies " .
" It is a grotesque initiative .
I am not at all worried about the content because the Prime Minister has a right to speak on the phone with anybody without being intercepted , " he told state radio .
Media muscle :
What the PM said
Mr Berlusconi to Giancarlo Innocenzi , commissioner on broadcasting regulator Agcom :
" I 'm telling you , Thursday evening there was still the Spatuzza trial [ on TV ] and they were trying me as if I belonged to the Mafia ... really , if you do n't manage to do this stuff here ... I do n't know ... "
Mr Innocenzi to Rai director general Mauro Masi after news emerges of a Rai programme on the Berlusconi - Mills bribery charges :
" Berlusconi yelled at me : ' What the fuck are you doing with all this ? "
Then he gave me an ear - bashing that never ended . "
Mr Berlusconi suggests that Mr Innocenzi take the matter up with Agcom president Corrado Calabro :

For climate sceptics it was a key piece of evidence showing that the scientists behind global warming could not be trusted .
A quotation by one of the world 's most eminent climate scientists was supposed to demonstrate the depths to which he and his ilk would stoop to create scare stories exaggerating the threat of global warming .
Sir John Houghton , who played a critical role in establishing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPPC ) , was roundly condemned after it emerged that he was an apparent advocate of scary propaganda to frighten the public into believing the dangers of global warming .
" Unless we announce disasters , no one will listen , " Sir John was supposed to have said in 1994 .
The quotation has since become the iconic smoking gun of the climate sceptic community .
The words are the very first to appear in the " manual " of climate denialism written by the journalist and arch - sceptic Christopher Booker .
They get more than a 100,000 hits on Google , and are wheeled out almost every time a climate sceptic has a point to make , the last occasion being in a Sunday newspaper article last weekend written by the social anthropologist and climate sceptic Benny Peiser .
The trouble is , Sir John Houghton has never said what he is quoted as saying .
The words do not appear in his own book on global warming , first published in 1994 , despite statements to the contrary .
In fact , he denies emphatically that he ever said it at any time , either verbally or in writing .
In fact , his view on the matter of generating scare stories to publicise climate change is quite the opposite .
" There are those who will say ' unless we announce disasters , no one will listen ' , but I 'm not one of them , " Sir John told The Independent .
" It 's not the sort of thing I would ever say .
It 's quite the opposite of what I think and it pains me to see this quote being used repeatedly in this way .
I would never say we should hype up the risk of climate disasters in order to get noticed , " he said .
Even though the quotation appears on about 130 thousand web pages , no one seems to know where it originated .
On the few occasions a reference is cited , it is listed as coming from the first edition of Sir John 's book , Global Warming : The Complete Briefing , published by Lion Books in 1994 .
But Sir John does not say it in this edition , nor in subsequent editions published by Cambridge University Press .
Christopher Booker , a newspaper columnist , considers the quotation so important that he lists it at the top of the first page of his most recent book on climate scepticism , The Real Global Warming Disaster , published last year .
Mr Booker also cites the 1994 edition of Houghton 's own book on global warming as the source of the quotation , even though there is no mention of it there .
Mr Booker did not respond yesterday to enquiries by The Independent .
Benny Peiser , a social anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University , also cited the 1994 edition of Sir John 's book as the source of the quote , which he used last Sunday in an article denouncing the alarmism of climate scientists .
Dr Peiser admitted to The Independent that he had not read the book recently and had only used the quote " from memory " because it is so widely cited in other books on climate scepticism .
" I 've seen it printed in many books .
He is well known for making these statements .
I 've used that quote on many occasions from one of the books on climate alarmism .
If he makes the claim that he never said this then he has to clarify that , " Dr Peiser said .
" If he publicly says that he never made that statement then , of course , I would n't use it , but this is the first time I 've heard [ his denial ] and this has been going on for 15 years .
This quote has been used for the past 15 years , " he said .
In fact , the earliest record of the quote comes not from 15 years ago but from November 2006 when it appeared in a newspaper column written by the journalist Piers Akerman in the Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph .
Akerman , a controversial right - wing columnist and global warming sceptic , appears to be the first person to use the quote verbatim in an opinion piece criticising the Stern Review , which looked at the economic effects of global warming .
" This alarmist approach reeked of stupidity , snake oil , and misguided gospel preaching but was in line with a formula adopted by the first chairman of the IPCC , Sir John Houghton , who produced the IPCC 's first three reports in 1990 , 1995 and 2001 and wrote in his book Global Warming , The Complete Briefing , in 1994 : ' Unless we announce disasters no one will listen ' , " Mr Akerman said .
Within three years of Akerman 's piece being published , climate sceptics had jumped on the supposed quotation , citing the source as Houghton 's 1994 book .
Mr Akerman said that he could not remember where the quote came from but he will check his records .
Christopher Monckton , 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley , also cites the 1994 book as the source of the quote , which he uses extensively in his writings and lectures advocating climate scepticism .
The quotation , he says , is a prime example of the alarmism and exaggeration of the climate change community and the IPCC .
Although Lord Monckton replied to an email asking him for the source of the quotation , he did not reply to a second email pointing out that it does not appear anywhere in Houghton 's 1994 book .
Sir John , who was the former head of the Met Office but is now living in semi-active retirement in Wales , said he is considering taking legal action because he feels that the continued recycling of the misquotation is doing him and his science a huge disfavour .
" It does n't do me any good because it suggests to everyone that I have hyped things up .
I 've been growing aware of it now for some time .
The trouble is , if I just deny it then it cuts no ice with the people who want to believe it .
I have to consider legal action , " Sir John said .
How Sir John 's words were twisted
The scientist ...
Sir John Houghton
He is one of the most distinguished climate scientists of his generation .
He was professor of atmospheric physics at Oxford University until 1983 , when he became director general of the Meteorological Office where he established the Hadley Centre .
A devout Christian , Sir John has been a strong advocate of the global research effort into climate change .
He was the first head of the scientific working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and was lead editor of the panel 's first three reports outlining the science of global warming .
In 1994 he popularised the message of these reports in a book called Global Warming , The Complete Briefing .
The book is widely cited by climate sceptics as saying : " Unless we announce disasters , no one will listen " .
However , Sir John said that this quote does not exist anywhere in the book and he has never said or written such a statement .
... and the sceptics
Lord Monckton
Otherwise known as Christopher Monckton , he is one of the most articulate and theatrical of the climate sceptics , lecturing extensively in the US .
He likes to identify errors by climate scientists which he says fall in the direction of " undue alarmism and flagrant exaggeration " .
He has frequently cited the quotation of Sir John Houghton 's as a prime example of the deeply flawed nature of the scientists behind the global warming " scare " .
Lord Monckton cited the source of the quote as Sir John 's 1994 book , but did not reply to enquiries pointing out his error .
Christopher Booker
A journalist and author , Booker has been a thorn in the side of climate scientists .
His latest book , The Real Global Warming Disaster , is seen as the " manual " of climate scepticism .
He deems Sir John Houghton 's quote as being so important that it lies at the top of page one .
Again , the source of the quote is cited as the 1994 edition of Sir John 's book on global warming .
Booker has been a fierce critic of the IPCC and of Sir John 's Hadley Centre .
He believes that the computer models used by climate scientists are deeply flawed and that it is not carbon dioxide that has been driving the climate but natural changes driven by the activity of the Sun and changes to the ocean currents .
In short , Booker believes that global warming is merely a " bizarre set of collective delusions " .
Benny Peiser
A social anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University , he has not published any scientific research into climate change , but believes that the field is marred by alarmism .
He has also used the Houghton quotation , but said yesterday that he cannot recall where he had come across the quote , except that it was from another book on climate alarmism .
Peiser said he was unaware that Sir John denies saying the words .

( Health.com ) --
Scientists have finally confirmed what the rest of us have suspected for years : Bacon , cheesecake , and other delicious yet fattening foods may be addictive .
A new study in rats suggests that high - fat , high - calorie foods affect the brain in much the same way as cocaine and heroin .
When rats consume these foods in great enough quantities , it leads to compulsive eating habits that resemble drug addiction , the study found .
Doing drugs such as cocaine and eating too much junk food both gradually overload the so - called pleasure centers in the brain , according to Paul J. Kenny , Ph.D. , an associate professor of molecular therapeutics at the Scripps Research Institute , in Jupiter , Florida .
Eventually the pleasure centers " crash , " and achieving the same pleasure -- or even just feeling normal -- requires increasing amounts of the drug or food , says Kenny , the lead author of the study .
" People know intuitively that there 's more to [ overeating ] than just willpower , " he says .
" There 's a system in the brain that 's been turned on or over - activated , and that 's driving [ overeating ] at some subconscious level . "
In the study , published in the journal Nature Neuroscience , Kenny and his co-author studied three groups of lab rats for 40 days .
One of the groups was fed regular rat food .
A second was fed bacon , sausage , cheesecake , frosting , and other fattening , high - calorie foods -- but only for one hour each day .
The third group was allowed to pig out on the unhealthy foods for up to 23 hours a day .
Health.com :
How the pros curb food cravings
Not surprisingly , the rats that gorged themselves on the human food quickly became obese .
But their brains also changed .
By monitoring implanted brain electrodes , the researchers found that the rats in the third group gradually developed a tolerance to the pleasure the food gave them and had to eat more to experience a high .
Health.com :
Eat this and burn more fat
They began to eat compulsively , to the point where they continued to do so in the face of pain .
When the researchers applied an electric shock to the rats ' feet in the presence of the food , the rats in the first two groups were frightened away from eating .
But the obese rats were not .
" Their attention was solely focused on consuming food , " says Kenny .
In previous studies , rats have exhibited similar brain changes when given unlimited access to cocaine or heroin .
And rats have similarly ignored punishment to continue consuming cocaine , the researchers note .
Health.com : 25 diet - busting foods you should never eat
The fact that junk food could provoke this response is n't entirely surprising , says Dr. Gene - Jack Wang , M.D. , the chair of the medical department at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Brookhaven National Laboratory , in Upton , New York .
" We make our food very similar to cocaine now , " he says .
Coca leaves have been used since ancient times , he points out , but people learned to purify or alter cocaine to deliver it more efficiently to their brains ( by injecting or smoking it , for instance ) .
This made the drug more addictive .
According to Wang , food has evolved in a similar way .
" We purify our food , " he says .
" Our ancestors ate whole grains , but we 're eating white bread .
American Indians ate corn ; we eat corn syrup . "
Health.com : 10 ' Last Supper ' paintings : Bigger portions over time ?
The ingredients in purified modern food cause people to " eat unconsciously and unnecessarily , " and will also prompt an animal to " eat like a drug abuser [ uses drugs ] , " says Wang .
The neurotransmitter dopamine appears to be responsible for the behavior of the overeating rats , according to the study .
Dopamine is involved in the brain 's pleasure ( or reward ) centers , and it also plays a role in reinforcing behavior .
" It tells the brain something has happened and you should learn from what just happened , " says Kenny .
Overeating caused the levels of a certain dopamine receptor in the brains of the obese rats to drop , the study found .
In humans , low levels of the same receptors have been associated with drug addiction and obesity , and may be genetic , Kenny says .
Health.com :
The real reasons we eat too much
However , that does n't mean that everyone born with lower dopamine receptor levels is destined to become an addict or to overeat .
As Wang points out , environmental factors , and not just genes , are involved in both behaviors .
Wang also cautions that applying the results of animal studies to humans can be tricky .
For instance , he says , in studies of weight - loss drugs , rats have lost as much as 30 percent of their weight , but humans on the same drug have lost less than 5 percent of their weight .
" You can't mimic completely human behavior , but [ animal studies ] can give you a clue about what can happen in humans , " Wang says .
Although he acknowledges that his research may not directly translate to humans , Kenny says the findings shed light on the brain mechanisms that drive overeating and could even lead to new treatments for obesity .
" If we could develop therapeutics for drug addiction , those same drugs may be good for obesity as well , " he says .

Steve Krakauer catches this strange coincidence for Mediaite , in which the network appears to take Obama ’s advice about Obama .
Fox did n’t even bother to cover the visit by Barack Obama to his fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill , which featured another strange coincidence in question selection :
Politicos watching President Barack Obama ’s question - and - answer with Senate Democrats might notice : Many of the lawmakers pressing the president are vulnerable entering the 2010 election .
So far , Sens. Arlen Specter ( Pa. ) , Michael Bennet ( Colo . ) , Blanche Lincoln ( Ark. ) , Kirsten Gillibrand ( N.Y. ) and Barbara Boxer ( Calif . ) have taken to the microphones to ask Obama questions and , at the same time , stress their Democratic bona fides .
…
Specter is trailing Republican challenger Pat Toomey ( Pa. ) in preliminary polls , despite a six - term incumbency .
Meanwhile , Bennet ’s seat is regarded as a toss - up , and Lincoln has faced near - crippling pressure from her opponents on the healthcare front .
While Obama won kudos for his appearance with Republicans last week from the media , and Republicans benefited from the media ’s coverage of their policy proposals , very few appear impressed with today ’s event .
Krakauer himself noted the banality of the echo chamber feel of Obama ’s appearance :
It was ( sort of ) Presidential Question Time , Part Two today , as Pres. Barack Obama addressed the Democratic Senators at their retreat .
It turned out to be far less of a pull - back - the - curtain moment …
As a whole , the event turned out to be more of a chance for Democrats in contested races to speak on a big platform with the President – and less of a real give - and - take than Friday .
Following a few of the White House press corps ’
Twitter feeds gave the same impression :
“ I do n’t think a D on D # Question Time works as well .
Feels too staged .
U also may need a random way to select questioners , ” wrote Nate Silver , a political statistician at fivethirtyeight.com . …
“ This Q&A was a lot more boring than the last Q&A , ” wrote Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein .
The fact that five of the six Democrats who asked questions are up for reelection in November did not go unnoticed either .
“ Takeaway from obama sen dems meeting : new transparency .
It ’s transparent that this was forum for vulnerable dems 2 campaign , ” wrote CNN ’s Dana Bash .
There was little tension and nothing said that had n’t already been expressed over the past year .
Perhaps in the future , the House and Senate could schedule these events and give equal time to Democrats and Republicans for questions , which would make it a more precedent - setting environment and allow for better transparency in the actual halls of power .

Globalization is killing Europe , just as it's already wiped out much of the American middle class .
Spain and Greece are facing immediate crises that many other European nations see on the near horizon : aging boomer workers are retiring with healthy benefit packages , but the younger workers who are paying for those benefits are n't making anything close to the income ( or , therefore , paying the taxes ) that their parents did .
Globalists / corporatists / conservative " free market " and " flat earth " advocates say this is a great opportunity to cut benefits for the old folks ( and for the young folks in the future ) , thus bringing the countries budgets back into balance , and this story is the main corporate media storyline .
But it overlooks the real issue ( and the real solution ) : how globalization is killing these nations ' economies and what can be done about it .
From the days of Adam Smith , classical economics pointed out that manufacturing and extraction are the only two ways to " create wealth . "
" Wealth " is different from " income . "
Wealth is value , which endures at least for some time .
Income is simply compensation for work .
If you wash my car for $ 10 and I mow your lawn for $ 10 , we have a GDP of $ 20 and it looks like we both have income and economic activity .
But no wealth has been created , just income .
On the other hand , if I build your car , I 'm creating something of value .
And if you turn my lawn into a small farm that produces food we can all eat , you 're creating something of value .
Not only do we have an " economy " with a " GDP , " we also have created wealth .
A stick on the ground has no commercial value , but if you add labor to it by carving it into an axe handle -- a thing of commercial value -- you have " created wealth . "
Similarly , metals in the ground have no commercial value , but when you add labor to them by extracting , refining , and forming them into products , you " create wealth . "
Even turning seeds and dirt and cows into hamburgers is a form of manufacturing and creates wealth .
This is the " Wealth of Nations " that titled Adam Smith 's famous 1776 book .
On the other hand , when a trader at Goldman Sachs makes a " profit " trading stocks , bonds , or currencies , no wealth whatsoever is created .
In fact , to the extent that that trader takes millions in commissions , pay , and bonuses , he 's actually depleting the wealth of the nation ( particularly to the extent that he moves his money offshore to save or invest , as many do ) .
To use the United States as an example , in the late 1940s and early 1950s manufacturing accounted for a high of 28 percent of our total gross domestic product ( and much of the rest of the economy like agriculture that , in a classical sense is " manufacturing " was n't even included in those numbers ) , and when Reagan came into office it was at a strong 20 percent .
Today it 's about ten percent of our GDP .
What this means is that we 're creating less wealth here , because we 're not making much anymore .
( And the biggest growth in American manufacturing has been in the military sector , where goods are made that are then destroyed when they explode over foreign cities , causing even more of our wealth to vanish . )
The main effect of the globalism fad of the past 30 yearrs -- lowering the protective barriers to trade that countries for centuries have used to make sure their own local economies are self - sufficient -- has been to ship manufacturing ( the creation of wealth ) from developed nations to developing nations .
Transnational corporations love this , because in countries with lower labor costs and few environmental and safety regulations , it 's more profitable to manufacture products .
They then sell those products in the " mature " countries -- the places that used to manufacture -- and people burn through the wealth they 'd accumulated in the earlier manufacturing days ( home equity , principally , along with savings and lines of credit ) to buy these foreign - manufactured goods .
At first , it looks like a good deal to consumers in developed nations .
Goods are cheaper !
But over a decade or two or three , as the creation of real wealth is reduced and the residue of the old wealth is spent , the developed nations become progressively poorer and poorer .
At the same time , the " developing " nations become wealthier -- because those are the places that are producing real wealth .
Which brings us to Spain and Greece -- and the problem of all developed nations including the USA .
So long as globalism continues apace , the transnational corporations and their CEOs will continue to become fabulously wealthy .
But , more importantly , they also acquire the political power that comes with that control of economies .
So they tell us that instead of putting back into place tariffs , domestic content laws , and other " protectionist " policies that built America from the time the were first proposed by Alexander Hamilton in 1791 ( and largely adopted by Congress in 1793 ) until they were dismantled by Reagan / Bush / Clinton / Bush , we should instead simple " accept the reality " that we 're " living beyond our means " and we have to " cut back our wages and social programs . "
In other words , they get richer , our nations become poorer , and national sovereignty is reduced .
Nations -- and in large countries like the USA , even states -- must again rebuild their manufacturing base and become locally self - sufficient , so their own consumers are buying products manufactured by their own workers .
" But wo n't that make Wal - Mart 's stuff more expensive ? " whine the flat - earthers .
Yes , it will .
But most Americans ( and Greeks and Spaniards ) would gladly pay 10 percent more for the goods in their stores if their paychecks were 20 percent higher .
And manufacturing paychecks have always been higher , because manufacturing is where " true wealth " is generated ( thus the basis for most union movements , which further guarantee healthy worker income and benefits ) .
The transnational corporations benefiting from globalization are also , in most cases , the transnational corporations that own our media , so even the word globalization is rarely heard in reports on economic crises around the world .
But globalization is the villain here , and one that needs to be taken in hand and brought under control quickly if we do n't want to see virtually the nations of the world end up subservient to corporate control , a new form of an ancient economic system known as feudalism .

The Chinese government is considering taking meat from pet animals off menus across the country , raising concerns among dog farmers who have relied on the industry for generations .
The draft proposal to ban dog and cat meat has drawn an angry outcry from regions where the dish is popular .
Opponents say the ban would destroy local culinary traditions .

Mr Papaconstantinou ( right ) has asked for more bail - out details Greece has been warned by European finance ministers that it must make further cuts to spending and public sector wages or face more sanctions .
A joint statement from the 16 eurozone nations it said Greece needed to get its debt under control and calm " irrational " financial markets .
Last week , the European Union vowed to help Greece if needed .
But the idea of bailing out a euro nation has been badly received , prompting a harsher stance .
Rising pressure Greece 's woes have sent the value of the euro down to a nine - month low recently .
Now the country has been told that further measures will be imposed if its debt reduction plans are not on target by 16 March .
We wo n't abandon Greece
France 's Christine Lagarde
Why Greece matters
No tax please , we 're Greek Q&A : Greece 's economic woes Ministers and bank officials from the eurozone met in Brussels on Tuesday .
Germany 's deputy finance minister , Joerg Asmussen , said Greece should follow the actions of Ireland and Latvia - both of which are making major cuts to spending and wages .
" We made it clear the ball is in Greece 's court , " he said .
" Additional measures by Greece are needed " .
Austrian Finance Minister Josef Proell said : " The pressure on Greece to consider further measures has clearly increased . "
' Greek problem ' Earlier , Jean - Claude Juncker , chairman of the 16 nations that share the single currency and also Luxembourg 's prime minister , told German radio that Greece must understand that other eurozone members were not prepared to pay for its mistakes .
Greece 's debt crisis is " first and foremost a Greek problem and an internal Greek problem , " Mr Juncker said .
The markets are giving the euro a severe stress test because they suspect there are real flaws and uncertainties that have not been addressed

Hewitt 's blog in full " The financial markets are completely wrong if they think they can destroy Greece , " he added .
Europe 's leaders pledged to help Greece last week - without spelling out exactly what they were willing to do .
On Monday , French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde told reporters : " We wo n't abandon Greece .
It 's clear that we are all in this together . "
Greece is trying to reduce its public deficit from 12.7 % - more than four times the level that single currency rules allow .
It has pledged to reduce this to 8.7 % during 2010 under an austerity plan that involves major cuts in public spending .
But those plans are hugely unpopular with the Greek public and strikes have already been scheduled .
Greek bank shares fell again on Tuesday on the continuing concerns .
The country 's main stock index is down 14.6 % so far this year .
On Monday , Greece 's Finance Minister , George Papaconstantinou , said that he wanted the other eurozone nations to release details of their planned bail - out for his country to ease market fears that the country could default on its debts .
But Mr Juncker said it would be " unwise " to publicly detail " the measures we are putting in place " .
Mr Papaconstantinou has said repeatedly that his country is not asking for financial help from Brussels .

Although the Christian Bible has many verses describing the horrors and torments of Hell , it has surprisingly little to say about what Heaven is like .
The assumption , it seems , is that everyone knows Heaven is a great place and everyone will want to go there , so advertising is not necessary .
However , this assumption , at least in my case , may not be correct .
I do not mean to denigrate the civil , intelligent and rational believers whose acquaintance I have made , but in the course of researching atheism and theism , it is unfortunately true that I have come across religious bigots and racists , brazen hypocrites , hateful zealots , those who are ignorant and determined to remain that way , and many others who represent some of the worst qualities of humanity .
Ironically , it is these types of individuals who most frequently insist that salvation can be assured , and who further claim that they are among the beneficiaries of that salvation .
I say , if Heaven is full of these people , then I want no part of it .
In all seriousness , there remain some fundamental problems with the doctrine of Heaven .
Consider the following :
Most major religious traditions with a concept of Heaven – Christianity , Judaism , Islam , Mormonism , the Jehovah ’s Witnesses , Baha ’i – hold that God is good .
Yet it is undeniable that evil and suffering exist in this world , even though a truly good God would not allow such things .
In a partial attempt to resolve this dilemma , apologists for these traditions often rely on the so - called “ free will defense ” – that God gave human beings the ability to choose , either to obey him or to defy him , and those who choose to defy him and break his laws are the cause of moral evil in this world .
Many fundamentalist Christians would state this in even stronger form : they believe that all human beings are inherently sinful , and that it is impossible for anyone to avoid breaking God ’s laws , no matter how good they try to be .
As a result , these Christians conclude , humans are incapable of reaching Heaven by their own efforts , and only those who seek forgiveness of their sins from Jesus Christ will be granted salvation and eternal life .
However , “ eternal life ” is typically held in theist circles to mean an eternal continuation of mortal life – i.e. , the souls in Heaven will retain the same memories , the same personality , the same character traits as they had on Earth .
But if this is the case , do they also retain the same sinful human nature ?
Most religions would agree that even the best among us put a foot wrong occasionally , and some Christians would further state that everyone sins all the time .
Do people commit sins in Heaven , just as the fundamentalists would have us believe they do on Earth ?
There are two possibilities : either there is sin in Heaven or there is n’t .
The teachings of virtually all religions mitigate against the first option , and with good reason .
If there is sin in Heaven , it ca n’t be that much better than Earth .
There may not be tornadoes , earthquakes or infectious diseases there , but human beings are capable of harming each other in a virtually limitless number of more subtle ways .
Is there anger or frustration in Heaven ?
What about envy , pride , lust , greed , loneliness , hatred ?
Could there be harassment there , or infidelity , or treachery , or outright war ?
If all these things do exist in Heaven , then why would anyone want to go there ?
If they do n’t , how can that be reconciled with the fact that Heaven is populated by fallible , sinful humans ?
At this point , a simple solution suggests itself .
According to the theodicy discussed above , moral evil and sin are the result of humans misusing the free will God gave to us .
Therefore , an easy way to prevent there being evil and sin in Heaven would be for God to revoke the free will of its inhabitants .
We now have a further choice :
If there is no sin in Heaven , do the people there have free will or do they not ?
I will examine the latter possibility first .
The problem theists face could be resolved by claiming that there is no sin in Heaven because there is no free will in Heaven ; when we get there , we become like angels , non - free - willed beings whose only function is to praise God and who are actually incapable of committing sins .
But if Heaven is a desirable goal , those who make this argument must also claim that free will is a bad thing , or at least that the lack of free will is a desirable condition .
But this violates the key teaching of theism , embodied in the free will defense , which states that God gave us free will because he wants us to choose him of our own accord , not have our love programmed into us like machines .
And yet the ultimate reward , the thing we desire and God desires for us , is to lose our free will and become mindless slaves to the Almighty ?
This does not make sense .
It is not compatible with the high value God supposedly places on free will ; so high , in fact , that he allows most of humanity to damn itself just so the fraction of people who worship him as he directs can be said to genuinely love him .
If it is that important to God that we freely choose him , then how can he be content to be surrounded for all eternity by human automata chanting his praises , endlessly , like broken records ?
Would this not represent the undoing of everything he sought to achieve by creating free will in the first place ?
Indeed , if he is content with this , then the creation of this mortal world was entirely unnecessary .
Why not just throw out free will entirely and begin with Heaven , and not have to create a Hell at all ?
And if such a Heaven is unsatisfactory to God , it should be equally unsatisfactory to its other residents .
Many people , I among them , would say that a Paradise without free will is no reward at all .
I value my autonomy and self - direction .
Why would I want to give that up so I could spend eternity mindlessly singing hymns over and over ?
If Heaven is not a place where you get the reward you desire , it is not Heaven .
It seems , therefore , that a Heaven with both free will and sin is unsatisfactory , and a Heaven without either free will or sin is also unsatisfactory .
The final option – that there is free will , but no sin , in Heaven – is the most interesting , and the most potentially dangerous for theism .
On its face , it seems like the best option for both God and human beings .
But how can there be free will without sin ?
The theist might answer that the free will in Heaven is some different kind of free will , superior to the kind we have on Earth .
Perhaps the people there are gifted with perfect knowledge , or perfect empathy , or something of the sort , or perhaps we are transformed by being in the presence of God , or perhaps we receive new bodies immune to the temptations of sin ( some Christians believe exactly this and call it “ glorification “ ) – so that people in Heaven are either no longer able to commit sins or are able to avoid doing so , yet retain their free will in other things .
But of course , this begs the question :
Why did n’t God create us with this kind of free will in the first place and thus not have to create a Hell at all ?
No Christian or other theist has ever been able to resolve this paradox .
Assuming Heaven exists , there are only four options to choose from :
There is both sin and free will in Heaven .
There is sin but no free will in Heaven .
There is free will but no sin in Heaven .
There is neither free will nor sin in Heaven .
Together , these four options exhaust all possibilities , and therefore one of them must be true .
The only remaining question , then , is which of the four is the correct one .
I have argued on theological grounds that option ( 1 ) is unacceptable to Heaven - believing theists , and I know of no theist who disputes that conclusion .
( Option ( 2 ) is simply absurd and will not be considered . )
I have additionally argued that ( 4 ) is likewise unsatisfactory because it would make Heaven an undesirable goal for many , and because it contradicts the free will theodicy , a key teaching of most religions , which states that God wants beings who freely choose to love him and not “ robots ” programmed to do so .
Again , I know of no member of these religions who is challenging that .
Therefore , the only conclusion is that the correct solution is ( 3 ) .
But theists who accept this solution have stepped into a trap .
Now consider this argument :
By ( 3 ) above , it is possible for God to create free - willed beings
without the possibility of evil .
According to the free will theodicy , evil arises from the actions of
free - willed beings .
By ( I ) and ( II ) , God deliberately chose to create free - willed beings
who would commit evil acts , even though he had the option of doing
otherwise .
Conclusion : God wanted evil to exist .
And a being that would want evil to exist is itself evil .
This contradicts the tenet of theism which states that God is good , and so I believe I have shown that theistic belief as currently given by most of the world ’s major religions contains within itself an irreconcilable contradiction .
Therefore , it is not logically consistent within itself , and therefore it cannot possibly be true .
In logical terms , this is an example of “ proof by contradiction ” : by taking the initial premises of a system as given and showing that a self - contradiction logically follows , we prove that one or more of the initial premises must have been flawed .
On the basis of other considerations , I propose that the flawed axiom is that God exists in the first place .
The potential importance of this matter cannot be overstated .
This dilemma strikes at the very heart of theism – a god who would create evil , or create a world where evil is inevitable , despite having the option to do otherwise , would itself be evil , simply stated .
If God would have originally created us with the sort of free will that excludes evil altogether , then no one at all would have ended up in Hell .
But if God did not do this , and instead created us in a way that allows for the possibility – or the certainty – of sin , thus necessitating the creation of a Hell and ensuring that countless millions of beings would be doomed to an eternity of punishment there , then the only conclusion is that he wants at least some people to go to Hell , and only a monster would desire this .
If God deliberately chose this poor option when a better one existed , then he is evil , and such a god would not be worthy or deserving of worship even if it existed .
Fortunately , the empirical evidence suggests that this god does not exist at all – that the contradiction arises only from the minds of human beings , who have attempted to live in an indifferent and unfair world while maintaining the fantasy that an almighty , all - good ruler presides over it .
Though this argument is the most serious strike against Heaven , other problems exist with the doctrine as well .
For instance : Would n’t Heaven get boring eventually ?
Most religions that believe in such a place hold it to be a realm of perfect peace and idyllic contentment , where nothing ever goes wrong and where all the desires of its inhabitants are fulfilled .
And there is no doubt that an arriving soul would find such a place to be very beautiful and would be very happy – at least for a little while .
But it could not be long before a saved soul would look around at his heavenly surroundings and say , “ Okay , now what ? ”
The point is this .
How can beings such as humans not be bored if we have no work , no challenges , no accomplishments ?
What is there to do in Heaven ?
If you play a game of golf there , will you hit a hole in one every time ?
If you cultivate a garden , will it always give forth a profusion of beautiful plants and flowers regardless of how much or how little care you put into it ?
If you try to make new friends , does it really matter who you come in contact with , since every saved soul is just as loving and gracious as every other ?
( What would it mean to be an individual in Heaven ? )
It is easy to see how pointless such an existence would be , how rapidly it would become an intolerable monotony .
Humans need obstacles to surmount , deeds to accomplish , new experiences to be had to make their life worthwhile , and Heaven offers none of these things .
I am not arguing that there must be evil for life to have value .
A world where pain and suffering exist is unjustifiable .
But a world where there are no challenges or difficulties of all – no change of any kind – would be sterile , pointless .
Yet we are told that Heaven is such a world .
Will the saved really want to go on forever in such a state ?
Wo n’t the same hymn praising God get just a little tedious after the ten trillionth repetition or so ?
Will the Muslims who are looking forward to receiving their promised seventy - two dark - eyed virgins really be satisfied forever with that ?
To an ignorant desert nomad , this must have seemed the greatest imaginable reward , but all finite pleasures must ultimately fade before the crushing , inconceivable length of time that is eternity .
Likewise , it is significant that this site , which describes Heaven in rather absurd detail , mentions the saved being able to personally meet and talk to the heroes and prophets of the Bible – but the only stories these worthies will have to tell about come from their time on Earth .
What will happen after Judgment Day , when all of humanity is either in Heaven or Hell and everything that ’s ever going to happen will have happened ?
Wo n’t hearing Moses tell the story of crossing the desert with the Israelites , or Noah ’s description of the Flood , or even having Jesus preach a sermon at your dinner party , lose its novelty after the last few hundred billion times ?
Those who conceive of a changeless eternity , and think they will never tire of it , do not have much imagination .
For all its nightmares , all its sadness and its horror , life on Earth has a point : while we are here , we can do things , things that matter ; we can make a difference .
In Heaven , no one can make a difference .
The story will be over , the book will be closed .
There will be nothing else to look forward to but ennui and despair from the endless march of weary eons .
Can such a sterile and empty eternity really be considered a reward , or would not Heaven , with time , eventually become Hell ?
Who really wants to live forever ?
There is one last problem to address – a big one .
To admit the existence of a Heaven , one must also admit the existence of a Hell .
( At least , as far as scripture is concerned .
Some might believe otherwise , but such views find no support in any major religion ’s holy book . )
If this is the case , it is likely that for every one person who is saved , two or more will be damned , as no single religion commands a majority of the world ’s population .
And if the Bible and most other holy books are any guide , damnation is forever ;
Hell is an infinite punishment .
The point is this .
How can anyone enjoy Heaven , knowing that while you have eternal bliss there are people experiencing eternal suffering ?
Unless you belong to an insular religious community or a cult , it ’s almost certain that you know someone – a friend , a relative , a loved one , an idol who inspires you – whose religion of choice is different than yours , or who has no religion at all .
How will you be able to enjoy Heaven in the certain knowledge that that person is , at the same moment , suffering the torments of the damned ?
What if it ’s a spouse , a parent , a best friend , a child ?
( Some theists claim that watching the damned suffer is one of the rewards allotted to those who reach Heaven .
About this no more will be said . )
How can Heaven be any sort of reward at all if it means eternal separation from the people you care about , all the more so if those people must suffer without release while you are powerless to help them ?
And will you , a saved soul in Paradise , be content to kneel and worship the same god who , elsewhere at that same moment , is pouring out the flames of his wrath upon your lost loved ones ?
Charles Darwin , the founder of evolutionary theory and initially a devout Christian who later deconverted to agnosticism , said it best :
“ I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true ; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe , and this would include my Father , Brother and almost all my best friends , will be everlastingly punished .
And this is a damnable doctrine . ”
– From The Autobiography of Charles Darwin , 1809 - 1882 , With Original Omissions Restored , p.87 , ed. Nora Barlow .
Norton & Co. , 1969 .
But even in the very unlikely situation that everyone you know or care about has exactly the same beliefs as you , is this really a solution to the problem ?
Do you have to know the people in Hell personally for their suffering to spoil your happiness in Heaven , or would it be enough to ruin your heavenly bliss to know that anyone is in Hell at all ?
Would a truly good person , the kind worthy of an eternity of peace and joy , be untroubled by the screams of the multitudes writhing in the lake of fire ?
Would he not be crippled with empathy for those lost in the darkness of separation from God ?
Indeed , it might well be said that if you ’re looking forward to Heaven and do n’t plan on being bothered by the suffering of those in Hell , then you do n’t belong in Heaven .
And how much worse would the problem be if the very appeal of Heaven , as already mentioned , is to be in the presence of the very god who is inflicting these unimaginable torments upon others ?
Humans are , as far as we know , the only creatures cursed with a clear view of their own mortality .
It is natural and understandable that we would seek to allay our fears by inventing beliefs by which we could persuade ourselves that we could escape this fate .
The doctrine of Heaven is one such .
At first glance , it sounds like everything one could ask for .
Who would n’t want eternal life with God in Paradise ?
Who would n’t want to know that all of your ( believer ) relatives and friends who have died will be there , waiting for you ?
Such ideas can give courage to the dying , comfort to the bereaved , and hope to those who believe everything will be set right in the next world .
But just because a belief makes our existence more pleasant does not mean it is true .
It is the right and the duty of every person to rationally and skeptically examine a proposition before accepting it , and if that proposition turns out to not be supported by logic or evidence , it is the mark of a mature mind to be able to set it aside and face life as it really is .
Heaven is just such a belief .
Comforting though the idea may be , a rational examination shows that it suffers from intractable logical problems .
Therefore , we should face up to the fact that it is fiction , and find within ourselves the wisdom and the honesty to go on without it .
To those who have never known the freedom of a life without dogma , losing the safety net of belief in a pleasant afterlife may seem frightening and traumatic at first .
But like so many other doctrines of theism , the discarding of it ultimately turns out to be not a loss , but a gain .
The idea of “ eternal life ” makes our lives comparatively fleeting and worthless – after all , why bother trying to make yourself a better person now when you ’ll have eons to do it later ?
Why bother trying to ease the suffering of your fellow beings when all their tears will eventually be wiped away ?
This concept devalues our achievements , debases our very humanity .
Far better , far more commendable , is the atheist who does not fear death , though he accepts that when you ’re gone , you ’re gone , and strives to make the best use of the gifts of life and consciousness in the short time span available .
Tragically , the means that theists have adopted in an attempt to escape the end are instead depriving them of the only chance they will ever have .
Using such precious time to pray and abase yourself and follow superstitious rituals , all in the hope of winning the favor of some fictitious supernatural being , is a terrible waste .
Life is too short to spend it on your knees .
Instead of preparing for another existence that will never come , we should make the best use of the life we do have .
To learn wisdom , to appreciate beauty , to stand up for what you believe in , and to love – these are far better uses of the all too brief time allotted to each of us .
Gold cars are probably the newest trend .
It does n’t look that bad although the red Ferrari Enzo always will be the best color for the car .
I had to look several times at the photo because it looks like something someone photoshopped .
But , it is a real picture .
It`s a head turn type what can I say .
Garbage Plate – Nick Tahou Hots
Rochester , New York , is known for this unusual dish .
The Garbage Plate was created at Nick Tahou Hots ’ fast - food restaurant more than fifty years ago .
In 1918 , Alexander Tahou opened a restaurant in Rochester called Hots and Potatoes .
On the menu was a dish that included just about everything the kitchen could cook — meat and potatoes with a few other things thrown in to make a one - plate meal that would really stick to your ribs .
Alexander ’s son , Nick , took over the restaurant operations and updated the name to Garbage Plate .
Legend has it that long - ago college students asked Nick Tahou for a dish with ” all the garbage ” on it .
So , he concocted his original combo plate with two hamburger patties and a choice of two sides — usually some combination of home fries , macaroni salad , and beans .
The contents are often laced heavily with ketchup and hot sauce , and mixed together before eating .
Rolls or white bread are served on the side .
By the 1980s , the place was a huge hit with the college crowd , and eventually that meat and potatoes dish ( or “ hots and po-tots ” as it was sometimes called ) was dubbed the Garbage Plate .
In 1992 , the name iwas trademarked .
The Garbage Plate is considered a great late - night snack , and this restaurant is packed with diners from around midnight to 4:00 a.m .
Young college men living in Rochester , who like to have contests to see how much beer or food they can consume , consider the Garbage Plate a rite of passage from boyhood to manhood .
Restaurants all over the city serve many variations or imitations on this famous combo plate , but the original is the invention belong to a downtown restaurateur named Nick Tahou .
Other restaurants in the Rochester area have tried to put garbage plates on their menu but have been legally enjoined to rename similar dishes they serve with names such as Dumpster plates , Messy Plate , Sloppy Plate , Dog Dish , and Plat du Refuse .
Today , there are many different Garbage Plates served , such as cheeseburger , hot dog , hamburger , egg , sausage , and steak .
They all have the same base with half the plate piled with home fries , and the other half with a pile of macaroni salad .
Then comes whatever you order , such as eggs or burgers , placed on top .
Over everything are a couple of spoonfuls of onions and a glob of mustard .
The Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at the University of Rochester holds an annual Nick Tahou ’s Run ( the run benefits the fraternity ’s national charity .
Teams of two or three men run 2.2 miles from campus to Nick Tahou ’s on West Main Street .
Once there , they hand off to another person who must eat a garbage plate before the first person turns around and runs back to complete the relay .
Some brave men will do the run alone .
The fraternity calls them “ iron men ” .
Ron Witt , my food snoop in Rochester , NY , checked out this culinary creation with his son , Brian .
Ron says , “ Brian , like the college boys , regularly goes there late at night after chasing around town .
They literally inhale those plates of food . ”
Photo was taken by Ron Witt .
Ron ’s review :
There are many variations of the Garbage Plate , such as the Hot Dog Plate , the Hot Dog Burger Plate , and then there are versions with baked beans .
We had the original classic , the Burger Plate .
The atmosphere at Nick Tahou ’s restaurant is very down to earth with old fashioned counter tops , cooking area , and the added presence of street people from all walks of life .
It is customary to tip the person who makes the order .
In our case the total for the two plates and two Cokes came to $ 14.73 .
I was stuffed when I finished the plate .
After about an hour and a half I got sleepy from it .
It is very rich !
Here are the ingredients I saw and tasted :
1st layer : Home Fries and Macaroni / mayo ( very slippery macaroni and mayonnaise ) a little celery and carrots in the macaroni ( very little ) .
No unusual taste with the macaroni , just like all the take out fillers we ’ve ever had .
The home fries are crisp and delicious just like homemade .
2nd Layer :
Two hamburger patties medium well done covered with melted cheese , a mustard horseradish sauce , and then covered with chili hot sauce .
The mustard horseradish sauce is delicious – more horsey than mustard in flavor .
The hot sauce is like every ground beef hot sauce you can imagine .
Typical and very good .
Not too hot , very zesty and rich .
Side Dish :
The garbage plate also comes with a side of old fashioned Italian bread to help it down .
The bread is freshly made at a bakery right next door .
Comments from readers :
I loved this entry on garbage plates .

A man who fired a shot on an Oakwood Avenue bus last year has received a nine - year prison sentence after pleading guilty to attempted murder in an incident captured with stunning clarity by on - bus security cameras .
“ I ’m not a gangster .
I do n’t walk around with a gun , ” Richard Haynes , 29 , told the court Thursday , according to the Toronto Star .
“ I tried to take it off the bus .
I apologize for that ... I ’d never hurt anybody . ”
Haynes pleaded guilty Monday .
" Once he saw what was on ( the tape ) , he found it difficult to accept that he was someone who was capable of that , " said defence lawyer Sean Robichaud .
The Crown and defence supplied a joint submission to Justice Carole Brewer .
The incident occurred on Feb. 23 , 2009 .
The target was a 17 - year - old boy , who had been shot in the hip at one point during the attack .
He has since recovered .
Haynes , a second man and the victim knew each other .
They got into an altercation as Haynes and an accomplice tried to get the teen off the bus .
The teen would n't budge .
The security footage -- the result of a $ 17 - million upgrade to TTC bus security that began four years ago -- shows Haynes getting off the bus , getting back on , unwrapping a . 45 - calibre handgun from a red bandana , saying something to the driver -- and then firing a shot .
The bullet ricocheted and then ended up in the lining of a woman 's winter coat .
She could be seen walking up to the driver to calmly say she thought she 'd been shot .
However , she suffered no serious injuries .
By then , the teen had been pulled off the bus .
His hip wound came from a second bullet fired while the three fighting were outside .
No one else was injured .
Court heard Thursday that the 17 - year - old had stabbed Haynes in the midsection earlier in the day .
Haynes said he wanted an apology from the teen and that the earlier incident had filled him with rage to the point where he zoned out .
Haynes had no previous criminal record .
Upon completing his sentence , he will face deportation to Jamaica .
Marlon Cooper , 22 , the second man involved in the attack , pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily harm for his role and was sentenced to two years less a day .
He was given credit for time already spent in custody .
He said nothing after leaving court .
Daniel Brown , his lawyer , said all his client did was attempt to push the victim off the bus .

Planet Money ’s latest podcast features an interview with Matt LeBlanc , an efficiency expert .
LeBlanc ’s job is to observe various processes and figure out ways to make them more efficient .
The idea , is that by increasing efficiency companies can save money , which ends up helping everyone through higher productivity and lower prices , even if some people get laid off along the way .
I am as much of a compulsive efficiency nerd as anyone ( well , almost anyone ) .
LeBlanc lays out his toiletries in the morning in a specific order in order to minimize transition time .
When I lived in Berkeley , I figured out the fastest way to drive to school .
The various possible routes were different paths through a grid that included some stop signs and some street lights ; the best route involved slowing down at one intersection , looking to see if what color the light at an intersection was , and making a decision based on that .
On one of my previous blogs I wrote a post about the quickest way to get through a security line at an airport .
( Tip # 1 : Do n’t unload your bags into the plastic trays until shortly before you reach the X - ray scanner .
Your bags were designed to help you carry a lot of stuff with two hands ; if you unpack them early , you have to move your unpacked stuff with the same two hands .
Tip # 2 :
Put your bags through the scanner before your computer and toiletries bag ; that way you can have your bags ready and waiting on the other end so you can pick up the computer and slide it into your bag in one motion . )
One of my pet peeves is businesspeople who fly frequently , make faces when standing behind families in the security line , and then slow down the line themselves because they have n’t figured out how to get their stuff onto the conveyor belt immediately after the person in front of them .
But I ’ve become very skeptical of the simple argument for efficiency studies .
( To be fair , LeBlanc is probably equally skeptical ; but the podcast only put forward the simple argument . )
The idea is that time has a monetary value ( say , the per - hour employment costs of each employee ) , and if you save time , you save money .
One example that LeBlanc mentions is moving printers .
It seems to make sense on its face .
You spend time walking to and from the printer .
Therefore , printers should be located to minimize the total time people spend in transit , which could mean moving the printer closer to the heavy users of printing .
Then those people can spend more time at their desks being productive .
But there is a serious fallacy in this argument : the assumption that the constraint on productivity is time at your desk .
Let ’s leave aside the issue of whether you are productive walking to the printer .
The more serious issue is that you are n’t equally productive the whole time you sit at your desk .
What if you spend your extra two minutes ( in reduced time picking up printouts ) at I Can Has Cheezburger ?
Well , the efficiency expert may counter , all I need to assume is that a fixed percentage of your desk time is productive .
But that ’s still a big assumption .
Maybe the real constraint on your daily productivity is mental energy , and you only have enough mental energy to do four hours of real work a day .
Then your extra two minutes will all go to looking at pictures of cats with ungrammatical captions .
Even more likely , maybe the real constraint is your internal sense of what a reasonable day ’s work is .
Many of us have either left early because we got a lot done or stayed late because we got little done .
Maybe the real constraint is how much work your supervisor expects you to do .
Maybe the real constraint is how much your colleagues get done , either for process reasons or simply because workplace norms are set by group as a whole .
Maybe the real constraint is your motivation level .
Maybe the real constraint is customer demand .
( Another of LeBlanc ’s examples is a cafe where the barista only spends half his time actually making a drink ; the most plausible explanation is that you need to staff for potential demand , but actual demand fluctuates and is generally below potential demand . )
All of these possibilities seem much more likely to me than the idea that the limiting constraint is time spent at your desk .
And if any of them is true , then moving the printer has gained you nothing .
You might think this is less true of more routine tasks , like moving and unpacking boxes ( another LeBlanc example ) .
Maybe , but I ’m still skeptical .
Let ’s say you figure out a way to unload a truck , unpack the boxes , and put the stuff where it should go in half the time as before .
Will the same people get twice as much done ?
Maybe , but I doubt it .
Again , this assumes that the binding constraint on productivity is time .
What if the work is physically strenuous , and while the old process included a lot of unnecessary pauses , those pauses were necessary to allow people enough time to rest ?
Then if you try to push them twice as hard , using a more efficient process , their bodies will break down .
( If you could actually cut the effort in half , though , you might be onto something . )
What if the limiting constraint is boredom : people just ca n’t work at peak efficiency for eight hours straight , and the old process with its delays gave them time to chat , look around , and relax a bit while working ?
In many tasks , there is probably some room for efficiency improvement that can actually result in sustained higher productivity .
But the benefits are only a fraction of the theoretical benefits you get by multiplying time savings by the money value of time .
BlackBerry ( and its competitors ) have made a fortune off the myth of efficiency .
The reason BlackBerry is so popular with corporations is the idea that now people can be working while waiting in lines at the airport . *
( Judging from the ads , this is the core use case . )
That time is now money , at least according to the efficiency theory .
But what are people doing ?
They are clearing out emails .
If there is any benefit to anyone , it is that they will spend a little less time in the evening clearing out emails on their computers ; but they wo n’t be doing any other work , because the length of their workday is n’t set by a clock , but by their sense of when they ’ve done enough for the day .
( For a lot of people , their willingness to knock off at the end of the day is related to the amount of email left in their inboxes . )
In addition , a lot of the supposed BlackBerry benefit is destroyed by four factors .
First , working on a BlackBerry is less efficient than working on a computer ( it takes more time to get the same stuff done ) , so some of your benefit ( time waiting in line ) is wasted in lower productivity .
Second , checking your email constantly causes you to respond to emails and deal with issues that you could have simply ignored had you waited until you got home or to your hotel ( since questions or issues posed in email often resolve themselves if you simply wait a few hours ) .
Third , having a BlackBerry causes you to spend more time on email than you need to , because you can .
Fourth , the quality of work you do on a BlackBerry is lower than on a computer .
For example , with a computer , you can answer a question by finding a specific data source and actually finding the answer ; with a BlackBerry , you are more likely to give an unhelpful answer like “ try looking at source X , ” which you may have misidentified , and which is less helpful to the person asking the question .
But people lobby their companies to pay for their BlackBerrys because they want them , and companies often agree because they think they ’re getting a more efficient workforce .
In case you ’re wondering , I have no BlackBerry and no similar device for checking email while waiting in airport lines .
( My dumbphone can , in a real pinch , check my email , but it ’s so bad at it I rarely use it . )
* Obviously , there are some professions where constant accessibility is an issue–say , IT support personnel .
The vast majority of BlackBerry users do not fit into this category .
Update : I should have emphasized that I agree with the basic point that there are vast , vast inefficiencies in the economy that , if eliminated , could have enormous benefits for all of us .
In particular , we could make much more use of automation , especially through the expanded use of software ( if we could find software companies that make software that works well , that is ) .
Completely eliminating human touches reduces effort and takes all those other binding constraints I mentioned above off the table .
Software can also sift through vast numbers of similar cases and determine which ones require skilled human intervention and which ones can be handled automatically according to some set of rules .
We have made enormous advances in automation of manufacturing over the last century ; I think we can make analogous , though smaller , gains through the automation of many service industries .
What I ’m more skeptical of are time - and - motion efficiency gains , especially when it comes to knowledge workers .
TOKYO  Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama warned on Tuesday that Japan could fall back into recession without bold measures like the stimulus package introduced by the country ’s governing coalition .
But he is struggling to balance economic concerns with a campaign promise to rein in government spending .
“ We ’ve reached the utmost limit in terms of financing , ” Mr. Hatoyama , who took office in September after a landmark victory for his Democratic Party over the long - governing Liberal Democratic Party , said on Tuesday .
A recent surge in the yen to a 14 - year high against the dollar , together with persistent deflation , has disrupted the Japanese economy , leading to the new stimulus package of 7.2 trillion yen .
The $ 81 billion package  which is equivalent to about 1.5 percent of Japan ’s gross domestic product  includes $ 39 billion to prop up regional economies and pay for public works projects .

If your preferred play style revolves around combat , there are plenty of augmentations and weapon customizations to transform you into a killing machine .
If you 're a strategist or a pacifist , there are several options as well to avoid confrontation through augmentations and other means .
The choice is yours . :
Our initial goal was to identify the core values of Deus Ex and bring them back for a new generation of gamers .
The core values were established by Warren Spector and company , so by building on top of it , I think his heritage is quite present .
Of course , the first game was released several years ago ; we needed to bring fresh ideas to the table but never without respecting the essence of what makes a Deus Ex game what it is .
In the end , it 's going to be a mix of old and new .
Staying true to the original and making a real Deus Ex game is vital to this project .
Although we are a new team working on the game , we have the benefit of time and perspective to look back at the first two games and really identify the core aspects of a Deus Ex game , as well as what went right and wrong .
Of course , Deus Ex 1 and 2 varied a bit in what those core aspects were -- ultimately , we decided to emulate the first game more ; as mentioned , we no longer have unified ammunition and we are returning to an inventory system reminiscent of the first game .
We also wanted to ensure that our levels are larger and more open than in Invisible War ( i.e. Hong Kong in Deus Ex 1 ) .
In terms of being a Deus Ex game , we keep the core gameplay essence alive : that being a hybrid of action - RPG in which the core gameplay mechanics revolve around combat , stealth , hacking , and social aspects .
The gameplay is largely designed around giving the player choices which have consequences ; the core values are centered on letting players play the game the way they want . :
Yes .
Being a prequel to the original game , our story starts about 25 years before the start of the first game .
Although Deus Ex : Human Revolution will end and segue nicely into the start of the first game , and you may meet some familiar characters along the way , the story is self - contained so players new to the franchise wo n't have any problem getting into the game and understanding it . : Deus Ex : Human Revolution is a prequel for several reasons .
You do not need to be an old Deus Ex fan to appreciate the game – we have a new main character and supporting characters that you 'll encounter during the journey .
At the same time , we felt Invisible War took the franchise too far into the future and became almost sci-fi , whereas the first game used the typical gritty Cyberpunk archetype we all loved , and we wanted to get back to that .
Second , in the original timeline of Deus Ex , there was an era where mechanically - augmented people started to flourish in society before the event of nano - augmented people .
The distinction lies in the fact that nano - augmentations are invisible and the mechanical augmentations are not .
We thought it would be an interesting thematic to explore from both a gameplay perspective ( seeing how your character evolves ) and from an ethical / moral perspective ( the benefits & dangers of such a world where some can afford to get augmented while others can't ) .
One of the major aspects of our story revolves around the social conflict between augmented and non-augmented people .
In our story , there are people opposed to augmenting the body , since they see it as unnatural and do n't think scientists should play God .
On the other side , some people think it is the natural evolution of the human race and there 's no reason we should n't be trying things like this , if it can enhance the quality of life or extend it .
The game world itself will definitely reflect these opposing views so you will see a contrast depending on where you are in the game . :
No , Deus Ex : Human Revolution is a single - player game only .
Being the first project out of the new Eidos Montréal studio , and staying true to the Deus Ex legacy , the development team wanted to focus purely on the single - player experience to ensure we delivered on that front . :
I 'm currently playing Heavy Rain and I must say this is a fantastic experience .
Even though Deus Ex : Human Revolution shares similarities in terms of " choices & consequences " , we offer a totally different game experience .
But , yes , we want players to make choices that will affect some outcomes ( story - wise and gameplay - wise ) .
Like the first game , our game world is designed around a multi-path , multi-solution approach so any objective can be approached in different ways .
Whether you like action , stealth , hacking , or interacting with characters , you can complete objectives in different ways .
The two primary gameplay styles are combat and stealth .
You can basically play the entire game by going " frontal " or by going " sneaky " and / or back and forth as you please .
For us , it 's really about letting players express themselves the way they want .
You can decide to play the game without killing anyone ( minus some critical encounters ) , for example .
The two supporting gameplay styles are hacking and social interactions .
You can expand your possibilities through these means in order to open up new paths , find new solutions to problems , acquire useful goodies or information , etc .
Open-ended gameplay allows the player to take advantage of multipath / multi-solutions to accomplish their objectives and explore the game world for side quests , hidden treasures , etc .
Some RPG dialogs will be mandatory but most will be available to players in an optional form .
Obviously there are benefits from a story and gameplay standpoint to talk to other characters but it 's not forced .
If your play style is more centered on shooting , then so be it .
This method also rewards multiple play - throughs since by choosing one method over another , you may miss some interesting things that are accessible only by attempting specific things !
Amazing moment bald eagle chases down and catches a starling in mid-air
Advertisement
This tiny starling did n't stand a chance after a hungry bald eagle chose it as a mid-air snack .
This incredible sequence of pictures shows the enormous bird of prey closing in on its target .
The defenceless starling flies on , apparently unaware of the eagle behind it .
Too late :
The tiny starling is dwarfed by the massive bird of prey as it lifts its talons to grab its meal
But within seconds the eagle is so close its beak almost grazes the tail of the tiny bird .
In one swift moment , the hunter 's razor - sharp claws have closed around its prey .
Photographer Rob Palmer captured these incredible pictures in Colorado , U.S .
The 56 - year - old , from Littleton , said : ' I noticed a group of eagles sitting in the trees and then I spotted they were catching the starlings and blackbirds .
' It went on for a number of days .
The starlings would launch out of the yard and into the air as one .
Zeroing in :
The bald eagle spots its target as it flies through the air and begins to close the distance
Razor sharp :
The starling seems to be completely unaware it is on the lunch menu as the bald eagle makes it attack at high speed
' Two or three eagles would then start to pursue .
It seemed as if the starlings had been hypnotised because they acted as if they were not being chased .
' Over ten days I saw at least 50 starlings getting caught and eaten by various eagles .
It would happen anywhere from 100 to 500 ft in the air .
' It was an awesome and inspiring thing to witness .
' As a photographer , you only dream of seeing wild instances like this and I took advantage of the situation .
I have not witnessed anything like this since then . '
Defenceless :
The oblivious starling is grabbed in mid-air as the bald eagle swoops on its prey
The bald eagle , native to North America , can grow up to 3ft long and has a wingspan of 8ft .
The bird of prey eats mostly fish , but is known to be an opportunistic feeder - eating anything from small mammals like rabbits to larger prey like the Great Blue Heron .
Its talons are so powerful it has even been known to carry off deer fawns weighing around 15 pounds .
Nothing outside Tokyo's 24 Kaikan hotel hints at what goes on behind its grey concrete walls .
Tucked in off a back - street near the Shinjuku business and shopping district , the seven - story building could be an apartment block for retired civil servants .
A steady stream of customers in the salary - man 's uniform of dark suit , sensible shoes and winter overcoat files quietly through its innocuous doors .
Only in the lobby , cheerily adorned with scenes from a sex movie that depict a portly company president being diligently serviced by a young apprentice , does it become clear that this is one of Asia 's biggest gay landmarks .
Past the ticket machine – 2,600 yen ( about £ 18 ) for a 13 - hour stay – and pretty much anything goes , say guests who come from across Japan , and even abroad , to sample its treats .
Soak in the sauna / bathtub then make your way up semi-naked through the floors , where porn flickers 24 hours a day in dimmed communal sleeping areas equipped with futons .
Wander around and watch the sights or lie back and wait for someone who fancies you , instructs one guide , which blissfully advises customers to expect " some mind - blowing tableaus " .
Amid the satyric excess , bilingual signs posted throughout telegraph the only constantly visible rule : " Gentlemen who chew gum " will be evicted from the premises .
It is , in many ways , very Japanese : discreet , compartmentalised ; fastidiously careful about order and details .
Live and let live as long as the outward appearance of things is maintained .
" This is a country that happily lives with contradictions , " says Taq Otsuka , author of several books on Japan 's gay scene .
" It has its one way of doing things that people sometimes do n't understand . "
Thus , Tokyo , a city with a reputation as one of the most uptight , buttoned - down capitals , also boasts , in its Shinjuku district , one of the world 's densest and most diverse concentration of gay bars and clubs : the Ni-chome ( pronounced " nee- chomay " ) area .
Roughly 300 businesses , including the 24 Kaikan , are squeezed into Ni-chome 's couple of blocks , from sex shops to watering holes that cater to a staggering array of tastes – known in Japan as kei ( speciality ) .
Bars for overweight men , transvestites , spankers , the hirsute , the young , men over 70 , older men who want to be with younger men ; with names such as Popeye , Tarzan , Duke , Brutus and Bambi .
One establishment specialises in guys who look like pin-up idols ; another reportedly caters to clientele from the countryside .
" I 've even heard of one place that is for busaiku - kei [ ugly men ] , " laughs Otsuka , who has run local institution Tac's Knot bar for 28 years .
" There is n't much you can't find here . "
But , roughly half a century since it emerged as a refuge for homosexuals in what was formerly a red - light district , the block is in decline .
The local commercial organisation that promotes Ni-chome estimates that the number of gay bars in the area has fallen by at least a third in the past decade .
The once exclusively male gay clientele is filled out at the weekends with the straight , the female and the simply curious .
" Are gays vanishing from Shinjuku Ni-chome ! ? , " wondered one of the country 's most popular magazines recently .
" This used to be a place for communicating with and discreetly meeting like - minded people , " explains the organisation 's head Mitsuo Fukushima .
" Now there are many other ways of communicating . "
Last year , artist Susumu Ryu tried to document the decline in a 276 - page manga comic with the clumsy English title , " Vanishing Shinjuku Ni-chome – who severed the jugular of a flower garden of heretical culture ? "
Ryu blames gentrification associated with the opening of a new subway line , which has pushed up local property prices and made many of the tiny bars here unviable ; and the rise of the internet , which has given men with secret lives a way to navigate the world .
Instead of cruising bars for strangers , they can now hook up online and arrange to meet in a love hotel or apartment .
He cites the 2004 closure of the famous gay magazine Barazoku after 33 years as a key moment .
" That was a symbolic event when the internet overtook gay culture here . "
Recession has n't helped : many of the bars demand a cover charge of up to 1,000 yen ( about £ 7 ) .
On a Saturday night , though , the decline is not immediately obvious .
Crowds and taxis throng through Ni-chome 's streets , and clubs and bars fill up after 11 pm .
But many businesses are clearly struggling .
In Sazae , a retro - themed disco for cross - dressers , men trickle in , wearing suits and civvies , change into dresses and don wigs in the toilet , then dance and pair off .
Like many of these bars , the master – a middle - aged queen with a passion for 1970s soul and funk – sets the atmosphere and discreetly regulates the clientele .
" Business has certainly peaked , " he laments , grimacing unhappily .
" It used to be packed here and you can see what it 's like now , " he says , sweeping a hand around the half - empty bar .
" The customers are getting older , too . "
Fittingly , perhaps , as he shouts over the noise of the disco , Gloria Gaynor 's great gay anthem " I Will Survive " comes pounding out of the speakers .
Ni-chome partly mirrors the changes in Japan 's gay culture .
Until the 1980s , says the 62 - year - old Otsuka , the area – 10 minutes walk from Tokyo's busiest transportation hub – was an escape for men who were often married and hiding their sexuality .
" When I came here first in my twenties , everybody used fake names and it was just accepted that you were going to be unhappy , " he recalls .
" Even couples came separately .
The idea that gay people could share a life together was a fairy - tale . "
Adds Mark Oshima , a Japanese - American who came to live in Tokyo two decades ago : " In the old days , everyone got married – as long as they had respectable lives on the surface , they could live a double life . "
Though blighted by the typical agonies of personal identity and need for secrecy , gays and lesbians in Japan nevertheless did not suffer the same outright repression as those in other parts of the world .
Discrimination in Britain and the US , at least until the 1960s , was " horrendous " , points out Mark McLelland , a UK - born academic and author of Homosexuality in Modern Japan : Cultural Myths and Social Realities .
" You could be prosecuted there , whereas the Japanese are fairly laid - back about sexual scandal – it's not personally harming in the way it is in the West . "
While British cops were still busting men in public parks , Japan did n't even have an anti-sodomy law , nor what McLelland calls the " anti-homosexual rage " of many Christian cultures , the lethal fuel for homophobia and the " hyper- violence " of gay - bashing incidents .
As Otsuka puts it : " Homosexuality was never considered a sin here , just shameful . "
But if Japan was more laid - back about its sexual preferences , it also lacked the political and social frisson that helped transform the lives of homosexuals elsewhere .
Gayness was , and is still , largely seen as a personal lifestyle choice , not something to be flaunted or argued over on the streets and in parliament .
Otsuka says he sometimes looked with envy at the battles for gay equality in other parts of the world .
" It seemed very extreme and frightening , but I admired how you could shout your identity from the rooftops , and tell everyone that you were in a gay relationship . "
He began writing about what was happening abroad and set up his bar to lead by example .
" I learned the English phrase ' coming out ' and told people about it .
I was in a long - term relationship and I wanted to show others it was possible , if they had courage .
When my partner died of Aids [ about 10 years ago ] , there was a lot of ignorance about the disease , so I spoke about that too , though it was very hard for me . "
Today , men in Ni-chome are far more likely to use their real names and announce their same - sex relationships to the world – or at least to the clientele of their favourite club .
But progress has been tortuously slow , and many gays and lesbians are still living a lie , says David Wagner , a business consultant and 24 - year veteran of the Ni-chome district .
" It 's the Stone Age here .
This is one of the biggest cities in the world but the gay scene is pathetic .
The Sydney gay parade has maybe 500,000 people marching every year – Tokyo has maybe 3,000 , when it happens . "
He still meets many gay men who are lying to their families about their sexuality .
" I say , ' If you all came out the same time , everything would change . ' "
Homosexuals are still not legally recognised in Japanese civil law , civil unions are prohibited and there is , as yet , not a single openly gay law - maker or prominent business person , admits Kanako Otsuji .
A lesbian activist , in 2007 she ran as the country 's first openly gay candidate in a national election , after publishing her biography Coming Out .
" There is a saying in Japan : ' to put a lid on something that smells , ' " she points out .
" The topic is ignored and disregarded .
You do n't touch it .
But this is still not a bad place to be homosexual . "
Indeed , young gays hopping from club to bar around Ni-chome find bewildering Otsuji 's struggles to change society , or force it to acknowledge their sexuality ; one reason , perhaps , why she came near the bottom of the 2007 poll .
Many have never heard of her or the landmark 1969 New York Stonewall riots , or taken part in the Tokyo Pride parade , which limps into action some years and other years does n't happen at all .
But many accept that their lives have been transformed since the last generation of gay corporate samurai fled here from tormented lives .
" I came out to my parents when I was 11 , " remembers Yusuke Takane , a 23 - year - old university student sipping a drink in Arty Farty , one of the district 's most popular clubs .
" I do n't know what it means to be hiding . "
His experience living abroad has convinced him that Japan is friendlier to gays than elsewhere .
" I lived in France and people there shouted ' pede ' ( ' fag ' ) .
I could n't imagine that here , especially not in this area .
That 's why I come here , even though I can meet people on the internet – I feel comfortable . "
Few seem worried or even aware that Ni-chome may be dying .
But among many proprietors , the talk is of little else .
Some speculate that Tokyo's famously right - wing governor Shintaro Ishihara , irritated by the area 's reputation for sexual freedom and occasional debauchery , may have a hand in its decline , but there is no proof of that .
" He does n't have to crush Ni-chome , " says Wagner .
" It 's imploding . "

In the summer of 1980 , MIT graduates Donald Faber and Peter Haberle moved into an empty two - car garage and started work building their first ever personal home computer .
Almost 30 years later , what began as a humble two - man operation has since grown into an even more humble , even more cramped computer company , based out of an even smaller single - car garage .

" We started out with pretty much nothing , " said Peter Haberle who , along with Faber , sat down with reporters on Monday to reminisce about the early days of Xalaga Technologies .
" I remember we had this old workbench , which we called our development station .
And we got our hands on a few wooden chairs from this dumpster across the street .
Donald even had to borrow an air mattress so we'd have somewhere to sleep at night . "
Added Haberle , letting out a deep sigh , " That place was a palace compared to today . "

According to Faber and Haberle , a lot has changed since Xalaga was first founded .
What was once a struggling $ 7,500 - a- year business with only a dozen or so paying customers is now a desperate $ 6,400 - a- year business with only a half dozen or so paying customers .

Indeed , long gone are the dark days of scraping together donations from friends , and applying to banks for loans , as those channels have completely run dry and Faber and Haberle were forced to take on second and third jobs to finance their dream venture nearly a decade ago .
Faber , who turned down a promising position with GE in order to start Xalaga , a decision he now says he regrets each and every waking day , told reporters that he knew almost immediately that his company had something not - at - all special on its hands .

" We sold only one computer that first year , then the following year it was three computers , then suddenly 10 computers , then just as suddenly five computers , then back down to three computers again , and finally only one or two machines every other year for pretty much the next decade , " said Faber , standing up from the plastic milk crate that now serves as his desk .
" Had someone told us when we first started that we'd be here today , operating out of a much smaller , somehow less expensive garage , we probably would have laughed right in their face . "
" Well , nobody 's laughing now , " Faber added .
Despite their eventual lack of success , and the complete absence of any recognition whatsoever , those early days did n't always go as planned .
In 1986 , Haberle was left with no choice but to move permanently into Xalaga 's garage - headquarters after his then - fiancée left him and he was evicted from his one - bedroom apartment .
Then in 1993 , the pair saw months of exhausting work go up in flames when an electrical fire destroyed dozens of circuit boards , driving Xalaga Technologies even further into debt .

Still , it was those initial setbacks that made all the setbacks still to come that much more painful .
" I 'd be lying if I said Donald and I did n't have doubts — heck , those first 30 years were pretty tough for us , " said Haberle , who recently celebrated his 53th birthday .
" But trust me , places like Google and Apple went through the exact same thing when they began… . "

" Hold on just a second , " continued Haberle , quickly gathering up a number of unfinished microprocessors , memory boards , and other belongings piled high on the ground .
" Looks like the owner wants to park his car . "

At least five homes were destroyed after a tornado touched down in western Oklahoma Monday evening , authorities said .
There were no reports of injuries .
Other homes were damaged , and power was out to about 900 residences in and around the city of Hammon in Roger Mills County , Oklahoma , Michelann Ooten of the Department of Emergency Management said .
Roger Mills officials continued to assess the damage , but all residents appear to be accounted for , Ooten said .
The tornado hit about 5:30 p.m. ( 6:30 p.m. ET ) , said Ken Gallant , lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norman , Oklahoma .
The thunderstorms that produced the conditions for the tornado weakened shortly afterward and a tornado warning was canceled , Gallant said .
Jerry Dean , county commissioner of Roger Mills , said the county barn was among the structures destroyed .
Area residents had time to prepare before the tornado hit , Dean said .
He could see the tornado coming before going into a cellar to wait it out , he said .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH PDF Based Targeted Attacks are Increasing Posted by Sean @ 15:30 GMT Microsoft schedules its security updates on the second Tuesday of the month .
Adobe recently began following this schedule as well , and while there are no Adobe updates today , there was an out - of - cycle security update two weeks ago .
That update should now be applied if you have n't already done so .
Why ?
Because we 're now seeing the vulnerability ( CVE - 2010 - 0188 ) being exploited in targeted attacks ( Microsoft also ) .
Our sample was submitted by a European financial organization and the file name includes a reference to the G20 .
The exploit drops a downloader and attempts to make a connection to tiantian .ninth.biz .
We detect this attack as Exploit : W32 / PDFExploit .G.
It does n't surprise us to see this Adobe Reader vulnerability utilized so quickly .
Looking through our sample management system , we see a growing number of targeted attack files .
There were 1968 files in 2008 .
The number was 2195 during the year 2009 .
That is n't a very large increase in the overall total from 2008 to 2009 but we did see a greater percentage targeting Adobe .
And how about the first two months of 2010 ?
Well , so far the number is 895 , which will more than double last year 's number if the current pace continues .
The percentage targeting Adobe Reader continues to rise .
Here 's a graph with a breakdown of the most common attack vectors used in targeted ( espionage ) attacks :
Updated to add : A couple of readers noticed that our graph 's 2009 percentages were slightly off — it 's been corrected .
Wilson Pickett ( March 18 , 1941 – January 19 , 2006 ) was an American R&B and soul singer .
Known for his raw , passionate delivery , he played a major role in developing southern soul music .
Aided immeasurably by the excellent studio bands backing him at the Stax Studios in Memphis , Tennessee and at the Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals Alabama , Pickett created iconic hits such as " In the Midnight Hour , " " Mustang Sally , " and " Funky Broadway " for Atlantic Records between 1963 and 1972 .
One of the most popular black singers of the 60s , Wilson Pickett helped int… read more
When it comes to iconic sounds of synthesis , few are as memorable as Vangelis ‘ Main Titles for the classic science fiction film Blade Runner .
When Blade Runner was released , in 1982 , many were confused by the movie ’s narrative .
Others were put off by the story ’s dark tone , or by Harrison Ford ’s deadpan voice - overs .
Few recognized the movie as a future classic .
The completeness of Ridley Scott ’s fully realized , all - enveloping world , though , was immediately recognized .
And even after more than 25 years , Scott ’s visuals , combined with Vangelis ’ stunning score , set the standard by which other science fiction films are measured .
Vangelis entire score to Blade Runner is a classic , but the “ brass ” theme from his Main Titles is iconic .
Embedded above , the opening scenes of Blade Runner , which kick in at about 2:30 , immediately thrust you into a stunning futuristic world .
The amazing visuals are accompanied by depth - shaking electronic drones and percussion , and a soaring Yamaha CS - 80 lead that concisely sets the tone for the film .
While Vangelis used the rare CS - 80 extensively throughout Blade Runner , synthesists have been using all sorts of synths to approximate the iconic sound of his Main Titles since .
Here ’s a demonstration using the Yamaha CS - 70 , a younger sibling to the CS - 80 , to recreate the iconic sound :
Nice !
But do you have to have a rare vintage Yamaha synth to get that awesome sound ?
This video demonstrates using a cheap Korg MicroKorg to recreate the Blade Runner brass sound :
Check out this take on the Main Titles performed on an Access TI Polar :
It ’s not an exact match for Vangelis ’ original , but the Access synth sounds fantastic and very musical .
Next up , a version using the Dave Smith Instruments Prophet 12 :
Think a Moog Minimoog Voyager can nail the Blade Runner Brass sound ?
Check this out :
Cool – but not that close to the original .
Here ’s a take on the Main Titles , done on the Roland Juno - 60 :
This video offers a visual guide to programming a Vangelis Blade Runner style brass sound on the Roland June - 60 :
Again , it ’s not a match to the sound of the classic synths that Vangelis used , but it sounds great , nonetheless .
The Oberheim OBXa is a monster synth that can make gorgeous brass sounds , and it ’s perfect for taking on the challenge of Vangelis ’ iconic theme :
The Korg Radias was used in creating this cover of the Main Titles :
Here ’s a visual guide to programming the Vangelis ’ Blade Runner brass sound on the Korg Radias :
Finally , this cover of the Blade Runner Main Titles does an incredible job of capturing the sound and feel of Vangelis ’ original :
An Ensoniq ESQ 1 is used here for the CS80 brass leads , a Juno 6 for electronic beeps , and a Korg x5 and Juno G for various bells and percussion .
What about a Casio ?
Here ’s Mike Martin ’s take , using a Casio XW - P1 :
Think software is the way to go ?
Here ’s an attempt at the iconic Blade Runner brass sound using using the MiniMogue VST software synthesizer :
For this live cover , Guillermo Moran used the ME80 VSTi for the CS80 parts :
Here ’s another soft synth take on the sound , using UVI CS-M :
Here ’s a surprisingly close version of the Blade Runner brass sound , created on a Moog Little Phatty :
Here ’s another take using the Slim Phatty , by Bob ‘ T ’ :
A Yamaha SY - 77 is used for the metallic harp sound .
Roland MKS - 7 ( raw noise ) plug into the Moog Slim Phatty does the rocket noise sound and Hollow Sun VP330 does the string sound .
This demo , via Julien Lecoq , uses aTEISCO S-60-F :
This take uses only a Modal Skulpt :
Here ’s an official guide from Korg to creating a Vangelis Blade Runner - inspired patch on the minilogue xd :
Ultimately , it ’s tough for any synth to match up to the sound of the classic Yamaha CS - 80 .
Trying , though , is a great way to explore and understand the capabilities and limitations of a synthesizer .
The CS - 80 was way ahead of its time when it was released in 1977 and is still considered one of the most playable synths of all time .
Vangelis owned seven CS - 80 ’s at one time , .
You can hear the CS - 80 all over his Blade Runner soundtrack and much of his finest work .
Check out the examples , and then leave a comment with your thoughts on Vangelis ’ iconic Blade Runner Main Titles theme ….. and the synths that you think come closest to matching the Yamaha CS - 80 .

Last December we had , as a nation , quite a bit of cash lying around .
The following month we found a way to spend it .
In fact , we spent some $ 12 billion more in January than we had saved up .
That ’s a lot of flat - screens–or an all - inclusive vacation that would put Sandals Jamaica to shame .
It ’s also more than the gross domestic product of several entire nations , according to the CIA ’s World Factbook .
So are we up to our old ways , living beyond our means and spending money we do n’t really have ?
Or are we once again happily striding forth into the marketplace , confident that this nascent recovery will only grow stronger ?
With any luck , the latter .
Let ’s just hope the answer to both of those questions does n’t reflect our complicated relationship to spending , yielding a single reply : yes .

LAS VEGAS -- Kelly Kulick left all the guys in the gutter .
Kulick became the first woman to win a PBA Tour title on Sunday , beating Chris Barnes in the final of the 45th Tournament of
Champions .
Kulick outscored Barnes 265-195 to take home the $ 40,000 first prize and a two - year PBA Tour exemption .
The 32 - year - old
right - hander earned a berth in the Tournament of Champions by winning the PBA Women 's World Championship last September .
" It 's unbelievable , " Kulick said .
" I always imagined myself winning a professional title , but I never thought it would be a major .
The
Tournament of Champions is one of the most prestigious events on Tour .
" It 's starting to kick in now .
It 's slowly starting to seep in now . "
Kulick grew up in Union , N.J. , and started bowling in a Saturday morning league in nearby Linden when she was 6 years old .
She grew up watching the PBA Tour on TV and competed at Morehead State University before she turned pro .
" At a very young age I enjoyed the sport and knew I could make a career out of it , " said Kulick , who declared in her fifth - grade
yearbook that she wanted to be a professional bowler .
The previous best finish for a woman in a PBA Tour event was second by Liz Johnson of Cheektowaga , N.Y. , in the 2005 Banquet
Open .
" Kelly Kulick 's win today at the PBA Tour 's Tournament of Champions is not only historic , it serves as a motivational and
inspirational event for girls and women competing at all levels all around the world , " Women 's Sports Foundation Founder Billie Jean
King said in a release .
Kulick also was the first woman to earn a PBA Tour exemption , finishing sixth in the tour trials in 2006 .
Her best finish during
the 2006 - 07 season was 22nd , accomplished twice .
She 's hoping Sunday 's win could lead to a full - time women 's tour , instead of just a series .
" Obviously , this is a turning point for my career and women 's sports in general , but I would really like to see the whole sport
benefit , " she said .
Barnes was competing for his second Tournament of Champions win .
He won in 2006 .
" When it comes down to one game , a combination of factors have to come together and they just did n't for me , " he said in a
release , " but Kelly bowled great and she met every challenge . "
Kulick , who got a pep talk from her mother , Carol , before the final , started the championship with four consecutive strikes .
Kulick could face some difficult choices with her two - year exemption .
The PBA Tour and women 's series overlap , and she was n't
sure if the tour would allow her to participate in both competitions .
This is , after all , uncharted territory .
" It 's going to pose a lot of questions down the road , but I 'll wait to answer those when I get there , " Kulick said .
Have you taken a look lately ?
WTF ?!!
A tonsillolith , also known as a tonsil stone or a zot , is a piece or , more commonly , a cluster of calcareous matter that forms in the rear of the mouth , in the crevasses ( called tonsillar crypts ) of the palatine tonsils ( commonly known as tonsils ) .
The Real Danger of Debt
In 2000 , the United States had a balanced federal budget .
Today , America has a deficit problem that threatens the country ’s future .
It is compounded by former President George W. Bush ’s fiscal recklessness , the economic crisis that began with September 2008 ’s financial collapse , President Barack Obama ’s spending ambitions , and the mysterious ability of the weakened Republican Party to create political deadlock in Congress .
Under Bush , spending was increased , taxes were cut , and the result was huge deficits financed by borrowing .
Then came the " Great Recession , " as it is being called ( I call it a depression because of its probable long - term economic and political consequences ) .
The public debt ( the important component of the national debt — the part that is more than an accounting entity — that is really owed ) , which the Bush administration ’s deficits had caused to double , soared further .
It soared because of falling tax revenues , rising unemployment benefits , and rising government expenditures to fight the depression ( such as Obama ’s $ 787 billion stimulus plan ) .
The public debt reached $ 7.5 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2009 ( Sept. 30 , 2009 ) and is expected to increase another $ 1.6 trillion this fiscal year and another $ 1.3 trillion next year .
That means it may exceed $ 10 trillion by Sept. 30 , 2011 .
Almost half the debt is owned by foreigners , and the interest payments to them are a drain on American wealth .
Interest rates on the debt will rise as the world economy recovers , increasing competition for capital .
The United States has a deeply wounded economy .
At this writing , transfer payments by the government to individuals and families ( Social Security , unemployment benefits , tax credits , etc. ) exceed the taxes being collected from the household sector .
At the same time , private investment net of depreciation is negative .
This means that private savings are being borrowed by the government , combined with the government ’s foreign borrowing , and then transferred to households to enable them to maintain their accustomed level of consumption .
People are saving more , but government borrowing overwhelms their saving , with the result that aggregate saving — public plus private — is negative .
So : negative savings , negative private investment , an incredible ratio of household debt to disposable income ( 1.25 to 1 , though down from 1.39 to 1 in 2007 ) , massive government borrowing to finance private consumption — not a nice combination .
When the American economy does finally recover , tax revenues will rise , unemployment benefits will fall , and depression - fighting programs will end — so annual deficits should decline .
But realistically , this means only that the public debt will grow more slowly than it will be growing this year and next .
The international dimensions of public debt growing slowly or rapidly from a very high level deserve consideration .
At some point , the value of the dollar relative to other currencies will fall ; this effect will be accelerated if , as is not unlikely , the " easy money " policy of the Federal Reserve , instituted to fight the depression , results in significant inflation .
A falling dollar may endanger the dollar ’s status as an international reserve currency .
Foreign contracts are often denominated in dollars rather than in a local currency .
If an oil producer in a Middle Eastern country sells oil to a refinery in a South American country , neither party may be happy to have payment made in the currency of the other party ’s country because by the time payment is due , the value of the currency may have changed to the advantage of the other party .
By providing that payment will be made in U.S. dollars , the parties can hedge against changes in the value of the local currencies .
For such hedging to be effective , however , the value of the dollar has to be stable .
If it becomes unstable , the dollar may cease to be the principal international reserve currency , accounting at present for almost two - thirds of international currency reserves — a status that allows the United States to run a trade deficit ( up to a point ) costlessly because foreign countries need to hold U.S. dollar reserves to supply dollars in exchange for local currencies to businesses that have dollar - denominated contracts .
It is true that as growing deficits reduce the value of the dollar relative to other currencies , while making imports more expensive , American exports will grow , implying a shift of workers and capital from services to manufacturing .
But the shift , reversing a long - term decline in manufacturing relative to services , may be a painful and protracted one , just as China ’s transition from an export - led manufacturing economy to a domestic consumer economy is likely to be painful and protracted .
Any major restructuring of a country ’s economy will produce heavy unemployment as a byproduct until the restructuring is complete .
The adjustments that will be needed — if the economy does not outgrow an increasing burden of debt — to maintain the U.S. economic position in the world may be especially painful and difficult because of features of the American political scene that suggest that the country might be becoming in important respects ungovernable .
The perfection of interest - group politics has brought about a situation in which , to exaggerate just a bit , taxes ca n’t be increased , spending programs ca n’t be cut , and new spending is irresistible .
If one may judge by the Bush administration ’s fiscal improvidence , these tendencies are bipartisan .
America used to have a liberal and a conservative party , though both were loose coalitions lacking European - style rigid ideological uniformity .
The Democrats , the liberal party , favored big government and therefore big government spending — and therefore high taxes to pay for the big spending .
The conservative party , the Republicans , opposed big government and big government spending , and therefore favored low taxes .
These were coherent positions .
For Democrats , however , favoring heavy taxes was a political albatross , while for Republicans the albatross was opposing big government spending .
Beginning with Ronald Reagan and continuing with George W. Bush , Republicans squared the circle by abandoning their opposition to big spending while redoubling their commitment to low taxes .
Belatedly , the Obama administration has decided that while still favoring big government spending ( indeed more than recent Democratic administrations have done ) , it too wants to keep taxes low — not as low as the Republicans want , but low enough that deficits that swamp those of the Reagan and Bush years are looming .
The decline of bipartisanship is lamentable ; it is small consolation that fiscal imprudence is bipartisan .
The parties play leapfrog when it comes to spending .
From the standpoint of economic policy , the United States has only one party , and it is the party of profligacy .
As real interest rates rise as a consequence of a growing public debt and declining demand for the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency , U.S. savings rates will rise and , by reducing consumption expenditures , slow economic activity .
Economic growth may also fall as more and more resources are poured into keeping alive elderly people , most of whom are not highly productive members of society from an economic standpoint .
The United States may find itself in the same kind of downward economic spiral that developing countries often find themselves in .
American political culture is sick , but the broader social culture may also impede renewed economic progress .
America ’s growth has been promoted by the " can - do " attitude of its people , their rejection of fatalism , their individualism — qualities conducive to innovation , ambition , and hard work .
But the rejection of fatalism is also a major factor in the country ’s soaring medical costs , as its old people ( and often their children ) insist that every effort be made , at taxpayer expense , to extend their lives .
As a result , 25 percent of Medicare costs are incurred in treating elderly people in the last few months of life .
American individualism is also a barrier to fiscal belt - tightening through tax hikes or spending cuts .
A can - do attitude can and often does express itself in a refusal to worry about looming crises .
Americans can overcome any challenge .
So not to worry !
Qualities that promote a country ’s fortunes in one era may undermine them in another .
Because of the low U.S. inflation rate and the Federal Reserve ’s determination to keep interest rates very low , the dollar has become a favorite tool of the " carry trade , " endangering the world economy .
By borrowing U.S. dollars cheaply ( because U.S. interest rates are being artificially depressed by the Federal Reserve in an effort to ease credit and by doing so stimulate economic growth ) and exchanging them for foreign currencies to lend or invest , traders can earn generous profits — though not without great risk .
The carry trade may be a factor in recent rises in commodity prices ; indeed , there is fear of new bubbles as a result of all the dollars sloshing around in the world economy .
This poses dangers for the global economy because the carry trade is susceptible to runs .
If a speculator borrows dollars in the short term to minimize interest expense and uses them to buy rupees , say , and the dollar surges in value relative to the rupee , the speculator may have to sell his rupees in a hurry to repay his lenders .
If so , the value of the rupee will fall farther relative to the dollar , which may precipitate a run on rupees as speculators unload them .
And because of the integration of the world ’s financial systems , a run on a foreign currency can harm other countries ’ economies .
The Fed has made clear that it intends to keep short - term interest rates rock - bottom low for some time , reassuring the carry traders that the Fed is not going to pull the rug out from under them by open market operations designed to reduce U.S. bank balances , a policy that would increase the value of the dollar in relation to other currencies by reducing the amount of money in circulation ( the U.S. money supply is essentially the sum of all U.S. bank balances ) , and by doing so would increase interest rates on dollar loans .
The Obama administration is doing nothing , moreover , to prevent the dollar from falling in value relative to other currencies — the government wants it to fall in order to spur exports , import substitution , and a mild inflation — and a falling dollar makes the carry trade more profitable .
The carry trader borrows dollars with which to buy currencies that can be invested at higher interest rates than the cost of borrowing the dollars — and then , after cashing out the investment , he returns to the lenders dollars worth less than when he borrowed them .
The Greek fiscal crisis has caused the value of the dollar to rise sharply against the euro , and if this new valuation of the dollar persists it will hurt U.S. exports and could also trigger a crisis in the carry trade .
This is a further illustration of how globally connected the U.S. economy has become — and why getting America ’s fiscal house in order is an urgent priority .
WHY should we celebrate the Irish ?
No doubt , several reasons could be proffered .
But for me one answer stands out .
Long , long ago the Irish pulled off a remarkable feat :
They saved the books of the Western world and left them as gifts for all humanity .
True enough , the Irish were unlikely candidates for the job .
Upon their entrance into Western history in the fifth century , they were the most barbaric of barbarians , practitioners of human sacrifice , cattle rustlers , traders in human beings ( the children they captured along the Atlantic edge of Europe ) , insane warriors who entered battle stark naked .
And yet it was the Irish who were around to pick up the pieces when the Roman Empire collapsed in the West under the increasing assaults of Germanic tribes .
It is hard to overstate the momentousness of that collapse .
By the early sixth century , Western Europe had become largely illiterate , its teachers dead , its students on the run , its libraries turned into kindling .
Ireland , however , had just settled down , thanks to a tough old bird named Patrick , a Roman citizen raised in the province of Britain who had been grabbed by Irish slavers when he was a teenager .
It was after his escape that Patrick resolved to seek priestly ordination and return to Ireland to preach the Gospel .
The glories of Christianity  particularly its books  fascinated the Irish .
They came to love the Roman alphabet that Patrick and his successors taught them , as well the precious illuminated manuscripts that he presented to them .
There was indeed nothing in their intellectual heritage to block their receptivity to the Christian faith .
Mike Enzi started out his statement saying that seniors are terrified of reform .
Maybe that has something to do with this , hmmmm ?

HOLLYWOOD ’S golden age may have ended in the 1950s , but it is only recently that Tinseltown appears to have hit upon a mathematical way to capitalise on our fickle attention spans .
“ Film - makers have got better and better at constructing shots so that their lengths grab our attention , ” says James Cutting , a psychologist at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York .
He analysed 150 Hollywood movies and found that the more recent they were , the more closely their shot lengths tended to follow a mathematical pattern that also describes …
This is the first article in a series of articles that wrap up achievements , work in progress and some background of what happened during Tokamak4 , the Oxygen , KWin and Plasma sprint .
Tokamak4 took place from 19th to 26th February 2010 in Nürnberg , Germany in the openSUSE premises and was kindly made possible by Novell and KDE e.V.
During the sprint , 26 hackers gathered to work on various aspects of the KDE user experience .
The combined sprint of the workspace and window manager teams and the Oxygen artwork team made cross-collaboration possible across these KDE software components .
In this article , we actually start off with a side - track of Tokamak4 which was hardware integration .
It turned out that many people working on this were actually participating in Tokamak4 , so the team took the opportunity to sit together and hack some on different aspects of hardware integration in KDE SC and specifically Plasma .
Solid Plans for the Future
During Tokamak 4 in Nürnberg , several developers of Solid , the KDE Platform component that offers integration of hardware and networking functionality to KDE applications in a platform - independent way , sat together and discussed their plans for the future .
One important change is that multiple Solid backends can now be loaded at the same time , providing information from different sources in parallel .
A first implementation of this change has been done by Kevin Ottens during Tokamak 4 .
This change allows for more flexibility within Solid , especially for the support of new middleware such as upower , udisk and the like .
The Solid hackers , or Metalworkers as Kevin " ervin " Ottens started to call the crew , have also decided to expand the scope of Solid a bit to virtual devices and devices on the network .
One important addition that is planned , and already in part implemented by Friedrich Kossebau is support for UPnP .
UPnP
More and more devices that support UPnP are popping up in your author 's network .
The media center and NAS offer their content via UPnP to the network , the phone and mediacenter are able to play those files directly over the network .
With KDE targeting a wide device spectrum , UPnP cannot be missed out any longer .
Friedrich Kossebau has now landed the first bits of UPnP support into Solid , based on the work by Bart Cerneels .
The code uses the Coherence server as underlying middleware and already allows detecting UPnP media servers on the local network .
Solid 's hardware browser showing UPnP devices Solid 's hardware browser showing UPnP devices
For interested students , there are proposals for possible projects taking part in the Summer of Code to bring this work to further fruition .
Network Management
The Network Management team , Will Stephenson , Alexander Naumov and Sebastian Kügler sat together to work on functionality to easily connect the computer to wired and wireless and mobile broadband networks and to VPNs .
The Network Management Plasmoid which has the focus of the developers now uses a service which can " talk to " different underlying network management systems .
Currently , there is a backend for NetworkManager and another one for WICD is in the works .
This allows the developers to build a UI suitable for a given device rather than having to duplicate work for the underlying layers as well .
Some distributions already ship KDE 4 network management in the form of KNetworkmanager , a small application that sits in your notification area and offers network connections using a context menu .
During the meeting , several UI improvements have been worked out which combined will create a natural workflow in a simple but very powerful user interface .
Many of the changes that were discussed have already been implemented .
The Network Management team has also gained some fresh blood , in the form of Kubuntu - hacker Aurelien Gateau , who has already committed an impressive number of bugfixes and UI improvments and with Shantanu Tushar Jha , who has improved the visual feedback for unplugged network cables .
You can find more information on Sebastian Kügler 's blog , here and here .
The new Network Management Plasma Widget The new Network Management Plasma Widget
In the meantime , many of the design choices the team has made are already implemented in the network management plasmoid .
Many interaction bugs have been fixed , VPN support for the plasmoid has been implemented and the first test results of this new piece of hardware interaction UI are promising .
Setting up network connections Setting up network connections
Bluetooth
Independently from Tokamak , but closely related to all the work that is going into Solid these days .
Alex Fiestas , Rafael Fernandez Lopez and Eduardo Robles Elvira have decided to give lots of love to the bluetooth functionality in KDE SC .
The system the Spanish developers are working on is called BlueDevil and aims to provide bluetooth service discovery , pairing , file browsing and transfer .
The system will be built of a kded module which receives and multiplexes bluetooth events via DBus and a KIO virtual file system slave for file management .
The bluetooth System Settings module will make it easy to manage your bluetooth devices .
Alex Fiestas regularly updates us on his blog at afiestas.org about the current state of things

Fifty - nine of New Jersey ’s wealthiest school districts would receive no direct state aid for their operations next year — in effect , a 100 percent cut — under the governor ’s proposed budget , according to state figures released on Wednesday .
The state would seek to reduce direct aid to nearly 600 districts by an amount equivalent to as much as 5 percent of their individual operating budgets , for an overall reduction of $ 820 million from the year before .
The education cuts were revealed in detail for the first time since being proposed on Tuesday by Gov. Christopher J. Christie as part of his $ 29.3 billion budget plan .
For wealthier districts like Ridgewood , Millburn and Glen Ridge , that would mean losing the direct state aid that they receive for their classrooms — a relatively small percentage of their operating budget — forcing them to rely almost exclusively on local property taxes .
“ It is by no means a death blow , but it is a heavy burden , ” said Elisabeth Ginsburg , the school board president in Glen Ridge , which received $ 1.2 million in state aid this year , most of which paid for mandated special - education services .
“ You have to think carefully about how you ’re going to go forward . ”
Reporting from Creech Air Force Base , Nev. --
From his apartment in Las Vegas , Sam Nelson drove to work through the desert along wind - whipped Highway 95 toward Indian Springs .
Along the way , he tuned in to XM radio and tried to put aside the distractions of daily life -- bills , rent , laundry -- and get ready for work .
Nelson , an Air Force captain , was heading for his day shift on a new kind of job , one that could require him to kill another human being 7,500 miles away .
Seated in a padded chair inside a low , tan building , he controlled a heavily armed drone aircraft soaring over Afghanistan .
When his shift ended , he drove 40 minutes back through the desert to the hustle and neon of Las Vegas .
Drone pilots and crews are the vanguard of a revolution in warfare , one that the U.S. military and intelligence agencies have bet on heavily .
The first Predator carrying weapons was rushed to Afghanistan just four days after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Today , the Air Force is spending nearly $ 3 billion a year buying and operating drones , and is training pilots to fly more unmanned than manned aircraft .
Demand is so strong that even non-pilots such as civil engineers and military police are being trained .

More than 7,000 drones of all types are in use over Iraq and Afghanistan .
The planes have played an integral part in the offensive now being carried out in Marja , Afghanistan , by U.S. Marines and British and Afghan troops .
The Pentagon has adapted consumer - driven technology such as satellite television and digital video to give pilots , combat troops and commanders at headquarters a real - time look at the enemy on computer screens .
For the first time in warfare , troops on the ground can see the enemy miles away on live video feeds .
Drone strikes in Pakistan are part of a separate CIA program that has killed more than two dozen senior Al Qaeda and Taliban figures , including two leaders of the Pakistani Taliban in the last six months .
But the attacks also kill civilians , inflaming the sentiment that the United States is fighting an undeclared , illegal war from the skies over that country .
Some critics say the problems are so serious that the entire program is counterproductive and should be shut down .
Advertisement
This is combat in the age of video games and virtual reality .
Even though drone pilots operate from half a world away , they are as engaged in deadly combat as any pilot inside an airplane .
A drone pilot can fire on an insurgent dug into the Afghan hills and be home in time for a backyard barbecue .
In just an hour or two , the pilot can go from a heated argument with a spouse to a tense radio conversation with an amped - up soldier pinned down by weapons fire .
“ On the drive out here , you get yourself ready to enter the compartment of your life that is flying combat , ” said retired Col.
Chris Chambliss , who until last summer commanded drone operations at Creech Air Force Base , the command center for seven Air Force bases in the continental U.S. where crews fly drones over Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ And on the drive home , you get ready for that part of your life that ’s going to be the soccer game . ”
Drone crews do n’t put their lives at risk .
Instead , they juggle vast streams of video and data .
With briefings both before and after their missions , their workdays typically stretch to 10 or 11 hours .
Many of the pilots are experienced military fliers , but the camera operators tend to be much younger -- often only 19 or 20 , and new to the stresses of combat .

Just like troops in Iraq or Afghanistan , drone crews have access to chaplains , psychologists and doctors .
They are taught to keep an eye on one another for signs of stress .
The psychological challenges are unique : Pilots say that despite the distance , the video feed gives them a more intimate feel for the ground than they would have from a speeding warplane .
Some say they would prefer to be in Afghanistan or Iraq to avoid the daily adjustment from the soccer field to the battlefield .
After his stint in Nevada flying drones , which the military refers to as “ remotely piloted aircraft , ” Nelson recently transferred to a crew at an air base in Kandahar , Afghanistan .
Crews there and in Iraq , often battling high winds and freezing temperatures , control the drones on takeoff and landing , then hand them off to the U.S. - based teams .

While still in Nevada , after arriving for his shift on a mild day bathed in brilliant sunshine , Nelson received a battlefield briefing and then opened the door to his office -- the ground control station .
He settled into the cockpit seat , known to pilots as the “ Naugahyde Barcalounger , ” facing computer screens displaying live images from the mountains of Afghanistan -- color during the day , black - and - white at night .
As in any other cockpit , he had readouts for engine speed and temperature , altitude , fuel , pitch and roll angles , as well as other flight data .
At his fingertips were two keyboards .
He could type messages in chat rooms connecting him to scores of military personnel and analysts worldwide , and he could call up maps , satellite images and intelligence reports .
He talked by radio with ground commanders and troops who saw the same live images on their laptops and hand - held radios .
Inside the climate - controlled ground station , Nelson , a slender 30 - year - old , spent the next six hours amid the hum of computer servers and the occasional click of keyboards .
Advertisement
Early in the shift , a roadside bomb exploded in the Afghan night .
Using a throttle and joystick , Nelson maneuvered a 36 - foot - long Reaper drone armed with Hellfire missiles and 500 - pound bombs to a mountain valley in eastern Afghanistan , where a plume of black smoke rose over the site .
A convoy of Humvees had stopped a safe distance away , the vehicles a ribbon of boxy shapes on the screen as the Reaper soared several thousand feet overhead .
For the next hour , Nelson watched until the vehicles crept past the bomb site and safely reached their base .
Then he flew on to his next assignment , watching another convoy miles away .
Next to Nelson , who flew C - 5 cargo planes in Iraq before volunteering to pilot drones , was Tech .
Sgt. Jim Jochum , who operated the cameras .
An intelligence coordinator , whose job is to study the imagery , was posted next door .

Locked in on a mission , they often forget they ’re in Nevada .
Capt .
Mark Ferstl , a former B - 52 pilot , said drone pilots typically feel more intimately involved in combat than they did when they sat in actual cockpits .
“ When I flew the B - 52 , it was at 30,000 to 40,000 feet , and you do n’t even see the bombs falling , ” Ferstl said .
“ Here , you ’re a lot closer to the actual fight , or that ’s the way it seems . ”
Nelson recalled one instance when he received an urgent radio call from a ground controller whose unit was under fire .
“ You could tell he was running , and you could hear shots being fired at the enemy , ” Nelson said .
He tracked the insurgents and targeted them for two F - 16 fighter planes that attacked and killed them , he said .
Advertisement
“ Just hearing the voice of the [ controller ] running , excited , tension in his voice , just asking for any air support , anywhere , hearing the gunfire , it felt good to be able to help him out , ” Nelson said .
As Predator drones and the larger and more powerful Reapers became prevalent in the Afghan and Iraq wars , the Air Force took pilots away from manned aircraft to fly them .
Many were reluctant to switch .
“ From a personal reward standpoint , it ’s way more fun to climb up the ladder , throw the white scarf around your neck , and get into an F - 16 cockpit , ” said Chambliss , a former fighter pilot who volunteered to fly drones .
“ But from a combat effectiveness standpoint , it ’s not even close .
“ You can look at guys walking down a road and tell whether any of them are armed , ” he said .
“ You can zoom in from an ultra - wide to a road intersection ” to look for bombs .
Advertisement
Though more than 95 % of their missions involve gathering intelligence or watching over troops , pilots sometimes must decide whether to open fire .
They operate under the same rules as pilots of fighter jets or attack helicopters .
Only after going through a long checklist of safeguards are they cleared to push a black button on the throttle and squeeze a gray trigger on the joystick to release a bomb or missile .
The pilots call out “ Three , two , one , rifle ! ” as the weapon launches and “ Splash ! ” when it hits its target .
The job also involves confirming deaths , by drone or manned aircraft .
Then crew members focus on corpses and ruined buildings .
“ You see a lot of detail , ” Chambliss said .
“ We feel it , maybe not to the same degree as if we were actually there , but it affects us .
Part of the job is to try to identify body parts . ”

A 50 - year - old senior master sergeant and camera operator said veteran personnel keep an eye on young crew members for signs of stress .
“ They ’re continually reminded that they ’re not just sitting outside Las Vegas doing a job , ” said the sergeant , who for security reasons identified himself only by his first name , Ralph .
“ I talk to these youngsters quite often , especially after they ’ve seen their first shot , to make sure they do n’t keep things bottled up and are able to decompress . ”
Col .
Dale Fridley , a 50 - year - old former F - 15 pilot , said one of his most rewarding moments as a drone pilot came without firing a shot .
After a U.S. military vehicle broke down in the desert in Afghanistan ’s Helmand province , a Taliban stronghold , the rest of the convoy returned to base .

The stranded soldiers were able to sleep while Fridley ’s drone stood watch overhead , awaiting a repair crew ’s arrival in the morning .
“ And that , ” Fridley said , “ was something that was never , ever possible before . ”

Researchers in Cambridge to launch three - year £ 1 m trial to desensitise sufferers of allergy that affects 4 % of schoolchildren
Doctors are launching a major clinical trial in the search for a long - term treatment for peanut allergy after children suffering from the condition were treated successfully for the first time .
Researchers at Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge will begin the £ 1 m government - funded immunotherapy trial next month after a pilot study showed children who had a severe reaction to peanuts could be desensitised .
The therapy is the most promising development yet in the search for a long - term treatment for the allergy , which affects 4 % of British schoolchildren .
Children who suffer a reaction to peanuts can experience a constriction of the airways , breathing trouble , asthma , itching and swelling .
Unlike some other childhood allergies , peanut sensitivity rarely recedes with time .
Around one in 10 reactions is serious .
The hospital has recruited 104 children who will be randomly assigned to receive the therapy or join a control group for three years .
Children receiving the therapy will be given a small amount of yoghurt with one milligram of peanut flour mixed in each day .
Over time , the quantity of peanut flour will be increased to the equivalent of five peanuts a day , a process designed to desensitise their immune systems to the nuts .
In the pilot , 21 of 23 children aged seven to 17 were effectively desensitised to peanuts and were able to eat food containing the nuts without suffering any reaction .
Two of the children now only take the yoghurt with peanut flour once a week to maintain their tolerance .
" This is going to be the largest trial of its kind in the world and it should give us a definitive idea of whether it works and whether it 's safe , " said Andrew Clark , a consultant in paediatric allergy at the hospital .
Food allergy is responsible for the majority of anaphylactic shock in children and has increased by 20 % in western countries in the past 10 years .
Families involved in the pilot said the therapy changed their lives .
" It 's dramatic , " said Clark .
" Before they were checking every food label every time they ate food .
They would worry it would cause a reaction or even kill them , but now they can go out and eat curries and Chinese food and they can eat everyday snacks and treats .
" For their birthday they can have chocolate cake and chocolates without any fear of reactions .
Our real motivation is to try to develop this as a clinical treatment that we could spread to the rest of the country , " Clark told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Diego .
Researchers said children may need to receive the immunotherapy for two to three years , after which it may be possible for them to stop without losing their tolerance . "
Clark said the therapy was at the research stage and required intensive clinical oversight to ensure it was safe .
" It must not be tried at home outside the research setting , " he said .
A previous trial in the 1990s , which used injections rather than consumed peanut flour , produced serious side effects .
a ) Teddy Bear -
The most important thing to keep in mind is that your bear should be big enough that the LED 's fit reasonably well in it 's head .
I bought one bear online and it turned out to be too small for this version of the LEDs
b ) Scanning LEDs -
There are several online kits available with the necessary LEDs , resistors , etc ... to make your own scanning LED array .
I used the one from Thinkgeek , but I also picked up a smaller version that I may use in teddy bear Mark II .
c ) Blaster Gun -
Not a big deal , but once I had a bear I was able to pick out a gun that looked about the right size for him .
Cylons are often shown with blasters so I did n't want Mark I to feel left out .
d) Audio -
To get the signature " By Your Command " catch phrase I picked up a few different versions of your stock greeting card / toy voice recorder gadgets .
I had planned to use one type and set the button in his paw , but I ended up decided to use the small white hockey puck version pictured below and actuating it by squeezing his nose ( it just seemed cuter that way ) .
You 'll also need fabric glue , a zipper , wire , electrical tape and heat shrink tubing .
Oh , and I also used an on / off push button and a momentary on / off push button to control on / off and the speed of the LEDs ( the kit I used has 3 speeds controlled by a momentary on / off button that triggers the speed change )
Washington ( CNN ) --
The head of the National Black Farmers Association said Thursday the U.S. government has agreed to pay qualified farmers $ 50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias .
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said those farmers may also pursue a claim for actual damages from the bias , and potentially receive up to $ 250,000 .
The settlement , which covers as many as 80,000 black farmers at a price of more than $ 1 billion , still needs to be funded by Congress , both sides acknowledged Thursday .
The 2010 farm bill , still pending in Congress , includes more than $ 1 billion to cover the compensation claims .
In a written statement Thursday , President Obama said his administration " is dedicated to ensuring that federal agencies treat all our citizens fairly , and the settlement in the Pigford case reflects that commitment . "
The Pigford case was decided in favor of black farmers by a federal judge 's ruling in 1999 .
The head of the farmers group , John Boyd , said : " It 's really the Department of Agriculture agreeing to pay , the Justice Department agreeing to pay and our lawyers agreeing to the process . "
In a conference telephone call with reporters , Vilsack said racial bias unquestionably took place in his agency over many years .
He gave an example of two farmers , one white , one black , applying for a farm loan with an office of the USDA .
The white farmer 's application " was processed rapidly , it was approved , and resources were quickly available to enable him to put a crop in , " Vilsack said .
The application from the black farmer " was denied without due diligence on whether he had the capacity to repay , or else he or she was strung out over such a long period of time that they could n't put in a crop , " Vilsack said .
The result , Vilsack said , was that " in some cases they lost the farm . "
This month Boyd 's group organized demonstrations throughout historically black agricultural areas of the South , including areas in Arkansas , Tennessee , Mississippi , Virginia , Alabama , South Carolina and Georgia .
The rallies wrapped up Monday as a small group of activists gathered outside the Agriculture Department in Washington .
Boyd and other demonstrators expressed frustration that Congress has yet to approve a budget that would pay for the 1999 class action settlement in the case .
Part of the reason lawmakers were reluctant in the past to provide funding , Vilsack said , was their concern that no agreement -- such as the one announced Thursday -- was on the table .
He described a two - track process in which black farmers could receive a flat $ 50,000 payout with minimal proof linking discrimination to the denial of federal farm support .
A more rigorous system of proof could establish actual damages and yield a potential payout up to $ 250,000 , depending on how many other claimants also prove their cases to draw from the funding provided by Congress .
Boyd acknowledged " not everyone will qualify " for the payments .
" It 's still a victory that their claims will be reviewed as a result of this agreement , which at least gives them a chance and keeps this out of courts , where no one gets any money , " he said .
Vilsack , noting the farm bill is still awaiting approval , said he did n't think " anybody in Congress doubts there 's a responsibility to settle . "
However , if no funding exists by the end of March , farmers can walk away from the agreement if they desire , he said .
Boyd said he will meet Friday with the staffs of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to affirm that the agreement should be funded .

Update : BloomEnergy is now Live , details at the end
The future is all about generating your own cheap electricity in greener ways , and a US startup believes that they have found a solution – “ Powerhouse in a Box ” .
Bloom energy , formerly “ Ion America ” , comes - up with something that is truly powerful , and revolutionary .
K.R. Sridhar has built what he claims to be a fuel cell that can power a typical US home for a year with zero emission .
This equals 2 European and 4 Asian houses 24/7 x 365 days , that ’s alot of energy .
KR had worked previously with NASA to build a handy device that could actually produce Oxygen for Mars .
But the idea was dropped by the agency , and KR reversed the invention to make it a fuel cell .
Currently , these boxes cost $ 700,000 - $ 800,000 , but eventually in 5 - 10 years , there will be one in every home – and Sridhar thinks he can get the cost below $ 3,000 for a unit to make that happen .
Two of these boxes combined together makeup to a size of a brick , and they need to be surrounded by a larger unit that takes in an energy source ( such as natural gas ) of upto size of refrigerator .
The fact is that they ’re already installed at datacenters in companies like Google , eBay , FedEx and others .
Four of these Bloom Boxes have apparently been powering a Google datacenter for the past 18 months .
eBay says their five boxes have saved them over $ 100,000 in electricity costs over the past 9 months .
Watch the Video Coverage from CBS :
The technology will be unveiled to public on wednesday , 24th feb , the countdown is already clicking on their website .
Stay tuned for the unveiling , we will keep you updated @taranfx .
Update : BloomEnergy is now Live
Energy Saver : Built with our patented solid oxide fuel cell technology , Bloom ’s Energy Server™ is a new class of distributed power generator , producing clean , reliable , affordable electricity at the customer site .
Fuel cells are devices that convert fuel into electricity through a clean electro - chemical process rather than dirty combustion .
They are like batteries except that they always run .
Our particular type of fuel cell technology is different than legacy “ hydrogen ” fuel cells in four main ways :
Low cost materials – our cells use a common sand - like powder instead of precious
metals like platinum or corrosive materials like acids .
High electrical efficiency – we can convert fuel into electricity at nearly twice the
rate of some legacy technologies
Fuel flexibility – our systems are capable of using either renewable or fossil fuels Reversible – our technology is capable of both energy generation and storage
Each Bloom Energy Server provides 100 kW of power , enough to meet the baseload needs of 100 average homes or a small office building … day and night , in roughly the footprint of a standard parking space .
For more power simply add more energy servers .
At the heart of every Energy Server™ is Bloom ’s patented solid oxide fuel cell technology .
Each Energy Server consists of thousands of Bloom ’s fuel cells .
Each cell is a flat solid ceramic square made from a common sand - like “ powder . ”
Each Bloom Energy fuel cell is capable of producing about 25 W … enough to power a light bulb .
For more power , the cells are sandwiched , along with metal interconnect plates into a fuel cell “ stack ” .
A few stacks , together about the size of a loaf of bread , is enough to power an average home .
In an Energy Server , multiple stacks are aggregated together into a “ power module ” , and then multiple power modules , along with a common fuel input and electrical output are assembled as a complete system .
For more power , multiple Energy Server systems can be deployed side by side .
In addition to Bloom ’s unmatched performance , this modular architecture offers …
easy and fast deployment
inherent redundancy for fault tolerance
high availability ( one power module can be serviced while all others continue to operate )
mobility

Science & Exploration Space Station ’s big bay window installed 15/02/2010 604 views 0 likes
The biggest window ever launched to space has been installed in its final position on the Earth - facing port of Node - 3 .
The latches and 16 electrically driven bolts were engaged today at 07:31 CET ( 06:31 GMT ) .
Opening of the window shutters is foreseen for Wednesday .
During the launch of Endeavour , the Cupola was attached to Node - 3’s end cone docking port , After installing Node - 3 on Friday and preparing Cupola for relocation , Cupola was this morning released and manoeuvred to the Node - 3’s Earth - facing port where it was reberthed .
Electrical and water lines are now being connected between Node - 3 and Cupola , and the Cupola ’s window heaters are being activated .
Activities related to making Node - 3 fully functional also continue .
Astronaut Robert Behnken during the EVA 2 Meanwhile other outfitting tasks inside Node - 3 are being carried out , including removal of all panel launch bolts and the installation of two sampling tools over the thermal lines that will be used to extract water sample for analysis .
During tomorrow ’s spacewalk astronauts Behnken and Patrick will open the second ammonia loop for Node - 3’s External Thermal Control System and disconnect the power line for the temporary heaters .
The astronauts will also remove the insulating blankets covering the Cupola , which were needed during transfer to the ISS .
The thermal shroud will be jettisoned on removal .
Once the thermal blankets have gone the launch bolts that secure the Cupola ’s window shutters in place ( three bolts per shutter ) can be removed .
After installation of handrails and fixtures that will help astronauts on future EVAs , the Cupola will be ready for operation .

Vitamin B6 appears to play a beneficial role in preventing colon cancer , a study published Tuesday concluded .
Researchers led by Susanna Larsson of Sweden 's National Institute of Environmental medicine traced the beneficial effects to pyridoxal - phosphate ( PLP ) , the main active coenzyme form of vitamin B6 .
" Vitamin B6 intake and blood PLP levels were inversely related with the risk of colorectal cancer , " the study said .
Vitamin B6 is found in cereals , vegetables , poultry and fish as well as in some fruits like bananas and avocados .
Published in a special edition of the Journal of American Medical Association , the study analyzed 13 other US , European and Asian studies conducted between 2002 and 2009 .
In the United States , according to JAMA , 20 percent of men and 40 percent of women over the age of 50 do not take in sufficient vitamin B6 .
While taking vitamin B6 supplements did not appear to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer , increases in the level of PLP in the bloodstream were associated with an inversely lower risk of colorectal cancer .
The authors believe that these studies could contain distortions because individuals who take vitamin B6 tend to have healthy behavior , such as less smoking and alcohol and higher physical activity .
But studies that compared the effects of taking weak to high doses of vitamin B6 also showed " a statistically significant 21 percent reduction in colorectal cancer risk " at higher doses .

If you find yourself feeling frustrated with your progress in building your home business , or have the perception that you ’re just spinning your wheels and getting nothing accomplished , take time out and refocus your efforts .
I believe that even the most successful and prosperous home business entrepreneurs have “ hit the wall ” at some point , perhaps many times .
It is n’t so much how many times you get frustrated and unsure of yourself that determines success or failure , but rather how quickly you recognize the symptoms and take action to get back on track .
I ’m talking here about any type of home based business .
You may be involved in network marketing , pursuing affiliate sales opportunities , or performing a service such as writing resumes or web programming and development .
Whatever you do , there will be times when you wonder if you ’re on the right track , especially during the crucial “ ramping up ” phase where you ’re just beginning to do the things necessary to make money and create the financial independence you desire .
How do you feel about the path you ’ve chosen to develop your home based income ?
Is there a confidence that you ’re on the right track , or a nagging doubt that encourages you to continually evaluate other options ?
Here is what I ’ve found , from personal experience as well as interacting with lots of people looking to make money from home , especially on the Internet .
There is just too much chatter and easy access to information that makes staying focused very hard at times .
Consider a typical scenario .
Rick decided he wanted to earn an income from home , working in his spare time .
He came to the conclusion that setting up a network of web sites and blogs to market affiliate products was what he wanted to do .
He purchased a popular “ Internet marketing ” course that taught a turnkey method for doing this .
In the real world , many people market affiliate products successfully and make excellent incomes doing it .
However , despite marketing and promotional pitches that imply otherwise , it takes some work and special attention , and real results do n’t happen quickly .
If you carefully follow a legitimate and proven plan , you can make great money if you stick with it .
So , Rick got started and published five websites , loaded with content , designed to sell certain affiliate niche products .
After a couple months , and ongoing hard work , he made a total of $ 165 in affiliate commissions .
Did n’t sound like much , but it was a start .
To make a long story short , during this time , Rick participated in a couple of popular Internet marketing discussion forums in hope of finding information that would help him do even better at his new affiliate marketing business .
What he actually found was a whole different story .
Rick discovered the power of distraction .
Constant pitches for other “ systems ” and products .
Visible criticism of the system and plan he was working with , coupled with extremely effective marketing promos for other materials that promised more money faster and easier .
As it turned out , Rick lost his focus and eventually fell into the trap of flip flopping back and forth among various programs and “ make money online ” courses and never really had success with much of anything .
Refocus and Make a Commitment
If you feel that the path you ’ve chosen to make money from home is in doubt , or you lack confidence in the ultimate potential for what you ’re doing , it ’s time to refocus and commit .
Why did you choose this particular business model in the first place ?
Was it based on a great sales presentation that made it look easy and effortless to make money and enjoy lots of free time ?
What were the advantages ?
Any disadvantages ?
What appealed to you most about it ?
Was it more the daily actions required to prosper in the business ( things you would enjoy ) , or just the idea that you could make great money if you just did it ?
Does it fit your personality ?
If you ’re not a people person and prefer working alone , network marketing or any business that requires extensive interaction with others probably wo n’t be a fit for you .
Once you ’ve revisited your original reasons for doing your business , dig deep and ask yourself if the potential benefits are truly worth the effort and time you ’ll put in .
Be sure you enjoy what you ’re doing – that ’s a huge key to your success .
Refocus .
Make a commitment .
If you can ’t , or find that the home business you ’re pursuing is really not suited to you , consider other options .
Always remember , though , that with any business things will be slow and often rough in the beginning .
You ’re not likely to make it big overnight .
The rewards come to those who patiently work , do the right things , and stick it out .

New Zealand ’s internet filtering system went live last month – but the government forgot to mention this to its electorate until its hand was forced by online freedom campaign , Tech Liberty .
Thomas Beagle , a spokesman for the group , said he was " very disappointed that the filter is now running " and that its launch had been conducted in such a " stealthy mode " .
He added : " It 's a sad day for the New Zealand internet . "
In an interview with Computerworld this week , he claimed that the filter had gone live on February 1 but the Department of Internal Affairs ( DIA ) delayed announcing this at until it had met with its Independent Reference Group .
The manager of the DIA ’s Censorship Compliance Unit , Steve O'Brien , denied that there had been any subterfuge .
The system has been undergoing trials for two years and the media have been aware of this throughout .
He said : " The Independent Reference Group has met and the filter system processes were demonstrated as set out in the code of practice , that is that the website filtering system prevents access to known websites containing images of child sexual abuse . "
While the DIA continues to be coy about exactly which ISPs are joining the filter , Tech Liberty understands that Watchdog and MaxNet have already signed - up to deploy the filter system , and that ISPs Telstra Clear , Telecom and Vodafone have said they will do so .
Orcon , Slingshot and Natcom have said that they wo n't or , in the case of Orcon , that more data is needed as to how the filter will impact customer service .
ISPs also appear to take differing views of what – and when – to tell their customers .
Maxnet appear not to have warned their customers officially that the filter is in place : Vodafone has said it will do so when it goes live .
The system employs the Swedish Netclean Whitebox content filter - website requests are filtered by Border Gateway Protocol against a blacklist held on a central server in the government Censorship Compliance Unit .
The list is maintained by the Independent Reference Group which actively reviews banned URLs each month to eliminate false positives .
Bans must be justified and signed off by three " warranted inspectors of publications " .
Government statistics , published in 2009 , suggest that the blacklist includes more than 7,000 URLs featuring child sexual abuse – or over ten times the number of links recognised by the UK ’s Internet Watch Foundation .
It has been built by the censorship unit since 2005 and is affiliated with Europe ’s Cospol Internet Related Child Abusive Material Project .
David Zanetti , technical spokesperson for Tech Liberty , said : " We fear that the filter will reduce the stability of the internet in New Zealand .
It is a single point of failure , introduces a new and very tempting target for hackers , and by diverting traffic will cause issues with modern internet applications . "
Tech Liberty is also concerned by the expansion of government powers that thefilter represents .
It entrenches the principle that the government can set up a new censorship scheme and block material with no reference to existing law .
Worse , the filter list stays secret , in contrast to the censorship regime that operates in respect of other media , where the Chief Censor must publish decisions banning offensive material .
Cynics have also noted that the launch of the filter comes not long before the eighth round of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) negotiations , due to take place in Wellington , New Zealand in April . ®
' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' Protesters Chain Themselves to White House Fence Lt. Dan Choi and James Pietrangelo were part of 150 protesters .
March 18 , 2010  --
A pair of Iraq war veterans who were dismissed , or soon will be , from the military under the Pentagon 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , were arrested by police officers today after chaining themselves to the front gate of the White House , as part of a protest of that policy .
The pair were identified as Lt. Dan Choi , and former Army Capt .
James Pietrangelo , whose appeal of his dismissal was turned down by the Supreme Court last year .
The U.S. Park Police said that the two individuals will be charged with failure to obey a lawful order .
Some 150 protesters were also in front of the White House , chanting " Hey hey ho ho ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' has got to go , " which attracted about 30 Washington police officers who lined up in a show of force .
Alexander Nicholson , executive director of advocacy group Servicemembers United , said the White House can and should do more to push for repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
" It is significant to know that there are a few more things they can do to make sure that we see full legislative repeal in 2010 instead of risking , waiting until after the midterms , " Nicholson told ABC News at the White House protest .
" It 's not just about Congress , but also the commander in chief , " said John Aravosis , a Washington , D.C. - based gay rights activist who writes AMERICAblog .
" People think they 're moving ahead [ with repealing the ban ] .
It 's not moving ahead at all .
We may lose the house in November . "
While Choi and Pietrangelo were protesting , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was asked if President Obama had plans to meet with Choi .
" I do n't believe there are any meetings scheduled today , " Gibbs answered .
He said that he was not aware that the White House was given any heads - up about this beforehand .
The protest appeared to be spontaneous , witnesses said , after a small group of protesters headed off to the White house after a scheduled event in downtown Washington , D.C. featuring Kathy Griffin .
Choi , a 29 - year - old West Point graduate , announced he is gay during an appearance in March 2009 on MSNBC's " The Rachel Maddow Show . "
Soon after , the Army made plans to fire him , saying he had " negatively affected good order and discipline in the New York Army National Guard . "
His discharge under " do n't ask , do n't tell " is still pending , a decision from the Army hierarchy has still not taken place .
In a letter to Obama last year , Choi described his reaction to receiving the letter as " a slap in the face to me .
It is a slap in the face to my soldiers , peers and leaders who have demonstrated that an infantry unit can be professional enough to accept diversity , to accept capable leaders , to accept skilled soldiers .
...
My subordinates know I 'm gay .
They do n't care , " he said .
" They are professional .
" As an infantry officer , I am not accustomed to begging .
But I beg you today :
Do not fire me , " Choi wrote .
' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' Protesters Arrested in Front of White House
Choi told ABC News last May that he had never confided about his sexuality to anyone in the Army .
He stayed silent for nearly 10 years .
But in 2008 , Choi said he found the man he describes as his first love , and that relationship spurred his decision to come out .
" It has been one of the greatest things .
I grew as a person .
You know , you have the support .
You have the encouragement to be a better solider .
You have someone to share your very difficult times with , " he said .
" I was able to experience that and how can I lie and keep quiet because it 's so good . "
Pietrangelo was in the Vermont National Guard when he was discharged in 2004 .
The Supreme Court denied his review of an appeal to legally challenge the " do n't ask , do n't tell ' policy .
" I think this decision is an absolute travesty of justice and I think every judge on this court should be ashamed of themselves , " Pietrangelo said at the time .
The former soldier served six years in the Army , seven years in the Vermont National Guard and fought in Iraq in 1991 .
" It 's nothing short of rubber - stamping legalized discrimination . "
As protesters gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue , the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on " do n't ask , do n't tell " today .
Senators heard from a former Marine general who favors keeping the law in place and from two junior officers with compelling stories of how they were forced out of the military they wanted to serve in .
Gen . John Sheehan made the argument that unit cohesion would be affected by having openly gay servicemen serving .
Former Air Force Maj. Michael Almy and former Navy Lt. JG
Jenny Kopfstein countered that unit cohesion was affected by their discharges , not their presence in the unit .
Almy was outed after his fourth tour in Iraq when a personal e-mail folder was reviewed by his new unit commander .
Kopfstein has said that she decided she could n't live with herself in hiding her sexual orientation from others and found supportive commanding officers who stood up for her when she was being discharged .
ABC News ' Luis Martinez contributed to this report .
" They said the owners were unhappy as the brick - field was not producing reddish bricks despite enough heating .
A fortune teller then suggested that the brick - field needed a human sacrifice , " he said .

The United States today has slipped toward race - based socialism :
That 's the true name for an overwhelming bias for one race above others , in employment , promotion , and educational opportunities .
Our media are constantly stirring the witch 's brew of racial grievances , constantly making black people feel aggrieved and white people feel accused .
Our schools drive that lesson home with young and innocent kids in a totally ruthless way .
Repeat that for twelve years of schooling and TV , and you have a brainwashed kid .
That is what European socialists have done with class envy for the last hundred years : whip up the poor against the middle and the rich .
It 's in their standard bag of tricks .
The American Left has just added racial grievances to class anger and resentment , always feeding more and more power to the racial socialists to buy peace for the very grievances they have whipped up in the first place .
The NAACP today practices racial socialism .
So does Obama .
" Racial Ssocialism " drives the Left 's current assault on American values .
That 's why Jeremiah Wright is such a significant part of Obama 's life .
Wright specialized in whipping up racial anger for political purposes .
Obama 's career was powered by it .
Only 12.3 percent of Americans are black , and they cannot command a majority vote .
It 's therefore necessary to add gender socialism , because half the population are women .
If enough women can be made to feel rage against normative America , along with blacks , Hispanics , and the poor , you 've got majority control of the country .
You can add the wackier Greens , the ones who fall for the global warming scam , the anti-nuclear scam , and all the other anti-scientific Luddites who vote Left .
The Democrats control our major cities with a coalition of those whipped - up grievance groups .
We are no longer a society run by talent , work , and opportunity .
Like ancient Egypt and Sumer , we are a society where the ruling class exploits its productive workers by taxing their labor , talent , and ability to recognize and use new opportunities .
Barack H. Obama is the logical outcome of racial socialism .
You can see it in his words and actions , and his very physical stance , all signaling his sense of superiority , the flip - side of feelings of inferiority he is reacting against .
Obama 's core support came from the Leftist alliance of grievance groups in spite of his total lack of relevant experience .
Obama is objectively the least qualified person to be elected to the presidency .
But the media could not say that , because it would have been non-P.C. to tell the truth .
Obama 's election was a kind of guilt propitiation by the American people for the history of slavery .
But that is bizarre .
Living people are not responsible for what others did two hundred years ago .
That is a racist idea -- it makes sense only if whites have Evil Genes -- just like traditional anti-Semitism and hatred for blacks as a race .
We are seeing the consequences right in front of our eyes today , as this administration demonstrates its incompetence and intellectual confusion about the most obvious problems we face -- the Islamist terror threat , for starters .
The most famous version of racial socialism is you - know - who .
The Nazis rose to power by whipping up racial resentment against the Jews , the Gypsies , and other " inferior " peoples : race - based national socialism .
For the Nazis , the " oppressed " were the German people , das Volk , as a race .
Racial socialism is routine in post - colonial regimes , like in the case of Robert Mugabe , who clings to power by scapegoating white Zimbabweans , people who also happen to run the farms that provide food for that country .
Like Stalin and Kim Jong
Il , Mugabe is exploiting racial divisions at the cost of starvation and poverty for his people .
That is also why Obama 's Dreams from My Father is an important policy statement , whether Bill Ayers wrote it or not .
Obama is a post - colonial socialist , as was his father -- a Kenyan who wanted revenge against white Britons who ran colonial Kenya .
That is why as president , Obama bizarrely tries to diss the Brits -- both the Queen and socialist Prime Minister Gordon Brown -- while bowing low to autocrats like the king of Saudi Arabia .
There is something very regressive about that .
It is looking to the past , not the present or the future .
Post - colonial socialism has been a universal failure wherever it has been tried .
Robert Mugabe is one in a long series of failures .
In India , the big post - colonial socialist was Jawaharlal Nehru , and his Congress Party has now switched its economic policies to encourage free markets , having learned something from decades of economic failure .
In China , a similar evolution has happened .
In Africa the most successful regimes have rejected post - colonial revenge socialism .
But do n't we owe black Americans something for the sins of slavery ?
Just like we owe women for the sins of sexism , and gays for the sins of heterosexuality ?
The answer is no .
Remedies for past injustices cannot be used to overthrow a society .
Germany 's forced reparations after World War I destroyed the economy and the middle class , thereby undermining France and the rest of Europe as well .
The attempted " remedy " for past sins also created a nationalistic revenge movement , the Nazis , who committed aggression even bloodier than World War I.
Revenge movements do not make for peace .
But that is precisely what Racial Socialism is all about .
But a society based on racial compensation turns into a tyranny , just as a society based on racial superiority does .
Real democracy allows individuals to overcome their circumstances .
But you can't overcome your race , your gender , or , in some cases , your sexual preferences .
America is therefore being driven relentlessly toward a European ruling class model based on inheritance and not talent , hard work , and opportunity .
Race - based socialism is not progressive , but radically regressive , going back to the clan - based ruling classes of the first city - states in human history , as in Sumer , Egypt , and the Indus Valley six thousand years ago .
The Indian caste system arose as a racial layering of Indian society by different invading tribal groups .
The Left is always pointing the finger at mainstream America for the sin of racism .
But racial divide and conquer is precisely the deliberate strategy of the Left .
In Britain , Labour politicians have finally confessed that they has deliberately imported hundreds of thousands of Pakistani Muslims to serve as cheap wedge - voters against British whites , while constantly accusing normal , decent people of racism .
Throughout Western societies , the Left has conducted a mean and cynical assault on the mainstream of society , constantly undermining normal people while laying claim to a higher morality .

Rudd is under pressure to guarantee householders and installers are free from the risk of cancer - causing agents carried in imported insulation .
The Prime Minister was subjected to Opposition questions in parliament today about why he did not disclose the substance of briefings received between August 2009 and March 2010 on the home insulation scheme , The Australian reports .
Last week , Mr Rudd revealed to parliament he received a letter from Minister Garrett about compliance issues with the home insulation program as early as August 14 last year .
He also admitted receiving further letters but refused to release them citing cabinet process , a claim he repeated today .
“ This correspondence between the minister and myself constituted cabinet related correspondence , ” he said .
Today he was asked by the Liberal MP for Forrest and Opposition Deputy Whip , Nola Marino , whether he could guarantee that all installations were compliant with the national code of practice for the safe use of mineral fibres .
“ Can the Prime Minister also guarantee that under his home insulation scheme no householder or installer is at risk from imported insulation that may contain or have been treated with cancer - causing agents ? ” she asked .
Mr Rudd said he could not issue the guarantee and referred Ms Marino to previous statements made by himself , Greg Combet , who is charged with cleaning up the home insulation scheme , and Mr Garrett .
“ We 'll be dealing with each practical problem as it arises for the households concerned , ” he said .
Last month claims emerged Mr Garrett was warned of cheap batts smelling of formaldehyde being imported from China , Thailand and the US .
Formaldehyde is a harmful chemical that can cause respiratory problems and cancer .
NYSCOF | Feb 22 , 2010
The California Dental Association ( CDA ) joins a growing list of researchers , dental and health organizations advising against regularly mixing infant formula with fluoridated water to avoid discoloring babies ’ developing teeth ( fluorosis ) .
But little effort is made to inform the public , reports the New York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation , Inc. ( NYSCOF ) .
“ Neither a nutrient nor required for healthy teeth , fluoride chemicals are added to many public water supplies and some bottled water in a failed attempt to reduce tooth decay , ” says attorney Paul Beeber , NYSCOF President .
“ … mixing powdered or liquid infant formula concentrate with fluoridated water on a regular basis for infants primarily fed in this way may increase the chance of a child ’s developing enamel fluorosis , ” according to the CDA ’s Feb 2010 Report , Oral Health During Pregnancy and Early Childhood : Evidence - Based Guidelines for Health Professionals . ( 1 )
In March 2006 , the National Research Council ( NRC ) cautioned that infants can fluoride - overdose via reconstituted baby formula .
( 2 ) The American Dental Association ( ADA ) passed this information on to its members in a November 2006 e- gram ( 3 ) which the ADA reaffirmed and strengthened in a November 2009 News Release ( 4 ) .
The ADA defines moderate fluorosis as “ All tooth surfaces affected ; marked wear on biting surfaces ; brown stain may be present ” and severe fluorosis as “ All tooth surfaces affected ; discrete or confluent pitting ; brown stain present . ”
Mild fluorosis is white spotted teeth affecting about 25 % to 50 % of tooth surfaces . ( 5 )
National data ( 1986 – -1987 ) shows dental fluorosis is a huge U.S. problem with 62 percent of 5 – 17 year - olds afflicted with white spotted , yellow , brown and / or pitted teeth .
( 6 ) Data from 1999 - 2000 shows that fluorosis has increased further since then . ( 7 )
The Food and Drug Administration ruled that fluoridated bottled water cannot be marketed for infants as a decay preventive .
( 8 )
In November 2007 , The Globe and Mail quotes ADA spokesman and University of California dental professor , Howard Pollick , as saying the ADA recommendation applies to infants under one year of age who consume a lot of formula and “ are at risk for developing some level of dental fluorosis . ”
Dr. Pollick said the risks occur at the level of fluoride recommended for U.S. water systems . ( 9 )
Health Canada reported in 2008
“ The consumption of powdered infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water could lead to excessive intake of fluoride in infants . ” ( 10 )
Other government and medical groups which advise against mixing infant formula with fluoridated water :
The Centers for Disease Control ( 11 )
The Academy of General Dentistry ( 12 )
The Vermont Department of Health ( 13 )
Delta Dental ( 14 )
The Minnesota Dental Association ( 15 )
This information has been known for decades :
“ Studies of fluoride levels of baby formulas and cereals have shown a significant increase in the fluoride content when fluoridated water was used for processing these foods , ” was reported by Kumar et al. in the May 1989 American Journal of Public Health .
Some scientists tried in vain [ in January 1990 ] to get the word out as described in “ Suppression by Medical Journals of a Warning about Overdosing Formula - Fed Infants with Fluoride , ” published in 1997 in the Journal Accountability in Research . ( 17 )
“ Four major [ fluorosis ] risk factors were consistently identified : use of fluoridated drinking water , fluoride supplements , fluoride toothpaste , and infant formulas before the age of six years , ” reported Mascarenhas in 2000 ( July - August Pediatric Dentistry ) . ( 18 )
“ Infant beverages , particularly infant formulas prepared with fluoridated water , can increase the risk of fluorosis in primary teeth , ” reported Marshall et al. in Journal of the American College of Nutrition ( April 2004 ) ( 19 )
“ A major effort should be made to avoid use of fluoridated water for dilution of formula powders ( Fluoride in Dentistry ) . ” ( 20 )
“ Our analysis shows that babies who are exclusively formula fed face the highest [ fluorosis ] risk , ” reports the Environmental Working Group . ( 21 )
“ The entire Board [ Burlington VT Board of Health ] holds serious concerns about the current fluoride exposure of infants between the ages of zero and six months .
We deem this exposure to be a ‘ significant public health risk ’ , and one that should be given immediate attention by the city and state . ” ( 22 )
“ Some risk of increasing fluorosis may be attributed to the ingestion of powdered infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water , ” ( Pizzo et al. Clinical Oral Investigations , Feb 2007 ) ( 23 )
At least eleven other studies link reconstituted formula with fluorosis . ( 24a -k ) .
NYSCOF news releases in 2000 , 2004 , 2009 and 2010 ( 25a , b , c , d ) cited many studies linking fluorosis to infant foods mixed with fluoridated water .
( Also see : http://www.fluoridealert.org/health/infant )
“ Instead of using their enormous resources to warn the public against mixing fluoridated water and infant formula , fluoridation proponents have created news releases attempting to discredit NYSCOF that actually reinforce NYSCOF ’s science - based information ( 4 , 26 ) , ” says Beeber .

Owners of Nvidia - based video cards may be putting those cards , as well as the rest of their PCs , at risk if they ’re using the latest version of Nvidia ’s graphics drivers .
First reported by beta testers playing Starcraft II , the problem with the recently released driver update 196.75 may affect you , even if you ’re not a gamer .
Starcraft II ’s publisher , Blizzard Entertainment , issued an official statement in the game ’s Battle .
net forums advising users to roll back to the previous driver version , 196.21 , to avoid any issues .
The company has diagnosed the problem as related to fan control , which is causing overheating .
According to a story at IncGamers.com , in some extreme cases this is causing physical damage to not only the video card but the processor and motherboard as well .
Blizzard also advises that the problem could affect Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft .
But any current Windows version ( 32 - and 64 - bit XP , Vista , and Windows 7 ) running the driver is susceptible , which means that using any 3D application with the new drivers could put your system at risk .
Nvidia responded to our request for comments with the following statement : “ We are aware that some customers have reported fan speed issues with the latest 196.75 WHQL drivers on NVIDIA.com .
Until we can verify and root cause this issue , we recommend that customers stay with , or return to 196.21 WHQL drivers .
Release 196.75 drivers have been temporarily removed from our Web site in the meantime . ”
1. to greedily covet something to the point of paranoia , even when among friends ; 2. to knowingly and covertly attempt to consume a larger share of the communal weed than is proper , at the expense of one 's homeboys / girls .
OriginRefers to characteristics displayed by the actor Humphrey Bogart in his portrayal of Fred Dobbs in the 1948 motion picture , ' The Treasure of the Sierra Madre .'
Dobbs is selfish and distrustful of his friends and attempts to hoard for himself the gold that he and his companions discover while prospecting in Mexico .
In the movie , Bogart 's character , Dobbs , and his two prospecting buddies strike gold !
The minute they do , however , Dobbs becomes super greedy , selfish , and paranoid .
When he is the one selected to go into town for supplies , he freaks out : Dobbs :
Why am I elected to go to the village ?
Why me instead of you and Curtin ?
Oh , do n't think I do n't see through that .
You two 've thrown in against me .
The two days I 'd be gone would give you plenty of time to discover where my goods are , would n't it ?
Later , they 're sitting around a campfire after having split up the gold from their claim .
Dobbs is off the reservation at this point and convinced the other two are planning to take his share after he falls asleep : Dobbs : Let 's see , three times 35 - is a hundred and five .
I 'll bet you 105,000 dollars that you go to sleep before I do ... He is threatening to kill them and take their gold if they fall asleep .
In other words , he is bogarting the shit out of that gold .
The insurance fund is in better shape than such numbers might suggest , however .
Officials estimate that bank failures would drain about $ 100 billion from the fund from 2009 through 2013 .
But of that amount , a total of roughly $ 80 billion in losses were recognized last year or projected for 2010 .
By that math , the agency is expecting an additional $ 20 billion of losses over the next three years .
After slipping into the red last fall , the F.D.I.C. moved swiftly to refill its coffers .
The agency imposed a special assessment on banks that gave it an immediate $ 5.6 billion cash infusion .
That assessment was in addition to the ordinary payments that banks make to the F.D.I.C. fund .

The New York Times
In September , the F.D.I.C. ordered banks to prepay quarterly assessments that would have otherwise been due through 2012 .
That provided an additional $ 46 billion to restore the fund to normal .
For accounting purposes , the agency will add that money to the fund in small doses over the next 13 quarters , which explains the current negative balance .
Together , these moves buy time for the agency to determine its next steps in the event its losses worsen .
In such a case , banks might be called on to chip in more money , either through new special assessments , prepaid fees or premium increases .
F.D.I.C. officials said no such plans were in the works .
“ The good news is that the industry will power through this , ” said Bert Ely , a longtime banking industry consultant in Washington .
The fund has “ taken a lot of hits along the way , but I still do n’t expect the taxpayer to ride to the rescue . ”
To protect the fund , the F.D.I.C. also has found creative ways to bring in more money .
On Tuesday , Ms. Bair said that the agency would soon issue bonds backed by the assets of failed banks and guaranteed by the government .
The program aims to attract nontraditional buyers of bank assets , like insurance companies , pension funds and mutual funds .
This is NOT your average unboxing video !
I ’ve been trying to get my hands on the Nokia N900 for a while now , many of you have emailed me asking for a review or asking questions about the N900 so we ’ve been bugging Nokia for a review model almost daily !
About a week ago I had an email from Nokia asking if I would like to try out one of their new handsets , but the catch was that they were unable to tell me which one they were going to send me !
Not a problem I said , we ’ll take a look anyway .
The Nokia N900
So a few days ago this large , heavy black plastic cube turned up in the office .
There were no instructions , no list of contents , just a USB to MiniUSB cable supplied .
There was no obvious way to open the box – a little puzzle ! 🙂
So first of all we connected the box up to a PC with the USB cable to see what would happen , when Windows reported that it was installing drivers for a USB to Serial bridge and added a serial device on COM4 I thought it would be a good idea to start a terminal connection to it and , well watch the video below to see what happened next .

Wilson Brings Blueliner From Carolina by San Jose Sharks Staff / San Jose Sharks
San Jose Sharks Executive Vice President and General Manager Doug Wilson announced today that the team has acquired defenseman Niclas Wallin ( wahl - EEN ) and a fifth round selection in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft from the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for a second round selection in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft ( previously acquired from the Buffalo Sabres ) .
“ Niclas is a playoff - hardened , veteran player with lots of postseason experience and a Stanley Cup ring , ” said Wilson .
“ Good , solid character players are hard to come by and we think he will complement our existing group very well .
He has a history of playing his best when the games mean the most . ”
This year is an odd year for the NHL ’s annual trade deadline as there is a hiatus during the Olympics and then there are only three days for trades following the break .
“ It ’s important to have time to integrate someone into the team , ” said Wilson .
“ He understands how to play with good players . ”
A strong part of the trade is the Sharks were able to acquire a player with Wallin ’s qualities without having to deplete their roster .
“ It worked out , we wanted to add to our team and not subtract from it , ” said Wilson .
Wallin falls into the category of a player who can handle virtually any situation , whether he ’s on the left or right side .
“ He ’s just a hockey player and knows how to get it done , ” said Wilson .
Wallin , 34 , is a nine - year NHL veteran , all with the Carolina Hurricanes and won a Stanley Cup with the organization in 2006 .
He has posted five assists and 26 penalty minutes in 47 games with Carolina this season and is 15th among all NHL defenseman with 125 hits .
In 517 NHL games , he has collected 69 points ( 18 goals , 51 assists ) and 391 penalty minutes .
He accumulated three overtime game - winning goals for Carolina .
Wallin has added eight points ( three goals five assists ) and 32 penalty minutes in 69 Stanley Cup Playoff games and has appeared in two Stanley Cup Finals series .
All three of his post - season goals were overtime game - winners earning him the nickname , “ The Secret Weapon . ”
Wallin represented his native Sweden at the 2008 World Championships , where he picked up four points ( two goals , two assists ) and 33 penalty minutes in 7 games .
The six - foot - three , 220 - pound native of Boden , Sweden was selected by Carolina in the fourth round ( 97th overall ) of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft .

In Essential Skills for Perl 5 Programmers I mentioned that no one can be an adept Perl programmer without understanding context .
This trips up many , many people -- and you often hear ( unfair ) criticisms of Perl 5 based on misunderstandings and guesses about how context works .
Context is reasonably easy to explain .
( The previous sentence is grammatically correct . )
Contexts is not difficult to understands .
( The previous sentence is grammatically incorrect , even if you speak the Queen 's English . )
If you can find the errors in the previous paragraph , you can understand quantity context in Perl 5 : like subject - verb agreement in terms of number , expressions in Perl 5 can behave differently in contexts that imply zero , one , or more results .
fetch_something_awesome( ) ; # void context my $ item = fetch_something_awesome ( ) ; # scalar context my @items = fetch_something_awesome ( ) ; # list context
Context gets a little bit trickier when you need to coerce what would normally be one context into another :
my ( $item ) = fetch_something_awesome ( ) ; # list context push @items , scalar fetch_something_awesome( ) ; # scalar context
If you know the visual cues ( if you do n't randomly sprinkle punctuation about your program until it works ) , those are easy to understand as well .
The subtlety comes when dealing with complex contexts , usually with nested expressions :
# list context , thanks to say say reverse $ name ; my % values = ( # list context , thanks to hash assignment name => get_name ( ) , rank => get_rank ( ) , ) ; # list context ( param flattening ) $ screen ->flip ( $ fleet->get_spaceships ( ) ) ;
This is often where more fair criticisms of Perl 5 suggest that context may not be worth it , because you have to understand what a line of code means and what it implies to read it correctly .
There 's a fair point there , but it 's also silly in some ways .
Skimming code which calls other functions may give you some idea of what those functions do , but you rely only on the names of those functions and not their documentation to tell you any other details .
Do they modify global or thread - local variables ?
Do they have caching or performance characteristics ?
Do they block ?
Do they require special initialization or error handling ?
Do they return special values ?
The valid point is that chaining multiple expressions into complex compound expressions can have interesting effects .
( I see this in Haskell code often ; invisible partial application means that I personally can't skim Haskell code without tracking down the arity of functions to figure out what happens where . )
A woman has been tortured by her neighbours for two days and forced to eat human waste before she finally gave in and confessed to practising witchcraft .
Those who beat , punched and kicked Kalli Biswokarma , 47 , accused her of casting evil spells on a schoolteacher who had fallen ill in the village of Pyutar , 40 kilometres south of Nepal 's capital , Kathmandu .
" I was victimised because I am a poor woman , " said Ms Biswokarma , who belongs to the Dalit community - the untouchables on the lowest rung of Nepal 's rigid Hindu caste hierarchy .
" Around 35 people came to my home and took me away .
They trapped me in a cow shed and forced me to eat faeces and drink urine .
" The next day they cut my skin with blades .
I could not bear the torture and I confessed to being a witch just to save my life . "
Hundreds of Dalit women are thought to suffer a similar ordeal every year in Nepal , where superstition and caste - based discrimination remain rife and where most communities still operate on strict patriarchal lines .
Human rights campaigners say the perpetrators of such crimes are rarely brought to justice , with police viewing the persecution of Dalit women as a matter for the community itself to sort out .
Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal has pronounced 2010 the year to end violence against women , but authorities in the impoverished nation admit they face an uphill struggle .
" Superstitions are deeply rooted in our society , and the belief in witchcraft is one of the worst forms of this , " said Sarwa Dev Prasad Ojha , minister for women and social welfare .
" Such traditional practices cannot be wiped away overnight . "
The Women 's Rehabilitation Centre says it has documented at least 82 cases in two years in which women who were tortured by neighbours on charges of witchcraft .
Experts say superstitions about witchcraft are often merely a pretext for victimising women .
For Ms Biswokarma and her family , now back in their home village after a stay in a women 's refuge in Kathmandu , the stigma of being accused of witchcraft persists .
" I am still afraid because some of the people who tortured me are still in the village , " she said .
" I have lost my dignity , but I have not given up hope .
I will fight for justice . "

The Internet is a flutter with a Gamesradar.com ’s twitter post that states that they will introduce a brand new PS3 exclusive first thing Monday morning .
The exact twitter post can be found after the jump .
“ Anyone interested in a World Exclusive PlayStation 3 announcement ?
Try 8 am UK time Monday 15 Feb on GamesRadar.com .. ”
The site is based out of England , which means the announcement will most likely be made during the middle of the night on Sunday for us States side .
Some rumors have been indicating this may be the first trailer for Resistance 3 , while others have said it could be anything from Killzone 3 , Infamous 2 , or just something brand new .
Only time can tell .
Any predictions EG’s ?
UPDATE :
The mystery reveal has turned out to be , surprisingly , not a game at all .
The Playstation 3 will now play host to a new , HD television show from the makers of Official Playstation Magazine .
“ FirstPlay , ” will launch next month on PSN , and be a weekly release of the familiar news / reviews / previews / interviews spread of content gamers have come to expect from print magazines .
The show will also offer exclusive demos and content , each individual section ( including screenshot galleries ) coming equipped with optional commentary .
Confirmed first for the UK market , gamers in PAL and other European regions can expect a delayed release to follow .
Those in the UK can pay 99p / week , or approximately 9 pounds for a three month subscription .
Gamers in the US should not expect the service to come to their side of the Atlantic , the US Playstation Store having a similar service in “ Qore . ”
Louisiana has the highest rates of incarceration of minors of any state in the country .
Louisiana has the highest incarceration rate per capita of any state in the country .
It has now become the first state to sue its own death row inmates :
via Solitary Watch .
The absurdity of this gesture is fitting for a policy that only ensures time and resources are wasted on arguing the merits for and against killing people for symbolic purposes .
Get beyond the obvious – that is that the state should n’t be involved in de-existing people – it seems the main conclusion to be drawn is that hundreds if not thousands of jobs rely on the self - indulged death - industry toying with the fate of death - rowers for decades .
It seems to me that victims , victims ’ families and those sentenced become a secondary concern ; an infrastructure of legal jousting imposes itself , acquires its own logic and fights it out because that what the cogs demand .
The results are laughably tragic deadlocks and bizarre gestures such as that of suing convicted individuals who are virtually powerless anyway .
My solution would not be to limit the legal avenues of appeal following conviction , it would be to abolish the death penalty as a sentencing option .
Just as the state should not be involved in killing people , it should not be involved in the retaliatory - posturing concerning the killing of people .

" Today we made that good law even better , " Reid said .
NOT A DONE DEAL YET : A LOOK AT THE BILL'S REVISIONS NOT A DONE DEAL YET : A LOOK AT THE BILL'S REVISIONS
The bill now before the Senate would make changes to the health care law signed by President Obama on Tuesday .
Some of those proposed changes : Enforcement : Adjusts the penalties on Americans who fail to buy health care insurance .
Almost everyone will be required to buy insurance .
The penalties will be gradually phased in , beginning Jan. 1 , 2014 .
Under the bill , the fine for not having insurance would start at $ 95 per person up to $ 285 per family , or 1 % of taxable household income , whichever is greater .
By 2016 , the penalty would be $ 695 for each family member up to $ 2,085 , or 2.5 % of taxable income .
Medicare prescription drugs : Provides more help for Medicare patients who have a gap in prescription - drug coverage .
It provides for a one - time , $ 250 rebate this year and a 50 % discount on brand - name prescription drugs , beginning in 2011 .
The coverage gap would be closed by 2020 .
Nebraska deal : Removes language that would have given Nebraska 100 % federal financing for newly eligible Medicaid recipients added to the program by the new law .
Instead , the measure makes more money available to all states to help offset the new costs .
Insurance plan tax : Delays the excise tax that would be imposed on high - cost health insurance plans and raises the threshold for when the tax would take effect .
Under the bill , a 40 % excise tax would be delayed until 2018 , and would be imposed on health care plans that cost more than $ 10,200 for individuals and $ 27,500 for families .
Unearned income tax : Imposes a 3.8 % tax on unearned income for individuals earning more than $ 200,000 a year and families making more than $ 250,000 .
The money would help fund Medicare .
Student loans :
Requires the government to originate student loans , closing out a role for banks and other private lenders who charge a fee .
The savings -- projected to be more than $ 60 billion over a decade -- are plowed into higher Pell Grants for needy college students and increased support for historically black and Hispanic colleges .
Medicaid payments : Increases payments to primary care physicians under Medicaid .
( c ) USA TODAY WASHINGTON  Congress sent to President Obama a set of revisions to the new health care law on Thursday that will expand health care to 95 % of Americans " Today we made that good law even better , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. Sen. Judd Gregg , R - N.H. , countered that the changes only made " bad health care policy worse , adding more spending , taxes , gimmicks and debt to the new health care law without insuring any more people . "
The Senate voted first Thursday , 56 - 43 , approving changes that were part of a deal made when the House passed the nearly $ 940 billion legislation on Sunday .
Three Democrats — Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska — voted " no " with 40 Republicans .
The House then approved the bill 220 - 207 , getting only get Democratic votes as it did earlier in the week .
HISTORY : The health care bill 's 8 key moments THREATS :
House leaders decry threats , dish out blame TIMELINE : Key moments on road to health care PRESIDENT : Obama returns to Iowa
The new law , signed by the president on Tuesday , offers health care to 32 million uninsured people , prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and offers subsidies to make coverage more affordable .
Some House Democrats agreed to support the bill on a promise that the Senate would pass some changes .
The revisions passed by Congress : • Closed a gap in prescription - drug coverage for seniors under Medicare by increasing drug benefits .
• Eliminated a deal to give Nebraska more money for Medicaid , the federal - state program for the poor , that was aimed at getting Nelson 's vote in December , when the Senate passed the original health care bill .
• Delayed a tax on high - priced insurance plans until 2018 .
To stall passage of the changes , Senate Republicans offered 41 amendments as part of what was known as a " vote - a- rama " that had senators voting until 2 a.m.
Thursday and then again during daylight hours .
The bill went back to the House because of an unrelated measure attached to it dealing with Pell Grants for low - income college students .
Reid called it a " legislative fight that will be in the record books . "
Shortly before the final vote , however , the senators paused together for a moment of silence to honor late senator Edward Kennedy , D - Mass . , who fought for health care for the poor and uninsured for nearly five decades in the Senate .
He died in August .
Retiring Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , said the new law means
Americans will no longer have to fear financial ruin from a health care crisis .
" You 've waited a long time for this , " he said .
" You 're finally going to have that freedom from fear . "
Kennedy 's replacement , however , said the costly bill would only further damage the economy .
Sen. Scott Brown , R - Mass. , who won a special election in January to replace Kennedy , said the legislation will " hurt jobs and the economy , " and vowed to work to repeal portions of it .

Simple works
For the past four years , Thornley Fallis has had a simple , two sentence online communications policy : “ Be smart .
Cause no harm to any person . ”
This simple policy has served us well .
We had only a few bumps – and we learned from each one .
This policy worked because we have many people who are active in social media and they are steeped in the blogging culture .
They understand the importance of transparency , authenticity and generosity .
They also understand the power of search and the permanence of what we put on the Web .
New people .
New needs
A few months ago , we updated the Thornley Fallis and 76design Websites .
In doing this , we introduced new Twitter feeds for both Thornley Fallis and 76design .
We also created a page on our corporate Website that displays the current conversations our employees are having in social media .
Each employee has their own page on which they can display whatever social media and information they want to share .
They can add their personal blog feeds , links to their Facebook pages , Twitter streams , Linked In profiles – whatever social media they wanted .
I soon realized that our employees are generating much more social media traffic than I had been aware of .
I also realized that not everyone spends as much time thinking about social media best practices as Dave Fleet or Terry Fallis might .
So , it ’s time to take a second look at our online communications policy to be sure that it provides basic guidance for new employees and others new to social media and our perspective on its culture .
Under the hood
In refining our policy , I wanted it to be written in plain language .
I also did n’t want to be so prescriptive that people would feel the need to refer to it constantly .
And , bottom line , I respect the intelligence of the people I work with and trust their judgment .
So , how to draft a policy that provides essential guidance but still puts the onus on people to exercise good judgment ?
The answer , in my mind , is to ground the policy and guidelines in a clear statement of our objectives – why we are active in social media .
Having stated this , I ’m comfortable encouraging people to post freely if they know that their actions contribute to the achievement of our objectives .
If they are n’t sure or feel that their posts / actions may actually detract from those objectives , then I suggest that they do n’t post it .
It in doubt , I ask people to consult a colleague before proceeding .
Having spelled out this general framework , I needed only a handful of specific guidelines .
I posted the policy on our Internal Wiki and asked for comments .
I received some good feedback from several people , including Jeremy Wright , Dave Fleet and Bradley Moseley - Williams .
So , here ’s the first draft of our new online communications policy .
What do you think of it ?
Have we missed something important ?
Would it work for your organization ?
— — — — ——
Thornley Fallis Online Communications Policy
This policy is intended to provide us with practical guidelines that we can apply to ensure that our online actions and communications will make a positive contribution to our reputation as individuals and members of the Thornley Fallis & 76design team .
You ’re always one of us
Each of us represents the company to the world and the character of the company is defined by our beliefs and actions .
We must be mindful of this when participating in social media and any kind of online communications .
You may be active in social media on your own account .
That ’s good .
But please remember that whether you are on your own time or company time , you ’re still a member of our team .
And the judgment you exercise on your own time reflects on the judgment you exercise at work .
There ’s only one you – at play and at work .
Our Objectives
First , when participating in social media , please always be mindful of why we are involved in social media .
Our company ’s objectives are :
To educate ourselves .
To contribute to our community by sharing our knowledge with others .
( We believe in the culture of generosity and recognize that we should contribute more to the community than we take out . )
To attract talented people
To attract sophisticated clients
As a first step in deciding whether to write or post something online , ask yourself if doing so would contribute to the achievement of these objectives .
If so , then publish away .
If your post would be at odds with these objectives , please do not post it .
Guidelines
Of course , sometimes , it ’s nice to have some simple , plain language guidelines to point the way .
So , here are some basic rules for day to day conduct .
Cause no harm to any person .
Be respectful and civil in your tone .
( After all , that ’s the kind of people we are . )
Respect our clients ’ right to decide for themselves what they want to make public .
Unless they specifically grant us permission , do not post about client wins or client assignments .
Be transparent .
If you are posting about a client or commenting on a client competitor or posting about anything in which we may have a material interest , disclose the relationship or interest .
Still in doubt ?
If you ’re still in doubt , seek out the counsel of one of you colleagues .
Two sets of eyes are better than one .
A five - year official study of the Allied bombing of Dresden in World War II has concluded that as many as 25,000 people died , far fewer than most historians have estimated , the BBC reports .
The study by The Dresden Historians ' Commission was aimed at ending a heated debate on the casualty figure from the raid on the German city by British and American warplanes Feb. 13 -15 , 1945 .
Far - right groups in Germany have claimed that the attack and ensuing firestorm killed up to 500,000 people and constituted a war crime .
The Telegraph in Britain says the bombing has long been a cause of tensions between the two countries and noted that protesters demanding an apology threw eggs at Queen Elizabeth II when she visited the city in 1992 .
The commission used records from city archives , cemeteries and other official registries as well as eyewitness and published reports , the BBC says .

Have you ever wondered how a bike saddle is made ?
It just plops out of a replicator or something , right ?
If that seat is a handcrafted Brooks saddle , then the answer is " no . "
Gadget Lab reader Graham Glen was lucky enough to get a tour of the Brooks factory in Smethwick ( in the West Midlands in England ) , and he snapped some photos of the goings - on there , which he has very generously allowed us to use here .
The thing that strikes me is the simplicity of the process .
Metal parts are stamped out and heat - treated , flat pieces of leather are soaked and then formed in molds and the parts are all assembled by hand .
After seeing how much work goes into a single bike seat , these famously expensive saddles start to look cheap .
Follow along for a tour of the factory .
Wire is fed into a machine and is quickly twizzled into springs .
These become the " suspension " on some of the more comfortable models .
These pieces are stamped out , cookie - cutter style , ready for the next stage ...
The flat metal plates are stamped and bent to turn them into the rear saddle support .
This is where the rails join on , and – on the final seat – the part that you see riveted to the leather upper .
After this , they are heat - treated and separated , either for painting or plating .
From another machine come the saddle rails , which runs from front to back and join onto the seat post .
The leather is cut by hand .
Graham says
" It takes a very skilled human eye to decide where to cut the saddle top from , both to ensure optimum use of the hide and to get the correct softness . "
Saddle tops wait to be formed .
After a thorough soaking , the leather is pressed in these blocks into its final shape , ready for assembly and finishing .
The logo goes on , to make sure people know how much you spent .
Everything is put together by hand , from the adjustment bolt in the nose to the rivets at the back .
The finished item is ready to support somebody 's butt for the rest of their life .
If you want to see more of Graham 's excellent photographs , head over to his Picasa gallery , and read his account of the tour .

Robert M. White was a 38 - year - old U.S. Air Force major and record - setting test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in 1962 when he joined the elite ranks of America ’s four astronauts .
But Mercury astronauts Alan Shepard , Virgil Grissom , John Glenn and Scott Carpenter went into space seated atop ballistic missiles and returned in capsules that parachuted onto the ocean .
White did it as the pilot of a rocket - powered X - 15 research airplane , flying nearly 60 miles above the Earth ’s surface and completing a conventional landing on Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards Air Force Base .
His out - of - this - world adventure earned him the distinction of being the first man to earn a winged astronaut rating by piloting an airplane in space .
White , a retired Air Force major general who also was a decorated veteran of World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars , died of age - related causes in his sleep March 17 at an assisted - living facility in Orlando , Fla. , said his son , Greg .
He was 85 .

“ He lived his whole life , it seems , on the edge of danger , and he died so peacefully , ” said Greg White .
Jim Young , chief historian at the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base , said White was “ one of the major icons in aerospace history . ”
“ It ’s been so many years since his achievements , ” Young said , “ but they were extraordinary and remain extraordinary to this day . ”
A 1954 graduate of what is now the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base ,
White became the first lead Air Force project pilot for the X - 15 flight research program that was launched by NASA , the Air Force and the Navy .
The first flight was in 1958 .

During an eight - month span in 1961 , White achieved three milestones .
On March 7 , 1961 , he became the first pilot to exceed Mach 4 , attaining a top speed of 2,905 mph .
On June 23 , 1961 , he became the first pilot to exceed Mach 5 , recording a speed of 3,603 mph .
And on Nov. 9 , 1961 , during the first full - throttle flight of the X - 15 , he became the first pilot to exceed Mach 6 , attaining a top speed of 4,094 mph .

Then , on July 17 , 1962 , White flew the X - 15 to an altitude of 314,750 feet -- 59.6 miles above Earth .
“ This is a fantastic view , ” he reportedly radioed while flying weightless .
He said after landing that it was too cloudy to see the ocean , “ but I could see the coastline of the Western United States from well above San Francisco Bay down into Mexico . ”
Calling him “ the nation ’s newest space hero , ” Life magazine featured a photo of White on its cover greeting son Greg , then 7 , after the flight .
Said the headline : “ Boy , That Was a Ride . ”

At a 1962 ceremony on the White House South Lawn , President Kennedy presented what had been called the nation ’s most treasured aviation award , the Robert J. Collier Trophy , to White and three fellow X - 15 pilots .
The X - 15 was the forerunner of the space shuttle , whose first orbital flight was in 1981 .
“ They were flying during a remarkable period in the history of flight , ” Young said of the X - 15 pilots .
“ When Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier at Mach 1 in the Bell X - 1 [ in 1947 ] , he flew at about 700 miles per hour .
“ Just over 14 years later , Bob White is flying at Mach 6 and just over 4,000 miles per hour .
It was an extraordinary time at Edwards Air Force Base , ” Young said .

In his book “ The Right Stuff , ” Tom Wolfe described the handsome , nondrinking , churchgoing White as “ the eternally correct and reserved Air Force blue - suiter . ”
Young said White “ was quiet and unassuming , and a very thoughtful guy .
He never let the press clippings and all the attention go to his head . ”
Born July 6 , 1924 , in New York City ,
White became an Army Air Forces cadet in 1942 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant .
He served with the 355th Fighter Group in Europe , where he was shot down over Germany in 1945 and became a prisoner of war .

During the Korean War , he served as a fighter pilot and flight commander with the 40th Fighter Squadron based in Japan .

Study explains why light worsens migraine headaches
Ask anyone who suffers from migraine headaches what they do when they 're having an attack , and you 're likely to hear " go into a dark room . "
And although it 's long been known that light makes migraines worse , the reason why has been unclear .
Now scientists at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) have identified a new visual pathway that underlies sensitivity to light during migraine in both blind individuals and in individuals with normal eyesight .
The findings , which appear today in the Advance On- line issue of Nature Neuroscience , help explain the mechanism behind this widespread condition .
A one - sided , throbbing headache associated with a number of symptoms , including nausea , vomiting , and fatigue , migraines are notoriously debilitating and surprisingly widespread , affecting more than 30 million individuals in the U.S. alone .
Migraine pain is believed to develop when the meninges , the system of membranes surrounding the brain and central nervous system , becomes irritated , which stimulates pain receptors and triggers a series of events that lead to the prolonged activation of groups of sensory neurons .
" This explains the throbbing headache and accompanying scalp and neck - muscle tenderness experienced by many migraine patients , " explains the study 's senior author Rami Burstein , PhD , Professor of Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine at BIDMC and Harvard Medical School .
In addition , for reasons that were unknown , nearly 85 percent of migraine patients are also extremely sensitive to light , a condition known as photophobia .
" Migraine patients may wear sunglasses , even at night , " he notes , adding that the dimmest of light can make migraine pain worse .
Extremely disabling , photophobia prevents patients from such routine activities as reading , writing , working or driving .
It was the observation that even blind individuals who suffer from migraines were experiencing photophobia that led Burstein and first author Rodrigo Noseda , PhD , to hypothesize that signals transmitted from the retina via the optic nerve were somehow triggering the intensification of pain .
The investigators studied two groups of blind individuals who suffer migraine headaches .
Patients in the first group were totally blind due to eye diseases such as retinal cancer and glaucoma ; they were unable to see images or to sense light and therefore could not maintain normal sleep - wake cycles .
Patients in the second group were legally blind due to retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa ; although they were unable to perceive images , they could detect the presence of light and maintain normal sleep - wake cycles .
" While the patients in the first group did not experience any worsening of their headaches from light exposure , the patients in the second group clearly described intensified pain when they were exposed to light , in particular blue or gray wavelengths , " explains Burstein .
" This suggested to us that the mechanism of photophobia must involve the optic nerve , because in totally blind individuals , the optic nerve does not carry light signals to the brain .
" We also suspected that a group of recently discovered retinal cells containing melanopsin photoreceptors [ which help control biological functions including sleep and wakefulness ] is critically involved in this process , because these are the only functioning light receptors left among patients who are legally blind . "
The scientists took these ideas to the laboratory , where they performed a series of experiments in an animal model of migraine .
After injecting dyes into the eye , they traced the path of the melanopsin retinal cells through the optic nerve to the brain , where they found a group of neurons that become electrically active during migraine .
" When small electrodes were inserted into these ' migraine neurons , ' we discovered that light was triggering a flow of electrical signals that was converging on these very cells , " says Burstein .
" This increased their activity within seconds . "
And even when the light was removed , he notes , these neurons remained activated .
" This helps explain why patients say that their headache intensifies within seconds after exposure to light , and improves 20 to 30 minutes after being in the dark . "
The discovery of this pathway provides scientists with a new avenue to follow in working to address the problem of photophobia .
" Clinically , this research sets the stage for identifying ways to block the pathway so that migraine patients can endure light without pain , " adds Burstein .
On March 3 , 2010 , the life of Anatoliy Alekseyevich Petrov came to an end .
Here was a person who was labeled a genius during his lifetime , who was linked to the future of our domestic animation , and of whom , to this day , few have heard .
While studying at animation courses , he was already creating scenes the level of which his classmates dreamed of reaching just one time .
From the first years of his practice at the studio , the classical masters of animation invited Petrov into their groups , giving him priority over the most authoritative masters of the old generation .
When he himself became a director , some colleagues were ready to " go all the way to the District Party Committee " , in order to get themselves a place as animators in Petrov 's group .
He managed scenes that required the most difficult perspective foreshortening , conquering any stylistic convention - from primitive " hieroglyphs " to ultra-realistic figures .
He himself was drawn toward the latter .
He was the rare animator who could solve acting problems that required not the grotesque , but heroism , or even pathos .
He was a universalist who could do anything .
His " heights " as an animator were scenes for Atamanov 's " The Bench " ( the dance of the youths to the music of " The Beatles " , scenes with the homeless man , and others ) , keyframes for Andrey Khrzhanovskiy 's film " There Lived Kozyavin " , the role of the Ballerina in " Ballerina On a Ship " and the grandpa in " The Key " ( both also directed by Atamanov ) , the most difficult acting scenes in Roman Davydov 's " Shareholders " , in Vladimir Polkovnikov 's " The King 's Rabbits " , in the films of Boris Dyozhkin , Fyodor Khitruk , Boris Stepantsev , Vitold Bordzilovskiy ...
And at the same time , Petrov could easily portray the quarrel of two dogs in Atamanov 's " The Fence " or virtuosically play the strongman who juggled weights in " The Vacation of Bonifacius " ( one of his best scenes , ruined after the transfer of the drawings into the technique of cutout animation ) .
Anatoliy Petrov had exceptional technical skills from childhood .
He himself equipped his home photo studio , designed a variety of mechanical toys , manufactured a homemade slide projector ... at the courses for animation artists , he and Galina Barinova were almost the only ones who paid serious attention to film technology , and lessons about cinematography and special effects .
No wonder that it was he ( as well as Yuriy Norshteyn ) who was destined to achieve a technological revolution in animated film production , to develop a few techniques that had no analogues in the world .
He was the first to paint backgrounds on celluloid , introduced and perfected many times the legendary technology of " photographica " , developed the simple and ingenious way to separate the contour from the colour fill ... Returning in 1967 from training in Zagreb , Petrov officially made his debut as director .
" The Singing Teacher " in the anthology " Kaleidoscope " quickly became one of the unspoken artistic manifestos of the " Soyuzmultfilm Youth " .
It was also one of the first of Petrov 's technological experiments - this method of combining pencil drawings on whatman paper with backgrounds was not yet known by our animation profession .
If only one episode remained in Petrov 's biography - his founding of the animated journal " The Merry Carousel " , - this would have already been enough to forever enter his name into the history of animation .
It was none other than Petrov who was the leader of the group of young animators who so powerfully and clearly declared themselves in the late 1960s - Leonid Nosyrev , Valeriy Ugarov , Gennadiy Sokolskiy , Galina Barinova ...
He was the initiator , developer of the concept of the anthology , and the most promising author .
Although he resembled the role of the leader the least .
He never had the ability or the desire to assert himself , especially to advertise ; do " PR " .
When censorship killed his best work , he made no objections and did not resist , but meekly retreated and complied with all requirements .
An artist - recluse , he was akin to the medieval masters , seeking to " dissolve " in their works and to remain anonymous and nameless .
He himself dreamed of " secret " creativity , of the life of a hermit who worked for his own pleasure .
He was a fanatic illustrator .
An artist for whom drawing was not bread , but air .
He despised neither drawing , nor inbetweening .
And at the same time , he coined that fair formula : " In a good animator , the artist must die " .
Yuriy Norshteyn admitted that any one of Petrov 's layouts was worthy of display in a Museum of Fine Arts .
And Yevgeniy Sivokon remembered standing , with bated breath , behind Petrov , as he animated Mayakovsky 's head turning 90 degrees for the film " Mayakovsky Laughs " .
It was like magic - Petrov drew the smallest change of angle as if in front of his eyes were countless photographs of Mayakovsky , observing perfect portrait likeness in each figure .
Much later , Anatoliy Alekseyevich revealed the " secret " of this magic trick - before beginning his work , he spent a long time walking around the bust of the poet in the Moscow Metro , memorizing every position , mentally " photographing " all the details ... Petrov always considered the nature of animation to be the art of drawn movement .
He thought long about this topic , and tried to consolidate in practice that rule which he considered one of the most significant : for every stylistic visual decision , one must search for a " key " of movement specific to it .
A drawing in the style of Picasso cannot move by the rules of a drawing in the style of Bidstrup .
Or a drawing in Dali 's style by the rules of the works of Miro .
This was what consumed Petrov , when he worked on his first story for " The Merry Carousel " , " Scatterbrained Giovanni " .
This story , which became one of the main targets for the new generation of filmmakers in the studio , was honored with the following rating from Minister Romanov : " an attempt to use the platform of children 's animation to promote abstractionism " .
For Petrov , this rating was very honorable .
Petrov 's next works , " Blue Meteorite " , " The Merry Old Man " , " The Wonder " ( the last two were ruined by censorship ) , the film " And Mother Will Forgive Me Too " , and the plan - destroyed in Goskino - of an animated cartoon - journal for schoolchildren called " Merry Link " - confirmed Petrov 's leading role in drawn animation of those years .
In the second half of the 1970s , journalists writing about " Soyuzmultfilm " mentioned Yuriy Norshteyn and Anatoliy Petrov in first place as the most promising persons .
One of Petrov 's qualities as director was perfect knowledge of the material .
If he was filming a story called " Little Light " for " Merry Carousel " , then it would show deep - sea fauna in all its richness and with maximum accuracy .
If he adapted " Solnyshkin 's Voyage " for the screen - it is unlikely that even professional sailors could find fault with the images of rigging and cargo ship construction .
Geologists who have seen the film " And Mother Will Forgive Me Too " , asked : " How does the director know drilling rigs so well ? "
Galina Barinova 's script for her film " Jester Balakirev " required immersion in folklore and life at the time of Peter the Great , and the " Ancient Greece " series made Petrov a specialist in antiquity .
And if the conception was of some kind of educational movie - the plot of " The Merry Link " or the screenplay for Ugarov 's future film " At the Back Row " - the job would not be complete without a thorough study of literature in physics , mathematics , chemistry ...
But that was not the main thing .
As director , Petrov was also an outlier .
Many directors in their work tried to prove this or that " theorem " .
Everyone had his own .
Sometimes , several at once .
Petrov " denied axioms " .
He defied the laws of nature .
In this particular case - the nature of animation .
For every animator , the indisputable postulate has always been that animation is best suited for conventionalization and worst suited for realism .
Animation 's task is not to compete with the natural image , but only to turn it into a parody .
Petrov hit at this fundamental , self - evident position .
He proved , moreover , in practice , that a real Artist is capable - with his own hands , without any help such as photos , location filming or technical aids - of creating a realistic protagonist on the screen , the authenticity of whose acting will be comparable to an actor in live - action cinema .
Already in the 1970s he proposed this unprecedented - for - the - animator task : " to overcome live - action film " .
To extend the boundaries of animation , to prove that it can do even THIS .
Most colleagues declared it a dead - end road .
After the theatrical release of " Firing Range " , voices were raised : what was this feat needed for ?
Yes , it 's great , it is exceptional and unprecedented , but it is , after all , not repeatable !
This can be done only by one man - " and he will not leave us an heir " !
What 's the point ?
Nobody seemed not to notice that a Miracle had occurred .
That a man , not having wings , ran up and took off .
And overcame the laws of physics and biomechanics .
And after all that , heard the question raised :
Why fly , if it 's more convenient to walk or run ?.. Another problem that Anatoliy Petrov solved before anyone in the world was creating the effect of a moving painting .
Of course , the technology of painted animation had existed before .
But before Petrov , all had tried to " move the brushstrokes " , and only Petrov decided to try to " move the glaze " .
To reach in a drawing the full effect of light streamlining the figure , and to see what happens with this figure , if it will change angle , turn its back , become alive ...
Petrov solved this problem by using only traditional animation materials - celluloid , inked contours , animation paint .
The not - quite - accurate name " photographica " , which became attached to Petrov 's technology , should preferably be replaced by " graphic painting " .
Viewers described these films as being " computer " or " laser " , not believing that they were made at a typical animation desk .
Even now , most professionals ( excluding those who had seen the filming with their own eyes ) do not realize how it was done .
The high point of these artistic searches was the film " Heracles Visits Admetus " .
A masterpiece of animation possessed of an extraordinary spiritual power .
A film the creation of which took nearly four years .
Even at the start of production , the veteran animator F.S. Khitruk did not believe that the animator would prove able to take on such a hellish work of moving sculptures in the frame and offered to search for a different stylistic decision .
But Petrov again decided to " sprint for the record " .
This time , it was a real battle .
Petrov had already seen that other creative workers of the studio were not too fond of " exertion " and jumping higher than their head .
Here , the majority of animators and artists of the craft proved unequal to the level of graphical excellence possessed by Petrov himself .
He struggled with [ FC ] , with the tracing , with the filling , with cinematographical and laboratory arbitrariness , trying to achieve only one thing - Quality .
Each frame was achieved by overcoming incredible resistance .
Help from specialized departments had to be abandoned , the group was reduced to just a few people , deadlines were postponed many times , the director had to again and again prove to officials that such a film was even necessary .
On top of that , the plan underwent three different edits and the film came out lacking a few key episodes and practically unfinished ... But this feat , too , was accomplished .
" Heracles Visits Admetus " remains the pinnacle that has not yet been conquered by any other director of animation .
Even decades later , directors working in the technology of 3 - D , possessing technical capabilities incomparable with Petrov 's , could not achieve such accurate , on - screen , living " volumetric " cartoon characters , which Anatoliy Petrov fought for with his golden hands ...
And the scene in which Heracles leads the rescued Alcestis to Admetus , you can safely show in theatre and film studies as an example of impeccable acting .
Petrov did not set further such tasks for himself .
Although four more films were made and a new filming technology invented and perfected , it was rather the " tail end " of what was already accomplished .
Petrov remained a brilliant animator and graphic artist , still performed all operations by hand , but no longer aimed for new peaks .
When Anatoliy Alekseyevich was asked why he finally settled on the style of hyper - realism , he would answer : how else can an artist convey the richness of the nature surrounding him ?
All the beauty of the sea or mountain landscape ?
How , with stylistic methods of art , can you make viewers believe that a drawn protagonist moving into the depths of the frame is filled with tragic thoughts about life and death ?
It is no exaggeration to say that Petrov assumed the role of the Demiurge in the full sense of the word ; he knew that he was unable to compete with nature , and still tried to get closer to this result .
Are there many people in animation today who are ready to set such goals ?
The very same Petrov said that the best situation for an artist is to be as " equidistant " from all political parties as from all religions .
To try to maintain calmness and objectivity .
His last few years were difficult attempts to find one to whom he could pass on his experience , skill and vision of the nature of animation .
These attempts proved almost fruitless .
Many of his students refused to understand why the animator had to draw well and know anatomy , if the technology of " Flash animation " existed , and ignorantly called his masterly scenes from " Firing Range " " Éclair " [ " rotoscoping " ] .
They were not even able to understand that it is precisely with " rotoscoping " that this effect can not be achieved .
That this can only be done with Golden Hands and Great Experience .
Before his death , Petrov managed to write and illustrate a three - volume textbook on animation .
This textbook , probably , was his last creative work .
Will there ever appear anyone who will need it ?
Today , the name of Anatoliy Petrov means something to just a few people .
In addition to the professionals who worked with him at one time .
Sooner or later this name will be on a par with the names of Vladislav Starevich , Alexander Alexeyev , Yuriy Norshteyn ...
But for now - almost no one will notice that the land has been deprived of another genius ...--- Links .
A few films .
" The Singing Teacher " ( 1968 ) " Firing Range " ( 1977 ) " Heracles Visits Admetus " ( 1986 ) ( 16/04/2010 update : here is a subtitled version of the film : ) Notes .
Wikipedia describes the " photographica " technique in the following manner : " two celluloid layers for each character with special color schemes and with one of the layers out of focus to imitate the three - dimensional space rendering " .
Petrov 's decision to focus on " Greek erotica " in his later films was not exactly welcomed by everyone , which may be why he's not now as well as known as some of his contemporaries .
His last four films are decisively adults - only .
Tesco shopper , 24 , forced to show ID ... because she was ' too young to buy slice of QUICHE '
Usually the only thing you need to eat quiche is a hearty appetite .
But according to Tesco you should be over 21 too .
At least that 's what the checkout cashier told Christine Cuddihy when she took a 51 p slice of cheese and onion quiche from the deli to the till .
Daft : Christine Cuddihy , 24 , holds up a cheese and onion quiche .
She was asked to provide ID to prove she was old enough to buy a 51 p slice from Tesco
CAN I SEE SOME ID ?
OTHER BARMY REQUESTS
Tony Ralls , 72 , asked if old enough to buy bottle of wine in Morrisons in Liverpool
Ellie Hargreaves , 28 , asked for ID to buy child 's Ben 10 advent calender in Debenhams , Blackburn
Grandmother Tina MacNaughton - Jones , 47 , refused a bottle of wine in a Waitrose supermarket in Worthing , West Sussex - because she could not prove she was over 18 .
Her 22 - year - old daughter then produced a driver 's licence to buy the bottle but she , too , was turned down over fears that she would pass the alcohol on to her mother
At first , the 24 - year - old office worker thought the cashier was joking when she refused to let the sale go through because she ' looked under 21 ' .
Eventually , as the shoppers queueing behind her grew restless , an embarrassed Miss Cuddihy had to produce her driving licence to prove her age .
' The girl told me : " You do n't look over 21 .
I need to see some proof of age " , ' she said .
' I told her I was certain the proof of age laws do not apply to quiche but she just said : " We have to be really strict now and this applies to quiche bought over the counter " .
' It was very embarrassing , what on earth is dangerous about a slice of quiche ?
' There was nothing suspicious about me and it's not even like I was buying a whole quiche to binge on .
' It was rush - hour and the shop was really busy .
I was so insulted that they thought I could n't be trusted with a harmless snack . '
The incident happened at the Tesco store in Cannons Park , Coventry on January 21 .
Miss Cuddihy , from nearby Leamington Spa , was on her way home from work when she popped in to buy the quiche for her supper .
The Tesco store in Coventry where Christine was asked for ID .
The company is at a loss to explain why this happened
But she ended up getting into a humiliating argument with the cashier , a woman in her mid 30s , as well .
' I was really embarrassed and just wanted to get out of the shop , ' she recalled .
' There was a queue forming behind me so I just showed her my driving licence and rushed out .
' I was so hungry that I did n't even bother kicking up a fuss or complaining to the manager .
I just wanted the quiche .
' The irony of the whole thing is that I 've bought alcohol from there dozens of times without being asked for ID .
' I 've racked my brains to come up with an explanation but I can't find one .
The whole thing is ridiculous .
Yesterday Tesco apologised for the incident .
A spokesman for the supermarket said shoppers did not have to prove their age to buy quiche .
' We 're at a loss to say what happened here , ' the spokesman said .
' We could n't find the staff member who asked for the ID .
' Age - related prompts at till are set centrally and there obviously is n't one on quiche . '

Wow .
Does n't the NY Times have some of the world 's most famous and accomplished economists writing for them at times ?
You would think that , at some point , as they tried to figure out business model ideas , they would think to actually run some of these ideas by an economist .
We 've already explained why the NYT 's decision to put up a paywall makes little sense from an economic standpoint , but now it 's getting even worse .
You see , there are still some folks who bizarrely believe that tablet computers -- or , really , just Apple 's iPad -- represent the savior for journalism because suddenly people will pay for apps .
Already , this suggests a rather tragic misunderstanding of the economics of apps , but apparently it 's even worse than that .
Rumors are flying that there 's a battle within the NY Times on how totheir app for the iPad .
Those on the newspaper side of the house apparently believe that it should be priced at $ 20 to $ 30 / month to avoid cannibalizing the print product .
By the way , if you want a simple tip for how to fail at business , it 's to make a decision to avoid cannibalizing your own business .
When you do , you 've just made it clear that a competitor is going to cannibalize your business for you .
The folks on the interactive side of the house think that $ 10 / month makes a lot more sense and believe that pricing it at the $ 20 to $ 30 range is suicidal .
Of course , if you thought that the management at the NYT's was really crafty , you might believe that this whole story was floated to reset the anchor price , though I have trouble believing that 's true .
The problem , of course , is that the NY Times is pricing based not just on trying not to cannibalize the physical product , but without regards to basic economics , and the fact that everyonethat without a physical product , the costs of the paper actually go down .
Yes , of course the costs of all the reporting and editing remain -- no one is denying that .
But you no longer have the printing and delivery costs , which are substantial .
And reasonable people would expect that , at the very least , the cost of the app will reflect that .
Either that , or ( more likely ) , they 'll realize that other , more well managed news providers will step in and offer up news for free in order to get the market share that the NY Times once had .
Oh , and one final word for the NY Times .
I recognize that you 're a better paper , with a much better reputation , than your neighboring competitor , Newsday , but remember what happened when Newsday tried to charge $ 20 + per month for access to its digital version ?
It got a grand total of 35 people to sign up .
I 'm sure more would sign up for a NY Times ' app , but how many more ?

The State of PostgreSQL : Not So Easy to Kill
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 07 , 2010
If you follow open source news at all , it 's been pretty hard to ignore MySQL the last few months .
With a desperate campaign to stop Oracle gobbling up MySQL , the FLOSS poster database has been front and center .
As usual , the PostgreSQL community has been quietly coding away and working on the 8.5 release scheduled for the first quarter of 2010 .
However , one of Monty Widenius ' arguments about the vulnerability of PostgreSQL has caught the attention of the PostgreSQL community .
In a comment on OStatic , Widenius says that " PostgreSQL can also be killed " by a company like Oracle :
Yes , PostgreSQL can also be killed ;
To prove the case , think what would happen if someone managed to ensure that the top 20 core PostgreSQL developers could not develop PostgreSQL anymore or if each of these developers would fork their own PostgreSQL project .
Greg Sabino Mullane , posting on the End Point Blog , points out how silly that argument is :
The catch comes from being able to actually stop 20 of those people from working on Postgres .
There are basically two ways to do this :
Oracle could buy out a company , or they could hire ( buy out ) a person .
The first problem is that the Postgres community is very widely distributed .
If you look at the people on the community contributors page , you 'll see that the 32 people work for 24 different companies .
Further , no one company holds sway : the median is one company , and the high water mark is a mere three developers .
All of this is much better than it was years ago , in the total number and in the distribution .
In fact , PostgreSQL as a project is pretty healthy , and shows how vulnerable projects like MySQL are to the winds of change .
PostgreSQL could die tomorrow , if a huge group of its contributors dropped out for one reason or another and the remainder of the community did n't take up the slack .
But that 's exceedingly unlikely .
The existing model for PostgreSQL development ensures that no single entity can control it , it can't be purchased and if someone decides to fork the project , the odds are that the remaining community would be strong enough to continue without a serious glitch .
It 's not to say that every FLOSS project that 's controlled by a single entity will go the way of MySQL .
But what 's happened to MySQL could happen to other projects where one company holds control over the project .
Something to think about when deciding what projects to work with , adopt , and depend on in 2010 .
Joe ' Zonker ' Brockmeier is a longtime FLOSS advocate , and currently works for Novell as the community manager for openSUSE .

The MBA reports : Mortgage Applications Drop the Week of Christmas and Remain Flat the Week After
The Mortgage Bankers Association ( MBA ) today released its Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the weeks ending December 25 , 2009 and January 1 , 2010 .
For the week ending December 25 , 2009 , the Market Composite Index , a measure of mortgage loan application volume , decreased 22.8 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from the prior week .
For the week ending January 1 , 2010 , this index increased 0.5 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis .
...
For the week ending December 25 , 2009 , the Refinance Index decreased 30.5 percent from the previous week and the seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreased 4.0 percent from one week earlier .
The following week , the Refinance Index decreased 1.6 percent and the seasonally adjusted Purchase Index increased 3.6 percent .
...
For the week ending January 1 , 2010 , the average contract interest rate for 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages increased to 5.18 percent with points decreasing to 1.28 .

This graph shows the MBA Purchase Index and four week moving average since 1990 .
Note :
In the past the MBA index was somewhat predictive of future sales - and was a favorite indicator of Alan Greenspan , but it has been questionable for some time .
The increase in 2007 was due to the method used to construct the index : a combination of lender failures , and borrowers filing multiple applications pushed up the index in 2007 even though activity was actually declining .
Recently there has been a substantial number of cash buyers , so the MBA index missed the strength of the recent existing home sales increase .
Despite the problems , it is hard to ignore the sharp decline in purchase applications since mid-October .
The four week moving average is now at the lowest level since November 1997 .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The Taliban 's top military leader , Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , has been captured , a senior administration official told CNN late Monday .
This is a " huge deal , " CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said .
" This guy ... is the number two political figure in the Taliban " in addition to being the group 's top military commander .
Baradar was captured several days ago in a secret joint operation by Pakistani and American intelligence forces in Karachi , Pakistan , according to American government officials , the New York Times reported .
So besides the millions of dollars of lobbyist money from Wall Street , what ’s stopping this ?
The Democrats are nuts and will deserve a thrashing in the elections if they blow this one .
Of course , they will blow it and they will be thrashed .
The Democrats simply do n’t have the stomach for a fight that everyone outside of Wall Street wants .
Why should anyone support a party that fears an issue that is so popular ?
An overwhelming majority of Americans wants Wall Street subjected to tougher regulation in the aftermath of the bank bailout and the bonus scandals that have rocked the U.S. financial sector , according to a Harris poll released on Thursday .
The findings suggest that 82 percent of Americans want the government to clamp down more strongly on Wall Street excesses , with a particular emphasis on bonus schemes that have rewarded employees at loss - making companies such as American International Group .

Maj Dymovksy alleged police accepted bribes because they were poorly paid
The Russian government has admitted that parts of the police have been turned into what the interior minister has described as criminal businesses .
It is the most frank admission so far of corruption and other crimes being committed by members of the police .
It came after a senior policeman in southern Russia posted a video on the internet in which he appealed to the prime minister to tackle the problem .
It is the latest in a series of highly embarrassing revelations about police .
Earlier this year a senior police officer went on a shooting spree in a Moscow supermarket , killing three people .
The incident was recorded on security cameras and the video was widely broadcast on Russian TV and on the internet .
Now a serving police officer , Major Alexei Dymovsky , has spoken out in a video , also posted on the internet which has registered more than 700,000 hits in just a few days .
The officer from southern Russia accuses his superiors of forcing policemen to arrest innocent people to ensure monthly quotas are met .
And he says they are paid so little they have no choice but to accept bribes .
Interior ministry pledge
It is very unusual for a policeman to speak out so openly .
And he has clearly had a major impact - holding a packed news conference in Moscow on Tuesday .
He said he wanted to meet the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to ensure there was a proper investigation to restore the honour and dignity of the police force .
The interior minister has announced that any policeman accused of committing serious crimes will face prosecution .
GENEVA , Switzerland —
Seven imprisoned Baha'i leaders appeared in court today in Iran for a second session of their trial .
The session was once again closed , and family members were not permitted in the courtroom , the Baha'i International Community has learned .
The hearing , which lasted just over one hour , does not seem to have gone beyond procedural issues .
No date was given for any future sessions .
The seven were arrested nearly two years ago and have been held in Tehran 's Evin prison since that time , spending the first year there without formal charges or access to lawyers .
After several postponements , their trial officially began on 12 January , when the seven were arraigned in Branch 28 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran .
That session was also closed to the public , but accounts in government - sponsored news media said the defendants were formally charged with espionage , propaganda activities against the Islamic order , the establishment of an illegal administration , cooperation with Israel , sending secret documents outside the country , acting against the security of the country , and corruption on earth .
All the charges have been categorically denied .
The defendants are Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi , Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani , Mr. Afif Naeimi , Mr. Saeid Rezaie , Mrs. Mahvash Sabet , Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli , and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm .

Now and then one individual stands out as an indictment against injustice .
That would be Liliany Obando , incarcerated in Bogota ’s Buen Pastor Women ’s Prison for almost two years .
Her trial has been repeatedly postponed .
Authorities want to move her to another prison , away from family , attorneys , and supporters .
The International Network in Solidarity with Colombian Political Prisoners and the Alliance for Global Justice issued an appeal recently on her behalf .
Obando , a sociologist and documentary filmmaker , served as human rights director of Fensuagro , Colombia ’s largest peasants ’ union .
She toured foreign countries , raising money for Fensuagro , which has lost more members to murder , disappearance , and prison than any other Colombian union .
Obando issued a report in early 2008 documenting 1,500 Fensuagro unionists murdered at the hands of soldiers and right wing paramilitaries .
She was soon arrested , leaving two young children in the care of her elderly mother .
She is charged with “ rebellion ” and aiding the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) .
The government accused at least twelve others similarly .
First Obando and then professor Miguel Angel Beltran , another sociologist , are the only two so far to be imprisoned .
Widely discredited computer files belonging to FARC commander Raul Reyes allegedly implicate them all .
Seizure of his computers followed an illegal U.S. Colombian air attack in Ecuador on March 1 , 2008 that killed Reyes .
The Colombian regime used the raid and bogus evidence to instill fear and sow confusion among social movements , notably those fighting the rape of peasants ’ land .
Liliany Obando and Fensuagro are emblematic of that struggle .
Fictitious agrarian reforms and military invasion of the countryside came first .
Over decades four million rural people were displaced , with 75 percent impoverished and 50,000 disappeared or murdered .
The U.S. government contributed $ 7 billion towards the Colombian military ’s conduct of a civil war .
Repression , human wastage , and U.S. complicity go unreported by the dominant U.S. and European media .
Liliany Obando ’s case is beginning to reverberate throughout the activist world , especially among labor unions in Australia and Canada , whom she visited .
“ Lily ’s trial has everything to do with her work with Fensuagro , ” writes Alliance for Global Justice spokesperson James Jordan , “ The Colombian government is trying to destroy the union , ” he adds .
“ The war in Colombia is built around driving farmers off their land and of course the union is at odds with that goal . ” .
The issue of land is one good reason to fight for Obando ’s safety in jail and ultimately her freedom .
Another is that she epitomizes the situation of Colombian political prisoners .
Colombia ’s prison system is particularly odious .
The U.S. government has turned a blind eye to 7,500 political prisoners in Colombia who make up ten percent of the country ’s prisoners .
Prisons there are old .
They house almost twice their advertised capacity .
Prisoner rights advocate Agustín Jiménez notes three categories of political prisoners : captured insurgents , those falsely accused living close to guerrilla operations , and human rights activists .
Among the latter , writes analyst Azalea Robles , are “ unionists , students , teachers , peasants , and ecologists ” imprisoned mostly “ as terrorists under coarsely patched together judicial proceedings . ”
Their living conditions are “ subhuman ” and “ The Colombian state is one of the principle torture states in the world . ”
Jiménez accuses the Colombian army of retaliating against prisoners through torture .
Prisons and military power are central to criminalization of social protest leading to harassment , persecution , and torture of political prisoners .
“ Prolonged isolation ” is commonplace .
Supporters see Obando ’s possible transfer to another prison as the regime ’s response to her defense of fellow political prisoners subjected to physical and psychological abuse .
Imprisoned criminals and paramilitaries serve as enforcers .
Many jailed human rights activists linger in jails for several years , charged , never tried , and then released .
By contrast , soldiers accused of killing youths and dressing their bodies to look like FARC casualties – the “ false positives ” scandal – often leave prison in less than 90 days .
Up to 2,000 young rural men have been murdered in this way .
On its web site , the Alliance for Global Justice provides addresses of suitable recipients of letters written in support of Liliany Obando .
Potential writers are advised to write in Spanish because prison authorities bar letters written in other languages .
Or they can use the Spanish version of a model letter , available on the web site .

It 's been less than 24 hours since I attended the PlayStation Move reveal event at GDC , and I 'm gathered in a small conference room of game - makers and press for Sony 's presentation to developers .
I 'm looking for answers .
Yesterday 's event established release date , ballpark pricing and bundling options .
I got to play a bunch of games too , but many of them were so early in development that accurately gauging the potential of the controller was a tough call .
The state of much of the software was such that you could be forgiven for thinking Move is little more than a Wii Motion Plus with some fancy camera options .
But I know how good Sony 's R&D teams are , I 've read up on the underlying tech , and with the right concept and execution this should stand alongside the technological innovation found in Project Natal and in terms of certain , crucial applications , it could indeed surpass it .
As for the nuts and bolts of the wand itself , SCEE 's David Coombes sets out his stall .
" The controller itself has a bunch of inertial sensors built into it which can be used to detect motion .
There 's an accelerometer , a gyroscope and a magnetometer in there .
Those can be used to determine position and orientation , " he says .
" However , inertia sensors have some inherent limitations .
They tend to suffer from drift and inaccuracy , there 's a lot of noise in the data .
" Some of that is because these are simple integrated circuits .
These are n't the sensors you 'll get in an aeroplane for instance .
What we did was add a glowing sphere that the [ PlayStation Eye ] camera can track , similar to the tech used in motion capture labs . "
The combination of internal sensors - talking to the PS3 via a Bluetooth connection - and the PSEye tracking the glowing , bulbous tip of the Move adds to the flexibility and accuracy of the controller .
" The really cool thing about having the illuminated ball is that it works in all kinds of lighting conditions , " Coombes continues .
" It can work in darkness because it is self - illuminating .
You change the colour of the ball and when you have four players , each one can have a differently coloured controller .
" The controllers can change colour too .
So they can turn red as you move into a dangerous area , for example , or it can flash when you fire a gun .
So as well as the tracking there are some interesting game design options you can use within the controller . "
Sony research and development guru Anton Mikhailov takes point on much of the technical data imparted at the briefing .
Straight away he 's talking about the " dreaded lag " .
Yesterday , at the main event , latency with Move was defined as being under one frame - a state of affairs that seems almost unbelievable , putting the motion controller on equal footing with the DualShock 3 and Sixaxis .
It turns out that getting the lowest possible latency was one of the team 's primary objectives .
" The interface itself has some inherent latency because there 's processing and so forth , " explains Mikhailov .
" But also , the player might have latency .
If I want to throw a punch , I 'm gonna move slower than I would if I were just pressing a button , so it 's a two - part thing .
" What people often forget is that latency actually is very important for casual games .
People think you can swing around , you can do some gestures and that 's OK .
Actually for a game to be connected to the player , to feel intuitive , it has to have low latency .
Latency creates the barrier between the user and the interface . "
Mikhailov then goes into an in - depth briefing on just about all the various PlayStation controllers Sony has been responsible for , from the DualShock to the SingStar mics to EyeToy and Buzz .
The latter devices all have limited functionality but they are intuitive and familiar to the casual audience .
What Move - and by implication the WiiMote - does is to give the flexibility of the DualShock without the abstraction .
No longer do you press X to perform a motion like , say , swinging a bat .
You simply use the wand to mimic the action .
" It 's like a bridge between casual devices and the DualShock , " Mikhailov adds .
" Some games are still going to be better on the DualShock .
We 're not trying to take games away from the DualShock in any way .
There are some times when you really need buttons and analogue sticks . "
According to Mikhailov , it 's all about being intuitive , robust , and being able to work in all conditions .
" One big issue with EyeToy we always tried to tackle was lighting .
If you have low - light conditions , you can't see the user and you can't track him very well .
That 's why the spheres are illuminated : you can work in pitch - black conditions .
Second thing : it 's robust .
It goes back to precision : if the interface is n't precise , the user starts to blame the interface and we do n't want that .
" It 's also intuitive .
It wo n't lose track of you , even if the camera loses track of the sphere it'll compensate with the accelerometers .
I can put the controllers behind my back , I can swing backwards , it 's not losing tracking .
You do n't have to worry about it freaking out ... there 's a one - to - one connection . "
Based on yesterday 's presentation and gameplay session , if there was one positive you could take away from the event , it was that Move is clearly a far more precise implementation than the Wiimote .
Some of the games felt clearly more " tactile " than the Wii equivalents .
Move also takes care of the basics .
When I spoke with Kudo Tsunoda at gamescom last year , I was surprised that you could n't point with Project Natal .
As Anton Mikhailov powers up one of his myriad tech demos , it 's clear that Move does pretty much everything a developer or gamer could want from it .
Armed with twin wands , he 's pointing as you would with a light gun or laser pen .
" Doing a pointer is very easy because you have a 3D object in space , " Mikhailov says .
" All you do is shoot a ray from where you are to the TV .
From a programming perspective your math is very simple , it 's like a ray - tracer . "
The demo simply shows Atari VCS style rectangular blobs moving around the screen as Mikhailov wields the twin controllers .
It 's clear to see that while pointing works , the targets are jittering .
But this is by design .
" You can see the jitter , but the jitter 's in my hand , " Mikhailov explains .
" I have a tripod here .
Check this out .
If I stabilise myself on the tripod , I can get rid of the jitter .
It 's in my hand .
It 's not system jitter .
It 's not some kind of noise .
If you want to make a really accurate shooting game , you keep the jitter in because you want the players to get better at shooting .
" If you want to make a more casual game , you smooth this out .
It introduces latency when you smooth things but for a casual user , maybe that 's a better thing .
As a developer , you have control of this .
If you want to make a hardcore game with precise tracking or if you want to make a more casual game , or give some help to the user you can do that . "
In January of 2009 , shares of Palm traded at a little over $ 3 as everyone awaited details of the once - mighty smartphone maker 's plans to save itself from certain death .
In the wake of the Pre 's successful unveiling later that month at CES , Palm 's stock price more than doubled , and optimism about the Pre 's prospects eventually drove shares to a high of over $ 17 in October of last year .
But as of this past Friday 's earnings report , sales are way below Palm 's and Wall Street 's expectations , the company has little cash left on hand , and shares of PALM have dropped all the way back down to $ 4 .
There 's a growing consensus — as expressed by the market — that there are only two possible futures for Palm : acquisition , or insolvency .
So what happened ?
Was n't webOS the greatest thing since the original iPhone OS ?
Was n't the Pre a great phone ?
How did Palm blow it so badly ?
I was a Pre user up until January of this past year , when the Nexus One came out .
I went with Palm as far as I could , but in the end , I bailed .
Here 's where I think Palm went wrong , and why I left the Pre .
The App Catalog : the tail never got long enough
One of the most exciting aspects of the Pre launch was the promise of a new , more open platform for app developers .
Palm 's webOS and App Catalog were supposed to be so many things that the iPhone OS and App Store were n't : open , fair , developer - friendly , and homebrew - friendly .
There was some initial grumbling that the Mojo SDK forced developers to use Web technologies like Javascript and CSS , but overall the developer response was positive , and we all awaited the inevitable flood of webOS apps .
But the flood never came , and the Pre seemed to fizzle in the ensuing app drought .
In the end , the webOS app shortage meant that the Pre never benefitted from a powerful " long tail " effect that the competing iPhone enjoyed .
When the Pre launched in early June of 2009 , the App Catalog had only about 30 apps .
In July , there still were n't any apps , nor were there in August .
Eventually , there was a trickle of apps into the store , and by the time the " beta " tag came off at the end of last year there were just about 1,000 apps on offer .
One thousand apps is peanuts compared to the iPhone , which has well over 100,000 apps on offer , or Android 's 10,000 + apps .
Even so , you might think 1,000 apps should be plenty to fit everyone 's needs , but then you misunderstand how the iPhone 's App Store contributes to Apple 's success .
In short , 100,000 apps is a really , really long tail , and in that tail everyone can find one or two goofy , niche apps that they really like .
And when they find those apps — my dad loves the bubble wrap and the Bible translations , my wife loves the koi pond and the kiddie apps that entertain my daughter , and I like the IRC clients — they show it off to friends and family .
And when one of my dad 's non-iPhone friends sees the bubble wrap and the six different Bible translations , that person does n't say to himself , " my God , it has bubble wrap and Bibles .
I must buy this phone . "
Rather , he says , " if it has bubble wrap and Bibles , I bet it has something really cool for me , too .
I must buy this phone . "
The power of the long tail for app stores is that everyone can find and share a handful of quirky little apps that really excite them for whatever reason .
And when they share those apps , they 're essentially shilling for the platform , not the specific apps .
Every time two people pull out their iPhones in a crowd and start trading recommendations for incredibly niche apps that fit their specific interests , everyone who does n't have an iPhone feels like they 're missing out .
By the end of 2009 , as a Pre user , I definitely felt like I was missing out .
I wanted games and IRC clients and quirky apps of my own .
My wife had an iPhone 3GS , and I envied her for it .
I still liked all of the aspects of webOS that I raved about in my review of the Pre , but I felt like I was sacrificing for those features .
I was suffering the Pre 's barren app catalog in exchange for the benefits of Synergy , multitasking , and cloud messaging .
Lost momentum , and the 3GS
Closely related to the App Catalog drought in the summer of '09 was the issue of overall platform momentum and buzz .
The Pre got off to a great , buzz - and hype - filled start .
And then nothing .
For months , there was no new hardware , no surge of new apps , no big announcements or reveals , and no reason to talk about or write about or think about Palm .
Meanwhile , as Palm was losing momentum for lack of announcements and progress , Apple launched the wildly successful iPhone 3GS .
The 3GS was a truly great smartphone , and people bought millions of them .
Palm had no response ready , and when I brought home a 3GS for my wife , that feeling that I was missing out really took hold .
Pre 's hardware is the Xbox 360 of smartphones ( in a bad way )
The review unit that Palm sent me broke shortly after the review was done , though I ended up buying a Pre for myself so it did n't matter .
But then that Pre had problems — performance was atrocious ( especially with the dialer ) , and there was something wrong with the proximity sensor .
I griped about it a lot on Twitter , and after a few weeks of headaches it was clear that my unit was a lemon .
Yet it seemed to me that everyone 's Pre had problems .
I 've only met one Pre owner in - person who has n't sent at least one phone back , but I 've met many people who have returned multiple Pres .
When you pull out your
Pre somewhere and another Pre user spots it , the odds are close to certain ( in my experience ) that that person has sent at least one unit back because of some kind of issue .
Every single reviewer that I know of sent at least one Pre back in the beginning .
I realize that there has been a ton of debate over the actual return rate for the Pre , with a number of analysts claiming that the returns issue is overblown and that there 's nothing out - of - the - ordinary going on .
But based entirely on my own anecdotal experience , it 's my very strong impression that there were serious quality control problems and that returns were common .
Even if I happen to inhabit some vortex of Pre malfunction , and my experience is totally atypical , it 's still the case that only a slightly elevated return rate is bad news for a fledgling smartphone like Pre .
The one thing people do n't want with a phone is trouble .
A glitchy phone is a terrible thing , and given the kinds of situations that people use their phone in ( driving , cooking , running , secretly during a meeting , in an emergency , etc. ) , the average person 's tolerance for phone gremlins is zero .
Mirror mirror : Pre was targeted at women ( ?!)
I 'm fairly convinced that Palm intended the Pre to be a smartphone that was designed with women in mind , and that this somewhat bizarre decision was a mistake .
Regardless of whether women do or do n't really represent a distinct and grossly underserved smartphone market ( this proposition sounds dubious to me , but I 'm a guy , so what do I know ) , Palm 's lame attempts at targeting women probably hurt more than they helped .
There was a famous incident in early July where Palm backer Roger McNamee — the money man who recruited Jon Rubenstein to make the Pre — got into an awkward tussle with Kara Swisher over the mirror on the back of the Pre .
Let 's roll the tape :
MS . SWISHER : Who do you consider your customers ?
Is there a demographic you are aiming for ?
MR .
MCNAMEE : People who are really busy .
People who use the Web a lot .
For one thing , look at this device .
There has never been a smartphone designed before for people who care a lot about how it fits in your hand and who care about integration of multiple personal information or synchronization from the cloud .
It has a mirror on the back .
Remember , there has never been a smartphone designed for the needs of women before .
MS .
SWISHER : Wait , wait .
Women need mirrors more than , say , you ?
MR .
MCNAMEE : No , I am saying if you have the opportunity to stick a mirror on here , why would n’t you do it ?
If you are making it for 25 - to 40 - year - old nerds , you would have put a black thing back here .
But we are sitting here going , “ Look , it costs nothing .
Why do n’t we do it because you know what , people actually do need mirrors from time to time . ” ... MS. SWISHER : Are you aiming at the ladies ?
It is smaller , and it is cuter .
MR .
MCNAMEE : Look , 52 % of the population is women , and they have been grossly underserved .
MS .
SWISHER : The iPhone is n’t the scariest phone in the world .
MR .
MCNAMEE : We did a study of every single advertisement done in the smartphone category over the last three years , and other than Palm , there have been a total of four instances and one print ad by BlackBerry ever aimed at women .
All the rest of them have Star Wars themes and they are all clearly aimed at testosterone - laced , tech - driven men .
The mirror on the back of the Pre and the odd , off - putting , ad campaign both are emblematic of what was ultimately wrong with Palm 's awkwardly executed targeting of women as a distinct smartphone market : it just did n't work .
The mirror was worthless , and good only for checking your teeth after dinner .
( I could also imagine signaling with it if I were stranded in the wilderness . )
As an actual mirror for anyone ( woman or man ) who cares about mirrors and needs one for cosmetic reasons , it was a total failure .
Likewise with the ad campaign : people just did n't respond to it , regardless of what kind of reproductive equipment they had in their pants .
It just did n't resonate with anyone .
In ways large and small ( including , I suspect , the form factor ) , Palm tried for women and they missed everybody .
They should have just tried for everybody .
Google 's corporate information sites appeared to have been hacked this morning .
Update , 3.21 pm : Google now says the problem is " not a hack , but a bug " .
Their California offices are waking up and dealing with it now ...
Users searching with Google for " Google executives " were given an English link saying " Corporate Information – Google Management " that took them to a page with all information in Chinese – http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html.
The site lists Google 's executives , among them Eric Schmidt , Sergey Brin and Larry Page .
Its parent site http://www.google.com/corporate/ which usually gives information about Google 's business was also in Chinese and further directing users from there to the new non-censored Chinese version of Google .
The redirection occurs only in some areas , but the failure could be reproduced after the cookies were deleted and when the private browsing mode was turned on .
Google was informed by the Guardian about the problem , and a spokesperson confirmed it , saying they are now investigating the issue .
Update : A Google spokesperson later added : " This is not a hack but rather a bug affecting the language displayed to some users , and we are working to fix it soon . "
Google 's Executives on the Chinese version
On Monday , Google stopped censoring the Chinese Google search , Google News and Google Images , and redirected search users in China to its uncensored search engine based in Hong Kong , Google.com.hk .
Now its US corporate site is partly mirroring the Hong Kong version .
Google 's move caused lots of criticism in China yesterday .
CCTV , China 's state television , broadcasted criticism of Google 's decision , and the overseas edition of the People 's Daily , the main newspaper of the Chinese communist party , accused Google of collaborating with US spy agencies , Reuters reported .
In January an American internet security firm said it has traced the sophisticated cyber - attack against Google and 30 other US companies back to the Chinese government " or its proxies " .

Ferran Adrià , the Catalan chef who for two decades has been the leading catalyst and inspiration for avant - garde cuisine , has decided to permanently close his restaurant El Bulli , considered by many to be the world ’s greatest , and to replace it with an academy for advanced culinary study , Mr. Adrià said in an interview on Friday .
In January , Mr. Adrià had said that the restaurant would go on a hiatus starting in 2012 , but that it would reopen in 2014 .
For many years El Bulli , in the Mediterranean town of Roses , north of Barcelona , closed for half the year so Mr. Adrià and his chefs could spend the off months developing new techniques , like the foams , airs and other culinary wizardry that he has created .
He told The Wall Street Journal at that time that his research would “ be focused on sustaining and growing our brand however possible .
A brand with goals like ours requires a big capital investment . ’’
On Friday he said he decided to close the restaurant for good because he and his partner , Juli Soler , had been losing a half million Euros a year on the restaurant and his cooking workshop in Barcelona .
“ At that level of contribution , ’’ he said of the losses , “ I think we would rather see the money go to something larger that expands the concept and spirit of what El Bulli represents . ’’
He said he would use that money — which he earns mostly from consultancies and other businesses — to establish his new academy and to finance scholarships so the world ’s most talented cooks can attend .
“ We had planned to use the two years to see how El Bulli could evolve , ’’ Mr. Adrià said in a telephone interview .
“ We ’ve been looking at many options , but yesterday we decided that the foundation would be the most satisfying . ’’
He said of the demands of the restaurant , “ at that bestial pace , it would be impossible to continue . ’’
Adrià said the academy would be “ a place for free thinking and kicking around ideas ’’ about food .
The El Bulli academy would likely work with many cooking schools around the world and would seek students — perhaps 25 in the first year — who had the highest levels of professional training .
“ Throughout the history of El Bulli we ’ve made seemingly drastic decisions in order to maintain our level of creativity , ’’ he said .
Mr. Adrià , 47 , arrived at El Bulli in 1983 , when it was a French restaurant .
Soon he took charge of the kitchen and by the 1990s it became known as a laboratory for daring innovation .
“ Mr. Adrià ’s idea , as he describes it , was simply to ‘ do new things with old concepts , ’’’ Mark Bittman wrote in 2006 .
“ So , seeing chicken curry as a concept and determining to do something that had n’t been done before , he developed a dish , now famous , in which the sauce is solid and the chicken liquid . ’’
In 1997 he won three Michelin stars .
He has since been proclaimed by many to be the greatest chef in the world .
He has been widely influential in the spread of “ molecular gastronomy ’’ — a term he has renounced .
The restaurant will reopen for six months on June 15 after its winter break and will close for good in December 2011 .
The 3,000 people on the waiting list for one of about four dozen seats , will just have to hope that someday Mr. Adrià will open another restaurant .
He said that has no plans to , but the academy might be open for breakfast , or an occasional lunch .
( And he is the director of gastronomy at El Bulli Hacienda Benazuza hotel near Sevilla . )
“ Everything new looks strange , ’’ Mr. Adrià said .

The biggest upset in a tournament full of them was done .
Northern Iowa had taken down mighty Kansas .
Playing with poise down the stretch and getting another big 3 - pointer from Farokhmanesh , Northern Iowa pulled off one of the biggest NCAA upsets in years by knocking No. 1 overall seed Kansas from the bracket with a program - defining 69 - 67 win on Saturday .
" If anybody 's going to shoot that shot , I want it to be Ali , " Northern Iowa 's Jake Koch said .
This year 's NCAA tournament has been defined by its upsets .
Eight double - digit seeds moved through the bracket in the first round .
No. 10 Saint Mary 's beat Villanova on Saturday and No. 11 Washington shoved aside New Mexico .
This was the biggest shocker of all .
Winning the tempo tug - of - war , ninth - seeded Northern Iowa ( 30 - 4 ) grounded the high - flying Jayhawks with in - their - jersey defense , then withstood a furious rally to become the first team to beat a No. 1 seed in the second round since UAB and Alabama did it to Kentucky and Stanford in 2004 .
Farokhmanesh , Northern Iowa 's first - round hero , had the biggest play of all .
With Kansas charging and its fans roaring , the fearless son of an Iranian Olympic volleyball player caught the ball on the wing after the Panthers had broken Kansas ' press .
The shot clock still in the 30s , he hesitated for just an instant , then cast his bracket - busting shot with 34 seconds left on the game clock .
Trailing 66 - 62 , Kansas had one last chance , but Tyrel Reed was called for an offensive foul and Farokhmanesh sealed it with two free throws with 5 seconds left , sending the Panthers to the round of 16 for the first time .
Next up is the Michigan State - Maryland winner in St. Louis -- and another chance at history .
" This team has done such a great job of turning the page to what 's next , and this would be the biggest challenge of the year , " Northern Iowa coach Ben Jacobson said .
" A lot of positive things have happened because of the way these guys played .

Say no to NATO use of the Wahan Corridor By Han Dongping ( chinadaily.com.cn )
Updated : 2010-01-15 16:39
As US and its allies stepped up its military operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan , they also began to realize that the task they are faced with there is almost impossible to complete .
I argued in a different article that there was no way the US and its allies would be able to win in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The reason is very simple .
The people in Pakistan and Afghanistan are too tough for the US and its allies to conquer .
First , Taliban forces and other anti-American elements in Pakistan and Afghanistan are at home in the harsh natural environment of the remote mountainous regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
But American soldiers and its allies , who are more used to modern comfortable conditions at home , are out of their element in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Second ,
The Taliban and other anti-US forces in Pakistan and Afghanistan can sustain its resistance at a relatively low cost with their simple weapons and technology .
The cost of Americans ’ high tech warfare , on the other hand , is much higher .
The American government estimates the cost of maintaining one soldier in Afghanistan for one year to be one million dollars .
As the US federal and state governments struggle with budget shortfalls amid the ongoing financial crisis , it is clear that it will be hard for the US and its allies to sustain its military operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan for very long .
As American government begins to see its precarious situation in Pakistan and Afghanistan , they have tried to drag China into its mess in Afghanistan and Pakistan by asking China to allow them to use the Wahan corridor for its military operations .
I hope that Chinese government can detect American intentions in this strategy , and that it is wise enough to deny America ’s request to use the Wahan corridor .
Afghanistan and Pakistan are both Chinese neighbors , and they are strategically important for China ’s national security .
China should never support outside forces to mess with its neighbors ’ internal affairs , particularly when it is almost certain that the outside forces will be defeated in the end .
The US forces and its allies will have to leave Afghanistan and Pakistan sooner or later , but the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan will always be there .
China should not alienate them hotheadedly .
More importantly , the US military operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan have multiple objectives .
One of its undisclosed objectives is to threaten the security of China ’s western borders , to disrupt one of China ’s most important strategic allies , Pakistan , and to enable India , China ’s traditional rival , to strengthen its military and political positions in the subcontinent of South Asia .
China has no reason to help US and its allies to undermine China ’s strategic interests in that area .
The US , as the only superpower in the world , has several hundred bases throughout the world .
According to the United Nations ’ calculation , the US has fought more wars than any other country in the world since the end of WWII , and it also supported one of its most important allies in fighting the second most wars since WWII .
As a result , the US and CIA activities in the world have become the biggest threat to world peace and the survival of the planet earth .
The US military leaders at one time threatened to bomb Pakistan back to the Stone Age , a threat it has also used against China in the past .
I teach environmental politics , so I know the environmental impact caused by war and military spending .
I sincerely believe that American military spending and military operations around the world are actually hurting the fundamental interests of the American people as well as the people who are directly affected by the US military operations .
American people always support their own troops .
In that mindset , it is very hard for American people to see that they are actually the victims of their government ’s own military operations in the world .
They can not see that the best way to support one ’s troops is to keep them out of the harmful way .
American people need to ask themselves some very profound questions .
Why does the US need military bases in so many countries outside their own territory ?
What do American people gain from such an extensive military presence in the world ?
Why American service men have to make the ultimate sacrifice in so many wars , in Korea , in Vietnam , in Iraq , and now in Pakistan and Afghanistan ?
It would be very hard for American people to realize the stupidity of stationing troops abroad .
Therefore , the world can not expect the US to withdraw its military forces back to the US voluntarily .
The only option left for the world is to drive some good sense into the heads of American leaders by forcing the US to withdraw from its overseas military establishments and operations .
For the sake of world peace , protecting our environment , and its own self - interests , China should refrain from allowing the US and its allies to use the Wahan corridor for its military operations and other resistance forces in Pakistan and Afghanistan .

A standard 9x9 Sudoku matrix .
Image credit : Héctor Rodríguez .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A new analysis of number randomness in Sudoku matrices could lead to the development of more difficult and multi-dimensional Sudoku puzzles .
In a recent study , mathematicians have found that the way that numbers are arranged in Sudoku puzzles is even more random than the number arrangements in randomly - generated matrices .
The counter - intuitive discovery may enable researchers to develop algorithms that generate Sudoku matrices with fewer clues , making them more difficult to solve .
Mathematicians Paul Newton and Stephen DeSalvo of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles have published the results of their study in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society A .
" I think it will help develop multi-dimensional Sudoku puzzles , and answer questions about how to give the initial [ clues ] in order to create a hard , but still solvable Sudoku puzzle , " Newton said in an article at ABC Science .
Sudoku is a number puzzle consisting of a 9x9 grid , whose 81 boxes are filled in with the numbers 1 through 9 in a way that meets certain criteria .
Each number can only appear once per row and once per column , as well as only once in each of the nine 3x3 sub - grids that make up the matrix .
In 2006 , researchers ( Felgenhauer and Jarvis ) found that there are about 6.67 x 1021 different Sudoku matrices that satisfy these three criteria .
In contrast , the total number of different 9x9 randomly generated matrices is much greater : 981 .
The ratio of these two numbers , or the probability of randomly generating a Sudoku matrix by randomly selecting each number in each box independently , is very small : about 3 x 10 - 56 .
This small probability results from the constraints put on Sudoku matrices .
In their study , Newton and DeSalvo wanted to find out how exactly random a Sudoku matrix is , given these constraints .
To answer this question , they generated a representative sample of about 10,000 matrices and compared them to randomly generated matrices .
They were surprised to find that Sudoku matrices are actually more random than randomly - generated matrices .
This result is counterintuitive since you would expect that , the more constraints on a matrix , the less random it will be .
Instead , the rules of Sudoku seem to “ weed out ” matrices with patterns .
For example , as Newton explained , a randomly generated matrix could potentially consist of all one number , alternating numbers , or some other pattern not allowed in Sudoku .
The imposed high level of number distribution in Sudoku gives it a higher level of entropy , making it more random than random matrices .
Newton and DeSalvo predict that this greater understanding of Sudoku could lead to better Sudoku - generating algorithms that create more difficult puzzles .
Currently , Sudoku puzzles require at least 17 numbers to be given in their correct boxes in order for the puzzle solver to find a unique solution .
The new study could decrease that number , making it more difficult to solve the puzzles .
Future algorithms might also develop more complex 3D Sudoku cubes .
" I think it will give people a lot of insight into how to produce better algorithms for constructing Sudoku matrices and it will enable ultimately the very fast learning algorithms that solve Sudoku matrices , " Newton said .
Australian mathematician Marcel Jackson of Latrobe University in Melbourne , who was not affiliated with the study , added that understanding Sudoku matrices better might also be useful in coding information to minimize the effect of errors in transmission .

One driver Mark Webber has been accused of undermining Victoria 's road safety campaign after he called Australia a " bloody nanny state " in the wake of Lewis Hamilton 's hoon session in St Kilda .
Victoria Police said Webber " should know better " after he attacked Victoria 's speeding and parking regulations and said he felt he needed to " read an instruction book " before getting out of bed .
Webber , who finished ninth in yesterday 's Grand Prix at Albert Park , was speaking after F1 ace Hamilton had his car impounded after he was caught doing burnouts in the Melbourne bayside suburb of St Kilda on Friday night .
'' It 's a great country , but we 've got to be responsible for our actions and it's certainly a bloody nanny state when it comes to what we can do .
Lewis has found out very quickly , " Webber said .
'' I think we 've got to read an instruction book when we get out of bed - what we can do and what we can't do ... put a yellow vest on and all that sort of stuff .
" It pisses me off coming back here , to be honest . "
Deputy Police Commissioner Ken Lay says the state 's road toll is distressingly high and Webber should know better .
" That 's after a weekend [ which left ] six dead , four of them attributed to speeding , " he said .
" It 's really disappointing .
Mark Webber 's in a unique position where he's got the ability to influence our road users .
He 's missed an opportunity .
He 's probably undermined our message .
" Might I be so bold to say there 's probably quite a few Webber fans still alive today because of the work we do , " he added .
" Hopefully on reflection he'd wish he had n't said it . "
Webber 's Red Bull team declined to comment when contacted by the ABC this morning but said the driver 's original remarks had been made in a private conversation .
South Carolina forces “ subversives ” to register with the authorities or do hard time
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , February 8 , 2010
Subversives who think government is corrupt and should be controlled by the people face 10 years in prison and a $ 25,000 dollar fine if they fail to register with authorities in South Carolina , in another chilling example of how free speech and dissent is being criminalized in America .
The state ’s “ Subversive Activities Registration Act ” is now officially on the books and mandates that “ Every member of a subversive organization , or an organization subject to foreign control , every foreign agent and every person who advocates , teaches , advises or practices the duty , necessity or propriety of controlling , conducting , seizing or overthrowing the government of the United States … shall register with the Secretary of State . ”
Of course , the right to overthrow a government that has become corrupt , abusive and completely unrepresentative of its electorate is enshrined in the Declaration of Independence – that ’s how America came to be a Republic in the first place – advocating or teaching that the people should “ control ” the government via their elected representatives is a basic function of a democratic society , but this law effectively makes it a terrorist offense .
“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness , ” states the Declaration of Independence .
Under the sweeping terms of the law , members of tax protest organizations , the Tea Party movement and the States ’
Rights movement based in South Carolina are all domestic terrorists if they fail to register their dissent with the authorities .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
It is important to stress that the notion this law somehow only applies to “ Islamic terrorists ” is completely at odds with the fact that federal and state authorities now consider the main terror threat to be from informed American citizens exercising their constitutional rights in opposition to the big government agenda they are being subjected to .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
As we saw with the MIAC report and a plethora of similar training manuals which were leaked over the last decade , police are being trained that libertarians , gun owners , Ron Paul supporters and anyone who is mildly political is a domestic extremist and a potential terrorist – these people are the real target of the subversives list in South Carolina .
The infamous Phoenix Federal Bureau of Investigation manual ( page one , page two ) produced in association with the Joint Terrorism Task Force listed “ defenders of the U.S. constitution ” and “ lone individuals ” as terrorists .
Will anyone in South Carolina who defends the Constitution , the very bedrock of what America stands for , have to register with the authorities unless they want to be locked up for a decade ?
Of course , since nobody is going to register as a “ subversive ” with South Carolina authorities , their failure to “ comply ” with the regulation will later be used against them as a means of eliciting criminal charges , in what represents a clear end run around the First Amendment .
The government is n’t going to just come out all guns blazing and ban free speech , they are simply going to make anyone who refuses to register for permission a criminal for failing to adhere to a separate mandate .
Just like people in places such as New York and Chicago were told that they had to get a license to purchase a gun – at first the process was a mere inconvenience but now the licensing process means they have to jump through 200 flaming hoops and the second amendment has effectively been outlawed in these cities .
They wo n’t hesitate to pull the same tricks with the First Amendment , and it ’s already happening with calls to license Internet users and force them to get government permission to run a website .

A 27 - year - old Reno native named Justin Massler was arrested yesterday for stalking Ivanka Trump .
News reports have described Massler as an obsessed fan with " a crush " on the socialite / heiress .
His vicious tweets and violent comics suggest otherwise .
Massler 's Twitter account has been deleted , but a cached version contains a string of angry messages directed at Trump .
On March 2nd , Ivanka posted a photo of herself at an event for the launch of the UN Foundation 's Girl Up campaign .
Massler responded with 14 tweets calling Trump " a diseased elitist and part of the problem " and saying her work with the UN was " as bad as appointing Hitler to head a charity for Jewish Hospitals . "
He also vowed to " destroy your entire jewelry enterprises with a brand destruction media campaign . "
Back in February , before he started sending her nasty messages on Twitter , Massler created the " Ivanka Trump Fan Blog . "
The blog only contains two entries .
The first is a fawning ode to Ivanka that references her " intensely alluring beauty and impossibly shapely figure " and ends with a love poem .
A few hours later , Massler put up a second post featuring a bizarre comic illustrating what would befall him if Ivanka denied his overture .
Massler 's deleted tweets , comics and poetry are below .
( CNN ) --
The widow of an Internal Revenue Service employee killed when a disgruntled taxpayer flew his plane into a seven - story building in Austin , Texas , last week is suing the pilot 's wife , according to court documents .
Valerie Hunter , the wife of Vernon Hunter , is accusing Sheryl Stack , wife of Andrew Joseph " Joe " Stack III , of negligence , alleging she knew or should have known that her husband was a threat to others and , thus , could have prevented the attack , according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Travis County District Court .
" Stack was threatened enough by Joseph Stack that she took her daughter and stayed at a hotel the night before the plane crash .
[ She ] owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to others including [ Vernon Hunter ] , " the suit says .
The lawsuit also seeks to bar the release of Vernon Hunter 's autopsy report , saying that , if made public , it would cause Hunter 's family to suffer " severe and irreparable emotional distress . "
Hunter was killed February 18 when , authorities say , Stack flew his Piper Cherokee PA - 28 into a northwest Austin building that housed nearly 200 IRS employees .
Authorities say Stack set fire to his $ 230,000 home in Austin before embarking on his fatal flight .
Police have said Sheryl Stack spent the previous night in an Austin - area hotel but did not say why .
Police said they had received no calls of domestic violence from the house .
The only calls to police were made a couple of years ago and concerned barking dogs , officials said said .
A 3,000 - word message on a Web site registered to Stack railed against the government , particularly the IRS .
" I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different , " the online message said .
" I am finally ready to stop this insanity .
Well , Mr. Big Brother IRS man , let 's try something different ; take my pound of flesh and sleep well . "
Sheryl Stack issued a statement after the attack expressing " sincere sympathy to the victims and their families . "
Note : This is the introduction to Direct Citizen Action : How We Can Win the Second American Revolution Without Firing a Shot , published last week .
This book is for people who have concluded that America is in serious trouble because its government got too big .
I make no effort to prove that here .
I and many others have done that at length elsewhere .
It is simply an assumption of the book .
So , this is a book for libertarians , Paulians , tea party people , limited government conservatives and anyone else who accepts the above proposition .
Let ’s call us the liberty movement .
Being a libertarian for thirty years , Ron Paul ’s election lawyer in New York State in 2007 — 8 , and a leader of the tea party movement should give me the credibility to say what needs to be done now .
I am not some Johnny - come - lately to the cause or a paid political hack for any party or plutocrat .
I received no outside support to write or publish this book .
I ’m a working - class lawyer who lives with his wife and two children in a three - bedroom home in a working - class neighborhood in North Buffalo .
The impetus for this book was my fear that the liberty movement is being set up for a big disappointment in 2010 and 2012 .
While public opinion is turning our way and millions of grassroots activists hit the streets to protest big government last year , the odds are that the same GOP establishment whose free - spending ways and nation - building wars set the stage for Obama , will be choosing the candidates for Congress this year and will choose the nominee against Obama in 2012 .
These folks are unapologetic about their decades of support for big government policies , yet they will cleverly say the things their consultants tell them to say to appeal to the liberty movement .
Direct Citizen Action :...

There will be elation on election night this year , but then the sellouts will occur just as they did during the Reagan years , after the 1994 Republican u201CRevolutionu201D and after the Republicans achieved total control of the federal government during the Bush years .
I can see this happening because I have watched politics closely for many decades and I know how GOP operatives think and act .
Please understand that I do not oppose political activity altogether .
Since I am a political consultant for liberty movement candidates , that would be economic suicide !
My point is that electoral politics should be engaged in with great selectivity , only when the candidate is golden , such as Ron Paul , and other circumstances dictate that the scarce resources of the liberty movement can be applied to great effect in a key race .
Instead , our primary focus should be on the numerous and highly effective methods of direct citizen action that have been neglected by our movement but which have been highly effective in other times and places .
Many of the ideas I propose here will also make electoral success for the liberty movement much more likely .
In the realm of politics , the best chance the liberty movement has is not winning elections but convincing states and localities to stop cooperating with the federal government .
I believe the Tenth Amendment Movement .
as it is known , has great potential .
Early on , I criticized this movement for too much talk — meaningless resolutions — and not enough action such as telling the Feds where they can put all their money with anti-federal strings attached .
Here ’s my post from March 10 , 2009 on LewRockwell.com :
When words on paper have failed , add more words
Political Class Dismis ... Ostrowski , Mr. James Best Price : $ 4.00 Buy New $ 9.50 ( as of 09:20 EST - Details )
That ’s how I see the state sovereignty resolutions , at least those I have read .
This Arizona resolution urges the federal government to start respecting the Tenth Amendment .
I have news for the drafters .
They think they are respecting the Tenth Amendment .
Here ’s what the resolution should have said if the supporters were really serious and not just chasing headlines or self - delusions .
u201CAll state legislation enacted under threat of the withdrawal of federal funds , and all state legislation that facilitates the administration of unconstitutional federal programs is hereby repealed .
u201D
I urge this movement to avoid direct confrontations with the Feds and instead use a more Zen - like approach : non-cooperation in all discretionary matters .
1
For example , while the Feds , with the blessing of our post - New Deal rubber - stamp Supreme Court , can apparently enact any drug laws it so chooses , I am not aware of any legal obligation that states and localities have to waste their scarce resources on the Feds ’ stupid drug war .
The best way to end the drug war is not through lobbying Congress but by persuading key cites to stop wasting their scarce resources on a destructive and unwinnable war .
For the latest developments in the Tenth Amendment Movement , see Michael Boldin ’s great website , TenthAmendmentCenter.com .
I am keeping this book concise to keep the cost down and make it available to a large readership .
Therefore , please refer to my websites , PoliticalClassDismissed.com and FreetheChildren .US for further information and updates on direct citizen action in these times .
The Best of James Ostrowski
UYUNI , Bolivia — " Gray gold " may be the key to a future filled with hybrid or electric vehicles .
That 's because lithium is the most important ingredient in the batteries that power these cars .
Even without many electric cars on the road today the lightest metal on Earth is more and more a mining target of multinational companies as lithium ion batteries power an increasing array of electronic gadgets .
Lithium is found in many places on the planet , but among all of them no deposit is richer than the vast salt flats of Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia , covering more than 10,000 square kilometers of the remote high plains .
Lithium is found among these salts , mixed in with brine that lies beneath a saline crust , the residue of an ancient evaporated sea .
That lithium - rich brine is the legacy of local volcanic activity transporting the metal to the surface where it could then be leached by infiltrating waters .
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that this single salar ( salt pan ) contains 5.4 million metric tons of lithium .
Harkening to a future of growing demand , landlocked Bolivia recently invested $ 5.7 million in a pilot plant to determine how best to process the salt , which may ultimately enable it to surpass its neighbor Chile in dominating the global market for the element .
But peasant salt harvesters still predominate in this part of the so - called Lithium Triangle — salt deserts perched atop the Andes at the junction of Argentina , Bolivia and Chile .
The bulk of common table salt from the salar is still harvested by Aymara people , their faces sheathed by sheets or wooden masks to protect against the blinding sun , using hatchets or iron bars and often breaking through to the blue - green brine beneath the crust , rich in minerals ranging from boron to lithium .
Says Nestor Alconz , a salt harvester in the Salar de Coipasa : " Evo Morales , our president , came to the village last year .
It was the first time a president ever came up to here .
He told us about lithium but he said that it requires such high investments that it will take a lot of time until we can start that here .
I do n't think I will witness it , but I do hope our children will benefit from it . "
Nevertheless , the Lithium Triangle salars are beginning to show the strains of increased lithium production : Evaporation ponds litter the barren landscape , and pumping the brine may lower the water table — a major threat in a desert area .
Furthermore , large - scale extraction could destroy the unique salar ecosystem .
Although increasing demand has driven lithium prices from $ 350 to $ 3,000 per ton in the past five years , ultimately it will be the proliferation of electric cars that pushes consumption of the element to new heights .
Whereas gadgets require roughly a few grams of lithium , a car battery requires as much as 30 kilograms .
And that 's the hope of some Bolivians , that a lithium rush may enable them to escape poverty .
" The discovery of lithium will allow Bolivia to become an industrialized country like others , " says metallurgist Maritza Vallejos of the pilot plant in Rio Grande .
" Thanks to the production of lithium batteries for electric cars , [ we ] will contribute to fighting global warming for the benefit of the entire Earth . "

Born in the East End and the son of a taxi driver , McQueen started as an apprentice at in Savile Row at the age of 16 , where he made suits for Prince Charles .
He was famously first discovered as a designer in the 90s by Isabella Blow , the style guru and fashion director of Tatler , who killed herself in May 2007 by taking weed killer after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer .
She bought all the clothes he made for his graduate show for £ 5,000 .
They were delivered to her in black binliners .
With his ultra-short hair and Doc Marten boots and his penchant for shock tactics in his early catwalk shows , he was initially the ' enfant terrible ' of the fashion world .
There was a stir when he was made head designer at Givenchy in 1996 , succeeding John Galliano .
He later joined forces with Gucci , who bought 51 per cent of his company .
His hugely successful career brought him numerous awards , including British designer of the year four times between 1996 and 2003 and the International Designer of the Year at the Council of Fashion Designer Awards .
He received an CBE in 2003 .
Openly gay , McQueen once described himself as the ' pink sheep of the family ' .
He once said : ' I was sure of myself and my sexuality and I 've got nothing to hide .
I went straight from my mother 's womb onto the gay parade . '
He married his partner , film - maker George Forsyth in 2000 on a yacht owned by the prince of Gambia in Ibiza .
Close friend Kate Moss was a bridesmaid .
But , according to an interview with the New York Times last February , he was single again and had started seeing a porn star - identified only by ' his porn nom de famille Mr Stag ' .

Within minutes of the Mail breaking the news of his death this afternoon , Twitter was awash with thousands of stunned posts .
Leading lights of the fashion world also began to pay tribute , led by Moss .
A statement released on her behalf said : ' Kate is shocked and devastated at the tragic loss of her dear friend Lee McQueen .
Her thoughts are with his family at this sad time . '
Alexandra Shulman , editor of Vogue , said : ' Lee McQueen influenced a whole generation of designers .
His brilliant imagination knew no bounds as he conjured up collection after collection of extraordinary designs .
' At one level , he was a master of the fantastic , creating astounding fashion shows that mixed design , technology and performance and on another he was a modern - day genius whose gothic aesthetic was adopted by women the world over .
His death is the hugest loss to anyone who knew him and for very many who did n't . '
Sue Whiteley his former CEO at McQueen said : ' This is devastating news .
He was an unforgettable part of my life .
He was a talent who was beyond others .
People who worked with him would give 100 per cent and more because he was totally inspiring .
This is an unimaginable loss for the fashion world .
' He was able to bring creativity to whatever he turns his hand to , from perfume bottles to every piece of clothing .
It is a dark , dark day to hear this news .
he was a British icon in fashion whose loss is unimaginable . '

Designer Katherine Hamnett said : ' He was a genius .
What a terrible , tragic waste . '
Dolce & Gabbana said : ' We are deeply touched for the sudden death of Alexander McQueen , a designer whom we have always admired for his creative genius and unmatched inspiration .
He leaves the fashion world with an unfillable void . '
Designer Matthew Williamson said : ' I am shocked and deeply saddened by McQueen 's death .
He was a genius and his talent was second to none .
Like many others , I always cited him as a hugely inspirational leader of world fashion .
He will be greatly missed .'
Victoria Beckham , who is frequently photographed wearing McQueen designs , said : ' McQueen was a master of fashion , creative genius and an inspiration .
' Today the fashion industry has lost a true great .
An icon of all time .
He made all he touched beautiful and will be desperately missed .
' My heart is very much with his family and friends at this very sad time . '
McQueen with his CBE outside Buckingham Palace in October 2003
A spokesman for the magazine publisher Conde Nast described the news as ' so sad ' and said the company was ' quite devastated ' .
The British Fashion Council said : ' We are deeply saddened at the news of Alexander McQueen 's untimely death .
He was a unique talent and one of the world 's greatest designers .
Our thoughts are with his friends and family at this sad time . '
Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw added : ' Alexander McQueen made an outstanding contribution to British fashion .
His extraordinary talent and creativity mean that his designs are adored not just by followers of haute couture but lovers of great style everywhere .
This is a great loss to one of Britain 's most successful industries and to the design world more widely . '
Fashion consultant Alice Smith , who arrived at McQueen 's home with a bunch of flowers today , said : ' I have known Alexander since his first collection .
He was a lovely man and the best fashion designer in the world .
' No one can beat him , no one will ever be as good as him .
He was a charming man but also quite fragile . '
The designer was the youngest of six children .
He left school at 16 and went to work at Savile Row ’s Anderson & Sheppard , whose clients included Prince Charles and Mikhail Gorbachev , after he saw a television program about the apprentice shortage in traditional tailoring .
He went on to work for Gieves & Hawkes , theatre ’s famous Angels & Bermans costumiers , and then worked in Japan and Italy .
He returned to London in 1994 , hoping to work as a pattern cutter tutor at London ’s prestigious Central Saint Martins fashion school .
Thanks to the strength of his portfolio , he was persuaded to enrol in the course himself .
After graduating McQueen set up his own label based in the East End of London and it was then that he was spotted by Blow .
McQueen was forced to deny rumours of a rift between the pair at the time of her death , saying : ‘ It ’s so much b******s.
These people just do n’t know what they ’re talking about .
They do n’t know me .
They do n’t know my relationship with Isabella .
It ’s complete bull ****.
' People can talk ; you can ask her sisters . …
That part of the industry , they should stay away from my life , or mine and Isabella ’s life .
What I had with Isabella was completely disassociated from fashion , beyond fashion . ’

The invites to the show were poster - size illustrations Richard Gray .
It depicts a triumphant Blow , in a McQueen dress and a Philip Treacy headdress , in a horse - drawn carriage ascending to heaven .
Miss Blow had said : ' My relationship with McQueen began in 1994 , when I went to a Saint Martins graduate show .
I could n't get a seat , so I sat on the stairs and I was just watching , when I suddenly thought : I really like those clothes , they are amazing .
It was his first collection .
‘ It was the tailoring and the movement which initially drew me to them .
I tried to get hold of him and I kept calling his mother , but he was on holiday .
She kept saying : ' He 's not here , he 's not here . '
She told him : ' This crazy person is trying to get hold of you . '
I eventually got to meet him and I decided to buy the collection : I bought one thing a month and paid him £ 100 a week .
He 'd bring an outfit in a bin liner , I 'd look at it and then he'd come to the cashpoint with me . ’
Lehman bankruptcy report exposes Wall Street criminality
15 March 2010
A report released March 11 by a bankruptcy court - appointed examiner concludes that in the months leading up to its September 2008 collapse , the Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers issued financial statements that were “ materially misleading ” and its top executives engaged in “ actionable balance sheet manipulation . ”
The 2,200 - page document details accounting fraud on a massive scale , involving secret transactions that enabled the bank to falsify its level of debt and conceal the scale of its losses from toxic mortgage - linked assets .
Lehman ’s collapse on September 15 , 2008 sparked a global crash of credit markets , which was used by the US government and governments around the world to justify the outlay of trillions of dollars in public funds to bail out the banking system .
The financial crisis precipitated the deepest recession since the 1930s , wiping out millions of jobs .
Now , governments are imposing brutal austerity measures to make the working class pay for the bankrupting of state treasuries for the benefit of the bankers and speculators .
The Lehman report demonstrates that workers ’ jobs , homes , wages and life savings , as well as their access to health care , education and even such rudimentary necessities as light and heat , are being sacrificed to pay for the criminality of the financial elite , which has further enriched itself from the catastrophe of its own making .
In the wake of the report ’s release , major Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have expressed shock over the Lehman revelations and averred that they never employed the accounting dodges used by their former competitor .
One is reminded of the film Casablanca , in which Captain Renault declares his “ shock ” at discovering gambling in Rick ’s casino .
All of the major banks employed intricate schemes , such as “ structured investment vehicles , ” to shift their losses off of their balance sheets , and made billions by repackaging what they knew to be dubious sub - prime loans and selling them as “ collateralized debt obligations . ”
Lehman ’s practices have been exposed only because it was the weakest of the big Wall Street firms and was forced into bankruptcy , in large part because its bigger rivals , smelling blood , took aggressive actions to push their struggling rival over the edge .
According to the examiner ’s report , Lehman specialized in vastly overvaluing its mortgage - backed securities and manipulating its books to produce end - of - quarter financial reports that concealed its true level of indebtedness .
As the author of the report , Anton R. Valukas of the law firm Jenner & Block , put it : “ Unbeknownst to the investing public , rating agencies , government regulators , and Lehman ’s board of directors , Lehman reverse engineered the firm ’s net leverage ratio for public consumption . ”
The bank ’s major accounting gimmick was known internally as “ Repo 105 . ” Repos , short for repurchasing agreements , are a standard practice on Wall Street .
To obtain short - term cash to fund operations , a bank will borrow from another bank , giving that bank some of its assets with the stipulation that it will buy back the assets within a set number of days .
For accounting purposes , such transactions are recorded as financings , not sales , and the assets that are shifted , often overnight , remain on the balance sheet of the bank doing the borrowing .
Lehman , however , valued its repo assets at 105 percent or more of the cash it received , and on that basis recorded its “ repo 105 ’s ” as sales ―moving bad debts off of its balance sheet just long enough to doctor its quarterly financial reports .
According to the examiner , Lehman by such means shed $ 39 billion from its balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007 , $ 49 billion in the first quarter of 2008 , and $ 50 billion in the second quarter .
The accounting scam was so smelly that Lehman was unable to find a US law firm that would sign off on its legality .
In the end , it retained a British firm that sanctioned the maneuver as legitimate under British law .
Lehman had to conduct its “ Repo 105 ” operations through its London - based branch and shift funds from the US to Europe to carry out the deals .
Valukas asserts that CEO Richard S. Fuld Jr. and three chief financial officers knew of and approved the shady transactions , and the bank ’s auditor , accounting firm Ernst & Young , covered up for the executives .
The examiner concludes that the four executives breached their “ fiduciary duty ” to Lehman ’s shareholders and board of directors , and adds that there is “ sufficient evidence ” to support a legal claim that Fuld was “ at least grossly negligent . ”
The examiner ’s report further details the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in allowing Lehman to exchange worthless securities for public funds from March of 2008 , when Bear Stearns collapsed and was taken over by JPMorgan Chase in a deal subsidized by the Fed , to September of that year , when Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection .
The president of the New York Fed at the time was Timothy Geithner .
Obama rewarded Geithner for his services as chief bagman for Wall Street by making him his treasury secretary .
Neither Fuld , whose compensation for 2007 totaled $ 22 million , nor any other Lehman executive has been prosecuted for their crimes .
Nor has any other top executive on Wall Street .
In response to the greatest social catastrophe since the Great Depression , the Obama administration and the Democratic - led Congress have rejected any serious reform of the financial system .
They have held no one accountable for plunging the US and the world into an economic disaster .
Instead , they have devoted their efforts to covering the bad debts of the financial oligarchs and enabling them to expand their swindling and increase their wealth .
The Lehman story is not an aberration .
Corruption , fraud , criminality are not simply the results of a few “ bad apples , ” or merely the expression of the subjectively determined depravity of certain executives .
The collusion of all official institutions ―the White House , Congress , the regulatory agencies , the media―testifies to the systemic character of financial gangsterism .
The criminality of Wall Street is rooted in the crisis and contradictions of the capitalist system .
Financial parasitism on an unprecedented scale , with all of its noxious corollaries ―increasing social inequality , imperialist war and political reaction ―is a manifestation of the putrefaction of the profit system , above all in its center , the United States .
The working class needs to draw the appropriate conclusions .
The financial executives whose fraudulent practices played a role in precipitating the economic disaster must be prosecuted .
Their ill - gotten wealth must be expropriated and used to provide relief for the unemployed and ensure the provision of basic social needs .
The banking system must be nationalized and run as a pubic utility under the democratic control of the working population .
It is not a matter of reforming the system , but building an international socialist movement to consign it to the dustbin of history where it has long belonged .

Baltimore Judge Marries Accused Abuser to Victim During Trial to Avoid Testimony Judge agreed to marriage so alleged victim would n't have to testify .
March 17 , 2010  -- A Baltimore County judge has been reassigned after pausing the trial of an accused batterer to marry him to his alleged victim so she could avoid testifying against him .
Judge Darrell Russell Jr. , the Baltimore County District Court judge assigned to the non-jury trial , performed the wedding ceremony in his chambers for defendant Frederick Wood and his girlfriend .
Prosecutors say they were powerless to stop it .
" It 's very frustrating .
We view very seriously the crime of domestic violence , " Deputy State 's Attorney Leo Ryan said .
" We understand that very often the nature of this crime means the victims are reluctant to testify . "
As a parting comment , according to an audio recording of the proceedings , Russell left the new groom with these sentiments :
" Mr. Wood , I found you not guilty , so I can't sentence you as a defendant in any crimes ... but earlier today , I sentenced you to life married to her . "
A spokeswoman for the Maryland Judiciary Office of Communications and Public Affairs confirmed today that Russell has been indefinitely reassigned and will no longer be allowed to preside over domestic violence cases .
" Effective today Judge Russell has been reassigned to chambers meaning he will not be hearing any cases at all , and the work that he 'll be doing in chambers is reviewing motions and civil cases , " Angelita Plemmer said .
The reassignment was ordered by District Court Chief Judge Ben Clyburn .
Both Wood , 29 , and his girlfriend , a 27 - year - old mother of two young sons whose name is being withheld , were in court last week for Wood 's trial on a misdemeanor second - degree assault charge stemming from a Nov. 29 incident at their home .
According to police reports , the woman told police that Wood picked a fight with her at 4 a.m. , smacking her in the face and kicking her in the side .
As the alleged assault continued , she told police , Wood banged her head into the wall and dragged her though the house before she was able to flee .
Domestic Violence Bride Reported That New Husband Tried to Kill Her
The responding police officer " found several visible injuries to victim ... including a bloody nose and a swollen left side of her face near her eye . "
A long red mark was also photographed on the woman 's neck .
The officer also compiled a report called a " domestic violence lethality screen " in which the woman said she thought he might try to kill her and that he has threatened to kill her and / or her children in the past .
She also answered " yes " on several more questions , including whether he has access to a gun , whether he 's ever tried to strangle or choke her and whether he 's ever spied on her or left threatening messages .
The guns , she later told authorities , were hunting rifles kept in a safe .
The screen also noted that Wood is unemployed , controlling and has tried to kill himself .
She was also recorded telling police , " He said he wants to kill me . "
Neither Wood nor the woman could be reached for comment .
By the time the case made it to Russell 's courtroom , however , the couple was outwardly ready to get hitched .
Ryan said the trial began with Assistant Public Defender Phillip Heller calling for a postponement " for the explicit purpose to allow the victim and defendant to marry so the victim could invoke her marital privilege . "
Maryland law states that a spouse is not legally required to testify against the other spouse .
District Public Defender Thelma Triplin declined to comment on Heller 's actions and Heller could also not be reached at his home or by e-mail .
Russell referred all comments to Plemmer 's office .
Ryan , who was not in court that day but has been brief by Assistant State 's Attorney Christina Cuomo , said the defense lawyer at one point asked Cuomo to put the case in a " stet docket , " which essentially renders a case inactive , but not decided .
Cuomo , he said , refused .
" She was adamant about prosecuting the case , " he said .
After Heller made his request , the judge offered to solve the defense attorney 's problem .
" He told the defense attorney that there was no need to postpone the case , " Ryan said .
" That they could go to Towson , get a marriage license and come back and he would marry them that day . "
Judge Marries Alleged Victim , Puts Her on Stand Minutes Later
Wood and his betrothed were excused for the 25 minute drive to the Towson court to get a marriage license and were married back in Russell 's chambers a short time later .
Once the trial reconvened , his new bride was immediately put on the witness stand .
" She invokes her marital privilege so there 's no evidence in the case .
And the judge finds him not guilty , " Ryan said .
Whether anyone files a complaint against Russell remains to be seen .
A spokesman for the Maryland Commission on Judicial Disabilities said complaints against any judge are confidential until that judge is publicly charged .
There are no public actions on record for Russell .

link Guinness Chocolate Pudding or Chocolate Guinness Goodness By Heather Baird Thursday , March 11 , 2010 Thursday , March 11 , 2010 Guinness Chocolate Pudding or Chocolate Guinness Goodness Recipe ByPublished :
Everywhere I look food bloggers are preparing celebratory dishes for St. Patrick 's day in the same way , with Guinness !
While I claim to love everything , ( it 's a growing problem ) I have to say that extra dark stout beers are not high on the list .
The last dark beer I tried was on the aforementioned ( previous post ) Scotland trip , and I did n't even drink half of what was given to me .
It was good , but so filling !
Afterward , I felt like I had eaten a large , yeasty piece of bread .
My husband on the other hand , likes them just fine .
When I saw this recipe for chocolate pudding made with Guinness I knew it would be something we both could appreciate .
The recipe comes from epicurious.com .
There 's a nice little write - up from the chef who concocted it and dubbed it " Chocolate Guinness Goodness " .
You 'll find it here under " editor 's note " .
The finished dessert mimics a frothy pint of stout .
Using a 70 - ish % dark chocolate will yield the nicest dark stout appearance .
I 'm not quite sure if my chocolate had the right percentage of cacao .
I had several unmarked blocks in my stash so I just used what looked darkest .
I like the ease and simplicity of this recipe .
The main players are the usual : egg yolks , sugar and cream .
The cream and stout are cooked together in a sauce pan until slightly bubbly , but not boiling .
The chopped dark chocolate is then added to the hot cream and stout mixture .
I added a little dark cocoa powder for extra color and also because I was n't sure if my chocolate was dark enough .
I think both colorflavor turned out really nice !
One thing that I altered slightly was the topping ( or " froth " ) that consists of freshly whipped cream and a Guinness reduction .
For me , leaving this component unsweetened was really off - putting .
It had a yeasty , flat taste that I just could n't get off my tongue .
I added 3 tablespoons of sugar and it became much more harmonious with the sweetened chocolate pudding .
The topping is definitely the most Guinness - like tasting portion of this dessert .
If you are serving this to little ones , you may want to make a plain vanilla topping and forgo the Guinness reduction completely .
The Guinness reduction is really quite beautiful to look at .
After about 20 minutes of simmering , the stout becomes a rich amber color and a little syrupy in consistency .
To me , the chocolate pudding portion tastes much like a brownie .
It 's strange , the Guinness adds a certain something .... something I cannot adequately explain .
I would never know I was having stout with my pudding , if it were not for the cream topping .
This recipe is certainly a keeper .
My picky husband likes it and I 'm sure that those passionate about stouts will love it too .
I think Guinness just got a little higher on my " love " list .
However , at the top of the list is my favorite Black - and - Tan ...... who could n't be bothered to lift his head for a photograph !
He had this comment : " zzzzzzzzzzzzz " .

Fast Matrix Products and Other Amazing Results
Some amazing mathematical results
Volker Strassen has won many prizes for his terrific work in computational complexity — including the Cantor medal , the Paris Kanellakis Award , and most recently the Knuth Prize .
He is perhaps most famous for this brilliant work on matrix multiplication , but he has done so many important things — others may have their own favorites .
Today I plan on talking about some amazing results .
Two are classic results due to Strassen , and the third is a recent result related to boolean matrix products .
I will have to do another longer discussion on “ Amazing Mathematical Results . ”
I need to think , first , how I would define them — for today I will just give three examples .
Fast Matrix Product
Strassen ’s 1969 result Gaussian Elimination is not Optimal shows , of course , a way to multiply two matrices in time order instead of the classic cubic method .
This is certainly an amazing result — it came as a shock to everyone that the classic method was not optimal .
Strassen ’s fast matrix algorithm launched a thousand results ; today many of the best algorithms for X are obtained by reducing X to matrix products .
As a consequence , it is quite common to see algorithms which run in time , for instance , where is the exponent of the fastest known matrix multiplication algorithm .
The current best matrix product algorithm is now due to Don Coppersmith and Shmuel Winograd , and runs in time .
I must mention the brilliant work of Henry Cohn , Robert Kleinberg , Balázs Szegedy and Christopher Umans who can reduce the search for faster matrix algorithms to certain group theory questions .
I will discuss their work another time .
There is a story — I believe is true — how Strassen found his terrific algorithm .
He was trying to prove that the naive cubic algorithm is optimal .
A natural idea was to try and prove first the case of two by two matrices — one by one matrices are trivial .
One day he suddenly realized , if there was a way to multiply two by two matrices with multiplications rather than , there would be a sub-cubic recursive method for by .
He immediately sat down and quickly discovered his now famous formulas .
At least this is the story .
All For The Price of One
Strassen also has another amazing result , in my opinion , on arithmetic circuits — this is joint work with Walter Baur .
They have used this result to get some tight lower bounds on arithmetic computations .
In 1983 they proved their result about the arithmetic straight - line complexity of polynomials : let denote the minimum number of basic arithmetic operations needed to compute the multi-variate polynomial , and let
denote the minimum number of operations needed to compute the polynomials , , , and so on , all at the same time .
As usual is the partial derivative of with respect to the variable .
The amazing result they prove is :
Theorem :
For any polynomial ,
Thus , the cost of computing is almost the same as the cost of computing and all of its first order partial derivatives .
Getting functions for the “ price ” of one seems surprising to me .
This result has been used to get lower bounds : this was why Baur and Strassen proved their result .
The general method is this :
Argue the cost of computing is .
is .
Then , reduce computing these polynomials to computing and all its partial derivatives , for some .
polynomials to computing and all its partial derivatives , for some .
This implies by Baur - Strassen ’s theorem , the cost of must be at least .
The critical point is proving a lower bound on the cost of one polynomial may be hard , but proving a lower bound on the cost of polynomials may be possible .
This is the magic of their method .
Finding Triangles
Virginia Vassilevska Williams and Ryan Williams have proved a number of surprising results about various matrix products and triangle detection .
One of the long standing open questions is what is the complexity of determining if a graph has a triangle ?
That is does the graph have three distinct vertices so that
One way to detect this is to use matrix product — invoke Strassen , now Coppersmith - Winograd .
Another approach is combinatorial .
It is easy to see that there is an algorithm that runs in time order
Of course , this can be as large as cubic in the number of vertices .
What Williams and Williams consider is the following question : is there a relationship between detecting triangles and computing boolean matrix products ?
They also consider the same type of question between boolean matrix verification and boolean matrix products .
The surprise is that the ability to detect triangles or the ability to verify boolean products , can also be used to compute boolean matrix products .
What is so surprising about this is these both return a single bit , while matrix product computes many bits .
How can a single bit help compute many bits ?
The simple answer is that it cannot — not without some additional insight .
Their insight is that the algorithms can be used over and over , and in this manner be used to speedup the naive boolean matrix product .
One Bit , Two Bits , Three Bits , Bits
Let me give a bit more details on what they prove , not on how they prove it .
See their paper for the full details .
Since they prove many theorems , I will state just one .
Theorem : Suppose Boolean matrix product verification can be done in time for some .
Then graph triangle detection on - node graphs can be done in time .
Note , matrix product verification is simple with randomness , but boolean matrix product seems much harder to check .
Recall , to check that for by matrices , pick a random vector .
Then , check
This can be done in time .
Open Problems
The main open problems are of course to finally resolve the exponent on matrix product — is it possible to multiply in ?
Also the Williams results show there are very interesting connections between checking and computing .
I think more can be proved in this direction .

As voters lose patience with political gridlock , the Obama administration is embarking on a strategy aimed at putting Republicans on the spot :
Either participate in bipartisan exchanges initiated by the president , or be portrayed as the party of obstruction .
The new approach is part of a series of adjustments the White House is making as it deals with the aftermath of Republican Scott Brown ’s victory in Massachusetts , which cost Democrats their filibuster - proof majority in the Senate .
Right now , it ’s not clear voters blame one party more than the other for paralysis in Washington .
A recent poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal showed that voters are as apt to blame congressional Republicans as Democrats for the standoff .
Virtually everyone surveyed agreed there is too much infighting in the capital .
In a flurry of recent public appearances , President Obama has sent a message that he is prepared to embrace GOP ideas .
But he is also signaling that if Republicans balk at compromise , he ’ll exact a political price .
Republicans , said White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer , “ have a role to play in solving problems in this country , or be accountable to the electorate for choosing not to . ”
Republicans do n’t see Obama ’s overtures as sincere .
They view with particular suspicion Obama ’s invitation to hash out differences on healthcare at a televised meeting Thursday .
Republicans who boycott the gathering risk looking obstinate .
But showing up is n’t a winning strategy either , some Republicans caution .
They fear the format is one that guarantees the president will appear the statesman .
“ When you ’re the president , you have the loudest microphone and clearest TV camera , ” said Mark Corallo , a Republican strategist .
“ You get to stand up and look reasonable , bipartisan and leader - like .
And anyone else ends up . . . looking like a petty partisan who is just interested in saying no .
There ’s no upside for the Republicans in even attending the healthcare summit . ”
Obama has been busy on other fronts positioning himself as the seeker of bipartisan solutions to the nation ’s problems .
Last week he named GOP former Sen .
Alan Simpson of Wyoming as co-chairman of a commission that will look for ways to curb the trillion - dollar deficit .
He also announced billions of dollars in federal loan guarantees promoting nuclear power , an energy source that many Republicans see as a solution to the country ’s electricity needs .
In a recent news conference , Obama said he was open to giving ground in exchange for GOP support for his energy plan , which is foundering in the Senate .
“ I ’m willing to move off some of the preferences of my party in order to meet them halfway , ” the president said .
“ But there ’s got to be some give from their side as well . ”
An administration official said that in coming months , the White House would be quicker to point out instances of what he described as Republican intransigence .
Though the White House has long believed that Republicans were committed to derailing Obama ’s agenda , officials will be more aggressive in making the case .
“ The Massachusetts election obliterated the argument that we could [ govern ] all on our own , ” said the administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly .
“ What we ’re doing now is actively reaching out and demonstrating our interest in bipartisanship -- but not passively standing by if Republicans are not willing to meet us halfway . ”
The White House will be relying on a wider network of people to drive home its message .
As part of its retooled communications strategy , more Cabinet secretaries will be in front of the cameras to defend the administration ’s record .
The plan is already on display .
Cabinet members fanned out across the country on the anniversary of the $ 787 - billion stimulus package being signed into law , touting projects now underway and countering GOP criticism that the bill was a waste of money that did little to curb unemployment .
Last year , by contrast , Obama often carried the administration ’s message alone .
“ There was a reluctance to hand off the ball , ” said the White House official .

Courts will consider the motivation for the offence when sentencing A new law has come into force to tackle hate crimes against gay or disabled people .
The act puts hate crimes against disabled or lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people on the same footing as racist incidents .
The legislation was put forward by Green MSP Patrick Harvie in 2008 .
Its implementation comes the day after a survey by the Stonewall charity suggested one - third of Scotland 's gay community has been physically attacked .
According to the poll , two - thirds of LGBT people have been verbally abused , but 88 % did not report it to the police .
Only four out of ten people who had been physically attacked told the authorities .
The Offences Aggravated by Prejudice ( Scotland )
Act brings Scotland into line with the rest of the UK by widening the definition of hate crimes .
Patrick Harvie 's member 's bill won cross-party support
It means courts must take into account the motivation for the offence , which may result in a more severe sentence .
Mr Harvie 's member 's bill gained cross-party support when it was introduced at the Scottish parliament .
He said : " From today , perpetrators of hate crimes against disabled and LGBT Scots will be put on notice .
" Courts can now take account of the true nature of their crimes when sentencing , and the police will be gathering data to see how effectively these offences are being tackled .
" Personally , I am also delighted to see Scotland 's first Green - initiated legislation go onto the statute books , and I have been pleased to work very closely with the Scottish government on the issue . "
' Same footing ' Labour 's justice spokesman Richard Baker said : " We need to send a clear message that hate crime will be dealt with with the full force of the law .
" It is clear too many victims of hate crime do not feel confident in coming forward and reporting hate crime because they do not believe it will make a difference - that needs to change .
" The new legislation will give sentencers greater powers and I hope that victims will feel that if they come forward they will get the support they need . "
Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said : " There is no excuse for any form of hate crime ; it is simply not acceptable and it will not be tolerated .
" When it does happen , victims must have the confidence to report it , confident that they will receive a good level of service from the police and other agencies .
" That is exactly why we 've got this new legislation coming into force which will rightly put these kinds of crimes on the same footing as racist incidents . "

The school has held the trip to Craggan annually A school trip for about 70 pupils has been cancelled because of potential legal action over the exclusion of a disabled child in the group .
The stay at an outdoor activity centre in the Cairngorms has been held annually for children at Inverness 's Crown Primary .
Highland Council has cancelled the trip to Craggan to avoid the action .
The girl 's mother Donna Williamson said her daughter was physically unable to take part in the activities planned .
She told BBC Scotland : " She cannot hold a bow and arrow for example , or go kayaking , because she has no upper body strength .
In the New Year there will be a concerted effort to provide an appropriate out - of - school excursion for all the children
Highland Council spokeswoman
" My daughter would have been excluded in that she would have had to stay in the centre while all the kids went off to do the activities .
" When she was n't in the centre she would have been asked to film them kayaking and doing the things she would love to do but she cannot do and I thought that was psychologically a pretty cruel thing to ask a child to do . "
Another parent at the school , Donald Mackenzie , said he was worried the situation could lead to other activities such as music lessons being stopped .
He said there had be a " little bit of give and take " and the activities the children had expected to take part in were not themselves wrong .
Danny Alexander , Liberal Democrat MP for Inverness , Nairn , Badenoch and Strathspey , said he hoped the trip could still go ahead .
He said : " I think it is very sad that the Disability Discrimination Act has been interpreted in this overzealous way by Highland Council given the efforts that the school made to make reasonable adjustments to the trip . "
' Tried hard '
An alternative trip to Glasgow has also been cancelled by Highland Council .
A council spokeswoman said : " In the light of legal advice relating to aspects of the Disability Discrimination Act and subsequent amendments , the decision was taken to cancel two trips organised by the school .
" The school has tried hard to accommodate the needs of pupils , but such is the complexity of the legislation governing disability discrimination that the council felt it had no alternative at this stage . "
She added : " In the new year there will be a concerted effort to provide an appropriate out - of - school excursion for all the children . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Toyota Motor Corp apologized for letting safety standards slip during a period of fast growth and vowed to respond more quickly to consumer complaints as two days of congressional hearings crucial to the automaker ’s reputation began on Tuesday .
President Akio Toyoda said he was “ deeply sorry ” for accidents caused by safety problems with Toyota vehicles and detailed a set of reforms that would shift control of recall decisions away from the automaker ’s Japanese headquarters .
The world ’s largest automaker is seeking to repair damage over unintended acceleration and braking problems that have led to the recall of more than 8.5 million vehicles globally .
“ We pursued growth over the speed at which we were able to develop our people and our organization , and we should sincerely be mindful of that , ” Toyoda said in written testimony for a hearing scheduled for Wednesday .
Toyota ’s recent safety problems revolve around sticky accelerators , accelerators that can be pinned down by loose floor mats and a braking glitch affecting its hybrid models .
But many lawmakers , some Toyota owners and safety experts fear Toyota ’s current recalls do not cover all complaints of runaway acceleration and also want reforms at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Rhonda Smith , driver of a Toyota Lexus in a 2006 incident where her car reached 100 mph , told lawmakers on Tuesday she felt Toyota and NHTSA had dismissed her belief that the vehicle ’s electronics were to blame .
“ Shame on you , Toyota , for being so greedy .
And shame on you , NHTSA , for not doing your job , ” Smith , who at times was tearful , told the House Energy and Commerce Committee panel .
Toyota ’s top- ranking U.S. executive , Jim Lentz , arrived for Tuesday ’s hearing in a silver 2010 Toyota Highlander SUV , one of the vehicles subject to the sticky accelerator recall .
“ We now understand that we must think differently when investigating complaints and communicate faster , better and more effectively with our customers and our regulators , ” said Lentz , Toyota ’s U.S. sales chief .
Under questioning , Lentz agreed that 70 percent of complaints about unintended acceleration remained unexplained .
“ That is probably fair to say , ” he said .
“ There are many factors that lead to it . ”
U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said he would hold Toyoda to his assurance that the carmaker is working to address all safety issues .
MOST DIRECT APOLOGY
Toyoda , grandson of Toyota ’s founder , is to testify on Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
The sprawling investigation into Toyota ’s safety problems and the automaker ’s response now includes a criminal probe by U.S. prosecutors and requests for information from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
In his written testimony , Toyoda apologized to the surviving family of Mark Saylor , an off - duty California Highway Patrol officer , who was killed along with three members of his family last August .
It was the most personal and direct apology so far from Toyoda , who has appeared uncomfortable with the media spotlight and initially resisted calls to testify before lawmakers .
The unintended acceleration problems with Toyota vehicles have been linked to at least five U.S. deaths , with 29 other fatality reports being examined by U.S. authorities .
Several lawmakers at Tuesday ’s hearing criticized Toyota ’s resistance to probing whether its electronic throttle systems can suffer from electromagnetic interference ( EMI ) .
“ Toyota ’s leadership has been ambiguous about whether these two recalls fully account for and address the problem of sudden unintended acceleration , ” said Rep. Bart Stupak , the Michigan Democrat who chairs the oversight and investigations subcommittee .
Henry Waxman , the California Democrat who chairs the full commerce committee , called for fundamental reforms to Toyota ’s leadership and said reforming NHTSA would require legislation .

“ There is no evidence that Toyota or the government agency NHTSA took a serious look at the possibility that electronic defects could be causing the problem , ” Waxman said .
He said Toyota did not initiate a study into possible electronic defects until two months ago and NHTSA does not have an electrical or software engineer on staff .
David Gilbert , a professor of auto technology at Southern Illinois University Carbondale , said he had found a possible flaw in the electronic throttle system on Toyota vehicles .
But Steve Buyer , a Republican from Indiana , said Gilbert ’s financial ties to pending Toyota lawsuits undermined his objectivity .
Lentz said Toyota engineers in Japan had told him that there was no evidence of any flaw with the automaker ’s electronic controls .
Toyota has only begun working with an outside consultancy , Exponent , whose work was singled out for criticism as incomplete by Waxman .

Several Republicans on the committee cautioned that Toyota should not be subject to an unfair grilling .
Texas Republican Michael Burgess said U.S. government ownership of General Motors posed an “ inherent conflict of interest ” in assessing Toyota .
The U.S. Treasury assumed a majority stake in GM last year in return for bailout money and bankruptcy financing .
PR DISASTER
Adding to the Japanese automaker ’s deepening crisis , documents surfaced over the past two days which detail how Toyota beat back U.S. safety regulators ’ efforts for a wider probe in 2007 .
Aaron Bragman , an analyst at IHS Global Insight , said the situation looked likely to get worse this week for Toyota .
“ From a public relations standpoint , this has been an unmitigated disaster from the start for Toyota , handled poorly by a team unfamiliar with major public relations catastrophes , ” Bragman said .
Mike Jackson , chief executive of AutoNation Inc , was one of several hundred Toyota dealers and workers who came to Washington on Tuesday as part of a campaign organized by the automaker to help win back popular and political support .
“ I ’m certain that once the vehicles have been repaired and production has resumed that going into March and April , that ( Toyota ’s ) sales will recover , ” Jackson told Reuters Insider .
In the wake of Toyota ’s massive recall , Consumers Union , the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports , issued a call on Tuesday for urgent changes to strengthen U.S. auto safety regulation .
It said that the U.S. safety regulatory system should be reformed to become more transparent and that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should have more funding and the ability to impose tougher sanctions .
Toyota ’s U.S. shares were down 1.9 percent at $ 71.58 late on Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China has an estimated 50 or fewer tigers left living in the wild , but efforts to stabilize one population in the bleak northeast are starting to pay off , a conservationist said on Monday .

Tigers once roamed huge swathes of China , right up to the now booming east coast .
Their population has collapsed due to habitat destruction on the back of rapid economic development and poaching for tiger products to use in traditional medicine .
About 10 still live in the southwestern province of Yunnan , some 15 in Tibet , and 20 or so in northwestern Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces , said Xie Yan , China Country Program Director of the Wildlife Conservation Society .
The South China Tiger is probably already extinct , she told the Foreign Correspondents Club of China , ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year of the Tiger , which starts on Sunday .
“ The number of wild tigers left in China is very depressing , ” Xie said .
“ We have less than 50 individuals in the wild .
The populations in Tibet and in the south are still dropping .
“ The northeast tiger is now stable , and maybe increasing a little , but the number is still very small , ” she added .
SKIN AND BONES TRADE
Conservationists say the trade in skin and bones is booming in countries such as China , which has banned the use of tiger parts in medicine but where everything from fur and whiskers to eyeballs and bones are still used .
Skins sell as rugs and cloaks on the black market , fetching up to $ 20,000 for a single pelt .
Activists say tough laws and occasional well - publicized clampdowns cannot compensate for a crucial problem -- the lack of strong and consistent enforcement .
Barely 3,500 tigers are estimated to be roaming wild across 12 Asian countries and Russia , compared with about 100,000 a century ago , conservationists say .
In December , a Yunnan court sentenced a man to 12 years in jail for killing and eating what may have been the last wild Indochinese tiger in China .
The Indochinese tiger is also on the brink of extinction , with fewer than 1,000 left in the forests of Laos , Vietnam , Cambodia , Thailand and Myanmar .
Xie said the Tibetan and Yunnan tigers have the bleakest futures , as their populations are both tiny and isolated .
The northeast tigers , though small in number in China , are far more numerous just across the border in Russia , where around 500 still live in an area with a far lighter human presence .
“ We think that the best hope for wild tigers in China is in the northeast , because it is connected to the bigger population in Russia , ” she added .
“ The rest of the populations are too small and not connected , ” Xie said of the Yunnan and Tibet tigers .
From the standpoint of short - term political strategy , the Republicans have played their cards perfectly .
Their slow withdrawal of any support excised the maximum political damage by forcing all Senate Democrats to agree , rendering the bill partisan and subjecting it to months of slow - bleed legislative wrangling .
The Republicans will probably pick up more seats in November than they would have if they had pursued a bipartisan accord .
But the policy costs have been significant .
As I wrote last December , " The Republicans may gain some more seats in 2010 by their total obstruction , but the substantive policy defeat they 've been dealt will last for decades . "
David Frum chimes in , " Legislative majorities come and go .
This healthcare bill is forever .
A win in November is very poor compensation for this debacle now . "
The funny thing is that this policy disaster was avoidable for Republicans .
Many Senate Democrats started the debate believing that a bipartisan accord was the only morally legitimate path to major legislative change , and desperately hoping for bipartisan cover as they undertook wrenching change to the status quo .
If they had put a compromise bill on the table , moderate Democrats would have leaped at the offer , and it would have taken just one Democrat to make such a deal and kill comprehensive reform .
The Republicans had another chance last month when President Obama convened a bipartisan health care summit .
If some Republicans had come forward with a meet - you - halfway plan , or even meet - you - quarter - way plan , Democrats would have been in a bind .
They let the opportunity pass .
Why ?
Frum writes :
There were leaders who knew better , who would have liked to deal .
But they were trapped .
Conservative talkers on Fox and talk radio had whipped the Republican voting base into such a frenzy that deal - making was rendered impossible .
How do you negotiate with somebody who wants to murder your grandmother ?
Or – more exactly – with somebody whom your voters have been persuaded to believe wants to murder their grandmother ?
The Republican strategy of total opposition instead forced the Democrats into an all - or - nothing choice of passing a comprehensive bill or collapsing into catastrophic defeat .
( Republicans tried desperately to convince them that letting the bill die was their best political strategy , but Democrats wisely rejected this awful advice . )
Let me be clear : I 'm glad they did it .
I 'm willing to accept higher Democratic losses in exchange for a health care bill that really solves the pathologies of the health care market .
The Republican strategy was an audacious gamble , and it could have worked , but it came up empty .
Thank goodness .
East Baton Rouge Parish Mayor President Sharon Weston Broome and state officials said Wednesday that bars in the parish could re-open after a weekslong coronavirus shutdown , despite doubts raised when the Metro Council fell one vote short of passing a resolution doing so .

There has been a stunning amount of news on state cutbacks over the past few days .
Here are the top headlines .
Up To 19,000 Job cuts Projected For New York City
Massive Job Cuts Projected For NYC
It 's a game of high - stakes chicken -- with thousands of New York City jobs on the line .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg released a doomsday scenario Tuesday , saying if Albany goes through with cuts to city aid he will be forced to make massive layoffs -- possibly the worst in decades .
It 's a grim equation for a grim time .
Bloomberg said that Albany 's threatened cut of $ 1.3 billion in state aid equals the elimination of 19,000 jobs .
3,150 fewer cops
1,000 fewer firefighters , which means the closure of 42 engine companies
8,500 fewer teachers in the classrooms
The elimination of 900 sanitation workers assigned to various street cleaning duties
500 fewer parks workers
500 fewer people in the transportation department
400 fewer librarians
Christie Asks For Voluntary Wage Freezes
Gov. Christie said yesterday that he has a way for school districts to avoid layoffs even after their state and federal funding is slashed .
His solution :
Get all public school employees to agree to salary freezes for the coming year , and to contribute to their health - insurance costs .
Christie laid out his plan before a friendly audience at the library of a Somerville elementary school .
He said he would lay out details in a letter to the New Jersey School Boards Association and the New Jersey Education Association .
" We should put the children first , and that means we will have to sacrifice , " said the governor , who has often criticized the raises educators routinely received .
The increases usually were more than 4 percent .
Putting The Children First
New Jersey Cuts Workers ' Benefits
Late Monday evening , Republican Gov. Christopher Christie signed three bills that require all government employees to contribute , or contribute more , to the cost of their health - care insurance .
For new government hires , the measures limit payouts for unused sick leave , bar part - time workers from being eligible for pensions and eliminate pension benefit raises approved in 2001 .
The legislation represents a sea change in New Jersey , where many politicians in the Democratically controlled statehouse who rely on union support typically have resisted any clampdown on benefits for government workers .
Indeed , retirement benefits would often be enhanced by Democratic politicians during election years .
" We are motivating our members to respond to this in November and the elections next year , " said Steven Demofonte , recording sectary of the New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police , in an interview .
" We will show our anger at the voting booth . "
Nashville School Board Privatizes Bus Drivers And Groundskeepers
Boos erupted from the 150 or more people attending the Metro school board meeting Tuesday night as board members narrowly approved a $ 633 million budget that cuts hours for some 600 bus drivers and contracts out all janitor jobs and groundskeeping work .
As the meeting went on , the crowd became more and more agitated .
When the budget proposal passed , quiet mumblings rose to shouts .
Someone yelled , " How can you sleep at night ? "
Then , most of the audience rose and filed out of the boardroom , chanting a call for the dismissal of Schools Director Jesse Register , who put together the proposal .
Missouri Lawmakers Ponder Salary Cuts
Missouri House members are considering whether to cut salaries for state agency leaders and staff members of certain elected officials .
Republican Ryan Silvey , of Kansas City , has proposed capping salaries at $ 86,500 for state department directors and $ 80,000 for deputy directors .
Staff members for statewide elected officials could be paid a maximum $ 86,500 .
Silvey says the salary cap is based on the pay for the lieutenant governor , who receives lowest pay of all statewide officeholders .
He estimates it would save $ 1.1 million and affect salaries for 43 state workers .
Wimpy Proposal
Illinois Bill To Slash Pensions For New Workers
A bill that would sharply cut pensions for government employees is all of a sudden moving at lightning speed through the Illinois General Assembly .
But , even though it only would apply to newly hired workers , it reportedly would give huge budget relief to Chicago Public Schools , which has threatened mass teacher layoffs to fill a nearly $ 1 - billion hole .
Under terms of legislation moved to the passage stage Wednesday morning by House Speaker Michael Madigan , newly hired workers generally would be able to retire at age 67 , up from as early as 55 now .
In addition -- again , only for newly hired workers -- benefits would be capped on the average salary of eight of their last 10 years of work , compared to four of 10 years now .
And the annual inflation adjustment would be the lesser of 3 % or half of inflation , far under the 3 % minimum figure in law now .
The legislation , which may go to the House floor for a final vote on Wednesday evening , also would apply the pension only to the first $ 106,000 of annual pay .
The proposed legislation -- known as SB 1946 -- would apply to every government pension fund in the state , excluding only police and firefighters in Chicago and Downstate , according to Mr. Madigan 's spokesman .
A spokesman for AFSCME 's Illinois council termed the measure " an assault on retirement security . "
Though now limited to new workers , " We see it as opening the door to slashing pensions for existing workers , " the spokesman added .
Almost as unhappy was R. Eden Martin , president of the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club , which has been strongly pressing for pension reform .
The bill is " a small step in the right direction , " Mr. Martin said .
But by limiting its extent to new workers , the bill does almost nothing to solve today 's budget holes .
It eventually will save tens of billions of dollars for taxpayers decades in the future , he added .

California Gubernatorial Candidate Meg Whitman Says Defined Benefit Plan Era Is Over
Poll Shows Most Believe Public Unions Strain Budgets
Most likely voters in California ( 52 % ) believe public employee unions place a significant strain on the state ’s struggling budget , according to a new Rasmussen Reports telephone survey in the state .
Just 24 % disagree and say the unions are not a budget strain .
Another 24 % are undecided .
The majority of voters in the state ( 53 % ) oppose unions for public employees , while 43 % are in favor of them .
Those numbers include 19 % who are strongly in favor and 28 % who strongly oppose these unions .
Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman is focusing attacks on Democratic opponent Jerry Brown for supporting public employee unions that she contends are hurting the state ’s budget .
Anti-Union Anger Mounts In California
Senate Bill 1425 , co-authored by state Sen . Joe Simitian , D - Palo Alto , aims to curtail the problem of pension spiking amongst public employees and “ double dippers , ” those who retire with substantial pensions and then pursue similar jobs often at the same public agency .
Some estimates consider the practices a $ 100 million loss to state taxpayers .
“ I think the public is willing to pay for a decent retirement for someone with years of service , ” Simitian said .
“ I do n’t think the public wants to pay the equivalent of two full - time paychecks to someone working in the same job . ”
In 25 years of public service , Simitian has never heard the level of anger and frustration from the public on the issue as he has in the past year , he told the Daily Journal .
Simitian anticipates some pushback on his legislation but he is not the only one looking to curtail the high cost of public employee pensions .
A group has formed in Menlo Park aimed at putting a pension reform measure on the city ’s November ballot .
Citizens for Fair and Responsible Pension Reform say the current rules Menlo Park operates under in paying its employee ’s retirement cost will eventually bankrupt the city .
Under current rules , an employee can receive 81 percent of his salary for life starting at age 55 .
The reform group ’s ballot measure intends to move the number down to 60 percent of an employee ’s salary at age 60 .
The measure , however , excludes police department employees .
“ Some of Menlo Park ’s administrative secretaries or assistants earn from $ 75,000 to $ 90,000 a year .
Huge Reductions In Florida Pensions With No Grandfathering
There is a bill ( HB … 1319 / SB 1902 ) moving in Tallahassee that will significantly change the Florida Retirement System if passed .
Some highlights of HB 1319 / SB 1902 include :
Retirement compensation will be computed based on the average salary over ALL years of service .
The average of the “ highest five years ” rule will be repealed .
There is no grandparenting clause , so this will apply to existing employees participating in the FRS system who continue to work after July 1 , 2010 .
All new hires as of July 1 , 2011 , and all with DROP participation dates beginning on or after July 1 , 2011 , would pay a 1 % contribution of gross income into the FRS system .
Reduction in annual multiplier from 1.6 % to 1.44 % for regular class ; reduced from 2 % to 1.8 % for senior management class ; and reduced from 3 % to 2.7 % for special risk class ( cops , firefighters , etc ) .
There is no grandparenting clause , so this would apply going forward to existing employees participating in the FRS system who continue to work in qualified positions beyond the effective dates .
Normal retirement service years and DROP ages increased to 33 years / age 65 ( currently : 30 years / age 62 ) , and by +3 years for all special risk categories .
There is no grandparenting clause , so this will apply to existing employees participating in the FRS system who continue to work in qualified positions beyond the effective dates .
This would not impact those who enter DROP before the July 1 , 2010 , effective date .
Average full compensation would no longer include accumulated annual leave paid out of the end .
Accumulated sick leave paid out at the end will also not be counted towards calculating FRS compensation benefits .
Maximum benefit reduced to 80 % of average final compensation .
Existing 90 % cap would remain for FRS participating employees who vested ( at least 6 years of qualified FRS service ) before July 1 , 2010 .
Also pending is HB 1543 ( Rep Zapata ) Highlights include :
Cut the maximum benefit to 70 % of average final compensation .
Entirely eliminates the elected official , senior management , and special risk administrative support classes for FRS benefits .
All in these categories would all remain in FRS , but would be transferred to the “ regular class ” category .
Finally !
A Bill That Bypasses Grandfathering
Great Day For New Jersey Taxpayers
A package of public - employee pension and benefit cuts expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming fiscal year and billions over a longer period was signed into law by Gov. Christie yesterday , 35 minutes after winning final legislative approval .
" Today is a great day for the taxpayers of the state of New Jersey , " Christie said at an evening ceremony as he approved the bills , the first legislative action he has signed into law .
The signing ceremony came after the Assembly overwhelmingly approved the three - bill package that had cleared the Senate in late February .
The changes will cut retirement payments for future workers by 9 percent , make all public employees start contributing 1.5 percent of their salaries toward health - care premiums , cap payouts for unused sick time at $ 15,000 , and make changes intended to thwart pension abuses .
Except for the health - care contributions , most of the major changes will affect new hires only .
Two of the three bills will combine to save the state $ 8 billion over the next 15 years , Christie said .
Senate President Stephen Sweeney ( D. , Gloucester ) called the votes " a big victory for the state of New Jersey , " saying the health - care law would save local governments $ 314 million in the coming fiscal year .
Those savings will translate into property - tax relief , said Senate Majority Leader Barbara Buono ( D. , Middlesex ) .
The measures passed with almost no legislative opposition , moving swiftly from introduction to law in six weeks .
But the day still had its share of backroom drama as Assembly leaders initially planned to delay a vote on the most sweeping piece of the three - bill package , citing questions about a relatively - minor provision .
The move surprised the bills ' supporters , who had seen the reforms sail through the Senate without a single " no " vote .
Bipartisanship At Its Finest
Partisanship At Its Worst
Attorneys general in at least 12 states warned on Monday that lawsuits will be filed to stop the federal government 's healthcare reform bill from encroaching on states ' sovereignty .
Eleven of the attorneys general plan to band together in a collective lawsuit on behalf of Alabama , Florida , Michigan , Nebraska , North Dakota , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , South Dakota , Texas , Utah and Washington .
" Congress ' attempt to force Michigan families to buy health insurance -- or else -- raises serious constitutional concerns , " said Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox .
" We will fight to defend the individual rights and freedoms of Michigan citizens against this radical overreach by the federal government . "
The state attorneys general say the reforms infringe on state powers under the Constitution 's Bill of Rights .
Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli , who plans to file a lawsuit in federal court in Richmond , Virginia , said Congress lacks authority under its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce to force people to buy insurance .
The bill also conflicts with a state law that says Virginians cannot be required to buy insurance , he added .
Great Day For California Looms On Horizon
As the parents of a 14 - year - old Phoenix girl pleaded not guilty to charges of child abuse and kidnapping Monday morning , new details have emerged surrounding the suspected imprisonment of their daughter .
The couple was indicted by a grand jury last week on three counts of child abuse and one count of kidnapping .
They pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the Maricopa County Superior Court arraignment Monday .
According to the police report filed following the arrest of Scott Bass , 33 , and Andrea Bass , 31 , the teenage girl , who was 5 - foot - 8 - inches tall , was only 90 pounds when she left the home .
The Basses are suspected of keeping their daughter locked in a bathroom for two months with no running water , feeding her canned food once every few days , forcing her to exercise and beating her when she became too exhausted .
In his report , Phoenix police Officer Vincent Lavia reported that the 14 - year - old girl would hysterically cry whenever she thought of returning to her parents ' house .
According to the officer , her living conditions " were barely suitable for an animal . "
Police interviews with the 14 - year - old girl , the parents and other children in the Bass home - including an 11 - year - old girl - revealed a history of family tension .
The 14 - year - old said her father once spent a night in jail for domestic violence against Andrea , according to the report .
The girl said she has n't seen her biological mother , Treasure Adams , since she was 8 years old .
She said Andrea Bass ' appearance in her life five years ago felt like her " world turning upside down . "
She told police Andrea Bass , who gave piano lessons and massages from home and taught toddler classes as a volunteer at the YMCA , turned her father against her .
Scott Bass said his daughter was only being disciplined for bad behavior - behavior sparked by the family 's move from their apartment in Glendale to a house in Phoenix , near 27th Avenue and Durango Street .
He said he gave his daughter a bucket to urinate and defecate in because he was fed up with attempting to talk to her .
He said living in seclusion was her choice .
Andrea Bass , Scott 's wife of five years , said Scott Bass tried to kill himself after Child Protective Services took his five children away prior to his arrest .
She told police that she alone had been involved in at least 15 prior reports with CPS .
At the time of Scott and Andrea 's arrest , police did not believe the other children in the house - ages 3 , 4 , 11 and 12 - had been abused .
The 14 - year - old told police the other children were emotionally abusive toward her .
When the girl 's younger sister , 11 , was asked if she cared about her older sister , the girl told police , " In certain situations , no . "
The 11 - year - old said she did n't know what happened behind her sister 's locked bathroom door .
She said she never saw her older sister exercise with her parents , but she knew she did because the Basses were , according to the police document , a " healthy family . "
The 11 - year - old , however , admitted that she has lied to social workers before .
She said she knew what it felt like to be locked in the bathroom .
Scott and Andrea Bass will have their next court date on April 6 .
Many refugees sought police escorts to the neighbouring Bauchi and Nassarawa states , fearing that militant Christians blocking roads at nearby villages would kill them , a Red Cross worker said .
The conflict between the Christian Tarok and the Muslim Fulani is rooted in rival claims over the fertile farmlands of Plateau state in central Nigeria , but is stoked by religious hatred and the sense among many Christians that Muslims are outsiders .
Survivors of the massacre said they had buried 630 corpses around the remote market town after Sunday 's attack .
A senior policeman spoke of " hundreds " dead .
Nigeria 's 130 million people are split roughly equally between Muslims and Christians .
More than 5,000 have died in violence since 2000 , when 12 northern states established Islamic law .
( CNN ) -- Google on Monday announced it has stopped censoring search results in China .
The announcement came amid speculation that the search giant would pull out of China entirely and sets up a showdown with the Communist leadership there .
In a 3:03 p.m. ET post on its official blog , Google said it stopped running the censored Google .cn service on Monday and was routing its Chinese users to an uncensored version of Google based in Hong Kong .
" We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services , including users in mainland China , yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self - censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement , " said Senior Vice President David Drummond , Google 's chief legal officer , on the blog .
Google hopes the move " will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China , " Drummond wrote .
" We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision , though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services , " he added .
Google said it would be carefully monitoring to see if access to the site is blocked in mainland China .
China state media : Google decision ' totally wrong '
Early reports from China on Monday suggested that the Chinese government was already restricting access to Google 's Hong Kong - based site , said Eddan Katz , International Affairs Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" We 've already heard indications that visitors to Google .hk are getting ' ca n't find page ' errors , " he said .
The company on Monday also launched a dashboard page , which it promises to update regularly each day , that will show which Google services are available in China .
According to the page , YouTube , Google Sites and Google 's Blogger apps were blocked Monday afternoon .
Observers said Google 's actions amounts to a de facto withdrawal from China by putting the ball in the court of a Chinese regime that virtually everyone expects will begin censoring search results on the site .
Ron Deibert , director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto , which studies the intersection of digital policy and human rights , said Google 's move did n't come as a surprise .
" It 's become unsustainable for Google to operate in this environment , " he said .
" They 've made a decision that the risks are too great for them , so they 're going to pull out . "
Google launched Google.cn , its China effort , in 2006 amid complaints that its devotion to Web freedom was being subverted by a willingness to comply with Chinese censorship in return for access to a huge potential customer base .
The company , whose slogan is " do n't be evil , " countered that by operating in limited form , it gave Chinese users more information than than they would have had otherwise .
Google also hoped its presence would speed a move toward online freedom in China .
Google - China move hurts businesses , academics
In January , Google announced that the company and at least 20 others were victims of a " highly sophisticated and targeted attack " originating in China in mid-December , evidently to gain access to the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists .
The company said the attacker or attackers gained access to the header -- or subject - line information -- from the e-mails of two human rights activists through the Google network .
As a result , the company said , it was no longer willing to abide by the filters that the Chinese government demanded on certain searches before allowing Google to operate in the country .
For a brief time afterward , Google.cn was retrieving results for sensitive topics including the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square , the Dalai Lama and the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement .
But about a day later , search results appeared to return to normal .
Advocates of Internet freedoms cheered Google 's move Monday .
" It demonstrates that a company like Google , with the business stakes in a market as large as China , can make the decision that free and open Internet is a better business alternative and a better ethical choice for its users , " said Katz of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which promotes free speech online .
Internet users naturally gravitate toward sites that offer unrestricted access to information , he said .
" This is an example of how the genie can't be put back in the bottle . "
Deibert , who co-founded the OpenNet Initiative , said China 's next move may not be to just block access to Google but to go a step further : blocking all outside search engines from accessing Web information in China .
" If such a radical measure happens , that would have major implications for cyberspace as a whole , " he said .
" It would point to a more regionalized Internet " and perhaps embolden countries like Iran to follow suit , Diebert said .
Google.cn is the preferred search tool for about 13 percent of Chinese Web users , according to a state - sponsored survey .
Baidu.com , a government - friendly Chinese search engine , dominates the market in mainland China with about 77 percent of users , the survey said .
Google 's announcement had been widely anticipated .
Internet companies operating in China face a March 31 deadline to renew licenses to operate in the country , according to the Beijing Communications Administration .
The blog post by Drummond said Google plans to continue research and development work in China and to maintain a limited sales presence there .
In an apparent attempt to deflect blame for the decision from Google employees still living in China , the post specified that the decision was made by Google 's top brass in the United States .
" Despite all the uncertainty and difficulties they have faced since we made our announcement in January , [ Google 's China employees ] have continued to focus on serving our Chinese users and customers , " the blog said .
" We are immensely proud of them . "

In the first Paxil birth defect trial against GlaxoSmithKline , much of evidence focused on the doctors on Glaxo 's payroll involved in the corruption of the medical literature and seminars given to promote the off label use of Paxil with pregnant and nursing mothers .
On October 13 , 2009 , the trial of Kilker v Glaxo ended with a Philadelphia jury awarding $ 2.5 million in compensatory damages to the family of Lyam Kilker , after finding that Glaxo " negligently failed to warn " the doctor treating Lyam 's mother about the risks of Paxil and the drug was a " factual cause " of the child 's heart defects .
Glaxo's lead attorney at trial was King & Spalding partner Chilton Varner , and the family 's lead attorney was Sean Tracey from Houston .
During his opening statement on September 15 , 2009 , Tracey told the jury that Doctor David Healy is " one of the most , if not the ( most ) world - recognized expert on pharmaceutical industry influence and the medicine , he is up there in the top five . "
Healy " is going to explain to you how GSK corrupted the medical literature , " he said , " how they used their money and influence to have doctors that they paid put out literature into the world so doctors ... could read literature that looked like literature , looked like science , smelled like science , appeared to be science , from very important people , people that were on boards , people that were professors , people that published hundreds of articles . "
Healy is going to explain to you that what they did n't tell people ... " is , we are paying these doctors to do all these things , " Tracey told the jury .
" There is a book , it looks like a telephone book , " he said , " of names of doctors , influential doctors , on their payroll , the names of these doctors you will see on this literature that looks and smells like science . "
" And just coincidentally , this science that they are going to parade before you , all seemed to help them , " he told the jury .
" Some of this happened in the last couple weeks before this trial started . "

In Tanzania ’s Selous game reserve an age - old scourge has returned to haunt Africa ’s biggest wildlife stronghold .
Poaching is back , big time , with an average of 50 elephants being killed every month to fuel the ivory trade .
Tanzania has become the leading source of illegally exported ivory , with Dar es Salaam as its major transit point .
Yet even as the slaughter continues , sending black - market prices soaring to more than $ 1,000 ( £ 636 ) a kilogram , Tanzania is urging CITES ( the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ) to lift the worldwide ivory trade ban ???
Unless Tanzania shows the same determination to secure its wildlife heritage as it have shown in the past , the elephants could soon be gone and the Selous will drop off the tourist map .

With the city in the middle of a budget crisis , Sgt. Trent Crump acknowledges it 's probably a bad time for the Phoenix Police Department to break in a new $ 4.15 million surveillance plane .
Crump said he understands the plane likely will raise eyebrows among residents , because Phoenix also is eliminating jobs and cutting employees ' pay .
But the police spokesman said the department did n't have many options when it acquired the Pilatus PC - 12 Spectre single - engine plane in September .
That 's when funding became available from a voter - approved 2006 public - safety bond , which also paid for a crime lab and police stations .
Crump said the bond money could not be used to pay for officers or to supplement the city 's general fund .
" There are things from 2006 we would like to take back , but we can't reallocate bond money , " Crump said .
The plane is used to more safely conduct aerial surveillance and to extradite prisoners .
The pressurized plane , which has a capacity for nine passengers and two pilots , is in a hangar at Phoenix Deer Valley Airport .
In the next few months , a few seats will come out and it will be fitted for a special camera and a viewing monitor that will allow officers to conduct surveillance above 9,000 feet .
The additional equipment will cost about $ 600,000 , also coming from bond proceeds .
Crump said the department since 2003 has wanted to add another plane to its fleet that includes three Cessnas bought in 1979 , 1981 and 1986 .
The older planes sometimes cannot be used in the summer because they have no air - conditioning , he said , and they are unsafe to fly at high altitudes when the temperature in the Valley exceeds 104 degrees .
The new plane has air - conditioning , and because it can fly at a higher altitude , it wo n't have the same restrictions the other planes have when flying around Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport .
Crump said the new plane gives Phoenix the option of using it to extradite prisoners back to the Valley .
The Maricopa County Sheriff 's
Office stopped providing that service last year because of budget cuts , and Crump said the new plane has done four extraditions so far .
He added that the seating capacity in the older planes is too small to extradite prisoners .
As the city has waited to add a camera to the new plane , it has been used to fly detectives in and out of state to work on 10 homicide cases and gang , drug - enforcement and street - crimes investigations .
The new plane has been in the sky for a little more than 115 hours , with nearly 55 hours devoted to training .
It costs about $ 200 an hour to operate the plane .
The Pilatus is popular with U.S. Customs and Border Protection , the Air Force and the Bureau of Land Management to monitor large geographic areas and quickly move personnel , said Mike Haenggi , vice president of marketing for Pilatus Business Aircraft Ltd. in Colorado .
Haenggi said Phoenix is the first municipality to buy such a plane from his company , whose international headquarters is in Switzerland .
He said the plane , which will have a restroom , is capable of circling in the air for up to seven hours at high altitudes .
" It 's a great asset to have , " Haenggi said .
" It has tremendous capabilities , and it can do a lot of things you can't do with a helicopter . "

When the idea of an A - Team movie first came out , I was a little sceptical but after seeing the trailer that was released a few months ago , I started to like the idea !
We ’ve literally just been sent these new posters for The A - Team which is directed by Joe Carnahan and stars Bradley Cooper as Lt. Templeton “ ˜ Faceman ’ Peck , Liam Neeson as Col John “ ˜ Hannibal ’ Smith , Sharlto Copley as Captain “ ˜Howling Mad ’ Murdock , Quinton “ ˜Rampage ’ Jackson as Sgt Bosco “ ˜B.A. ’ Baracus and Jessica Biel .
It ’s set for release on 30th July this year which is coincidently my birthday .
Roll on July !
Synopsis : THE A - TEAM follows the exciting and daring exploits of Hannibal Smith and his colorful team of former Special Forces soldiers who were set up for a crime they did not commit .
Going ‘ rogue , ’ they utilize their unique talents – and eccentricities – to try and clear their names and find the true culprit .

Michael Steele went on MSNBC this morning before the health - care summit and began attacking President Obama for a " dog and pony show " -- and claimed that the president should have held this summit a year ago , when things were just getting started .
The problem with this : Obama did .
On March 5 of last year .
Fully televised .
All that .
Republicans were so busy back then concocting plans to scuttle ANY health - care reform , though , that it kinda slipped their minds .
Kudos to Chuck Todd and Savannah Guthrie for calling him out for it :
STEELE : This whole dog and pony show that we 're about to witness today is something that should have taken place a year ago , when the administration first came in last February and laid out its agenda for health care .
This is how you should have started it - bipartisan , public forum , CSPAN , your cameras rolling to capture this and to capture , most importantly , what the American people want .
And right now , they want us to start over , and I think we should .
TODD : Chairman Steele , in fairness to them , I mean , it was a year ago that they actually had a summit .
GUTHRIE : On March 5th .
TODD : And it was n't just the legislative leaders .
They brought in folks from the industry as well .
And that one was televised .
So ... does that one not count ?
I 'm just curious .
STEELE : Well , apparently it did n't .
Because we do n't have health care .
You know , you really can't blame Republicans for wanting to fire Steele as the RNC chair , when the level of incompetence is this deep .
But we progressives hope he sticks around , just for the comic relief .
Researchers in Korea have created a children ’s book that uses 3 - D technology to bring its characters to life .
“ It took us about three years to develop the software for this , ” lead researcher Kim Sang - cheol told Reuters .
“ It will take a while to market this technology to the general public . ”
In video demonstrations of the technology , both text and animated figures emerge from the page and interact as the book is moved .
To experience the effect , readers wear computer - aided goggles that translate the images into three dimensions .
According to Reuters , the Korean team first hopes to develop the technology for everyday use in cellphones .
Let 's just say that Stephen Roach does n't exactly agree with Paul Krugman 's call for a yuan - dollar hike :
Bloomberg :
“ We should take out the baseball bat on Paul Krugman -- I mean I think that the advice is completely wrong , ” Roach said in an Bloomberg Television interview in Beijing when asked about Krugman ’s call , characterized as akin to taking a baseball bat to China .
“ We ’re lashing out at China rather than tending to our own business , ” which is raising U.S. savings , Roach said .
“ I ’m a little surprised at Steve for saying that , ” said Krugman , the Princeton University professor and Nobel laureate in economics , in a telephone interview when asked to respond to Roach .
“ What I said is actually based on pretty careful economic analysis .
We have a world economy which is depressed by China artificially keeping its currency undervalued . ”
Stephen Roach believes the U.S. should quit attacking China over its yuan - dollar peg , and rather , start trying to solve its problems at home first , such as America 's low savings rate , while trying to stimulate Chinese consumption of U.S. goods .
Thing is , is n't that what a yuan hike is supposed to help accomplish ?
Furthermore , if the yuan is n't undervalued , then why do n't we just let the exchange rate float and see where the market believes its true value stands ?
MORE than a decade since it was first spotted , element 112 , the newest element in the periodic table , has arrived at the finish line , winning its chemical symbol at last .

WASHINGTON – A nuclear - armed Iran would be unlikely to strike the Jewish state but would use its arsenal to intimidate adversaries across the Middle East , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said on Friday .
“ I do n’t think the Iranians , even if they got the bomb , [ would ] drop it in the neighborhood , ” Barak said .
“ They fully understand what might follow .
They are radical but not totally crazy .
They have a quite sophisticated decision - making process , and they understand reality .
” The defense minister did not go into details about the consequences of an Iranian strike , but he appeared to be alluding to an Israeli retaliation .
In a speech at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Barak once again stressed the need for tough sanctions against Iran as he prepared to wrap up meetings with senior American officials .
The two allies have disagreed on the severity of proposed new punitive measures in recent days .
“ What is really needed is significant sanctions , effective ones , within a time limit , ” he said .
During his five - day visit to the US , Barak emphasized that Teheran ’s nuclear program was not only Israel ’s problem .
“ Iran is not just a challenge to Israel , ” he said , envisioning a nuclear - armed Teheran that intimidates its neighbors and legitimizes Islamic radicalism and terrorism .
“ I can hardly think of a stable world order with a nuclear Iran , ” he said .
Before his meeting at the State Department with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton later on Friday , Barak said new sanctions should be “ consequential , ” despite the distinct “ possibility that in spite of all effort , it will not lead to Iran accepting the international norms .
” Clinton , who said in recent days that the Islamic Republic has left the international community “ little choice , ” made clear that the US is committed to rallying international pressure against it .
“ As the recent IAEA report makes clear , Iran is not living up to its responsibilities , and we are working with our partners in the international community to increase pressure on Iran to change course , ” she said .
During the meeting , they also discussed Gaza and kick - starting peace negotiations with the Palestinians .
In his speech earlier in the day , Barak said he expects proximity talks to start within the next few weeks .
A majority in Israel is ready to make peace once they feel there is a readiness on the other side , he said .
“ We are not having this tango alone , ” he added .
The Israeli defense establishment believes “ that we have strategic interests in putting an end to our conflict with Syria , ” Barak also said .
“ This is an opportunity more than a threat if navigated cleverly .
” But Barak harshly criticized the links between Hizbullah , Teheran , Damascus and Beirut .
“ We can not accept it , ” he said , noting that Iran , Syria and Lebanon are all members of the UN .
“ We are strong enough to face a deterioration if it happens on our northern front , but we are not interested in it .
We will not initiate it .
” Finally , he described the efforts of an Israeli delegation in Beijing last week that sought to “ exchange views ” and “ share information ” with its Chinese counterparts .
While in Washington , Barak met with senior American officials , including Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden on Friday , and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Adm .
Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Middle East envoy George Mitchell on Thursday .
During his talk with Gates , Barak reportedly stressed the importance of “ crippling ” sanctions .
But US officials backed away from the term , and State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said it was not the US “ intent to have crippling sanctions that have a significant impact on the Iranian people .
Our actual intent is to find ways to pressure the government while protecting the people .
” Barak sought to downplay any disagreement between Israel and the US , during a briefing with reporters on Thursday night .
He said sanctions needed to be “ done urgently and with emphasis , tenacity and determination . ” Pressed on the US resistance to “ crippling ” sanctions , he responded : “ I do n’t think the point is about discussing the definition of sanctions , ” rather whether they will stop Iran ’s nuclear capability .
“ This is the criteria by which we ’ll judge .
” Though Israel and the US do not see eye - to - eye on all issues , “ in the most important things our positions are getting closer , ” he said .
“ My impression is that America is investing effort and political capital [ to stop the Iranian nuclear march ] .
” Barak emphasized during his speech at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy that Israeli leaders want peace with their neighbors , both to normalize relations and to prevent the risk of a deteriorated relationship that leads to violence .
But he emphasized that Israel cannot afford to take security risks .
“ The Middle East is not the Midwest , neither Western Europe , ” Barak said .
“ We are living in a tough neighborhood .
It ’s a neighborhood where thereis no mercy for the weak , no second opportunity for those who cannotdefend themselves . ”
When the exciting opportunity to work in a post - bubble dot.com startup arose , I jumped to take it .
I had the luxury of doing things exactly as I thought right , and for a while it was truly fantastic .
I built a team with a dedicated user researcher ; information architect ; interaction and visual designers and we even made a guerilla usability lab and had regular test sessions .
Unfortunately , the enthusiasm I had for my new job waned after six months when an executive was appointed Head of Product Development — who insisted he knew SCRUM1 better than anybody .
As the Creative Director , I deferred authority to him to develop the product as he saw fit .
I had worked with SCRUM before , done training with Ken Schwaber ( author1 and co-founder of the Agile Alliance ) and knew a few things from experience about how to achieve some success integrating a design team within SCRUM .
This required the design team to work a “ Sprint ” ( month long iteration ) ahead of the development team .
But the new executive insisted that SCRUM had to be done by - the - book .
Which meant , all activities had to be included within the same sprint , including design .
Requirements came from the imagination of the Head of Product Development ; design was rushed and ill - conceived as a result of time pressure ; development was equally rushed and hacked together , or worse , unfinished .
The end of Sprint debriefing meetings reliably consisted of a dressing down of the entire team by the executives ( since nobody had delivered what they ’d committed to i.e. they had tried to do too much , or had not done enough ) .
Each Sprint consisted of trying to fix the mess from the Sprint before or brushing it under the carpet and developing something unstable atop the code - garbage .
Morale languished , the product stank , good staff began to leave … it was horrible .
This is an extreme example of where SCRUM went bad .
I am not anti-Agile although I ’ve been bitten a few times and feel trepidation when I hear someone singing its praises without having much experience with it .
Over the last eight years , I ’ve seen Agile badly implemented far more often than well ( and yes , it can be done well , too ) .
The result of this is mediocre product released in as much time as it would have taken a good team to release great product using a waterfall approach .
In this article , I will describe Agile and attempt to illuminate a potential minefield for those who are swept up in the fervor of this development trend and want to jump in headlong .
Then I will present how practices within User Centred Design ( UCD ) can mitigate the inherent risks of Agile and how these may be integrated within Agile development approaches .
Where did Agile come from ?
Envisioned by a group of developers , Agile is an iterative development approach that takes small steps toward defining a product or service .
At the end of each step , we have something built that we could release to the market if we choose to and therefore it can assure some speed to market where waterfall methods usually fail .
Agile prefers to work out how to build something as we go , rather than do a waterfall style deep dive into specification and then finding out we can’t build parts of the spec for some reason e.g. a misjudgment of feasibility , misjudgment of time to build , or changing requirements .
A group of developers such as Kent Beck , Martin Fowler and Ken Schwaber got together to come up with a way to synthesize what they had discovered was the most effective ways to develop software – The Agile Alliance was born .
It released a manifesto2 to describe its tenets and how it differs from waterfall methods .
Agile can be thought of as a risk - management strategy .
Often developers are approached directly by a client who does not know what a user experience designer , information architect or user interface designer is .
Roles such as these usually interpret what clients want and translate it to some kind of specification for developers .
Without this role , it ’s down to the developer to work out and build what the customer wants .
Because Agile requires a lot of engagement with the client ( i.e. at the end of every iteration , which can be as little as a week ) it mitigates the risk of going too far toward creating something the client does n’t want .
As such , it is a coping mechanism for a client ’s shifting requirements during development as they begin to articulate what they want .
To quote the Agile Manifesto ’s principles “ Welcome changing requirements , even late in development .
Agile processes harness change for the customer ’s competitive advantage .
Why do people rave about it ?
At the heart of what makes Agile attractive is the possibility of quicker return on investment for development effort , because we can release software earlier than we would have otherwise .
In the short term , this is typically borne out .
In the long term it can be too , though only when the team has n’t fallen victim to temptation ( more on that later ) .
Agile is also good at generating momentum because the iterations act as a drumbeat to which the team marches toward manageable deadlines .
The regular " push " to finish a sprint ensures that things move along swiftly .
Agile is also good at avoiding feature bloat by encouraging developers to do only what is necessary to meet requirements .
Because it emphasizes face to face contact for a multidisciplinary team , Agile tends to encourage contribution from different perspectives .
This is generally a positive influence on , pragmatism , innovation and speed of issue resolution .
The team is empowered to make decisions as to how requirements should best be met .
The Minefield
In of itself , Agile does a good job of flexing to the winds of change .
But one has to ask whether it was devised to treat a symptom of the larger cause : the business does n’t know what it wants .
While Agile enables the development team to better cope with this , it does n’t solve the problem and in most cases creates new problems .
Mine 1 : An unclear role for design
In the best cases of business approaching developers to build some software , some of those developers may have design skills .
But that ’s not a particularly common scenario .
Many developers have also had bad experiences with designers who do n’t know what they ’re doing .
It took a long time for the design profession to come to grips with designing for complex systems and there is still a deficit of expertise in this field .
“ Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project ” is another principle of Agile .
Where does the designer fit into the frame ?
Mine 2 : The requirements gathering process is not defined
Agile accommodates design activities from the perspective of a developer .
It tends to shoe - horn these activities into their view of the world where requirements fall from the sky ( from the business or customer who is assumed to be all - knowing ) and takes for granted that they are appropriate .
According to Ken Schwaber , SCRUM intends to be a holistic management methodology and leaves space for activities other than programming to occur within the framework of iterative cycles .
But when organizations adopt SCRUM , too often the good parts of a waterfall process like research and forming a high - level blueprint for the overall design become the proverbial baby thrown out with the documentation bathwater .
As the Agile Manifesto says , “ Working software over comprehensive documentation . ” 2
Many latch onto this and do n’t want to do any type of documentation that might outline a vision , even if in a rudimentary sense .
Mine 3 : Pressure to cut corners
Implementations of Agile that put design activities within the same iteration as they must be developed , ensure designs are achievable in code .
But they also put tremendous pressure on the experience design team to ‘ feed the development machine ’ in time enough for them to implement their vision .
This can and does lead to impulsive design .
So , what ’s wrong with that ?
Well , nothing if you ’re not adhering to user centric principles which suggest you should test ideas with end users before committing them to code .
Some assert that there are plenty of examples of best - practice interfaces to copy out there .
So , why reinvent the wheel ?
Surely we can save time that way ?
Sometimes they ’re right , but how will we know which best - practice interface works best in context with the user ’s goals , with no time to test with the user ?
How can we innovate by copying what already exists ?
Before Google reinvented internet search , other search engines assumed a status quo which behooved the user to learn how to form proper search queries .
It was institutional knowledge among the other search engines that this is how searching was done and customers simply had to learn to use it .
Most people ’s search results were poor at best .
Then Google came along and realized what is now obvious .
People just want to find what they ’re looking for , not learn how to drive a search engine first .
I ’m not suggesting the other search engines could not have done what Google did sooner , but I am pointing the finger at a mentality which meant they missed the opportunity .
Interestingly , Google is not known for its designers .
It ’s mainly a development house , but lots of those developers can clearly put a design hat on too .
There is absolutely nothing wrong with using Agile to produce results quickly ; that is , if you do n’t intend to release them on your poor , unsuspecting user without some usability testing .
Just do n’t be fooled that this is going to save you a lot of time if you want your new product to be right , because you will have to iterate to arrive at an appropriate solution .
Alan Cooper has argued that this creates a kind of ‘ scar tissue ’ where code that has to be changed or modified leaves a ‘ scar ’ that makes the foundations of the program unsound .

Mine 4 : The temptation to call it “ good enough ”
Invariably when we have release - ready working code at the end of each cycle , even if it ’s sub-optimal , there ’s a strong temptation to release it because we can .
Agile condones releasing whatever we have so long as it works .
Sometimes , that means doing what we can get away with , not what is ultimately best for the user .
Equally , if we do decide that a feature is n’t right yet , it ’s amendments get fed back into the requirements backlog where temptation strikes again .
Should we spend time in our next iteration on a feature that we ’ve already got a version of ?
Or shall we develop something new instead ?
Too often , the rework gets left in favor of exciting new stuff .
An so on we go building a product full of features that do n’t quite meet the bar .
Mine 5 : Insufficient risk - free conceptual exploration time
Iteration “ zero ” ( i.e. a planning and design iteration prior to the first development iteration ) can be used to do this and other planning activities .
However , depending on how long this iteration is , the level of rigor applied to exploration may be insufficient .
An argument used by some Agile practitioners asserts that a working example of a solution is the best way to validate whether it is the right one through exposure to the market .
This ‘ suck it and see ’ approach bypasses an activity called “ concepting . ”
Concept activities dedicate time to sketching different solutions at a high level and validating them in the rough with users before digging into detailed design or code .
“ Suck it and see ” would have us just build it , launch it and see if it flies .
This way , we ’ve wasted time building something we will probably have to take apart or rebuild .
The counter argument is : if it took as long to build as it would have to research and design before laying a line of code , then we break even .
This statement is a stretch in practice because development itself usually does take longer than well - managed design research and conceptual exploration .
Also , there has to be some level of design regardless of which methodology is used , and this adds days to the timeline .
Mine 6 : Brand Damage
Let ’s just say that design and research takes the same amount of time as development for argument ’s sake .
In the worst case , we completely miss the mark with the non-researched and designed solution and we have to start all over again .
Then we ’re back to the same total duration after developing it a second time , but there ’s no guarantee we ’ll get the solution right the second time either .
All the while we ’ve repeatedly foisted a botched product design on our users and adversely affected our brand .
Many companies succeed on the back of their reputation for producing consistently appropriate products and services .
When a company releases a flawed product or service , then their image in the customers mind ( i.e. brand ) is tarnished .
Brand damage takes far longer to mend than it does to make .
Software creators that fall victim to the temptation of " good enough " and fail to innovate through conceptual exploration put their companies revenues at risk .
In a competitive market , repeated failure to meet user needs well leads to serious brand and subsequently financial repercussions , as other companies who do get it right take the business .
Agile is good for refining , not defining .
If you have an existing product that you want to develop to the next level , then Agile in its truest sense works because you have a base upon which to improve .
This means that if you know what your requirements are and these have been properly informed with user research , comparative analysis , business objectives , and analysis of what content you have and what you can technically achieve , then Agile alone can work well .
But spending money on software development without a plan of what to build is like asking a construction crew to erect a tower with no blueprint .
Some level of plan is necessary to avoid a Frankenstein of each individual ’s perspective on the best design solution .
User Centered Design
UCD requires iteration – design , test with users , refine , test with users again , refine … repeat till it ’s right .
This is where Agile and UCD can work brilliantly together .
Agile really is about presuming you ’ll need to change things , and that ’s a good thing when it comes to refinement .
Uncovering requirements to form a strategy
User Centered Design ( UCD ) is not about answering requirements alone , but also includes defining requirements .
When we practice UCD end - to - end , we pretend we know little .
Little about what the solution to a problem should be ; little about what the problem actually is because assumptions close us off to new possibilities .
We prefer to allow some design research to create a viewpoint and then form a hypothesis as to what we might build .
In this regard , we cross into the realm of product managers , producers , program managers , business analysts and the like , trampling toes with gay abandon and meeting resistance all around .
Facing confinement to defining the boring old business need ( distinct from the user or customer need ) , these folks would prefer we constrain our UCD work to usability testing on designs meeting the requirements they set out .
They ’d prefer we stick to just helping with development … and if we can do that quicker using Agile ?
Wahey !
Is it always appropriate to do extensive research before starting design ?
That ’s a good question and one that Jared Spool ’s Market Maturity Framework5 helps answer .
Sometimes , just getting something off the ground , regardless of how precisely we meet user ’s needs with it is all we can afford to do .
Once we graduate out of this " Raw Iron " stage into " Checklist Battles " focused on getting the right features and then beyond , research is a core ingredient to putting our feet in the right place .
After researching what the user and business requires , we can make the “ Strategy ” tier of Jesse James Garret ’s Elements of User Experience3 which underpins everything we do during the project .
Do this well , and you really should n’t come up with something that ’s fundamentally wrong .
Agile does n’t account for this beyond a planning phase ( i.e. iteration zero ) , which may well define a strategy of sorts .
But does it really define the correct strategy ?
Surely , that ’s created through careful consideration of three things :
Empathetic qualitative research that uncovers the user ’s context , needs , goals and attitudes i.e. user requirements .
Cooper suggests that the customer does n’t know what they want and advocates a role of interaction designer as requirements planner .

This would avert building to the wrong requirements in the first place , but the time to do this must come into the development lifecycle somewhere .
It involves talking to users , preferably visiting with them in their environments to create experience models and user personas .
A thorough appreciation of what else in the big wide world exists in terms of products , features and technology that can be emulated somehow ( not necessarily addressing a similar situation to ours ) .
A clear articulation of the business problem , objectives , success measures and constraints .
Business people sat in a room discussing what they think should be done must be informed by all these things if the right strategy is to emerge .
Agile does n’t preclude that kind of consideration , but it does not mandate it either .
Concept Development
If we manage to built something usable and reasonably intuitive without research or strategy , did we succeed ?
Most MP3 players fit this bill but none took off like the Apple iPod .
Leaving interface usability aside , the iPod had a service concept behind it which included digitizing , replenishing and managing your entire music library with iTunes .
This was part of the iPod concept from the outset and in combination with good marketing and design , continues to eclipse the competition over seven years later .
But that concept needed to be sketched and iterated at some point .
If we do n’t explicitly build this into our Agile methodology , we can miss that thinking time .
The best of both worlds
UCD can be too documentation - heavy , isolated and risky but Agile needs help with defining requirements and concept development .
How can Agile and user centric principles work together ?
First let ’s understand what works well with Agile and not so well with user centered design .
In this regard , the work that user centered design calls the ‘ design ’ phase can produce buckets of documentation which is n’t read , describing interfaces specified in isolation which may not be feasibly coded in the time allotted to them .
So , doing detailed design is best done in conjunction with the development team and in a way where resulting interfaces can be tweaked as you go .
Examining brain tissue from over 500 individuals in 11 countries , researchers from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , and colleagues found a new risk factor for the second - most - common cause of early - onset dementia after Alzheimer 's disease .
" Using a genome - wide scan for genetic variation in post - mortem brain tissue , we were able to pinpoint variations common to patients with a specific subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration , FTLD , " says co-first author Vivianna Van Deerlin , MD , PhD , associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Penn .
" This gives us more information on what proteins may underlie the molecular events leading to FTLD , and eventually , new drug targets . "
The findings were published online this week in Nature Genetics .
" By identifying gene variants that may play a role in the development and progression of one type of FTLD , this research , if replicated , will take us one step closer to an understanding of the complex biologic pathways involved in this devastating disease , " said Marcelle Morrison - Bogorad , PhD , director of the National Institutes of Health Division of Neuroscience .
The findings build on a 2006 discovery by co-senior authors Virginia Lee , PhD , director of the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research , and John Q. Trojanowski , MD , PhD , director of the Institute of Aging at Penn .
They led an international team that found that a protein called TDP - 43 accumulates abnormally in brain tissue from individuals with one type of heritable FTLD .
TDP - 43 is a known protein widely expressed throughout the body , with multiple functions , including regulating transcription of the genetic code and as scaffolding for nuclear and motor neuron proteins .
FTLD cases that are characterized by TDP - 43 inclusions can be passed from one generation to the next , as a result of mutations in another protein called progranulin ( GRN ) .
Using post - mortem brain tissue from 515 patients with TDP - associated FTLD , the team found that these patients had multiple genetic variations called SNPs in common in a region on chromosome 7 containing the protein TMEM106B , compared to over 2,500 disease - free controls .
From this , the team concluded that the TMEM106B gene variants confer a higher genetic risk for all FTLD - TDP patients , as well as in the subset of patients with GRN mutations .
What 's more , alterations in levels of TMEM106B protein in the brain may be directly or indirectly involved in causing FTLD .
How TDP - 43 , GRN , and TMEM106B proteins might normally interact in brain cells and be disrupted in FTLD remains to be deciphered .
Nevertheless , the discovery of TMEM106B is an important step toward a better understanding of FTLD .
The team plans to sequence the TMEM106B segment of chromosome 7 , and in parallel , study the normal functions of TMEM106B .
Patrick M.A. Sleiman , PhD in the Center for Applied Genomics at CHOP ; Maria Martinez - Lage , MD , postdoctoral fellow in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine ; and Alice Chen - Plotkin , MD , Instructor in the Department of Neurology , both at Penn , along with Van Deerlin , are co-first authors on the Nature Genetics article .
Hakon Hakonarson , MD , PhD , director of the Center for Applied Genomics at CHOP is also a senior author on the paper .
Other Penn co-authors are Li-San Wang , PhD ; Gerard D. Schellenberg , PhD ; Murray Grossman , MD , and Steven Arnold , MD .
The Penn authors have submitted a patent application for TMEM106B .

The public has lost much of its enthusiasm for a health care overhaul , and how Mr. Obama has managed it .
He gets low marks for his handling of the deficit and the economy .
And the fact that 56 percent of respondents think that Mr. Obama does not have a plan to create jobs is a distressing bit of news for a White House that in recent weeks had made an intensive effort to present Mr. Obama as concerned with the economy .
But the public backs other elements of Mr. Obama ’s agenda .
By a two - to - one ratio , Americans support an end to tax cuts for the wealthy , and Americans favor allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the military .
The Tea Party movement , which has grown out of the strain of discontent , so far commands relatively little public support ; 18 percent of respondents said they considered themselves supporters of the movement , while 55 percent said they had heard little or nothing about it .
The level of dissatisfaction with both political parties  and the fact that 56 percent of Americans in the poll want a smaller government  suggests that the Tea Party movement has an opportunity to draw more support .
The poll found that 51 percent of Americans now view the Democratic Party unfavorably , nearly matching the highest in the history of the Times / CBS News poll .
At the same time , 57 percent have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party .
The nationwide telephone poll of 1,084 adults was taken from Feb. 5 through 10 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all adults .
The poll found substantial pessimism : 62 percent of respondents said the country was heading in the wrong direction .
And 70 percent of those polled said they thought it was going to take two years or longer for the effects of the recession that technically ended last year to fade away .
Three - quarters of the public disapproves of Congress , matching the highest level measured by the New York Times / CBS News Poll since it began asking the question in 1977 .
Four out of five voters thought Congress was more interested in serving special interests than voters .
Search Engine Optimization known as SEO sets major importance for trafficking .
It is all about having views , engagement levels and the popularity of your site or content .
Before the internet was available to everyone newspapers , magazines and journals continued to rule the importance of a piece of content .
With SEO emerging , content rules changed .
Google is the most visited site which implies the reason for its highest traffic rates .
Other search engines have less than 10 % of trafficking .
SEO is part of the marketing strategy for content , videos , and posters .
Every target audience has a strategy .
Target audience for SEO - keywords
The target audience depends on what kind of people the content would be attractive to .
For entertainment related to fiction targeting the age group of 12 - 25 - year - old people is the obvious choice .
Fiction entertainment can be video marketing that needs video SEO .
Video SEO needs thumbnails , video transcripts , concise descriptions , and titles .
The correlation between video SEO , poster SEO , and content SEO is being able to relate to the audience and finding the words which they might search .
Having the best content and perfect ideas is n’t the sole reason for the popularity of websites .
Being able to connect to the people who are searching for relevant content is important .
This come downs to a lot of different considerations specific to niches and search queries .
The adult niche is a large space of traffic and targeting these searchers is very different than others .
For example , if someone is trying to target the audience searching for free hookup sites , then they would want to have appropriate language in the content and snippet .
Enticing language would be more well suited rather than educational or informative language .
Also , this would be targeting specifically adults so that consideration would be valuable to take into account as well .
Creating Quality SEO content
Often people have messed up content while having multiple SEO words within them .
Compromising on the quality of content only leads to less effectiveness .
SEO is suggestible to be modified once the original idea is implemented .
The marketing part of any content is the latter part , after constructing a well - written and well - organized content .
The same goes for video SEO or poster SEO .
There are different strategies for video and poster SEO , however , the essence of search engine estimation works is always the same .
Technical SEO
Knowing about the technicality of how SEO works help a webpage have organic traffic rather than paid SEO .
Paid SEO might be an easy and safe bet , but having audiences in organic methods is best for long term success .
With quality work and proper SEO , there would be absolutely no way to have less trafficking .
There might be thousands of similar searches , but every other link does n’t have an SEO optimizer who completely understands the technicality .
When your content is about cooking rice .
It is crucial to know the number of searches for every related word like “ Rice ” , “ cooking ” , “ homemade ” , “ Natural ” , “ vegan ” and “ Carbohydrates ” .
After the search , it is possible to find “ Vegan ” as the most searched word .
These days vegan diet is popular among millennials and curiosity has driven many bloggers and cooking websites to get along vegan diet plans .
To increase your website link to the topmost link in google you can use google ads or either use relevant words in high numbers .
A viewer always looks for the description or metadata written under your link .
Concisely writing relevant data with keywords always increases the position of the link in the Google search engine .
In brief , this is the basic concept of how SEO works .
There is detailed information that people become aware of while using it .
Here are two types of SEO .
On - site SEO : Optimizing the SEO content and HTML on the website increases the relevant traffic to your website .
Using specific words related to your content , going in - depth increases the chances .
This is an easy way of using SEO , where basic knowledge about how a website works is sufficient .
It is also possible to have SEO without keywords .
Things like metadata , linking , speed and URL structure matter for a webpage .
Having a quality webpage largely increases search engine optimization .
Reading repeated words can bore the reader , which makes usage of synonyms an optimum choice .
Having subheadings parted content , and pictures or videos all add up to making the webpage much better .
Importantly cohesive writing attracted readers even before the internet days .
Using questions , attractive phrases , interactive content makes all the difference for a curious reader .
Off - site SEO :
This is working on SEO beside your page .
Linking to outside sources is one popular way .
Having google ads on your page means sharing the advertisement too .
Hence working on google ads is one best way to both earn and market your content .
Advertising through social media , influence advertising , blog posts are a few ways to increase the traffic for your website organically .
Linking method
Linking is one of the popular methods to have good SEO on your content .
Having links to related pages or websites often increases the chance of being seen .
Some of the problems in this include webpage , not opening , the problem in opening the content page and linking non-indexed pages .
Such problematic linking does n’t lead to organic trafficking .
Having a simple linking system makes a lot of difference in the content .
Many websites add their other page links within the article for more clicks .
The trafficking rates are high , as people are always interested to read more when cohesive content exists .
New trends in SEO
Google search is the highest way to get organic results .
However , other search engines are also picking up the rates , although statistics and studies show that Google still holds an overwhelming majority of the market share of search .
The loading problems make a frustrated user .
People are making themselves aware of other search engines .
Going off track can land you in better ranking .
Now there are applications , links to unique forms and much more .
AI is evolving in the coming days .
Having organized content would make your content unique and top of the search engines .
Repeating content without cohesiveness is largely found to increase SEO .
Engineers on working to provide better results for better search results .
Mobile phone usage has increased in large numbers .
Mobile SEO is slightly different .
Having only mobile marketing can lead to numerous engagements in web pages .
New trends also have international SEO .
Though the traditional way works perfectly fine , new SEO tools are emerging which have a quality impact on the number of audiences .
Traditional marketing schemes like loyalty , quality , and relevant content matters .
Topmost websites have a reputation for having true high - quality content .
Compromising on content for SEO itself would n’t reach you anywhere .
Balancing both content quality and SEO results in explicit popularity within the domain .
Am I the only one who finds Coverflow to be useless ?
It 's way more awkward to search through a large number of albums ( or apps in this case ) than it would be to use any type of drill down or searching .
I guess it 's shiny though .
La majorité présidentielle est inquiète .
Au lendemain des régionales - où le Front national a pu se maintenir au second tour dans douze régions , contribuant à la sévère défaite de l'UMP - , plusieurs voix s'élèvent pour réclamer l'interdiction des triangulaires au deuxième tour des législatives de 2012 .
Lors de ce scrutin , seuls les candidats qui , au premier tour , ont obtenu un score représentant 12,5 % des inscrits peuvent se maintenir au second tour .
« C'est encore trop , plaide Franck Reynier , député radical valoisien ( UMP ) de la Drôme .
Nous souhaitons que seuls les deux candidats ou les deux listes arrivés en tête au premier tour d'une élection puissent participer au second » , insiste l'animateur du cercle des parlementaires radicaux .
« Il faut appliquer à tous les scrutins la règle déjà en vigueur pour l'élection présidentielle » , argumente ce proche de Jean - Louis Borloo , élu d'un département où le FN a obtenu 16,52 % des voix dimanche .
Au même moment , deux autres députés de la majorité viennent de déposer des propositions de loi visant à ­interdire les triangulaires .
« Les triangulaires permettent à des mouvements qui ne peuvent espérer obtenir une majorité absolue de se placer en contradiction avec les principes démocratiques fondamentaux qui régissent notre pays » , plaide Éric Ciotti , député UMP des Alpes - Maritimes , où le FN a atteint 23,85 % des voix dimanche .
Selon ce proche du maire de Nice , Christian Estrosi , « la légitimité d'un élu doit reposer sur une majorité absolue et non sur une majorité relative » .
Un député du Nord , Christian Vanneste - où le FN a obtenu 20,78 % des suffrages dimanche - , a lui aussi déposé une proposition de loi en ce sens .
« Je suis un admirateur du régime parlementaire britannique qui repose sur le bipartisme , plaide Christian Vanneste .
Le seul scrutin où une triangulaire me ­paraît acceptable , c'est lors d'une élection municipale .
C'est une position que je défends depuis 2002 . »
Éric Ciotti et Christian Vanneste espèrent obtenir du groupe UMP l'inscription de leurs propositions de loi à l'ordre du jour de l'Assemblée lors d'une semaine d'initiative parlementaire .
Interrogé , jeudi , sur RMC , le président du groupe UMP à l'Assemblée , Jean - François Copé , s'est déclaré très favorable à ces deux propositions de loi .
Ces initiatives traduisent en tout cas l'inquiétude de la majorité , de nouveau concurrencée par une force politique importante et dynamique sur son flanc droit .
Le précédent des législatives de 1997 hante les esprits à droite .
Au soir du premier tour , le FN était en mesure de se maintenir dans 133 circonscriptions .
Le parti de Jean - Marie Le Pen s'était déterminé au coup par coup en fonction des candidats RPR et UDF en présence .
Le FN avait finalement choisi de se maintenir dans 76 circonscriptions .
Et les candidats RPR et UDF en lice furent battus dans 47 de ces 76 triangulaires , qui contribuèrent à la victoire de la gauche .
A catering assistant at a prestigious private school has been arrested after allegedly trying to poison a batch of soup intended for pupils and teachers .
The soup was ready to be served up for an evening meal at Stowe school , in Buckinghamshire , when a member of staff noticed a suspicious smell .
Service was aborted and police were called to the £ 6,000 - plus a term school , which counts Richard Branson among its alumni , before officers arrested a 58 - year - old man at his home near Brackley , Northamptonshire , on suspicion of administering poison with intent to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm .
Police said today there was no apparent grudge or grievance that would suggest a motive for tampering with the carrot and coriander soup .
At a press conference today at the school , headteacher Dr Anthony Wallersteiner said it is believed the product used was a " household cleaning product that would be used in any domestic kitchen " .
He added : " From the discussions I have had with the line managers of the catering department we do not know of any grievances or previous issues with this individual . "
Chief Inspector Henry Parsons , from Thames Valley police , said : " The police and the school are not aware of any issues at all , any motive of this at this early stage . "
Wallersteiner said : " This was a batch of soup that was being prepared for the evening meal and that was quite an ordinary batch of soup , there was nothing untoward about it .
" Before any meal is taken up from the kitchens to be served the food is tested , and it was during the routine sampling that one of the duty chefs discovered there was something acrid in the soup that was being prepared . "
Dr Wallersteiner said the employee , who had worked for the school since January 2007 , had since been suspended under the school 's disciplinary procedure pending a full inquiry .
He has been instructed that under no circumstances may he enter the school premises , the school said .
He said : " I would like to reassure parents that no pupil or member of staff was affected in the incident and , given the rigour of the procedures , neither the pupils nor staff were put at any risk . "
He said the member of staff who tested the soup had tested a very small quantity and said " it was immediately spat out because it tasted so foul " .
" I have been in contact with the medical centre and I have asked whether they have spotted any unusual entries regarding food poisoning or food - related illnesses and they have said that as far as they are aware there has been no unusual activity in the medical centre .
" We have had a couple of viruses and normal seasonal flus but nothing gastric or food - related .
There 's nothing to suggest it was anything other than a one - off . "
Thames Valley police said the suspect was not interviewed after being arrested on 12 March as he was " unfit to detain for health reasons " .
He has been bailed until 29 March .
The catering section of Stowe school 's website says food is provided by a " very experienced , in - house " team .
" The menus are varied , nutritionally balanced and provide a wide choice at each meal to suit all tastes , using fresh ingredients wherever possible , " the website says .
BRUSSELS , Belgium —
When the Obama administration ordered airport security ramped up after the December bombing attempt aboard an Amsterdam - to - Detroit flight , it allocated a billion dollars in federal funding for that effort .
The Dutch government , stung by the failure of Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport to detect explosive elements on the would - be bomber , also implemented stronger security measures , with all U.S. - bound passengers now required to go through body scanners .
The price tag for those machines is more than a million dollars .
The amount the Dutch government is paying — so far — is zero .
Europe is the only region in the world where airports pay for their own security measures .
So the long list of additional regulations imposed since the 9/11 attacks by the European Union or individual governments — which can enact more stringent measures than the EU mandates — has cost airports a hefty sum , according to Airports Council International ( ACI ) .
“ Pre -9/11 , the security costs at European airports were on average 5 to 8 percent of airport operating costs , ” explained ACI 's spokesman for Europe , Robert O’Meara .
“ Now security operations at European airports account for about 35 percent of operating costs .
Every time a threat is revealed , that suddenly is a new excuse for a new layer of regulation that somebody else has to pay for . ”
Some airports are large enough and profitable enough to absorb most of the costs ; others pass some portion on to airlines and passengers but still have trouble .
In addition to the new expenses , O’Meara said , last year saw a loss of about 105 million air passengers , down from 1.47 billion previously .
" Suddenly security has become a huge hole on the balance sheets , ” he said — and that was before EU governments began looking seriously , prompted by the U.S. , at requiring the use of full - body scanners , which cost $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 a pop .
Despite the enormous bill looming for the new machines , operating personnel and training at Schiphol , airport spokeswoman Mirjam Snoerwang said the scanners were on their way , as per the new government regulations .
“ Safety first , ” she said .
" We ordered [ the scanners ] and after we ’re going to have a a discussion with the government [ about ] who is going to pay for the scans . ”
Britain has joined the Netherlands in stepping up use of the machines , but other nations have said they will not do so without an EU - wide mandate , and cost is n't the only stumbling block .
The machines ’ potential use has been debated for years , sometimes hotly .
Last year the European Commission dropped a proposed measure that would have regulated the use of such equipment throughout the EU after the European Parliament said there were too many unanswered questions about the impact it would have on “ human rights , privacy , personal dignity , health and data protection . ”
In Germany recently , protesters in a " Flesh Mob " dropped their drawers in Berlin ’s Tegel Airport to oppose the scanners , arguing that the scans could violate travelers ' privacy :
The German government has remained noncommittal on whether it will require the scanners .
A special meeting of EU aviation experts on Jan. 7 failed to produce any clarity in policy .
A statement issued after the meeting announced that the bloc is “ considering an initiative on imaging technology to reinforce passenger security , while at the same time addressing the conditions for using such technology , in particular , privacy , data protection and health issues . ”
The next attempt to harmonize the EU approach comes Thursday , as EU interior ministers meet in Toledo , Spain .
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will attend the meeting and is expected to press EU partners to make more use of the scanners .
But the Spanish presidency hosting the meeting is n’t itself a huge fan of the scanners and is n’t promising any big movement in the EU position — or rather the lack of one , at this point .
Spanish presidency spokeswoman Cristina Gallach said her government ’s goal is to “ pursue a common position ” regarding the larger questions of airport security .
“ Yes , we have to discuss how we can enhance security and how it can be done in a coordinated and efficient manner , ” she said , “ but this does n’t mean tomorrow we are going to have a proposal on introducing scanners . ”
That ’s a delay that probably wo n’t bother the airports .
O’Meara is careful not to give the impression that his organization wants to forego safeguards for financial reasons , but he warned that any new government regulations must be accompanied by new ideas on how to finance them .
“ ( I ) n the medium - to long - term , it ’s not a sustainable situation for European airports , ” he said .
“ People have been wondering what ’s going to happen . ”

Advertisement UK researchers have developed a device to drag space junk out of orbit .
They plan to launch a demonstration of their " CubeSail " next year .
It is a small satellite cube that deploys a thin , 25 - sq -m plastic sheet .
Residual air molecules still present in the spacecraft 's low - Earth orbit will catch the sheet and pull the object out of the sky much faster than is normal .
The Surrey Space Centre team says the concept could be fitted to larger satellites and even rocket stages .
The group also envisages that a mature system would even be sent to rendezvous and dock with redundant spacecraft to clean them from orbit .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Our system is simple and very low cost ; but we need to demonstrate that it can be done , " said Dr Vaios Lappas , lead researcher on the project and senior lecturer in space vehicle control .
" It would help make space a sustainable business .
We want to be able to keep on launching satellites to provide new services ; but unless we do something , the amount of junk up there is going to grow exponentially . "
Simplicity of approach
It is thought more than 5,500 tonnes of junk now clutters the region of space just a few hundred km above our heads .
Last year , two satellites even collided , showering their orbit with tiny fragments that now pose additional risk to operational spacecraft .
The controlling spacecraft is a box that is 30 cm in its longest dimension International agencies have agreed that retired hardware - old satellites or spent rocket stages - should be removed from space within 25 years of the end of service .
Using large deployable surfaces to increase the drag on these objects so they fall to Earth rapidly is one possible solution to the space litter problem .
CubeSail , unveiled on Friday , is a 3 kg ( 6.6lb ) , 10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm ( 4in x 4in x 12in ) nanosatellite .
It incorporates within its tiny frame a polymer sheet that is folded for launch to be unfurled once in space .
The simple deployment mechanism features four metal strips that are wound under tension and will snap into a straight line when let go , pulling the sheet flat in the process .
The team hopes to launch its demonstrator at the end of next year , riding piggy - back on another mission or as part of a cluster of small research satellites that are sometimes lofted en mass atop a single rocket .
Force of sunlight
The nanosat will then circle the Earth , going from pole to pole at an altitude of about 700 km ( 435 miles ) , testing its systems and assessing the drag principle .
If successful , CubeSail could become a regular add - on system to satellites and rocket stages , opening up a new space business akin to the daily refuse services here on Earth .
" We would be looking to put it on our own satellites and to put it on other people 's spacecraft as well , " said Sir Martin Sweeting , the chairman of SSTL , the world - leading small - satellite manufacturer , which is supporting the research .

" We want this to be a standard , essential bolt - on item for a spacecraft ; and that 's why it 's very important to make it small , because if it 's too big it will interfere with the rest of the spacecraft , " he told BBC News .
The researchers hope to develop the project as a propulsion system as well .
The pressure of sunlight falling on such a large structure would also move it .
The force is tiny but continuous .
This " solar sailing " technique has long been touted as a means of moving spacecraft around the Solar System , or even just helping conventional satellites to maintain their orbits more efficiently .
Indeed , some of the large geostationary satellites , for example , already use solar - sail flaps to maintain their attitude without firing their thrusters .
This saves valuable chemical propellant and extends mission lifetime .
Delicate control CubeSail will endeavour to demonstrate this " propellantless propulsion " by trying to shift the path it takes across the surface of the Earth by just a few degrees over the course of a year .
To do this though , the nanosatellite will have to carefully control the angle of the sail with respect to the Sun , just as an ocean vessel has to play with its sails to catch the wind .
The sail will be made from an extremely fine polymer " We 're going to control our sail with a very novel geometric technique ; we 're not going to use any thrusters , " explained Dr Lappas .
" We have developed a tilting mechanism that uses very tiny motors .
It 's able to move in two directions .
This enables you to change the centre of mass of the sail .
We 're also going to be using small magnets to control the sail because they will interact with the Earth 's magnetic field . "
Once its mission is complete , CubeSail will be instructed to take itself out of orbit .
The project is a private venture within the Surrey Space Centre , which is based at the University of Surrey , Guildford .
CubeSail has been funded by Europe 's largest space company , EADS Astrium , which is one of the world 's biggest manufacturers of satellites .
It also produces Europe 's heavy - lift rocket , the Ariane 5 , which launches about half of the world 's commercial satellite platforms .
The entire cost of the project is expected to be no more than £ 1 m ( $ 1.5 m ) .
Other groups around the world are expected to launch solar sail demonstrators soon .
The US space agency has been working on a project with The Planetary Society , a long - time proponent of the technology .
The Japanese , too , have work in progress .
And even Astrium is sponsoring other space junk mitigation strategies within its own division .

Pope Benedict XVI yesterday rebuked Irish bishops for the negligent way they have handled sexual abuse cases in the Catholic church and issued an unprecedented public apology to the victims of paeodophile priests .
" You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry , " Benedict wrote in a pastoral letter released yesterday , which will be read at Catholic masses in Ireland .
The letter also announced the setting up of a Vatican investigation team .
" Many of you found that , when you were courageous enough to speak of what happened to you , no one would listen , " he added .
He accused bishops in Ireland of " grave errors of judgment " in their handling of thousands of " sinful and criminal " cases of abuse spread over decades .
Split into sections , the letter addresses victims , Irish bishops , abusive priests and parents .
" There has never been a letter like this , " said the pope 's spokesman , Father Federico Lombardi .
The letter does not admit any responsibility on the part of the Vatican in relation to the scandals , nor does it specify punishments for Irish bishops who covered up for paedophile priests , moving them from parish to parish .
Following revelations that he swore abuse victims to secrecy in 1975 , Cardinal Seán Brady , the head of the Irish Catholic church , has said he will seek guidance through prayer before deciding on his future .
Benedict has yet to accept the resignations offered by three Irish bishops .
Following the release of the letter , Brady said that all Irish Catholics should reflect upon it .
" I welcome this letter , " he said .
" I am deeply grateful to the holy father for his profound kindness and concern . "
It is evident from the pastoral letter that Benedict is deeply dismayed by what he refers to as " sinful and criminal acts and the way the church authorities in Ireland dealt with them " .
Lombardi said yesterday there were no pointers to be found on Brady 's future in the letter , which did not have an administrative or disciplinary function .
" This is a pastoral letter ...
That is not touched on here , " he said .
The letter comes as a new tide of sex abuse allegations threatens to engulf the Catholic church .
Benedict himself has come under pressure over the explosion of abuse revelations in his home country , Germany , following a wave of cases in the US .
Maeve Lewis , the Irish director for the campaign group against child abuse , One in Four , said she was " deeply disappointed " by the letter .
" It falls short of what victims want , since it only tackles failures in the Irish church and not the failures that go right to the top of the Vatican , such as the 2001 ruling on secrecy , " she said .
" The church is still in denial . "
Reports on abuse commissioned in Ireland have singled out a letter written by the current pope , then Cardinal Ratzinger , in 2001 instructing bishops to report all abuse cases to his office at the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for confidential handling .
Vatican officials have said the measure was designed to prevent cases being covered up at local level , but Irish bishops reportedly understood the letter to mean they should not report cases to the police .
In yesterday 's letter , Benedict urged Ireland 's bishops to " continue to co-operate with civil authorities " .
" That could be interpreted as an instruction on mandatory reporting of abuse to the police , and this is welcome , although it is not clearly stated , " said Lewis .
" But where the pope goes on to deal with the proper application of canon law in these cases , it suggests he has no idea that civil law supersedes canon law , that bishops should abide by civil law like any citizen . "
The letter announces that a Vatican investigation , or apostolic visitation , will be carried out at a " certain diocese " in Ireland , as well as in seminaries and religious congregations .
Such investigations are carried out when the Vatican believes a local church is unable to put its own house in order .
" A lot of people will be quaking in their boots in Ireland as they wait to see which diocese the pope means , " said one church insider in Ireland .
But Benedict also sympathised with Irish bishops , telling them : " I recognise how difficult it was to grasp the extent and complexity of the problem , to obtain reliable information and to make the right decisions in the light of conflicting expert advice . "
Rather than blaming abuse on an oppressive , conservative environment within the Irish Catholic church , Benedict singles out the creeping influence of liberal , secular society for weakening resolve against it .
" In particular , there was a well - intentioned but misguided tendency to avoid penal approaches to canonically irregular situations , " he writes .
Lewis added : " We are astounded that the pope links the problem to secularisation .
It shows a misunderstanding of the dynamics of sexual violence and suggests there is little hope the church will ever know how to respond . "
A good friend of mine ( the ever awesome @furiey ) linked a post from a blog she reads on twitter this afternoon .
This , in and of itself , is not an unusual thing ; we are both WoW ( World of Warcraft ) players , though I am on a bit of a hiatus from the game , many of our other friends on twitter are also gamers , and quite often links of common interest ( as well as cute animals ) get shared .
What was unusual about this particular link was its content .
You see it was a link to a WoW blog , however the post was not about WoW , it was about the end of the world .
Honor ’s Code : What In the World Is Going On ?
Now , this is the dude ’s blog , and he can post whatever he wants , but not only did he proceed to preach at his readers from a rather inappropriate pulpit , he also uses “ facts ” that are so bad that they are n’t even wrong .
Then he did n’t even have the nerve to allow comments on this particular post , which says to me two things :
1 ) He is n’t so sure in what he is saying that he can handle any sort of criticism of what he believes ; and 2 ) He wants people to listen to him , but is n’t willing to do the same for others ; especially those that might not agree with him .
I ’ve read through his post .
Closed it .
Gone back and read it again .
Decided about posting about it , then ( obviously ) changed my mind .
Looking at this , in the end it is more or less the digital equivalent of someone standing on the street corner with a cardboard sign that says “ Repent !
The End is Nigh ! ”
That ’s all well and good , and well within his right to do , what really bothers me is the faulty logic , misconceptions and just plain bad science .
Seriously , I could refute pretty much his entire argument with one link .
This one , in fact : USGS Earthquake Facts and Statistics
But me being who I am I ca n’t let it go at just that .
Let ’s take a look at some of this in greater detail .
After going through the motions and giving all his reasoning for doing this ( because he cares about each and every one of you , of course ) he goes into what is probably one of the oldest “ End Times ” arguments of all time :
There are over 50 signs that God said we could look for but one that I keep seeing over and over again is what he said about earthquakes in Matthew 24:7 : For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in diverse places .
* Emphasis in original
Often times you also see “ war and rumors of war ” on this list of “ over 50 signs ” , or whatever else is the hot topic talking point of the day .
It is a simple fact that on Earth there are always famines , wars , and especially earthquakes .
War is , sadly , just a part of human nature , and earthquakes are a fact of life on a living planet .
People have been using these same references and reasoning to announce that the end of the world was at hand since at least the 4th century ( Tichonus was sure it was going to end in 381 , Hippolytus said 400 : A History of the End of the World , Rubinsky and Wiseman , 1982 ) However , since earthquakes are the latest popular talking point in the news media that is what the rapture set seem to be focusing on lately .
That brings up one of the key points to this , the news media .
The world is getting smaller .
It was true in 1873 when Jules Verne wrote Around the World in Eighty Days , and it is even truer now in our modern information age .
With cell phones , the internet , twitter , email , blogs and everything else we have near instant global communication , and countless 24 - hour cable news networks and websites looking for content to fill the hours .
So we hear of things sooner , and hear of more things that even twenty years ago would have gone mostly unreported .
In 1710 it might take years before someone in , say , London heard about a devastating earthquake in Chile , or a war battle in Baghdad , if they heard about it at all .
In 1810 much the same was true , news traveled slowly ; it could take weeks or months for major news to travel .
By 1910 technology had closed the communication gap to mere days , and as the century went on that gap grew ever smaller .
Now , in 2010 , we know things within minutes , if not seconds of their happening , I ’m sure some news rooms were still trying to find Haiti on a map by the time the news of the earthquake had already made it around the world on twitter .
Unless you live in a cave you should know that earthquakes are everywhere right now , in the last month we have seen three major quakes in Haiti , Chile and in Taiwan .
Just yesterday , there was a strong 6.0 magnitude earthquake in Turkey that killed 51 people .
Not only were there earthquakes but these four earthquakes in diverse places brought hundreds of aftershocks with each one .
There are n’t more earthquakes , we just hear about more of them , and hear about them sooner than we used to .
This is on top of more earthquakes being detected due to advancing technology .
Do n’t believe me ?
How about the United States Geological Survey :
The USGS estimates that several million earthquakes occur in the world each year .
Many go undetected because they hit remote areas or have very small magnitudes .
The NEIC now locates about 50 earthquakes each day , or about 20,000 a year .
As more and more seismographs are installed in the world , more earthquakes can be and have been located .
However , the number of large earthquakes ( magnitude 6.0 and greater ) has stayed relatively constant .
The short of it is that the USGS expects about 18 7.0 or greater earthquakes every year .
There have been 4 so far this year , and we are , give or take , about one third of the way through the year , so if we extrapolate that out we should have an estimated 16 earthquakes before the end of 2010 .
These numbers do not make the loss of life from these earthquakes any less tragic , but one has to realize that the loss of life in an earthquake is more a factor of where the earthquake happens than how strong it is .
A 6.0 earthquake in a heavily populated area , especially one with low construction standards or a large number of old buildings , is going to cause more damage and loss of life than an 8.0 magnitude earthquake in the middle of the Gobi desert .
( For those of you who love graphs , I know I do , here is the data in a more visual form : Earthquake Facts and Statistics Graphs )
Maybe you think I ’m just over exaggerating .
Actually I think you are being very uncritical in how you are looking at the information , and taking what you are told by others without looking into it deeper on your own to see if the science backs up the claims that are being made .
From here he launches into an appeal to emotion with a story about a man who died in the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980 , refusing to leave his lodge at Spirit Lake because he felt that the danger from the volcano had been “ over exaggerated . ”
What he leaves out is that the man , Harry Randall Truman , also told reporters “ If the mountain goes , I ’m going with it . ”
While it is another sad story , the tale of a stubborn old man ( he was 83 at the time ) has nothing to do with earthquakes or the end of the world or anything else he is saying .
“ This man underestimated a volcano and died , so you should n’t underestimate the importance of what I ’m saying ” is not a valid leap of logic .
From here his post devolves into all the usual suspects of logical fallacies and emotional pleas that you so often see in things like this ( Not to mention some comments that come across as down right insulting to any of his readers that might not share his faith ) .
If I had n’t already gone on so long I might take the time to deconstruct these as well , but this post is already bordering on Oracian in length so I shall leave that for others to do .
Things like this just make me want to assault someone with science .
to affect with sharp irritation and resentment , especially by some wound to pride :
She was greatly piqued when they refused her invitation .
to wound ( the pride , vanity , etc. ) .
Mr Cheney has a history of heart problems and has a pacemaker
Former US Vice - President Dick Cheney has been taken to hospital in Washington after experiencing chest pains , his office has said .
They said Mr Cheney , 69 , was " resting comfortably " at George Washington University Hospital and his doctors were evaluating the situation .
Mr Cheney , who left office in January last year , has a history of heart problems .
He has had four heart attacks and quadruple bypass surgery .
Hospital doctors told NBC
News that the former vice - president was stable and may receive additional treatment on Tuesday .
The television network said that Mr Cheney had had an angiogram test so that doctors could look into his coronary arteries , and that the results showed he might need more treatment .
AFP reported that Mr Cheney was due to meet former US President George W Bush and other members of the Bush administration on Friday , for the first time since they left office in January 2009 .
Mr Cheney has undergone several operations to clear blocked arteries and was fitted with a pacemaker in 2001 .
In October 2008 he underwent treatment to correct an abnormal heart rhythm .
Vimanas
Evidence of unexplained ancient aircraft can be found across the planet especially in areas where major civilizations once thrived .
Physical evidence of alien intervention in human history is undeniable .
Ancient Astronaut
Theory seeks to explain alien presence in the past linked with Ancient Aircraft and purported landing strips , especially in areas like India ( Vimanas ) , Egypt , and Mesoamerica .
Pictographs and megalithic monuments describe human interaction with these entities , allowing those in our timeline to piece together what happened in the past that shapes out destiny today as humanity evolves beyond this consciousness hologram .
A vimana is a word with several meanings ranging from temple or palace to mythological flying machines described in Sanskrit epics .
References to these flying machines are commonplace in ancient Indian texts , even describing their use in warfare .
As well as being able to fly within Earth 's atmosphere , vimanas were also said to be able to travel into space and travel under water .
Descriptions in the Vedas and later Indian literature detail vimanas of various shapes and sizes :
There 's a war occurring each day in our backyards -- plant versus plant - eating insect versus insect - eating insect .
Research by UC Irvine 's Kailen Mooney suggests the outcome -- of interest to farmers -- is a stalemate .
For a study published online on March 26 , in the journal Science , Mooney and colleagues studied 16 species of milkweed , a group of flowering plants found throughout the Western hemisphere .
The scientists sought to determine the relationship among plant growth , how plants defend themselves against plant - eaters ( with thorns and toxins , for example ) , and the protection plants receive from predators such as ladybugs that eat plant - hungry insects .
The herbivores -- in this case bright yellow aphids -- damage plants ; ladybugs can act as bodyguards , helping plants by eating aphids .
The researchers asked : Can plants have it all ?
Can they grow quickly and defend themselves against herbivores while at the same time solicit protection from ladybugs and other bodyguards ?
The answer : No .
Milkweed species that grow quickly ( a desirable trait ) are more vulnerable to insects that feed on them ( an undesirable trait ) , making those plants more dependent upon predators for their survival .
In other words , you can be either a hard - to - eat , slow growing plant that does n't need bodyguards , or a tasty , fast - growing plant that relies on outside protection .
The finding could be important to farmers trying to develop herbivore - proof , fast - growing crops , and it betters our understanding of how the natural world works .
" We can breed plants to for fast growth , but if we do that , it appears we 're weakening the plants ' immunity against herbivores , making them more dependent upon protection from potentially unreliable predators , " says Mooney , assistant professor of ecology & evolutionary biology .
And there may not be much that farmers can do .
" Milkweed has been evolving for as many as 20 million years .
Natural selection favors faster - growing plants and those that easily fight off insects , " Mooney says .
" If nature has n't found a way to combine both , perhaps it 's something that cannot be done . "

The report says low carbon technologies could fuel the economy
The government must act faster if the UK is to fully benefit from low carbon technology , a report by MPs has warned .
The Energy and Climate Change Committee said in 2008 there were 881,000 green sector jobs - but with extra funding that could rise by 44 % by 2015 .
But it criticised slow uptake of carbon capture systems , electric cars and home insulation , calling on the government to invest more in the technologies .
The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it was taking clear action .
Committee acting chairman Paddy Tipping MP said : " Investment in low carbon technologies must be seen as key to economic recovery .
" These technologies have the potential to reduce the carbon intensity at every stage of the energy supply chain , resulting in lower emissions , many new jobs and growth for the economy . "
The government have a vital role in the move towards a green economy
Paddy Tipping MP
The committee found that , while developing low carbon technologies would require government support , they have the potential to create jobs .
Mr Tipping added : " The government should increase the proportion of public money spent on the uptake of low carbon technologies because they have a vital role in the move towards a green economy . "
The government has previously said it plans to generate one - third of UK electricity from renewable sources by 2020 .
Meanwhile the private sector continues to invest in low carbon technologies , with General Electric announced 1,900 jobs building wind - turbines in Britain last week .
A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said : " We agree that the low carbon sector offers huge opportunities for economic growth and employment in the UK .
" Government 's policies are designed to enable the UK to seize the benefits of that growth . "
He added : " The government is taking clear action to drive the move to a low carbon economy . "

HEADS UP !
This article was written for an older version of node .
More up - to - date information may be available elsewhere .
Most people that learn JavaScript are coming from a background in another language .
This brings with it a view of how the world works that may be different from how it really works in JavaScript .
For this and other reasons , JavaScript is often misunderstood .
It 's not entirely our fault , the language was designed to work like one thing ( scheme - like ) , but look like another ( c - like ) .
This article will describe lexical scope and the " this " variable and how to control them rather than be controlled by them when in coding JavaScript .
It 's all about where you are .
In all programming languages , there is this idea of current scope and current context .
In JavaScript we have a lexical scope and a current " this " context .
In JavaScript all new scopes are created through " function " definitions .
But contrary to other c- like languages , this is the only way to make a new scope .
For loops do n't do it , if blocks do n't do it , plain curly braces assuredly do n't do it .
This simplicity is both a blessing and a curse .
First let 's have a couple of examples to explain creating scopes .
This is an example of global scope :
global.js //
Define a couple of global variables
var name = " Tim " ;
var age = 28 ;
// Access one of them from the global scope
name ;
This is an example of local scope :
local.js //
Create a couple of local variables in a function .
function newScope ( ) {
var name = " tim " ;
var age = 28 ;
}
//
Try to access the local variables from the global scope
// This will cause an error .
name ;
Lexical Scope
Lexical scope is the key to making closures work .
Here 's a quote from wikipedia about closures and lexical scope :
In computer science , a closure is a first - class function with free variables that are bound in the lexical environment .
Such a function is said to be " closed over " its free variables .
A closure is defined within the scope of its free variables , and the extent of those variables is at least as long as the lifetime of the closure itself .
So what does all that mean ?
Here 's an example :
lexical.js var name = " outer " ;
function one ( ) {
var name = " middle " ;
var other = " findme " ;
function two ( ) {
var name = " inner " ;
//
Here `name` is " inner " and `other` is " findme "
console .
dir ( { name : name , other : other } ) ;
}
two ( ) ;
//
Here `name` is " middle " and `other` is " findme "
console .
dir ( { name : name , other : other } ) ;
}
one ( ) ;
//
Here `name` is " outer " and `other` is undefined .
console .
dir ( { name : name } ) ;
console .
dir ( { other : other } ) ;
Here we see that local variables in an inner scope can shadow variables by the same name in the outer scope .
But from the outside , variables in the inside do n't exist .
Lexical scope is 100 % based on the physical location of the variables in the nesting in the code .
It does n't matter what path you might take to get to the inner function .
That 's how closures are able to make inner variables usable .
closure.js //
Make a function that returns a closure function .
function myModule ( ) {
var name = " tim " , age = 28 ;
return function greet ( ) {
return " Hello " + name + " .
Wow , you are " + age + " years old . " ;
}
}
// call `myModule` to get a closure out of it .
var greeter = myModule ( ) ;
// Call the closure
greeter ( ) ;
The variables name and age are local to the myModule function , but when we call greeter from the global scope , it does n't throw an error .
This is because the greet function has name and age in its lexical scope and so they 're accessible as if they were local variables .
Basically the way variable lookup works is that it goes up scope by scope looking for a variable by the requested name .
The context of " this "
In addition to the lexical scope .
JavaScript adds another layer of locality through the special keyword " this " .
This keyword looks and acts like any other javascript variable except that you can't modify it .
It acts as a reference to the context object , and as an object , you can get to its properties through normal dot or bracket notation .
The magic is that the value of " this " changes depending on what context your executing in .
In most cases , the context is the receiver of the message .
For example :
this .js #person var Person = {
name : " Tim " ,
age : 28 ,
greeting : function ( ) {
return " Hello " + this .
name + " .
Wow , you are " + this .
age + " years old . " ;
}
} ;
Person . greeting ( ) ;
Note that I was able to access Person.name and Person.age from within Person.greeting .
" this " is where it bites
The previous code almost looks like objects from other languages .
But that 's where it bites you .
As the author of the Person module , you have no assurance that " this " will be the same as " Person " .
For example , what if I wanted to store the greeting function somewhere else :
this .js #standalone var greeting = Person .
greeting ;
greeting ( ) ; //
Will get undefined for `this.name` and `this.age`
The problem here is that " this " in the body of the greeting function is now the global object and not the Person object .
How about one more example just for fun :
this .js #dog var Dog = {
name : " Alfred " ,
age : 110 ,
greeting : Person .
greeting
}
Dog .
greeting ( ) ; //
This will work and it will show the dog 's data .
The greeting function in Dog and the function in Person are the same function .
They 're both references to the same object in memory .
But depending on where it 's called from , can change the value of " this " .
Basically " this " is whatever object comes before the dot in the call .
That 's why Dog.greeting ( ) uses Dog as " this " and Person.greeting ( ) uses Person .
When there is nothing before the function call , then the global object is used for " this " .
Taming " this "
JavaScript comes with a couple of handy - dandy functions on Function .
prototype called call and apply .
They work about the same , but take arguments differently .
Going on from the previous examples , let 's make a new object that does n't even have a greeting function , but can still be used by it .
this .js #alien var Alien = {
name : " Zygoff " ,
age : 5432
}
Person .
greeting .
call ( Alien ) ;
What we 're saying here is to call the Person. greeting function , but inject the object Alien as the " this " value .
We could have used apply just the same for this example since there are no extra arguments .
Let 's make a generic function that can work with any object that has age and name properties :
this .js #make - older function makeOlder ( years , newname ) {
this .
age += years ;
if ( newname ) {
this .
name = newname ;
}
}
This function just adds years to any " this " object and optionally replaces the name .
It 's not tied to any particular object .
( In fact any function not using variables from outer scopes is independent )
Here is how we would use it with either call or apply .
this .js #use - it makeOlder .
call ( Person , 2 , " Old Tim " ) ;
makeOlder .
apply ( Dog , [ 1 , " Shaggy " ] ) ;
console . dir ({ Person : Person , Dog : Dog } ) ;
The difference is that each extra argument to call is an argument passed to the function .
But with apply , there are only two arguments .
They are the " this " object and an array of the parameters to pass to the function .
Binding " this "
Sometimes we really like our nice OOP style code and want to force JS to act that way .
We do n't like " this " changing on us depending on how we 're calling it all the time .
The most common place where it bites me is in an event based system that takes callbacks as arguments .
Here is a simple example from jQuery .
jquery.js #cart Cart = {
items : [ 1 , 4 , 2 ] ,
onClick : function ( ) {
// Do something with this .items .
}
}
$ ( " #mybutton " ) . click ( Cart . on Click ) ;
While this looks ok , it 's waiting for disaster .
Even though we have Cart.onClick , we 're not calling the onClick function yet .
the jQuery code will accept is as some parameter and at that point it has no way of knowing that onClick came from the Cart object .
Your " this " wo n't be what you expect when it finally gets called .
Let 's combine our knowledge of closures and lexical scope and make " this " scope act like it does in most OOP languages .
jquery.js # bad $ ( " #mybutton " ) . click ( function () { Cart . on Click ( ) } ) ;
We created a little closure that then calls Cart.on Click ( ) .
The problem with this ( besides being long and ugly ) is that is does n't pass through any function parameters or return values .
We can fix that some .
jquery.js # better $ ( " #mybutton " ) . click ( function ( ) { return Cart .
on Click .
apply ( Cart , arguments ) } ) ;
This works , but it 's even harder to read and understand .
If you do n't already know , " arguments " is another special keyword that is an array - like object that contains the arguments that were passed to the current inner-most function .
If Cart was a globally accessible singleton object we could just use the variable Cart directly instead of relying on " this " , but that 's often not the case when you have " classes " of objects sharing common functionality .
Would n't it be easier to somehow modify Cart.onClick so that " this " was always Cart from within it ?
jquery.js #bind function bind ( fn , scope ) {
return function ( ) {
return fn . apply ( scope , arguments ) ;
}
}
Cart .
on Click = bind ( Cart .
on Click , Cart ) ;
$ ( " #mybutton " ) . click ( Cart . on Click ) ;
There are various ways of doing this and in fact it 's often not the right solution .
If you 're just trying to make JavaScript act like language X then this is a great little tool , but it 's better to just learn the semantics of JavaScript .
Here we 've just created a closure that has the scope embedded .
Then we replace Cart.onClick with the bound closure and use the apply magic to pass through any arguments and return value automatically .
Var statements
The var statement is really just a keyword to specify which nested scope a variable applies to .
In fact , if you never used var , then all your variables would be global and walk all over each other .
var.js # globals global_var = true ;
function someFunc ( ) {
another_global = 42 ;
var local_var = 5 ;
}
This is especially dangerous in things like for loops :
var.js #loops function sum ( start , end ) {
var n = 0 ;
for ( i = start ; i <= end ; i ++ ) {
n += i ;
}
return n ;
}
function nested_sum ( num ) {
var n = 0 ;
for ( i = 1 ; i <= num ; i ++ ) {
n += sum ( 1 , i ) ;
}
return n ;
}
nested_sum ( 3 ) ; //
Expected value is 10 , but i values get tangled
The i variable in both loops is the same variable and so the inner loop will break the outer loop and give the wrong answer .
Also if I had not put var statements before the two n variables , then they would walk over each other and give a wrong answer too .
There is one word of caution for var users .
It does n't matter where in the function body you put the var word .
It only matters which function body you put it in .
And its scope is inner to function parameters .
For example :
var.js #onevar name = " Tim " ;
function greet ( ) {
console . dir ( name ) ;
// name is undefined
// Lots of code , and them later on you have :
var name ;
}
greet ( ) ;
function greet2 ( name ) {
console . dir ( name ) ;
// name is " Tim " because functions arguments are special .
// Lots of code , and them later on you have :
var name ;
}
greet2 ( " Tim " ) ;
This is why jslint tells you to put all your var statements at the top of a function .
I 've actually had this one bite me because there was a page of code between the top of the function and the var statement .
I could n't figure out why my variable I was passing in got set to undefined before the first line of the function body .
Conclusion
There some universal rules that will go a long way to understanding scope in JavaScript :
The only way to create a new scope is through the function keyword .
Nothing else , not even for ... in blocks create new scopes .
keyword .
Nothing else , not even blocks create new scopes .
The var statement declares a variable as local to the current scope and the entire current scope , not just from the var statement onward .
These local variables shadow any existing variables from outer scopes .
statement declares a variable as local to the current scope and the current scope , not just from the statement onward .
These local variables shadow any existing variables from outer scopes .
All variables except " this " and " arguments " follow lexical scope .
Their meaning is defined by the physical location in the code .
" and " " follow lexical scope .
Their meaning is defined by the in the code .
The variables " this " and " arguments " change at every nesting level .
If you want to preserve them in a closure , then you need to first create a reference to their value through another variable that follows lexical scope .
" and " " change at nesting level .
If you want to preserve them in a closure , then you need to first create a reference to their value through another variable that follows lexical scope .
The value of " this " is defined by how the function is called .
You can control this through use of apply and call .
There are exceptions to these rules , but only when messing with things like function decompilation , eval , and the with keyword .
Even then you 're still following the rules , just not in the way you 'd expect .
Function decompilation + eval transplants a function into a new lexical scope .
And with can be used to make things like this .
name appear as local lexical variables but work like " this " properties .

We would strenuously resist not having the ability to approve rates or having the commissioners ’ oversight of rates overturned . ”
“ You are not necessarily helping the consumer if you keep rates artificially low , ” Ms. Praeger said .
“ What ’s worse for the consumer : having a premium increase or having to pay the full amount of a medical expense because the company is out of business ? ”
Mr. Obama has cited his proposal for a Health Insurance Rate Authority as one of the most significant elements of his plan to remake the nation ’s health care system .
Representative Jan Schakowsky , Democrat of Illinois , said that in a meeting with liberal Democrats last week , Mr. Obama “ focused in particular on the new provision that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to block exorbitant premium increases . ”
As an example , Mr. Obama has pointed to a request by Anthem Blue Cross to increase premiums for individual policyholders in California by an average of 25 percent , with some rates going up as much as 39 percent .
Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services , called Monday on five big insurers to provide detailed public justifications for their latest premium increases .
“ If insurance companies are going to raise rates , the least they can do is tell us why , ” said Ms. Sebelius , who has called their profits “ wildly excessive . ”
American Atheists will be among the non-believer groups led by the Secular Coalition for America for an historic briefing with the Obama Administration in Washington , DC , on Friday , 26 February 2010 CE .
Representatives of several leading Atheist , Freethought , and Humanist organizations will gather in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building , next door to the White House , at 11:00 AM ET , for the briefing .
Dr. Ed Buckner , President of American Atheists , said " We are delighted that we will get the chance to speak to and to hear from the Obama administration at the briefing with the Secular Coalition for America tomorrow .
We will not be seeking support for Atheism from the federal administration , because we know they must be neutral and because we are confident that our conclusions can compete and win in the marketplace of ideas , unaided by government .
We seek an end to special rights for religious ideas and beliefs -- in all regulations , laws , procedures , and pronouncements .
The privileging of religiosity violates the First Amendment and good sense . "

NASA scientists analyzing 30 years of satellite data have found that the amount of ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation reaching Earth 's surface has increased markedly over the last three decades .
Most of the increase has occurred in the mid-and - high latitudes , and there 's been little or no increase in tropical regions .
The new analysis shows , for example , that at one line of latitude -- 32.5 degrees -- a line that runs through central Texas in the northern hemisphere and the country of Uruguay in the southern hemisphere , 305 nanometer UV levels have gone up by some 6 percent on average since 1979 .
The primary culprit : decreasing levels of stratospheric ozone , a colorless gas that acts as Earth 's natural sunscreen by shielding the surface from damaging UV radiation .
The finding reinforces previous observations that show UV levels are stabilizing after countries began signing an international treaty that limited the emissions of ozone - depleting gases in 1987 .
The study also shows that increased cloudiness in the southern hemisphere over the 30 - year period has impacted UV .
Jay Herman , a scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , stitched together data from several earth observing satellites -- including NASA 's Aura satellite , NOAA weather satellites , and commercial satellites -- to draw his conclusions .
The results were published in the Journal of Geophysical Research in February .
" Overall , we 're still not where we'd like to be with ozone , but we 're on the right track , " said Jay Herman .
" We do still see an increase in UV on a 30 - year timescale , but it 's moderate , it could have been worse , and it appears to have leveled off . "
In the tropics , the increase has been minimal , but in the mid-latitudes it has been more obvious .
During the summer , for example , UV has increased by more than 20 percent in Patagonia and the southern portions of South America .
It has risen by nearly 10 percent in Buenos Aires , a city that 's about the same distance from the equator as Little Rock , Ark .
At Washington , D.C. 's latitude -- about 35 degrees north -- UV has increased by about 9 percent since 1979 .

The southern hemisphere tends to have more UV exposure because of the ozone hole , a seasonal depletion of the ozone layer centered on the South Pole .
There are also fewer particles of air pollution -- which help block UV -- due to the comparatively small numbers of people who live in the southern hemisphere .
Despite the overall increases , there are clear signs that ultraviolet radiation levels are on the verge of falling .
Herman 's analysis , which is in agreement with a World Meteorological Report published in recent years , shows that decreases in ozone and corresponding increases in UV irradiance leveled off in the mid-nineties .
The Many Sides of Radiation
Shorter ultraviolet wavelengths of light contain more energy than the infrared or visible portions of sunlight that reach Earth 's surface .
Because of this , UV photons can break atmospheric chemical bonds and cause complex health effects .
Longer wavelengths ( from 320 to 400 nanometers ) -- called UV - A -- cause sunburn and cataracts .
Yet , UV - A can also improve health by spurring the production of Vitamin D , a substance that 's critical for calcium absorption in bones and that helps stave off a variety of chronic diseases .
advertisement
UV - B , which has slightly shorter wavelengths ( from 320 to 290 nanometers ) , damages DNA by tangling and distorting its ladder - like structure , causing a range of health problems such as skin cancer and diseases affecting the immune system .
As part of his study , Herman developed a mathematical technique to quantify the biological impacts of UV exposure .
He examined and calculated how changing levels of ozone and ultraviolet irradiance affect life .
For Greenbelt , Md. , for example , he calculated that a 7 percent increase in UV yielded a 4.4 percent increase in the damage to skin , a 4.8 percent increase in damage to DNA , a 5 percent increase in Vitamin D production , and less than a percent of increase in plant growth .
" If you go to the beach these days , you 're at slightly higher risk of getting skin cancer ( without protection ) , " Herman said , though he noted the risk would have been even greater in the absence of regulations on ozone - depleting substances .
Last year , one of Herman 's Goddard colleagues , Paul Newman , published a study showing that the ozone hole likely would have become a year - round fixture and UV radiation would increase 650 percent by 2065 in mid-latitude cities if not for the Montreal Protocol , an international treaty signed in 1987 that limited the amount of ozone - depleting gases countries could emit .
Clouds and Hemispheric Dimming
In addition to analyzing ozone and ultraviolet trends , Herman also used satellite data to study whether changes in cloudiness have affected UV trends .
To his surprise , he found that increased cloudiness in the southern hemisphere produced a dimming effect that increased the shielding from UV compared to previous years .
In the higher latitudes especially , he detected a slight reduction -- typically of 2 to 4 percent -- in the amount of UV passing through the atmosphere and reaching the surface due to clouds .
" It 's not a large amount , but it 's intriguing , " Herman said .
" We are n't sure what 's behind it yet . "
Vitali Fioletov , a Canadian scientist and member of the World Meteorological Organization 's advisory group on ultraviolet radiation , agreed that Herman 's findings about cloudiness warrant additional investigation .
" I found the cloud effects on the global scale to be the most interesting aspect of the study , " he said .
" This is n't something you could see without satellites . "
Herman synthesized measurements from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS ) aboard Nimbus 7 and Earth Probe , the Ozone Monitoring Instrument ( OMI ) on NASA 's Aura satellite , NASA 's Sea -Viewing Wide Field - of - view sensor ( SeaWiFS ) on the commercial SeaStar satellite , and the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument ( SBUV ) on several polar orbiting NOAA weather satellites .
* California probes credit ratings of MBS
* State sends subpoenas , response expected within a month
* Agencies have no immediate comment on substance of issues
( Adds Fitch comment , deputy AG comment )
By Peter Henderson
SAN FRANCISCO , Sept 17 ( Reuters ) - California Attorney General Jerry Brown issued subpoenas on Thursday to Standard & Poor ’s , Moody ’s Investors Service , and Fitch Ratings as he launched an investigation of whether they broke state law with the ratings they provided mortgage - backed securities .
“ These agencies gave their seal of approval , their highest ratings , to underlying securities that were highly dangerous and in fact wreaked havoc on the lives of millions of people , ” Brown said at a news conference .
The investigation focuses on whether the agencies broke consumer protection and unfair business practice laws , in the most populous U.S. state , which give the state broad authority to bring suit in cases of false advertising and unfair competition .
“ The agencies have been coddled and protected , ” Brown said .
“ It ’s time we smoked ‘ em out . ”
Agencies claim first amendment freedom - of - speech protection for their ratings , but courts have given mixed support .
A federal court in early September allowed a lawsuit against agencies claiming such protection to go forward .
Supervising Deputy Attorney General Kathrin Sears , who heads the probe , said the agencies had hidden behind the First Amendment , in her view .
The investigation was just beginning , and the state needed to review the agencies responses , she added .
The agencies must respond to subpoena questions and requests for documents by Oct. 19 , but could seek an extension , she said .
S&P , owned by McGraw - Hill Companies Inc. MHP.N , said it had not received a subpoena and could not comment .
Fitch , owned by Fimalac SA LBCP .
PA , said it expected to provide information once it received a request , and Moody 's Corp MCO.N said it had received inquiries from state and regulatory authorities about its ratings and would cooperate as appropriate after reviewing them .
SUBPRIME CRISIS PROBE
At the peak of the housing boom , the agencies gave their highest ratings to complicated financial instruments , including securities backed by subprime mortgages , making them appear as safe as government - issued Treasury bonds , Brown ’s office said .
But California ’s economy slumped as house prices fell sharply in the past couple of years .
Its unemployment rate has hit record highs and government faced a major crisis as tax revenue plummeted .
The purchases of the securities helped fuel the housing bubble by providing funds for lenders to “ issue ever - riskier subprime and other toxic mortgages , ” Brown ’s statement said .
“ When the bubble burst , however , those risky mortgages defaulted in record numbers and investors were left holding worthless securities , unable to sell them , ” the statement said .
“ Subsequently , the agencies downgraded the credit ratings of $ 1.9 trillion in residential mortgage backed securities , a tacit acknowledgment of their failure to adequately assess the risks of the debt they rated . ”
Brown said it was unclear how long the probe would take and what remedies and remuneration it would seek if California sued the agencies .
“ This is real stuff here , and yet for the last year and a half , action has not been taken , ” he said .
Federal Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Schapiro on Thursday in prepared remarks said the agency was considering a series of proposals to bolster regulation of the agencies , including ones to shed light on ‘ rating shopping ’ and conflicts of interest by the companies , which are paid by the issuers they rate .
[ ID :nN17202110 ]
Brown ’s probe was applauded in California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer ’s office , which has been a harsh critic of credit rating agencies and has been pressing them to grade corporate debt and less risky municipal debt by the same standards .
“ The state of California along with other municipal issuers are all too familiar with wildly inaccurate ratings from the agencies , ” Lockyer spokesman Tom Dresslar said .
“ The ratings do not come close to reflecting the risk of default , which in our case is nil . ”
“ It ’s clear that the rating agencies played a significant role in the downfall of the U.S. economy , ” Dresslar said .

Warning , this blog post may cause you to become quite angry at the U.S. government .
So this last week , Obama heralded that Citibank was going to pay back all of the TARP monies it had received last year .
All the talking heads were making such a big deal about it .
The problem is that nobody told the whole story .
I credit Jack Spirko at The Survival Podcast for bringing this to my attention .
As part of the deal that gave Obama his favorable photo opp , the IRS gave Citibank a favorable tax ruling the will save it billions of dollars in tax payments over the next few years .
Some experts say that it may actually be more than they received in TARP .
You can read the article at The Washington Post
After losing to Carolina on Tuesday the Leafs actually look worse than their 29th place record indicates .
The power play stinks and the penalty kill is worse .
Our goalies can't save anything and our forwards can't score .
Brian Burke built this team and it's about time he be held accoutable : this team is worse than last year 's team .
Something needs to be done about it .
Wait hold on , I thought we could handle a rebuild ?
We 're the fans that have spent time saying " rebuild the Leafs , we 'll suffer if it means we 'll be better in the future " .
So why is everyone losing their mind right now ?
Did anyone really think we'd do anything more than maybe squeak into the playoffs if we played our cards right ?
I know people are upset about the Kessel deal , I think the timing might be wrong personally , but Burke understands what he gave up .
If Burke thinks Kessel is a better player than Taylor Hall and whoever we could draft next year then the deal makes sense period .
You can't can a GM for one bad season .
These moves take a long time to develop .
Evaluating bringing in Kessel or shipping out Tlusty can't be done objectively for years .
If Burke got fired now and another GM came in do you fire him in a year when the Leafs are n't in the playoffs ?
Do you keep firing GMs every year until one stiff gets lucky and his three or four predecessors made good moves that benefit the new guy ?
This does n't make any sense .
Bottom line is this is a rebuilding team .
This team is going to be horrible .
Next year 's team is going to be horrible .
Our GM is grabbing the pieces that he wants and waiting to grab the pieces that he needs .
Let 's have a little patience Leafs Nation , as we 've all learned if your team does n't win the Cup the season was an unmitigated disaster .
We were n't going to win the Cup this year under any circumstances and that 's true for next year too .
This is what cheering for a rebuilding team looks like .
Relax .
ps. Toskala still sucks and I hate him personally .

On Monday night , two teenagers stood before
and essentially pleaded that the grown - ups in charge change how sex education is taught in their district .
Their courage was a timely reminder that we ignore our children at their peril .
The first student to speak in the room of 150 or so in attendance was 17 - year - old Daniel Sparks .
Teenage boys do n't come any cleaner - cut or more poised than Daniel .
In a strong , steady voice , the junior at Parma Senior High School attacked the district 's abstinence - only - until - marriage sex education program , taught by Operation Keepsake .
The program sounds like a military exercise , but it sends kids virtually unarmed into a sexually complex and potentially dangerous world .
This , Daniel told the school board , is poor public health .
" Operation Keepsake has made me question education as a whole , for while they scared us into understanding what could go wrong , they afforded us no information on how things could go right , " he said .
" On how to protect ourselves , on the effectiveness of contraception , and empowering us with knowledge to make the right decisions before making the wrong ones . "
Daniel told the board that , for 19 months , he has been unable to meet or even speak with those responsible for making decisions about how he and his classmates learn about sex , despite his dozens of letters , phone calls and e-mails .
" As a gay student , " he asked , " how can I be expected to uphold a standard of abstinence until marriage when I live in a state where I cannot marry ? "
Daniel 's classmate , 16 - year - old Jelena Loncar , borrowed from Operation Keepsake 's own language to blast the curriculum for promoting gender stereotypes .
" I personally do n't view men as predators or protectors , " she said .
" And I certainly do n't view myself as a treasure or a target .
I found it insulting and undermining that Operation Keepsake reduced me to a social stereotype . "
Daniel and Jelena added that they were abstinent , but only because access to comprehensive sex education elsewhere helped them make informed and confident choices for their young lives .
The audience was respectful during the students ' speeches .
There were audible gasps only after Jelena pointed out that , in her high school 's sophomore class alone , eight girls were pregnant .
Several parents came up afterward to congratulate the teenagers for their courage and to voice support .
Superintendent Sarah Zatik , who earlier in the meeting announced that she was resigning in July , assured Daniel that she would meet with him .
She told me later she favored comprehensive sex education , and would form a committee to " start the conversation . "
Most parents -- liberal , conservative and somewhere in between -- want their children to abstain from sex , but they also want them to be safe if they choose otherwise .
The overwhelming majority of studies have shown , time and again , that abstinence - plus education is more effective than programs like Operation Keepsake .
Abstinence - only proponents are heralding a small study published this month in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine that showed , for the first time , that their brand of sex education reduced sexual activity by nearly a third in 12 - and 13 - year - olds .
The study involved 662 African - American middle - school students in four low - income schools in the northeastern United States .
An editorial accompanying the report cautioned against reading too much into this , and the study 's lead author , psychologist John B. Jemmott III , agreed .
" Policy should not be based on just one study , but an accumulation of empirical findings from several well - designed , well - executed studies , " Jemmott wrote .
Meanwhile , let 's keep this in mind :
The Centers for Disease Control reported only three months ago that chlamydia , gonorrhea and syphilis continue to spread in the United States , and that almost half of the 19 million new sexually transmitted infections each year affect 15 - to 24 - year - olds .
" We have among the highest rates of STDs of any developed country in the world , " John Douglas , director of the division of sexually transmitted diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told Reuters .
" We have n't been promoting the full battery of messages , " Douglas said .
" We have been sending people out with one seatbelt in the whole car . "
When it comes to protecting our kids , perhaps we need more teenagers like Daniel Sparks and Jelena Loncar in the driver 's seat .
After seven years on TV Ice - Catraz , Futurama is coming back to Comedy Central in June , with 26 episodes on order .
Earlier today , comedycentral.com posted a 30 - second teaser trailer for the relaunched series which , while it might not send fans into paroxysms of laughter , will at least elicit some nostalgia .
With that nostalgia lighting our hearts afire , at least until we remember Bender ’s Game , we thought we ’d revisit the eight best minor characters from the original run of Futurama : ( The Benders and John A. Zoidbergs of the world are disqualified here . )
8. Hedonism Bot
This grape - loving , solid gold bon vivant ( built with taxpayer money , of course ) is a decadent , vomiting opera patron , and he has no regrets .
Interesting tidbit from Infosphere : “ In the season three commentary , Matt Groening points out the importance of the name being hedonism bot and not hedonist bot – he is not only hedonist , he is the actual personification of hedonism . ”
7. Elzar
Goro - like smarmy space chef Elzar is one of those Futurama touches that ’s at once quaint and endearing : An Emeril parody ?
Really ?
So early 2000s .
But instead of saying “ give it some bam ! ”
Elzar just likes to shout “ Bam ! ” a lot , often quite threateningly .
6. Fry ’s Dog , Seymour
Whereas most of the other characters on this list are here for comedic purposes , Fry ’s dog , Seymour , is here for pathos :
The episode he appears in , “ Jurassic Bark , ” is unexpectedly sad and touching .
There ’s even a Facebook group called “ I cried for the dog episode of Futurama . ”
Not going to spoil the episode here , but there ’s a YouTube video of you want to see the tear - jerker of an ending .
5. Beelzebot
Whew !
Back to comedy .
Beelzebot , a.k.a. the Robot Devil , not only rules over Robot Hell ( in New Jersey ) , he can play a mean fiddle .
See for yourself :
4. Richard Nixon ’s head
Matt Groening definitely has a weird Richard Nixon obsession : see : The Simpsons .
How to port him into the future ?
Easy : put his disembodied head in a jar and make him evil , funny , and still very capable of winning elections .
You do n’t get your face ( and the jar it ’s in ) on the $ 1000 and $ 300 bills by catering to Communists .
3. The Hyper - Chicken
Just plead insanity !
The half - Jimmy Stewart , half - Foghorn Leghorn Hyper - Chicken is not actually a particularly good lawyer , but his track record is not bad , when he ’s not terrifying young witnesses ( see below ) .
And while he may just be a simple Hyper - Chicken , he knows when he ’s finger - licked .
2. Harold Zoid
Zoidberg ’s vaudevillian director uncle has some of the best lines in the series , which Hollywood would do well to listen to : “ Just because its a dramatic scene does n’t mean you cant do a little comedy in the background . ”
“ You know , through all my ups and downs , I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar .
But tonight , I realized what ’s really important is to win two Oscars .
I ’m kidding , I ’m kidding . ”
In terms of sheer character , Harold Zoid would actually be our # 1 favorite , except …
1. Hypnotoad
ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD .

Have a tip we should know ?
tips@themarysue.com
The Obama administration is escalating economic sanctions against Iran .
Administered by a secretive unit within the US Treasury Department , they will freeze the assets of Revolutionary Guard Gen .
Rostam Qasemi as well as four subsidiaries of a construction firm that he leads .
These sanctions build upon existing U.S. unilateral sanctions targeting shippers , financial institutions , and elements of the Guard Corps some believe are promoting Iran ’s missile and nuclear programs .
Economic warfare expert R. Thomas Naylor extensively documents that such sanctions create black markets and spread corruption while doing relatively little to deter rogue regimes .
Obvious economic dynamics create vast margins for smugglers and traders willing to bust embargoes .
Unless the economy of a target country is particularly dependent upon the influence or volume of goods from any single international partner , profiteers quickly step into the breach .
Sanctions typically punish legitimate traders while favoring corruption around the world .
That corrupting nature of sanctions reaches far into the US .
One example is Marc Rich , indicted in the United States on federal charges of illegal oil deals with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis .
Rich broke US embargoes by purchasing Iranian crude under special deals with Ayatollah Khomeini .
Rich then sold them at healthy margins to legitimate traders locked out of the market by US sanctions .
Forbes ranked the intrepid Rich as the 242nd richest American in 2006 with a net worth of US $ 1.5 billion .
Rich stayed outside the U.S. until he arranged for an unprecedented pardon from President Bill Clinton on January 20 , 2001 .
Eric Holder , then acting as deputy attorney general , gave Clinton his “ neutral , leaning towards favorable ” recommendation to pardon the Switzerland - based fugitive financier after a quiet and intense campaign by the Israeli government ’s Ehud Barak and Shimon Peres and the US Israel lobby .
But the temptations of sanctions busting are n’t an “ elites only ” affair .
Under the highly problematic US - Israel Free Trade Agreement , US growers should have an advantage in supplying the $ 20 million Israeli pistachio market .
But grower complaints meticulously documented in 2007 to the US Trade Representative reveal that Israel prefers to avoid importing American nuts while violating its own “ Trading with the Enemy Act ” by purchasing Iranian pistachios through Turkey .
Although US growers supplied scientific test data to the US Trade Representative validating these claims , no punitive measures have been taken by Israel or the USTR ( an office of the President ) .
History suggests that Israelis and their US lobby ’s financial backers will be first in line to violate so - called “ crippling sanctions ” against Iran , a country over which the US has relatively little direct economic leverage .
This adds insult to injury , since a real US economic sanctions regime — likely to have been highly successful in averting conditions underlying any potential Middle East nuclear arms race — has been suppressed since it was signed into law over three decades ago .
The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 as amended by the Symington Amendment of 1976 and the Glenn Amendment of 1977 prohibited US military assistance to countries that acquire or transfer nuclear reprocessing technology outside of international nonproliferation regimes .
Israel , unlike Iran , is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
The declassified US Army report titled The Joint Operating Environment 2008 identifies Israel as a nuclear weapons power in " a growing arc of nuclear powers running from Israel in the west through an emerging Iran to Pakistan , India , and on to China , North Korea , and Russia in the east . "
Jimmy Carter became the first former President to confirm in 2008 that Israel had secretly financed , developed , and deployed an undeclared arsenal of nuclear weapons .
Israeli Mordecai Vanunu long ago released his damning photos of Israeli nuclear weapons and facilities for which he served 18 years in prison .
If the President wishes to disburse US taxpayer - funded foreign aid to Israel in compliance with US law , he may do so only by issuing a special waiver , available for public review , as is currently the case with US aid for Pakistan .
Yet every president from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama has violated their oath of office — all refused to either withhold aid or sign the short presidential waiver that would make delivering taxpayer funded US foreign aid to Israel legal under Symington and Glenn .
If US presidents had faithfully executed this US law in order to reign in the Israeli nuclear weapons program since in the 1970s , there can be little doubt that the Middle East would be a vastly better place .
Israel is fully dependent on access to the US market , diplomatic cover , and vast military aid .
Israel would have been motivated to negotiate in good faith a comprehensive peaceful settlement with its near and distant neighbors , none of which would feel pressure to establish a deterrent to Israel ’s nuclear weapons .
But in terms of political coercion , Israel ’s arsenal is pointed squarely at the US .
Back in 1960 the CIA estimated [ PDF ] that " Possession of a nuclear weapon capability , or even the prospect of achieving it , would clearly give Israel a greater sense of security , self - confidence , and assertiveness … Israel would be less inclined than ever to make concessions … "
The presidential history of capitulation to Israeli violators unmasks these new economic sanctions for what they truly are : corrupt “ box checking exercises ” as Israel ’s lobby eagerly drives the US toward yet another needless — but long planned — military conflict which serves no legitimate American interest .
Nu de putine ori ni se intampla sa ne confruntam cu probleme dintre cele mai diverse , care ne pot da serios peste cap bunul mers al vietii noastre , iar in multe cazuri nu prea ne incumetam sa tragem o fuga la medic pentru a ni le rezolva .
Daca stam putin sa ne gandim la motive ( timpul pierdut stand la coada , banii pe care ii cheltuim pe serviciile medicale si asa mai departe ) nici nu este de mirare ca procedam in acest fel .
Ce este de facut atunci ?
Venim cu o veste cat se poate de buna – solutiile naturale pot fi gasite la tot pasul , fiind mai usor ca niciodata sa te poti trata singur , fara a mai face o vizita la medic .
Desigur , noi nu recomandam acest lucru decat in unele situatii in care simptomele nu sunt unele foarte grave , asadar nu sunt unele care sa va poata puna viata in pericol .
De obicei atunci cand vine vorba de intretinerea sanatatii , obtinerea unei siluete perfecte si obtinerea celor mai bun performante sexuale mergem la sigur daca ne indreptam atentia spre una dintre aceste solutii .
La ce trebuie sa fii atent inainte de a scoate banii din buzunar ?
Trebuie sa stii inca de la inceput faptul ca nu orice produs pe care il gasesti pe internet poate sa te ajute , deoarece sunt destul de multe companii care nu isi urmaresc propriile interese , ceea ce inseamna ca nu le pasa deloc daca produsele lor au sau nu efect , daca pot pune sau nu viata celor care le folosesc in pericol .
Acesta este principalul motiv pentru care recomandam citirea de review - uri inainte de a cumpara .
Astfel de review - uri iti sunt puse la dispozitie si de site - ul nostru , iar mai jos iti vom prezenta principalele noastre recomandari in functie de nevoile fiecaruia .
Slabire sanatoasa cu ajutorul pastilelor , produselor de tip spray si bauturi naturale
Atunci cand vine vorba de obtinerea siluetei perfecte trebuie sa recunoastem ca numarul optiunilor pe care le avem la dispozitie este unul complesitor de mare , fiind extrem de greu sa ne hotaram spre care merita sa ne indreptam atentia si de care trebuie sa stam la distanta .
Asadar pe aceasta nisa este mai important ca niciodata sa te documentezi temeinic inainte de a scoate banii din buzunar , mai ales daca stam sa ne gandim ca multe dintre reactiile adverse vin in urma folosirii unor produse necorespunzatoare .
Ce poti face pentru a slabi mai rapid ?
Cu siguranta ai mai auzit pana acum de dietele cu ciocolata , care iti poate aduce atat de multe beneficii , nu doar in ceea ce priveste silueta , ci si sanatatea generala a organismului .
Pentru ca efectul sa fie unul maxim trebuie insa sa alegi mai bine un produs precum Chocolate Slim , cel care iti ofera toata doza necesara de cacao pentru a arde grasimile din organism intr -un ritm mai alert .
Pe langa asta , o sa te poti bucura si de un gust delicios , scaderea riscului de aparitie a atacului de cord , reglarea nivelului de zahar din organism , scaderea nivelului de colesterol rau , alungarea depresiei si multe altele .
Pe langa ciocolata mai exista si asa - zisele spray - uri pentru slabit , care isi pot dovedi in destul de multe cazuri utilitatea , mai ales in cazul persoanelor care isi petrec o foarte mare parte din timp pe drumuri .
Daca preferi clasicele pastile pentru slabit , atunci afla ca cele mai bune astfel de produse la care poti apela sunt cele la baza carora sau extractele naturale , precum Forskolin Active , facut din extractul de radacina Coleus Forskohlii , o planta care este folosita in medicina traditionala de foarte multi ani de zile .
Pe langa asta , nu trebuie sa uitam ca , in cazul in care nu ne surade ideea de a apela la pastile , spray - uri ori bauturi , plasturii pentru slabit pot face si ei minuni , mai ales atunci cand vine vorba de ajutorul primit in eliminarea toxinelor din corp .
Pastilele Minci Ball
Forte sunt considerate de multi ca fiind cea mai usoara metoda de detoxifiere ( vezi si Detoxic ) si slabire existenta la ora actuala .
Noi i- am facut un review si tindem sa le dam crezare .
Imbunatatirea vietii sexuale – marirea penisului si obtinerea de erectii puternice
Viata sexuala nu mai reprezinta pentru nimeni un subiect tabu , cel putin nu atat de mult precum era considerata in urma cu 30 - 50 de ani sau mai mult .
Gasim informatii legate de orice aspect al sexului si problemelor pe care le putem intampina , precum si asupra solutiilor la care putem apela pentru a le trata , asadar este si pacat sa nu pofitam la maxim de acest accest avans tehnologic .
Printre cele mai comune probleme care isi pot face aparitia in dormitor il privesc in principal pe barbat , cel care se poate trezi in imposibilitatea de a duce la bun sfarsit un act sexual , sau chiar de a-l incepe , datorita lipsei erectiei sau a erectiei incomplete .
Ejacularea precoce reprezinta de asemenea o problema care aduce depresiile in randurile barbatilor , iar acest lucru a dus la ascensiunea produselor care promit stoparea ei , unde putem da ca exemplu pe Climax Control , despre care am vorbit anul trecut intr-un review dedicat .
Pentru a trata disfunctiile erectile ne putem gandi in primul rand la schimbarea stilului de viata , iar aici ne referim in special la alimentatie , cea care poate juca un rol important aici .
Tratarea problemelor cu prostata este de asemenea necesara pentru o viata sexuala activa , iar aici cel mai mult poate sa ne ajuta Prostabium , eficienta sa fiind dovedita de multe ori de catre medici .
Nu trebuie sa uitam bineinteles nici de suplimentele alimentare ( precum Erogan ) , cele care au la baza lor doar ingrediente naturale si care pot face minuni in incurajarea trezirii „ lu ’ ala micu ' ” , precum este cazul lui El Macho , el fiind capabil sa actioneze si sa ofere primele efecte imediat dup prima aplicare .
Desigur , pentru multi nivelul potentei poate reprezenta ultimul lucru la care se gandesc , mai ales daca au un penis mic .
In aceasta situatie ce putem face ?
Un raspuns foarte bun la aceasta intrebare poate fi reprezentat de Titan Gel ( unul dintre cele mai bune produse atunci cand vine vorba de marirea penisului in mod natural si fara reactii adverse ) , dar si de Maxi Size ( care se apropie foarte mult de rezultatele oferite de produsul anterior ) .
Iata asadar cum putem gasi cu usurinta cate o solutie la orice problema de natura sexuala am avea .
Lista nu se termina insa aici , iar asta pentru ca piata produselor pentru imbunatatirea potentei ne pune la dispozitie o gramada de posibilitati atunci cand vine vorba de a condimenta viata sexuala .
Pe langa cele mentionate anterior mai putem adauga fara nicio problema pe lista si pe Maxatin , care are ca principal avantaj sporirea placerii barbatului , pe care il ajuta sa obtina erectii mult mai puternice si orgasme mai intense , dar care va imbunatati semnificativ si performantele sexuale .
Sa nu uitam nici de Vigrax , care in ultima perioada a inceput sa fie din ce in ce mai apreciat de catre barbatii din Romania , iar motivele au fost evidentiate in review - ul dedicat .
Ingrijirea tenului
Orice femeie isi doreste sa aiba un ten perfect , iar pentru ca acest lucru sa devina realitate este capabila sa apeleze la orice solutie sau metoda existenta .
Inainte de a face asta insa este bine sa identifici cat mai bine tipul de ten , astfel incat sa ai siguranta ca vei alege doar cele mai bune produse pentru tine , care sa isi faca treaba exact asa cum trebuie , fara a te trezi cu iritatii a doua zi .
Stii cu siguranta care sunt cele patru mari tipuri de ten , fiind vorba de tenul cu piele uscata , cel cu piele normala , tenul mixt si tenul gras .
Dupa cum stii deja ( mai mult ca sigur ) fiecare are un anumit mod de a fi ingrijit .
Nu vom intra aici in foarte multe detalii privind modul in care identifici tipul de ten pe care il ai , deoarece am vorbit deja intr-un articol separat .
Vom aduce insa in discutie cateva dintre produsele care intr-adever merita atentia ta .
Este bine de stiut ca intotdeauna vom curata foarte bine fata seara , inainte de culcare ( este de preferat sa dam jos tot machiajul ) , iar acest lucru este valabil si dimineata , astfel incat sa eliminam pielea moarta acumulata si impuritatile .
Putem face acest lucru fie folosind produse / creme create special pentru asta , fie apeland la remedii de ingrijire facute direct acasa , apeland la ceea ce putem gasi in bucataria noastra .
In cazul in care faci parte din categoria femeilor care prefera , din comoditate , produsele de ingrijire a tenului , atunci o buna alegere poate fi reprezentata de Goji Cream aceasta fiind o crema de calitate , capabila sa te ajute sa lupti eficient impotriv semnelor de imbatranire a pielii .
Este bine , cu toate acestea , sa iti schimbi si putin stilul de viata , in sensul ca este de preferat sa faci mai multa miscare si sa consumi mai multe fructe si legume – chiar pot face minuni aceste mici schimbari .
La nivelul pielii fetei isi mai pot face apartia si alte diferite tipuri de leziuni , iar in tratarea acestora e bine sa apelezi la produse precum Manuskin Active , iar asta pentru ca ele au o eficienta care a fost dovedita in repetate randuri prin testele clinice realizate de catre institutiile specializate din Europa .
Sanatatea picioarelor tale
Picioarele noastre sunt predispuse la tot felul de afectiuni , unele foarte usoare , care pot fi trecute usor cu vederea , in timp ce altele pot fi destul de grave .
Daca ne uitam peste statisticile care spun ca o persoana normala merge pe jos in jur de 1000 de kilometri in fiecare nu este greu sa ne dam seama cat de mult depindem de ele si de ce pot fi afectate de fel si fel de probleme .
Care sunt aceste afectiuni / probleme neplacute ?
Lista poate fi una destul delunga , dar ne vom limita la doar cateva , pentru a - ti face o idee despre ce este vorba .
Vom oferi de asemenea si cateva recomandari de produse eficiente la care poti apela pentru a mai ameliora simptomele si chiar pentru a scapa complet de ele .
Crampele picioarelor ( cunoscute in special sub denumirea de „ carcei ” ) putem spune ca sunt printre cele mai comune probleme de care ne putem lovi , iar daca uneori le putem ignora , vor fi situatii in care senzatiile dureroase ne vor „ bloca ” pur si simplu , fiindu - ne imposibil sa mai facem o miscare corecta .
Motivele pentru care crampele apar pot fi numeroase ( un nivel scazut de minerale in corp – in special de magneziu si calciu - , efort fizic fara o incalzire prealabila , o circulatie periferica cu probleme , sarcina , obezitatea , deficitul de vitamine si asa mai departe ) .
Pentru tratare putem incepe sa consumam mai multe lichide in fiecare zi , fiind absolut necesara o hidratare facuta ca la carte .
O dieta bogata in fructe si legume este de asemenea de preferat , deoarece ea ne va asigura cantitatea necesara de vitamine si minerale , de care corpul nostru are atat de mare nevoie .
Monturile si bataturile – si acestea sunt printre acele probleme cu care se confrunta un numar mare de persoane , iar daca ultimele pot fi trecute , de cele mai multe ori , cu vederea deoarece trec de la sine , nu putem spune acelasi lucru si despre monturi .
Ce sunt monturile ?
Ele mai sunt cunoscute sub denumirea de Hallux Valgus , dupa cum am precizat si in articolele dedicate scrise in urma cu cateva luni .
Contrar opiniei multora , nu suntem in fata unui tesut osos care „ creste ” / se formeaza , ci pur si simplu vorbim de o deformare a degetului mare de la picior .
Devierea poate fi insesizabila la inceput , dar odata cu trecerea timpului ea se poate accentua si pot sa apara probleme in a merge corect si chiar dureri insuportabile .
Aspectul poate fi si el unul neplacut , mai ales in cazurile foarte grave , atunci cand singura solutie la care mai putem apela este calea chirurgicala .
Daca devierea este inca la inceput atunci sunt sanse foarte mari ca ortezele sa ne ajute foarte mult .
Desi sunt unele persoane care spun ca ele pot face mai mult rau decat bine , trebuie sa ii contrazicem , deoarece multe studii realizate de medici si specialisti in ultimii ani au demonstrat contrariul .
Ca exemple de produse care ne ajuta sa luptam impotriva monturilor putem da Valgus Pro , o solutie cat se poate de sigura , care ne ajuta sa avem picioare mai frumoase si sanatoase intr-un timp foarte scurt si cu un minim de efort .
Citeste in review - ul de la noi de pe site tot ce trebuie sa stii despre el .
Micoza piciorului – ea mai este cunoscuta si sub denumirea de „ picior de atlet ” ( motivul ?
– apare mai des la sportivi , deoarece ei poarta incaltaminte ocluziva care favorizeaza dezvoltarea ciupercii care este responsabila de afectiune ) , iar daca ne uitam peste statistici putem spune fara probleme ca si aceasta „ problema ” este una foarte frecventa in randul populatiei .
Afectiunea este una care de cele mai multe ori un subiect tabu , foarte putine fiind persoanele care recunosc ca o au sau ca au avut - o la un moment dat .
Micoza piciorului trece de la sine , in cele mai multe cazuri intr-un timp nu foarte indelungat , dar este de preferat sa aplicam un tratament in aceasta perioada , pentru a grabi putin procesul – in special datorita faptului ca este foarte contagioasa , un simplu contact cu pielea afectta fiind suficient pentru a te pricopsi si tu cu ciuperca piciorului .
Acest tratament poate fi reprezentat de diferite creme care pot face minuni datorita ingredientelor care stau la baza lor .
Marirea sanilor
Oare care femeie nu viseaza sa aiba o pereche de sani apetisanti , de dimensiuni generoase care sa fure privirile tuturor barbatilor care trec pe langa ea ?
Va spunem noi : niciuna !
Orice reprezentata a sexului frumos isi doreste sa arate perfect din toate punctele de vedere , iar sanii putem spune ca reprezinta o prioritate pentru femei .
Nici nu este de mirare ca in ultimii ani a crescut atat de mult cererea pentru operatiile estetice , implanturile mamare devenind „ la moda ” , ca sa spunem asa .
Cu toate acestea , nu sunt putine la numar femeile care nu agreaza foarte mult ideea de apela la bisturiu , unele de frica ( desi este o procedura destul de simpla , pot aparea complicatii ) , in timp ce altele datorita costurilor destul de ridicate ale acestor interventii .
Partea buna este ca daca se doreste doar o marire cu cateva numere ( sa zicem 2 , maxim 3 – foarte rar insa cel din urma caz ) atunci putem avea succes folosind cremele create special pentru asta ori prin schimbarea stilului de viata .
Printre aceste creme pe care noi le consideram eficiente se numara si Bust Size pentru marirea sanilor in mod natural , care a reusit sa isi dovedeasca eficienta de -a lungul timpului .
Nu trebuie sa uitam nici de alte solutii asemanatoare , despre care am vorbi mai multe pe site - ul nostru in articole dedicate ( vezi de exemplu cel despre BreastFast ) , articole pe care ti le recomandam si tie sa le citesti – cu siguranta o sa afli foarte multe lucruri interesante .
Nu trebuie sa uitam nici ca schimbarea stilului de viata isi poate puna amprenta destul de serios pe dimensiunile bustului .
De exemplu , un abonament la sala si alegerea unui antrenament specific , poate adauga cativa centimetri sanilor .
Cum este posibil acest lucru ?
La fel ca in cazul barbatilor , lucrarea pieptului va duce la dezvoltarea musculaturii in aceasta zona , iar in acest fel sanii vor iesi mai mult in fata si vor parea mai ridicati si fermi .
Introducerea in alimentatie a fructelor si legumelor , precum si a alimentelor care duc la cresterea nivelului de estrogen din organism poate reprezenta de asemenea o solutie excelenta , mai ales daca o combinam cu miscare si folosirea unei creme .
Dureri de spate si ale articulatiilor
Durerile de spate si cele ale articulatiilor pot reprezenta adevarate probleme cu care incepem sa ne confruntam din ce in ce mai des o data cu inaintarea in varsta .
Exista insa unele cazuri in care nu scapam de ele nici in tinerete , iar motive pot fi destule ( o accidentare , in cazul sportivilor , predispozitia genetica si asa mai departe ) .
Disconfortul produs poate fi unul destul de enervant , mai ales daca suntem genul de persoana destul de activa , care isi petrece o buna parte din timp pe drumuri sau stand in picioare .
Durerile de spate si cele ale articulatiilor pot sa apara si in cazul celor care lucreaza foarte mult la birou , motiv pentru care recomandam ca la fiecare 45 - 50 de minute de stat pe scaun sa ne ridicam si sa ne plimbam putin prin camera ori sa iesim afara pentru 5 – 10 minute .
Un alt motiv care poate duce la aparitia unor astfel de dureri poate fi reprezentat de lipsa de miscare si obezitatea ( persoanele supraponderale de obicei se confrunta cu dureri articulare , dar si cu cele de spate din cauza „ bagajului ” destul de insemnat pe care il care peste tot cu ei ) .
Pe lista putem adauga fara probleme si purtarea de catre femei a tocurilor foarte inalte ( sau prea joase – da , chiar si asta ) , hidratarea necorespunzatoare , o alimentatie care nu este capabila sa ne asigure necesarul de nutrienti zilnic , iar exemplele pot continua .
Cum putem trata durerile de spate si cele ale articulatiilor ?
Avem in primul rand o solutie care se numeste Hondrocream si care poate face adevarate minuni atunci cand vine vorba de ameliorarea simptomelor si tratarea problemelor actionand direct asupra sursei durerii .
De asemenea , nu trebuie sa uitam nici de faptul ca o schimbare a stilului de viata , care trebuie sa fie unul cat mai activ , este una mai mult decat binevenita .
Sedintele de fizioterapie , kinetoterapie si de masaj pot face si ele adevarate minuni , ducand de asemenea si la relaxare .
In cazul in care esti in cautarea unei alternative la produsul amintit anterior , atunci afla ca merita sa apelezi si la Flexa Plus , o solutie naturala care de asemenea este foarte apreciata de catre specialistii din intreaga lume .
Asta pentru ca este eficienta si are un pret bun , in timp ce ingredientele sale sunt unele naturale si 100 % sigure ( risc 0 de aparitie a reactiilor adverse ) .
Solutii care te ajuta sa lupti impotriva parazitilor
O alta categorie de produse care sunt destul de cautate este cea a celor care ne ajuta sa luptam impotriva parazitilor din organism , favorizand eliminarea acestora .
Cu totii stim cat de daunatori pot fi acestia , ducand la slabirea sistemului imunitar , asadar corpul nostru devine mult mai susceptibil de a contracta infectii , iar procesul de digestie este si el afectat in mod negativ .
De asemenea , pot sa apara semne accentuate ale oboselii , piederea in greutate ( nu , nu putem spune ca e de preferat sa slabim in acest fel ) sau chiar o respiratie urat mirositoare .
Cum putem scapa de parazitii din organism ?
In principal prin apelarea la produsele create special cu acest scop , dar si printr - o alimentatie mult mai diversificata , care sa includa anumite categorii de alimente .
Printre cele mai eficiente astfel de alimente se numara usturoiul ( pe langa favorizarea eliminarii parazitilor din corp ajuta si in intarirea sistemului imunitar ) , menta , chimionul dulce , cimbrul , germenii de grau , semintele de dovleac , ceaiul verde si multe altele .
In ceea ce priveste produsele recomandate , pe lista noastra putem adauga FitoBalt , un ceai care a reusit sa impresioneze foarte multa lume datorita eficientei sale ridicate , lucru dovedit de testele clinice realizate in ultimii ani , precum si de review - urile pozitive postate pe forum de catre cumparatori .
Mai putem recomanda si suplimentele care contin unul din ingredientele amintite mai sus ( cele cu extract de usturoi sunt printre cele mai bune , in opinia noastra , dar si a medicilor ) , indiferent daca vorbim de ceaiuri , pastile ori alte forme de administrare .
Perugia , Italy ( CNN ) --
An Italian jury has found American student Amanda Knox and her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito guilty in the stabbing death of British exchange student Meredith Kercher .
Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison and Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years .
Both were convicted on all charges except theft and together must pay 5 million euros ( $ 7.4 million ) to the victim 's family .
In addition , Knox must pay 40,000 euros ( $ 60,000 ) to a man whom she falsely accused of the killing .
Knox , wearing a lime jacket , her hair in a single braid , began to sob -- her sniffles and sobs punctuating the otherwise silent courtroom -- as the judge read the verdict quietly , without expression .
Few of the eight jurors looked at her .
Six of the jurors were wearing red , white and green sashes -- the colors of Italy 's flag .
Sollecito 's stepmother cried out her stepson 's name twice as he and Knox were led from the court .
Curt Knox , Amanda Knox 's father , walked the four blocks from the courtroom to his hotel staring stonily ahead , holding his two tearful daughters by the hand .
He said nothing as they strode through the streets of the medieval town except " Move , " when journalists got in his way .
" We are extremely disappointed in the verdict rendered today against our daughter , " Knox 's family said in a statement .
" While we always knew this was a possibility , we find it difficult to accept this verdict when we know that she is innocent , and that the prosecution has failed to explain why there is no evidence of Amanda in the room where Meredith was so horribly and tragically murdered .
" It appears clear to us that the attacks on Amanda 's character in much of the media and by the prosecution had a significant impact on the judges and jurors and apparently overshadowed the lack of evidence in the prosecution 's case against her . "
Knox and Sollecito will appeal the verdicts , attorneys said .
After the verdict , Knox 's lawyer , Carlo Della Vedova said his client was upset , but strong .
He would not speculate on the reason for the verdict .
" We have to see the motivation , " he said , referring to legal paperwork the judge must file within 90 days to explain the jury 's reasoning .
Her family was disappointed , but not surprised , by the verdict , Knox 's aunt Janet Huff told CNN.com
" It was terrible , it was gut - wrenching just to hear them say it , " said Huff , speaking from her Seattle , Washington , home .
" And to see the people outside the courtroom applauding -- that just made me sick that people can be that callous and cold . "
Knox and Sollecito were charged with murder and sexual violence in the November 2007 stabbing death of Meredith Kercher .
Knox and Kercher , both studying abroad , were roommates .
A third suspect was found guilty in a separate trial .
Prosecutors argued Seattle , Washington , native Amanda Knox was a resentful American so angry with her British roommate that she exacted revenge during a twisted sex misadventure at their home two years ago .
They said Knox directed Sollecito and another man infatuated with her , Rudy Guede , to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher 's throat .
Defense lawyers argued that Guede , who was convicted in a separate fast - track trial and is currently appealing his conviction , was the sole killer .
On Thursday , Knox took the stand for a third time in the Perugia courtroom , telling jurors that she is not a " killer " who stabbed her former roommate .
" They say that I am calm .
I am not calm , " Knox said in Italian .
" I fear to lose myself , to have the mask of the killer forced upon me .
I fear to be defined as someone I am not . "
Prosecutors touted an airtight case .

They argued DNA on Kercher 's bra clasp belonged to Sollecito .
And the alleged murder weapon , a 6 ½- inch kitchen knife taken from Sollecito 's home , had the DNA of Knox on the handle and Kercher on the blade , prosecutors said .
During the trial , the defense sought to cast doubt on the knife evidence , arguing it does n't match the wounds on Kercher 's body .
And they said the bra clasp with Sollecito 's DNA on it was left at the crime scene for weeks and is so contaminated that the evidence can't be considered credible .
Knox 's family has argued she has been the victim of character assassination .
Members of Kercher 's family have declined repeated CNN requests for comment .
Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini accused the defense of " lynching " the Italian police who worked on the case .
Knox and Sollecito have been jailed for more than two years .
The trial began in January in Perugia , a university town about 115 miles ( 185 kilometers ) north of Rome .

SANAA , Yemen —
A new white dress , chains of gold jewelry sparkling brightly and more attention than this 13 - year - old girl had ever received before :
It was like playing dress - up , but better , for Zainab Hussein .
“ I ’m a bride and I ’m getting married ! ” she bragged to her friend , showing off her new jewelry .
A few days later , Zainab , who ’d barely reached full growth , was married off to a 30 - year - old groom who also was her cousin .
He paid $ 5,000 to Zainab ’s father for his child bride .
Now 28 , she says of the experience : “ It was very difficult .
I still do n’t know who to blame .
Blame myself ?
Blame my father ?
Or my mother ?
I do n’t know .
I blamed my parents a lot . ”
There ’s much about her marriage that Zainab prefers not to recall .
She had dreamed of becoming a doctor , but talks about it as if it were someone else ’s dream .
She laughs occasionally and nervously , bitter and confused emotions about her early marriage bubbling toward the surface .
The ancient tradition of early marriage remains widely practiced in this country the United Nations qualifies as one of the poorest on the planet .
Three million to 5 million Yemeni girls who live mostly in rural areas are often married barely into their teens , and sometimes younger , according to an estimate by the Women 's National Committee .
Official figures for the average age of marriage do n’t exist .
A recent study sponsored by OXFAM estimates that over half of Yemeni girls are married before they ’re 18 , but the Women National Committee believes that in reality early marriage is much more widespread .
Yemen emerged from centuries of isolation following a revolution in 1962 , which established a modern republic .
Without the resources of its oil - rich neighbors in the Gulf , it continues to be one of the poorest and most under -educated of Arab countries .
Running water , electricity , education and other services are lacking in many rural areas .
Only 66 percent of the population had “ improved drinking water sources ” in 2006 , Unicef found .
Nearly half the population lives on less than $ 2 a day , according to the World Bank , and the country has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world .
There ’s no absence of protest against early marriage in Yemen .
Local development organizations , along with U.N. agencies and the many international NGOs here , have lobbied since 2000 for a law that criminalizes marriage for women younger than 18 .
Last year , a draft
law settled on 17 as a compromise , but it failed in parliament due to what activists describe as strong opposition from influential conservatives .
And this week , dozens of Yemenis demonstrated in front of parliament in a show of support for a proposed new draft law that specifies the minimum marriage age for women at 17 .
Yemeni rights organizations have been lobbying the government on the new draft law since last year , but it has yet to be ratified due to opposition from religious conservatives .
Changing values and deeply rooted traditions , particularly one such as early marriage , will be tough here .
Fathers believe they are protecting their daughters ’ chastity and purity from what are considered the dangers of adolescence when young men and women become sexually aware .
If a girl entered a romantic or sexual relationship before marriage , it would damage a family ’s honor .
Some say earlier marriages offer security to these brides .
Development agencies point to a prevalence of early marriage in struggling countries and highlight those that succeeded at development and growth only after abolishing the practice .
According to the U.N. Population Fund ( UNFPA ) : “ It is no coincidence that the same countries in Africa , Asia and the Middle East that have high rates of child marriage are those with high poverty rates , birth rates and death rates , greater incidence of conflict and civil strife , and lower levels of overall development , including schooling , employment and health care . ”
When Zainab moved to her husband ’s rural village , she entered a life of endless toil .
She shepherded the goats each day , gathered wood for the stove , and tilled the field as is typical of women ’s responsibilities in rural areas .
Early every morning she would fetch drinking water from a source hours away .
She carried water even while pregnant , suffering three miscarriages .
Girls between 10 and 14 years old are five times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than women in their early 20s , UNFPA figures show , because their bodies are not yet physically equipped for pregnancy and childbirth .
“ In rural areas , marriage is often viewed as bringing a helping hand to the house , to serve the family both inside the house and in the field , ” said Hooria Mashhour , deputy chairperson of the Women National Committee .
Zainab said she felt like a stranger among her husband ’s family .
He returned to his other life in Saudi Arabia two months after they married .
She was left alone to wait for his visits .
“ When a groom is an older man , ” said Fawzia Al - Muraissee , the Yemeni Women ’s Union head of family guidance and health , “ there ’s usually a financial aspect .
If the groom works abroad , the father thinks that he ’s probably doing well and that his daughter will have a better life . ”
The younger the bride , the greater the age difference in the couple , according to a study by Barbara Mensch , titled “ Trends in the timing of first marriage , ” cited by UNFPA .
Based on research in 16 sub -Saharan African countries , the study found that husbands were on average at least 10 years older than their 15 - to 19 - year - old brides .
“ Some believe that older men feel rejuvenated when they marry younger women , ” said Mashhour .
“ On the other hand , it could be a test that a man is still attractive to younger , beautiful women . …
From another perspective , a young girl is seen as better able to take care of an older man than an older wife . ”
When she bore her first child at 15 , Zainab was angry , so angry , she ’d strike her daughter in front of her husband ’s family to antagonize them .
“ I had no feelings for my daughter , even when she got sick , ” Zainab says , now ridden with guilt .
“ I did n’t have any maternal feelings .
Now , why would I hit my daughter ?
She did nothing to deserve punishment .
I just needed someone to take care of me and to love me , especially since my husband was away . ”
Yemen ’s civil society and government organizations , with the support of international development agencies , are working hard to combat early marriage .
The Yemeni Women ’s Union launched a project last year to raise awareness .
Villagers learned of the complications and psychological burden of early marriage and pregnancy .
The villagers said they were unaware of the psychological burden that child brides developed .
But their responses were emphatic .
Female villagers said they could not prevent their daughters from being married , Al - Muraissee explained .
For example , Zainab ’s mother was furious about her daughter being sold off so young , but was powerless to thwart it .
“ You have to educate our husbands , because they have the last word , ” the villagers told Al - Muraissee .
“ And we did , ” she said .
“ We sent men to raise awareness among the husbands . ”
Some of the men were deeply affected , and resolved not to marry their daughters at an early age , while others were skeptical and resistant , she said .
Education is squandered on women headed for a lifetime of physical labor , according to local sentiment .
It ’s a losing investment , and besides , it risks turning their daughters into unmanageable wives , so the perception goes .
The awareness project convinced villagers that an educated woman can contribute not only to her family — such as helping her children learn — but also to the village as a teacher , a midwife , or a healthcare worker for the women .
It demonstrated that early marriage continues the cycle of poverty .
Efforts are paying off , but slowly .
World Bank figures show that literacy among women age 15 and older improved from around 34 percent in 2005 to more than 40 percent in 2007 following programs such as the Union’s .
Yemeni men say they , too , are victimized by early marriage .
Sitting on a rocky ledge in the remote rural town of Al - Qobai , Mohammed Said , 27 , gazed deeply at a stretch of barren land , beautiful and haunting .
Shyly , he said he wanted to find a husband for his 8 - year - old daughter .
He spoke candidly , with no edge of cruelty .
His daughter ’s price , or " mahr , " which would be paid by her groom , seemed to be his only way out of his first and unhappy marriage .
He said he needed the mahr money to marry a second wife .
It ’s just the way things are in this country , he said .
Men who marry during their adolescence grow unhappy with young brides , said the Yemeni Women ’s Union .
With polygamy an option , 70 percent of men who married young said they later married a more like - minded second wife of their choosing , and reported being happier ,
Al - Muraissee says .
Teenage bride Zainab said she thinks Yemeni men prefer younger women to mold into what they would like them to be .
When her husband became ill and needed to be nursed , she stayed to help him , partly out of sympathy , partly out of fear that she would be unable to take her children with her .
“ I could n’t leave him alone while he was sick , ” she says .
“ That ’s not right . ”
She became the sole provider for the family , farming and giving birth to three more children .
Zainab forced her husband to move to the capital with her .
She continues to care for him , worried about losing her children if she divorces him .
“ I could n’t take it anymore .
I was in my 20 s but I had aged so much , and I had had enough of rural life .
I thought , ‘ My daughters will be 12 or 13 and I ’ll have to marry them off if I stay here . ’
So I moved my family to Sanaa , and decided to take a menial job .
I wanted my daughters to go to school and graduate , because I was deprived of an education … and of my childhood . ”
Beijing , China - China 's Xinhua News Agency is reporting that the government 's negotiations with Internet search giant Google broke down when the company ceased to exist .
Representatives from Google have denied the report .
The Xinhua story states , " Our brave negotiators worked tirelessly for the people to bring an Internet unfettered by the influence of a company whose stated motto was ' Be evil . '
However , that company ceased to exist midway through negotiations , and it appears they never actually did exist .
Our negotiators have since taken a long vacation from which they may not return as a reward for starting these phantom talks with the nonexistent company . "
The story did not offer any proof of its claim as it reported that it was " impossible to prove something did n't exist , so they would n't even try . "
However , the Department of Internet challenged any citizen of the country to find this company and offered a complimentary vacation to any Chinese citizen who could find it .
No one has taken them up on the offer yet .
Google offers a different view of events .
One member of the Google team who wished to remain anonymous said , " Negotiations were not going well at all , and then all of of sudden their negotiators started acting like we were n't there .
They walked out of the room , and no one would talk to us .
It was the strangest thing I 've seen . "
Google executives reassured investors by claiming the company did exist in a blog post about their efforts in China .
However , this claim was rejected by a Chinese official in a follow up story .
Yao Ming of the Department of Internet said , " Google 's attempt to prove they are real is laughable .
The blog post by the company proves nothing .
Oh crap , did I just say Google ? "
Yao has not been heard from since .
Xinhua reported that no company 's stock was changed on the news .

In the past decade the median bra size in America increased from 36C to 36DD .
And so manufacturers are designing attractive bras in bigger sizes — but how to label these big bras ?
Obviously , larger women can't be labeled " normal . "
Advertisement
WWD reports that between 2008 and 2009 the number of bras sold in sizes DD and up rose 7.4 percent to 158.8 million units , and dozens of bra manufactures are responding by cranking out lines of larger bras with better " fashion , color , innovation and styling " — i.e. , not those nasty grandma bras .
WWD attributes the jump to the obesity epidemic and Oprah Winfrey doing a " Bra Fit Interventions " show last year .
According to WWD , " Celebrities such as Mo'Nique , this year 's Oscar winner for best supporting actress , and her Precious co-star , Gabourey Sidibe , have raised the profile of full - figure women , " and the " combination of girth and glitz in the overall full - figure segment ... is adding a level of acceptance to what is considered attractive , fashionable and sexy . "

We know that the obesity epidemic has gradually worsened over the years , but that does n't explain the sudden 7.7 percent increase in sales last year .
Instead we 're supposed to believe that after numerous reports on finding the right bra size , Oprah mentioned it once and women bought new bras en masse .
Or maybe two " plus - size " actresses finally made it to the Oscars , so larger women are now allowed to buy attractive underwear , just like regular people .
Thanks Gabby and Mo'Nique !
There 's a lot of information in the WWD article on how to categorize these newfangled bras , and the women who wear them .
I thought that since I wear a 36DD ( the new median ) or 38 DD that I was finally wearing an " average - size " bra , but WWD set me straight :
Manufacturers and retailers are careful how they market and merchandise full - figure products because of the sensitive nature of how the message is perceived among large - size customers who want the same colors , embellishments and styles as average - size women .
As a result , the category in intimates is often a confusing mix of terms such as full - figure , full - busted , full - fitted , DD plus , or plus size .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Well , it 's nice to know manufacturers and retailers are being sensitive about how they inform me my median - size bra is a giant and freakish .
But there are even more measurements to categorize my abnormal figure :
Band size defines a clear distinction between a busty woman with an average figure who wears a 28 - to - 34 - inch band but is a G cup , and a plus - size woman who may not have large breasts , but whose band size ranges from 36 and larger and is a C or D cup .
Advertisement
Yes , it 's important that we separate the woman with a 28 - inch band and G cups from the woman who wears a 36C , because one may be a hot porn star with implants , while the other is just a fatty .
Whatever they wind up calling them , I 'm still excited about the prospect of less hideous bras in larger sizes .
Even as someone who is only on the cusp of being " full - busted , " finding a bra in the right size that does n't involve itchy fabric , ugly designs and five hooks has always been nearly impossible .
Advertisement
If I do find a DD at Victoria 's Secret it usually does n't fit , perhaps because bra sizes are being inflated and " DD is becoming the new C. "
My friends who — thanks to Victoria 's inflated - boob advertising — feel their B - cup is inadequate have no sympathy for my plight , despite my insistence that the company is surprisingly unkind to the big - breasted .
But it 's true ; the only decent bras I 've found in a true DD are at Lane Bryant — I got a tip from a " plus - size " friend , who wears a dress size 8 but a 36 DD bra .
Advertisement
If this shift among bra manufacturers really does allow me to give up my never - ending quest for semi-attractive 36DD bras , I 'll accept whatever ridiculous term they create for them .
It 's probably too much to ask that they just call them " bras , " since the clothing industry still insists on using the label " plus- size . "
At least now the president of Frederick's of Hollywood understands , " Women want to look sexy no matter what size they are . "
Maybe she can explain that to the rest of the clothing industry .

Peres is unpleased by the government 's decision to renovate a selected list of heritage sites – which includes the Cave of the Patriarchs and Rachel 's Tomb – and is concerned by the move 's possible implications , Ynet has learned .
" It was possible to decide to focus on 10 sites at this time , and take more decisions later , " Peres was quoted as saying .
Riots in Hebron .
Peres optimistic as well ( Photo : AFP )
Following several days of local riots , the president expressed his concern about the violence that may follow in Palestinian areas , while also referring to Israel 's responsibility on this front .
" It depends on us too , " he noted .
" We must conduct ourselves cautiously and with restraint . "
However , Peres expressed guarded optimism regarding the prospect of soon renewing official contacts with the Palestinians in the framework of diplomatic talks .
The president said that the Palestinian position on the matter has changed slightly as of late .
Peres added privately that he intends to continue his support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as long as the latter works to renew negotiations with the Palestinians .
Fayyad prays in Hebron : Non-violent protest
Last week , the cabinet approved a wide - scale plan to preserve and renovate " heritage sites " at a cost of NIS 400 million ( about $ 106 million ) .
At the last moment , after being pressured by right - wing elements and ministers , Netanyahu decided to add to the plan two sites located in the West Bank .
Burning flag in Jordan , Saturday ( Photo : AP )
The decision sparked riots in the territories , and particularly in Hebron .
Many young Palestinians , including children , have been clashing with the security forces in the past few days .
After Hamas called for a third intifada and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas warned of a " religious war " , Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad attended the Friday prayer in Hebron , called on his people to continue their struggle , but stressed that the Palestinians would not let the Israeli decision drag them to a state of violence .
Netanyahu himself has tried to ease the tensions with the Palestinians several times , saying it was all a misunderstanding .
" We have no intention of changing the status quo regarding Jewish or Muslim praying .
We want to maintain the current prayer arrangements .
The renovations were carried out in coordination with the Waqf .
These are necessary repairs , " the prime minister said .
Meanwhile , dozens of members of professional associations in Jordan demonstrated Saturday in Amman against Israel 's decision to add the Cave of the Patriarchs and Rachel 's Tombs to the list of national heritage sites .
According to Jordanian media reports , the protestors burned Israeli flags and carried signs urging the government to annul the peace treaty with Israel " as a first move in defending the holy sites . "
Dr Ahmed al - Armouti , secretary of the Jordan Medical Association , said that " the response to this crime must not be summed up with a statement and condemnations , but should be translated into support for the armed resistance option , the ' mujahideen ' ( freedom fighters ) , lifting the siege imposed on the people of Gaza and cancelling all forms of normalization and agreements with Israel .

Andrew Comiskey , of the ex-gay group Desert Stream Ministries , posted an admission on his blog that a staffer at DSM was found to have sexually abused at least one teenager under their “ care . ”
But instead of an apology to either the teenager , his family , Comiskey ’s church or the ex-gay movement , Comiskey pens a strange , rambling post in which he portrays himself as a victim of a blackmail attempt and expresses gratitude that the entire episode escape public scrutiny in the press :
Before we as a ministry even knew what had actually happened , one relative of the boy , savvy in the ways of insurance , insisted on a face - to - face meeting with Jonathan Hunter and I .
He wrote down an astronomical figure that he insisted we pay out to him , or else .
He threatened to take the case to the press and a flamboyant celebrity lawyer in LA .
( He assumed that our large and prominent new home – Vineyard Anaheim — had millions for such settlements ) .
The post goes on to express Comiskey ’s anguish over the sad affair .
Not the anguish for the molestation that the teens experienced , mind you , but the anguish of the humiliating police interrogations , anguish at being interrogated by their liability insurers and their lawyers . , the anguish of facing church elders at Vinyard Anaheim ( with which the ministry was affiliated at the time ) , and the anguish of losing a valued staffer who abused the teens .
Apparently , the unnamed staffer was a key player in the ministry , as well as a close personal friend to Comiskey and his wife .
But what about the anguish the teens faced ?
And what about the anguish they must assuredly feel again should they come across this post ?
If Comiskey had an ounce of compassion for what those teens experienced , it ’s hard to see it here .
What possible good could a post like this serve anyone , except to aggrandize Comiskey ’s own standing before a god who , according to Comiskey , saved his ministry from his enemies :
At the end of 3 years , the case was settled .
Our insurance covered most of the costs .
Our groups were reinstated at the Vineyard , with new boundaries and requirements intact .
Not one story was printed about the tragedy .
God spared us .
His mercy leveled and sustained DSM .
Good for you , Andy .
Your god smiled upon you .
But God bless the teens who were left to pick up the pieces afterward .
According to a comment by Ex - Gay Watch ‘s David Roberts left at Love Is An Orientation , the incident described in the post occurred in 1997 .
Another allegation of sexual abuse was lodged five years later .
In 2005 , Comiskey moved his ministry to Kansas City , where he became associated with the extremist charismatic group known as the International House of Prayer .
According to ex-gay Survivor Peterson Toscano , Desert Stream ’s Living Waters program “ uses extreme methods that involve forms of exorcism ( deliverance / healing prayer ) and rely on teachings that believe that people become gay through demonic influences and the sins of ancestors . ”
Desert Stream is an affiliated ministry of Exodus International .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
Adjoining Galway Bay to the north , the Burren Plateau ( Burren is Gaelic for “ stony place ” ) is an example of karst terrain .
Karst terrain is generally formed when sedimentary rocks are dissolved by groundwater .
This astronaut photograph illustrates the northwestern - most portion of the Burren Plateau , which is characterized by the distinctive bare exposures of almost horizontal , layered Paleozoic - age limestone rocks that form Gleninagh Mountain .
The mountain ( image center ) appears light gray , with brown concentric banding .
Slieve Elva ( lower left ) is capped with younger dark brown shale , and it has a border of dark green vegetation ; at 345 meters above sea level ( 1,132 feet ) , it is the highest point on the plateau .
The rounded character of limestone hills and intervening valleys of Gleninagh Mountain comes not only from the erosion of the limestone by water , but also from the scouring of loose material by past glaciers .
Most karst occurs in limestones or dolostones , rocks made primarily from the minerals calcite or dolomite .
Groundwater and surface water moves through fractures in the rock , dissolving it over time , forming voids and channels .
As the voids grow and connect , the rock dissolves even more ; when the rock below can no longer support the overlying rock and soil , collapse features like sinkholes form .
Over time , the collapses can turn an originally flat landscape into one with significant topography .
A very thin cloud cover is visible over Gleninagh Mountain .
Despite the barren appearance of this portion of the Burren Plateau , thin soils are present and the area is used for grazing cattle during the winter .
Numerous small springs — another hallmark of karst terrain : surface streams tend to disappear underground via fractures — provide water for both cattle and human use in this otherwise dry landscape .

I am proud to announce release 0.2.0 of ccc - gistemp .
This is an all - Python reimplementation of GISTEMP , the NASA GISS surface temperature analysis .
Please feel free to download and play with it .
It will automatically fetch input data across the internet , and produce textual and graphical result files .
This release works on Windows , Linux , Mac OS X , FreeBSD , and probably anywhere else you can get Python to work .
The only dependency is on Python ( 2.5.2 or later , as we discovered today that the code to fetch input data trips over a bug in earlier Python libraries ) .
The results of running this release match GISTEMP results very closely indeed :
In fact , the annual global , northern hemisphere , and southern hemisphere anomaly results are identical , as are the southern hemisphere monthly anomalies .
The global monthly anomalies differ 7 times , out of more than 1000 , each time by one digit in the least - significant place .
This ends phase 1 of the CCC - GISTEMP project .
However , although there is no remaining Fortran , ksh , or C source code , much of step1.py is still GISS code , and a lot of the large - scale structure of the code is still dictated by its 1980s Fortran heritage .
For instance , the data is broken up into pieces because it could n’t all fit into memory at once [ ed : 2010 - 01 - 19 : this particular instance is Issue 25 and it ’s now fixed ] .
This obscures the underlying algorithms being applied .
Phase 2 of CCC - GISTEMP will refactor the code to eliminate this obscurity .
We expect one side - effect to be an increase in speed .
Thanks to all who have contributed , including David Jones , Paul Ollis , Gareth Rees , John Keyes , and Richard Hendricks .
Thanks also to Reto Ruedy at GISS , who has been helpful and responsive .

This paper is an introduction to Abstract Stone Duality and its in particular its application to real analysis that is indended for the general mathematician .
It was published in the Journal of Logic and Analysis 2( 5 ) 1 –115 on 18 August 2010 ( BibTeX ) .
Abstract
Abstract Stone Duality is a revolutionary paradigm for general topology that describes computable continuous functions directly , without using set theory , infinitary lattice theory or a prior theory of discrete computation .
Every expression in the calculus denotes both a continuous function and a program , and the reasoning looks remarkably like a sanitised form of that in classical topology .
This is an introduction to ASD for the general mathematician , with application to elementary real analysis .
This language is applied to the Intermediate Value Theorem : the solution of equations for continuous functions on the real line .
As is well known from both numerical and constructive considerations , the equation cannot be solved if the function “ hovers ” near 0 , whilst tangential solutions will never be found .
In ASD , both of these failures and the general method of finding solutions of the equation when they exist are explained by the new concept of overtness .
The zeroes are captured , not as a set , but by higher - type modal operators .
Unlike the Brouwer degree , these are defined and ( Scott ) continuous across singularities of a parametric equation .
Expressing topology in terms of continuous functions rather than sets of points leads to treatments of open and closed concepts that are very closely lattice - ( or de Morgan - ) dual , without the double negations that are found in intuitionistic approaches .
In this , the dual of compactness is overtness .
Whereas meets and joins in locale theory are asymmetrically finite and infinite , they have overt and compact indices in ASD .
Overtness replaces metrical properties such as total boundedness , and cardinality conditions such as having a countable dense subset .
It is also related to locatedness in constructive analysis and recursive enumerability in recursion theory .

Acknowledgements
As I was a reluctant analyst , this work would never have been done without the persistent ( but friendly ) cajoling of Graham White and Andrej Bauer .
I would like to express my warmest appreciation for the ongoing encouragement that they have both given me .
In particular , during my visit to Ljubljana in November 2004 , Andrej provided the construction of the supremum of a compact overt subspace in Section 12 using Dedekind cuts that is the keystone of this paper .
This work was presented at Computability and Complexity in Analysis in Kyoto in August 2005 , and I am grateful to Peter Hertling and the CCA programme committee for the indulgence of allowing me to occupy altogether 80 pages of their ( pre-conference ) proceedings .
The paper that you see here is the fruit of illuminating discussions with numerous people since the conference .
I would particularly also like to thank Jeremy Avigad , Vasco Brattka , Douglas Bridges , Robin Cockett , Thierry Coquand , Martín Escardó , Nicola Gambino , André Joyal , Achim Jung , Norbert Müller , Erik Palmgren , Petrus Potgieter , Pino Rosolini , Giovanni Sambin , Peter Schuster , Anton Setzer , Bas Spitters and Steve Vickers for their interest and encouragement in this project .
Finally , I would like to thank the anonymous referees for their care .
Lengthy technical papers are not so uncommon , but in this case someone from well outside my usual circle was obliged to make a seismic shift in his entire understanding of the way in which mathematics is done .
I deeply appreciate the grace with which he was willing and able to do this .

Have you ever noticed that when you eat at a Chinese restaurant , the meat is always so soft and tender ?
It seems like your knife just slides through it without any effort at all .
A lot of Chinese recipes recommend tenderizing beef and other meat with Baking Soda .
Salt can help tenderize meat , and since baking soda is made mostly from sodium , it makes sense that it can be used as a meat tenderizer .
If you ’ve got a particularly tough cut of meat or beef , and you ’re looking to make it more tender , but do n’t want it to turn out as dry as a bone , try baking soda .
Here ’s how to tenderize beef with baking soda .
This method is for raw beef .
If you use this method on precooked beef , it will leave the meat with a baking soda taste .
It ’s most effective on small cuts of beef that you use in stir - fry dishes or stews .
You may want to slice the beef into the desired size before tenderizing .
After the meat has been tenderized , it may just fall apart as you ’re cutting it later .
First , take your beef and determine how much you have .
You want to use one teaspoon of baking soda per pound .
It does n’t matter if it ’s an exact teaspoon , just make a rough estimate .
It will all be washed off in the end .
Once you determine how much beef you have , use the correct amount of baking soda to sprinkle over the meat .
Use your fingers to work it into the beef , making sure you cover the entire piece .
Next , you ’ll want to let the beef sit for a while .
You want to let it marinate in the baking soda for 15 to 20 minutes .
You can put the tenderized beef in a bowl , cover it with plastic wrap , and either put it in the refrigerator , or leave it sitting on the counter for the set amount of time .
Some people say you should marinate it over night .
Be warned , however , if you leave it marinating that long , the meat might end up with a distinct baking soda flavor .
Once you ’ve let it marinate for about 20 minutes , rinse the beef thoroughly .
The baking soda is used as a tenderizer , not to add any flavor .
Rinse it off in the sink , then shake or wipe off any excess water .
Pat the meat with paper towels to get it dry .
You can also pat it dry with a cloth , but make sure that it ’s been properly washed and has n’t been sitting where it could have gotten dirty .
Paper towels are preferable , because cloth tends to get dirty quicker , even if it has n’t been used .
All that ’s left for you to do , is to cook the beef according to whatever recipe you ’re using .
You can marinate it in something else without a problem if the recipe calls for it .
The baking soda was used only to tenderize the meat , not as a normal marinade .
The next time you ’re looking for a way to tenderize beef or other meat , try the baking soda method .
Using this method of tenderizing beef will ensure you get meat so soft , you ’ll be able to slide your knife through it with no problem at all .
Your dinner guests will be curious to know how you got it to turn out so tender .
You ’ll be the one to know the secret on how to tenderize beef with Baking Soda .
You now know the secret as to how so many Chinese restaurants get their beef so tender .
This tenderizer works well with other meats , including pork and chicken .

It was in 1983 that President Ronald Reagan privately screened the anti-nuclear movie " The Day After " in Camp David and wrote in his diary of his resolve " to see there is never a nuclear war " – the ambition that fueled his remarkable series of summits with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
That very same year Barack Obama was just an undergraduate in his senior year at New York 's Columbia University , still very uncertain of his place in the world , when he publicly voiced the idea that Reagan shared but kept secret , an ambition of eliminating all nuclear warheads .
As reported by the New York Times , the young Obama wrote an article for a campus magazine that was entitled " Breaking the War Mentality . "
In it , he railed against " billion - dollar erector sets " and what he called " the twisted logic " of a winnable nuclear war .
Little did the then - 22 - year - old Obama imagine that it would be Reagan who would start the job of reducing the world 's nuclear stockpiles or that he himself would be the president in a position to carry that mission forward in the 21st Century .
The officer said of another raid : '' We found a series of flash cards and documents on how to raise Mujahid children .
The cards were written in English – and instead of having M for Muhammad they had M for Mujahideen .
They have the potential to indoctrinate .
It just shows the mindset of some people and what we are up against . ''
150 years ago a great man was born .
His name was Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof and he was born to a world divided by language , a world of constant violence between polish , jews , russians , etc .
All speaking different languages .
He thought the problem of the world was that people could not understand each other and set himself the task of fixing it .
He invented what latter on became know as Esperanto .
You can go to the Wikipedia and check the article on Esperanto and on Zamenhof to get a lot of encyclopedic information .
If you want to actually taste or learn the language , my recommendation is to go to Lernu .
And with that you can learn your first Esperanto word ( if you do n’t know any yet ) : lernu means learn , as in “ you learn ” .
Lerni means to learn .
In this post I will tell you some things I find interesting about Esperanto .
Let ’s go on with lerni .
School is lernejo .
See the relationship ?
lern – ej – o is school .
Ej means a “ a place for ” , so lernejo is literarily a place to learn .
There are other places like laborejo , which is the place to work .
Laboro means work ( think of ‘ labor unions ’ ) .
Zamenhof thought about the task of creating the Esperanto dictionary and the task was so big he thought it was the end .
Until he came up with the idea of allowing people to build words .
My English - Esperanto , Esperanto - English dictionary is 75 % for English , 25 % for Esperanto .
There are less words to learn in Esperanto .
Did you know the Wikipedia is available in Esperanto ?
If you go to wikipedia.org , you ’ll see it among the languages with more than 100000 articles .
And if you go to the English wikipedia homepage , Esperanto is the only constructed language listed on the left column .
Do you want to know something amazing ?
Vikipedio , the Esperanto Wikipedia is actually bigger than the Encyclopedia Britannica .
The legend goes that Zamenhof released his book about Esperanto , called La Unua Libro ( the first book ) and six months latter someone nocked at his door speaking Esperanto and asking to practice the language .
Esperanto spread like wildfire , unlike any other constructed language .
Today it is estimated that there are 2 million Esperantists in the world .
If you consider that 122 years ago there was only one Esperanto speaker , it ’s growing quite fast .
I would expect its growth is accelerating but it ’s very hard to know .
No census asks about Esperanto .
I know someone that made a informal survey asking for people that spoke Esperanto on the streets of Zürich and then actually asking questions in Esperanto and he got 3 % positive response .
Those 2 million speakers are not concentrated in one location , they are spread through the world so you are very likely to find Esperanto - speakers everywhere if you know where to look .
There are even an estimate of 1000 native Esperanto speakers .
Basically that happens when a family is formed by a man and a woman who only share Esperanto as a common language .
Even if they do n’t actively teach their children Esperanto , they learn to be able to understand their parents .
I know a couple of people that speak it natively .
When talking about how many people speaks the language , it ’s important to mention that Esperanto speakers were hunted by many totalitarian goverments .
The Nazi government specially targeted them because Zamenhof was jewish and according to Hitler as expressed in his My Fight , Esperanto was the language to be used by the International Jewish Conspiracy to set a new world order .
In the Soviet Union Esperanto was embraced at first .
Most socialists parties saw the potential for international communication and understanding .
Joseph Stalin saw it as a way to spread the ideals of communism until they realized that it was a two way street , new ideas would come from outside , including capitalism , and denounced Esperanto as the language of spies .
Imperial Japan did n’t like the language either .
In all those cases of totalitarism , Esperanto was forbidden and Esperantists hunted , exiled or even executed .
The first Esperanto congress was held in 1905 , bringing 600 people together from across the world .
since then it was held every year except during the world wars with an average of 2000 participants .
When it was done in China it was the biggest gathering of foreign people ever to happen in China .
There ’s a very practical reason to adopt Esperanto .
Currently we waste a lot of resources pretending English is an adequate medium of international communication and in translation .
Let me give you one example .
In 1975 the World Health Organization denied the following requests :
$ 148,200 to improve the health service in Bangladesh
$ 83,000 to fight leprosy in Burma
50 cents per patient to cure trachoma , which causes blindness .
$ 26,000 to improve hygiene in the Dominican Republic
All those requests denied .
It seems the World Health Organization did n’t have much money .
But that same year they approved Arabic and Chinese as working languages requiring lots of translations and increasing the expenses of the WHO by $ 5,000,000 per year .
That ’s right , 5 million dollars per year spent on translation when they could n’t give 50 cents to cure trachoma .
Esperanto is probably the easiest to learn usable language out there .
The Institute of Cybernetic Pedagogy at Paderborn compared how long it would take French speaking people to learn different languages to reach the same level :
2000 hours studying German
1500 hours studying English
1000 hours studying Italian
150 hours studying Esperanto
Yes , a tenth of the time it takes to learn English and less than that when compared to German .
And something very interesting happens here .
The third language you learn takes less effort than the second one .
If you want to learn another language , let ’s say , German , it ’ll take you less time to learn Esperanto and then learn German than to just learn German .
Yes , you ’ve read right .
Less time to learn two languages than one .
That experiment was done by teaching one year of Esperanto and four of French to some students while five of French to others .
The amount of time studying was the same but those that spoke Esperanto first reached a better French level .
So even if you never utter a single Esperanto word out there , it makes economical sense to learn it first , before you learn another language .
Many said that Esperanto will never take off and they proceed to never learn it and accept a divided broken world .
If you are among those , I ’m sorry about your defeat .
I ’d rather hope and do my part and learn Esperanto .
It ’s not that hard .
Associated Press issued a story yesterday ( Monday ) entitled “ Iran moves closer to nuke warhead capacity . ”
It was full of inaccurate and misleading information implying that Iran had admitted trying to enrich weapons - grade nuclear material .
The story appeared on a wide variety of media .
Last night , Antiwar.com news editor Jason Ditz issued a story refuting the AP story .
This morning , Associated Press recalled the story without explanation and replaced it with another , much less inflamatory story written by a different author .
It is important to question the mainstream media and not let them get away with helping the warmongers with their agenda .
Injuries are a consistent problem for Aramis Ramirez , having played in 150 games or more just three times since 2001 .
Last season it was a dislocated shoulder limiting him to just 82 games , but his performance was enough to continue to make him an appealing option for fantasy owners , especially at a shallow position :
306 At Bats
. 317 Batting Average ( 97 Hits )
15 Home Runs
65 RBI
46 Runs
2 Stolen Bases
.389 On Base Percentage
. 516 Slugging Percentage
. 331 Batting Average on Balls in Play
Concerns about the injury having long lasting affects on his performance should have been eliminated from his performance in ’09 after returning :
July – .333 , 5 HR , 14 RBI in 75 AB
August – .278 , 2 HR , 16 RBI in 79 AB
September – .300 , 4 HR , 18 RBI in 80 AB
That certainly is more than enough for me , especially when we are talking about a position that is as barren of talent as any .
He ’s currently the eighth third baseman off the board ( ADP about 64 ) and once he ’s gone it is pretty slim pickings .
Just look at the next group of names :
Chone Figgins ( ADP about 83 )
Gordon Beckham ( ADP about 91 )
Michael Young ( ADP about 94 )
Ian Stewart ( ADP about 129 )
As much as you might like Chipper Jones , Adrian Beltre or Jhonny Peralta , are you really looking to depend on them ?
Do any of these types of players offer the guarantee of production of Ramirez ?
The injury last season hides the ability he has .
Let ’s look at the power , where he had been between 26 and 38 home runs every season from 2003 to 2008 .
He ’s a flyball machine ( from 2002 - 2009 his flyball rate is 44.5 % ) , something that certainly helps when you ’re playing in Wrigley Field in the summer with the wind blowing out .
Whatever you want to say about the Cubs lineup , he also has always found a way to drive in runs .
He has six career seasons of over 100 RBI , including reaching 119 in 2006 .
No matter who is hitting atop the order , Ramirez should once again get enough opportunities to reach 100 RBI once again .
Runs scored could be a different story , having never reached the century mark , but a resurgent Alfonso Soriano could change that .
However , I would n’t hold my breath for that to happen .
His worst average , since 2004 , was .289 in 2008 .
Is anyone really concerned about him there ?
He does a great job putting the ball in play ( career strikeout rate of 15.2 % , which he has been better than every year since 2004 except for 2008 ) .
Add him up and here ’s the projection you get for 2010 :
.295 ( 162-550 ) , 28 HR , 90 RBI , 85 R , 2 SB , .298 BABIP , .357 OBP , .529 SLG
Injuries are really the only concern when it comes to Ramirez , but at a position as shallow as this you almost have to take the gamble if you miss out on the top names .
I have him slotted as the eighth best 3B ( click here to view my most recent rankings ) , and after him there is a pretty sizable drop - off .
I would n’t let the fear overcome you and shy away from him , not with this type of production ( and the potential to better it ) .
What about you ?
Is Ramirez someone you ’d be willing to draft in 2010 ?
What are you expecting from him in 2010 ?

Visionary who designed world 's biggest radio telescope , dies aged 92
An engineer who designed the telescope that discovered the first planets beyond our solar system has died aged 92 .
William Gordon was a visionary whose atmospheric work laid the foundation for current studies of satellite communication , space weather , and GPS .
He is probably best known for his role in getting the Arecibo Observatory up and running in the late 1950s .
Dr Gordon 's 1,000 ft radio telescope has been the forefront of scientific discovery
Dr Gordon designed the massive radio telescope , arranged funding , shepherded it through construction and was its first director in 1963 .
Arecibo is known to millions of James Bond fans as the backdrop to the daring base jump at the start of Golden Eye .
The 1,000ft telescope is the largest curved focusing dish on Earth and is sunk in a limestone basin surrounded by forested hills in Puerto Rico .
The telescope discovered the first three planets beyond our solar system and provided the first solid evidence that neutron stars exist in the Universe .
It was also used to measure how long it took Mercury to orbit the Sun and found lakes of hydrocarbons on Saturn 's moon Titan .
The Arecibo Observatory featured in the 1997 film ' Contact ' starring Jodie Foster
In 1974 , scientists sent out the Arecibo message toward the star cluster M13 in an attempt to communicate with aliens .
It inspired and played a prominent role in the 1997 Jodie Foster film ' Contact . '
Dr Gordon originally designed the telescope with the goal of probing Earth 's atmosphere to see how weather conditions might affects the flight of missiles and satellites .
He realised he would need a dish 1,000 ft across , which would need to be sunk in the ground to prevent it collapsing .
It was an engineering leap into the unknown as the largest radio telescope at the time was only 150 feet across .
He chose Puerto Rico near the equator to give the clearest views of other planets .

The telescope was designed to last ten years , but after two upgrades it is still providing useful data today .
The Arecibo message was aimed at the star cluster M13 25,000 light years away .
It includes information about humans and our solar system
At the telescope 's 40th anniversary celebration in 2003 , Dr Gordon said : ' When we were talking about building ( the telescope ) back in the late ' 50s , we were told by eminent authorities it could n't be done .
' We were in the position of trying to do something that was impossible , and it took a lot of guts .
' We were young enough that we did n't know we could n't do it .
It took five years from idea to dedication , and that is short .
But we were in the right place at the right time and had the right idea and the right preparation .
We had no rules or precedents . '
Richard Behnke , head of upper atmospheric research at the National Science Foundation said : ' He was probably the greatest man I ever knew .
You do n't see people like him very often .
Perhaps once in a lifetime .'
Dr Gordon was born in Paterson , New Jersey , and earned a bachelor 's degree from Montclair State Teacher 's College , a master 's degree from New York University and his doctorate at Cornell .
He worked at Cornell University from 1953 - 1966 .
He then moved to Rice University where he retired as vice president in 1985 .
Dr Gordon died on Tuesday of natural causes according to officials at Cornell University .
He is survived by his second wife and two children .
Att minnas saker är människan väldigt dålig på .
Vi kan ha gjort saker , sagt saker eller hört saker vi sedan glömmer alldeles för fort , och oftast det man egentligen vill eller behöver komma ihåg .
Dåliga saker eller hemska minnen däremot , dem har en tendens att stanna kvar betydligt mycket lättare .
Däremot kan vi människor påminnas lätt .
Det krävs bara små saker som en speciell doft , låt , bild etc .
så minns vi exakt vad som hände under denna period eller stund som om vi aldrig glömt det .
En bild säger mer än tusen ord som man brukar uttrycka det .
Bilder är det vi människor kan relatera till mest när det kommer till minnen .
Vi kan med hjälp av bilder också visa andra mer exakt hur just det minnet utspelade sig än om vi bara berättar om det .
Man förevigar helt enkelt ett minne , exempelvis första kärleken eller första resan , som man sedan kan bevara livet ut , om man så vill .
Är man riktigt duktig på att fotografera kan det kanske vara aktuellt att starta en egen firma där man kan ta betalt för att göra fotouppdrag åt andra .
Man kan då ställa upp som fotograf vid bröllop , fester eller liknande och på så sätt föreviga ett speciellt minne för någon annan .
För att komma igång kan det dock krävas en del kapital och för detta kan det vara aktuellt med att ta ett lån för att finansiera lokal , utrustning och liknande innan man har fått sina första uppdrag .
Man kan då försöka hitta billiga företagslån som är en bra lösning för nya företagare .
Man kan även göra väldigt mycket själv med bilder , bland annat kan man göra fina fotoalbum eller souvenirer som muggar , kuddar , kalendrar m.m. till antingen sig själv eller som present till en bekant .
Man kan även göra tavlor till hemmet av det , kanske en gruppbild på familjen eller varför inte en fin bild på ett par blommor som du tog häromdagen ?
Det finns dessutom mängder av tidningar och hemsidor där man kan skicka in sina bilder och få dem att synas lite mer .
Alla bilder kan användas till någonting .
12 - year - old bullfighter Michelito Lagravere is out of danger after being gored twice by a bull during a match at the Plaza de Toros in Cali on Sunday .
Michelito was carried sobbing from the bullring in Cali on Sunday after being tossed in the air by a bull nearly 10 times his weight .
His father brushed him off and encouraged back into the ring to finish the fight but within minutes the boy , who stands just 4ft 9in tall , was again knocked to the ground by the bull ’s horns .
He was treated for cuts and bruises at a local hospital , where doctors said his injuries were “ superficial ” , and discharged hours later .
“ He suffered a beating but it was nothing serious , ” said his Mexican mother , Diana Peniche Marenco .
“ It was a bad afternoon for him but he is eager to continue . ”
The precocious toreador , whose full name is Michel Lagravere Peniche , is already a veteran of the bullring having started his chosen profession at the age of five , under the tutelage of his father , Michel Lagravere , a retired French matador .
Since that time Michelito has participated in more than 150 corridas across Latin America .
He has become a symbol of a child welfare debate in a region where promoters see baby - faced bullfighters as a way to draw in the crowds .
The local human rights commission tried to ban the event citing child protection laws but the petition was kicked out by the courts .
With so many young professionals at the club , it takes something special to impose yourself and stand out from the rest .
Jay Emmanuel - Thomas , last season ’s FA Youth Cup and Premier Academy League - winning captain , certainly has an edge about him and , in recent weeks , has been growing in stature in terms of his status at the club .
Emmanuel - Thomas has always stood out from his team - mates because of his immense stature , but his footballing ability is now seeing him become increasingly involved with the first - team squad .
Following last season ’s success , during which he was also named on the bench for the first - team in the Premier League and the Carling Cup , the tall , versatile lynchpin was sent on loan to Championship side Blackpool in order to gain extra experience and game time .
He featured regularly for the Tangerines and , although his performances could n’t be defined as consistent , his talent was evident as well as his desire , perseverance and the ability to lead by example .
Now back at Arsenal , he is taking prominent steps to fulfilling his life - long dream of becoming a first - team player at the club .
Arsene Wenger is certainly keen on the youngster .
Having watched him make an impression in the Reserves whilst still a schoolboy , the Frenchman was always aware of his ability and future potential .
However , he has now been nurtured into a player who is more tactically aware and has learned how to tone down his temperament when required .
With injury problems to key players mounting , Wenger named Emmanuel - Thomas amongst the substitutes for the 1 - 1 Premier League draw with Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday and followed that up by rewarding the hard - working youngster with a contract extension .
He may not have found his definite position yet and he can still endure lapses in concentration at times , but Jay Emmanuel - Thomas is a big talent and one who , it appears , has a long future ahead of him in North London .
When a group of religious - right poobahs unveiled their effort in Virginia last week to attack Planned Parenthood and its funding , one of them -- a Republican legislator named Bob Marshal , as Josh at RightWingWatch reported -- declared that God punished women who 've had abortions by giving them disabled children later :
“ The number of children who are born subsequent to a first abortion with handicaps has increased dramatically .
Why ?
Because when you abort the first born of any , nature takes its vengeance on the subsequent children , ” said Marshall , a Republican .
“ In the Old Testament , the first born of every being , animal and man , was dedicated to the Lord .
There ’s a special punishment Christians would suggest . ”
Marshall later tried to claim he had n't said what he said :
A story by Capital News Service regarding my remarks at a recent press conference opposing taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood conveyed the impression that I believe disabled children are a punishment for prior abortions .
No one who knows me or my record would imagine that I believe or intended to communicate such an offensive notion [ . ]
I regret any misimpression my poorly chosen words may have created [ . ]
But yesterday , Josh got ahold of video of Marshall talking at the kickoff .
Watch it for yourself .
Yeah , that 's some misimpression .
Not only was the original quote perfectly accurate , but Marshall goes on , discussing those Christians and their scriptural support for these beliefs :
Marshall :
And with the knowledge they have from faith has been verified by a study by Virginia Commonwealth University .
First abortions of the first pregnancy is much more damaging to a woman than latter abortions .
Bad enough that he would say it .
Then to claim he did n't say what he clearly said is just cowardly and mendacious .
That 's some " Christian " character there , Bob .
And what will Sarah say ?
A lost , broken - down solar / nuclear robot rover left on the Moon by the Soviet space programme - and nowadays owned by a wealthy computer game developer and space tourist - has been precisely located by NASA 's new moon - mapping satellite .
NASA : Lunar lost property office
The Lunokhod - 2 rover was despatched to the Moon in 1973 , during the era of competition in space between the USA and the Soviets .
It used a hinged solar panel to charge its batteries for moving about during the lunar day , but such a vehicle could never survive the chilly , two - week - long lunar nights unaided .
A Polonium - 210 radioisotope heater was provided to keep Lunokhod alive once the sun had set .
The rover spent five Earth months successfully driving across the surface of the Mare Serenitatis , rolling along with stops to recharge batteries in the daytime and hibernating in the warmth of its internal nuclear fires at night .
Its 37 km track is the longest ever left by the machines of humanity on an extraterrestrial body , comfortably eclipsing even the Lazarus - like latter day NASA rovers of Mars .
There are now 38 sex clubs and brothel in the Lugano area .
And more are planned , according to Italian daily , Corriere della Sera , in order to accommodate the thousands of customers who pour over the border from Italy , where brothels are illegal .
Around 80 per cent of the men who pay for sex in the area are thought to be Italian .

I 'm not a teacher , but as a parent I can appreciate Mr. Nicely 's wisdom .
I think the true value of different teaching methods is determined by the results .
I had 4 children go through the school system .
When they had teachers they admired , learning was fun for them .
When they had teachers they feared , learning lost its joy .
Thank goodness , the sour , disapproving teachers were in the minority .
Every teacher leaves a mark on a child 's soul .
( CNN ) --
To see the world through Greg Taylor 's eyes , imagine being stuck in a time machine for 16 years and delivered to 2010 .
Facebook , flat screens and DVDs are all new to him .
Relationships that used to come with natural ease seem awkward .
Since 1993 , Taylor , now 47 , had been locked away in North Carolina 's prison system for the murder of a prostitute .
Last month , he was exonerated and freed .
" All that frustration and confusion I had stored up all those years was just let out , " Taylor said , recalling the day he was released , February 17 .
" There was a lot of relief and gratitude .
There was a whole lot to get used to . "
He agreed to jot down his impressions and share them with CNN .
After a month readjusting to life outside prison , Taylor has concluded that Facebook is " neat but a waste of time . "
He 's in awe that a flat , round disk called a DVD lets him rewind and fast - forward movies by just pushing a button .
He finds the automatic soap dispensers in the mall bathrooms startling .
Taylor is the first man to be exonerated by a state innocence commission , which makes his case stand out from those of the more than 500 people across the country who have been exonerated by the work of private attorneys , according to the Life After Exoneration program .
The group that freed Taylor , the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission , was created in 2006 after a succession of wrongful convictions were revealed .
It 's a one - of - a - kind program with a state - mandated panel that re-examines questionable cases , including those that do n't involve DNA evidence like Taylor's .
Other jurisdictions are following North Carolina 's lead , looking at creating government agencies to prevent and reverse wrongful convictions .
In New York City , the Manhattan District Attorney 's office launched a program this month to proactively flag common errors such as witness misidentification and false confessions before the case go to trial .
A petition filed before the Florida Supreme Court by a group of attorneys asks the state to create an agency based on North Carolina 's model that will examine why wrongful convictions occur .
Attorneys hope gathering useful data on eyewitness misidentifications and snitch testimony will highlight systemic flaws that need repair .
In Taylor 's case , the commission considered new tests that revealed that a stain found in Taylor 's truck was not blood , as the prosecutor had argued .
The commission also reviewed testimony from the jailhouse informant who implicated Taylor at the trial .
By the time the commission decided to free Taylor on February 17 , he had already spent a total of 16 years behind bars .
That day , he stumbled out of the courthouse without shackles for the first time .
He grinned when his 26 - year - old daughter embraced him tearfully .
No longer a 9 - year - old , Kristen Puryear had a child herself , making Taylor a grandfather .
She drove while her father sat in the passenger seat .
The post - exoneration journey is daunting for many former inmates , most of whom have spent a large portion of their adult lives in institutional settings .
The Life After Exoneration Program found one out of three inmates has lost custody of children .
About 25 percent develop post traumatic stress disorder , but access to counseling and medical care is limited without employment .
Unlike parolees , who are convicted of crimes , those exonerated do n't have access to corrections services .
When Taylor left prison , the state of North Carolina gave him a $ 45 check .
It was intended to get him a hotel room and back on his feet .
The amount makes him laugh .
Taylor spent his first day after his release at the mall , eager to trade his scratched plastic prison glasses for new ones .
He passed a bakery where the aroma captivated him .
In prison , sights and smells are muted , he explained .
Inmates wear identical uniforms and eat the same tasteless cafeteria food .
" I could have stood there all day , " he said .
Incarceration can also place strains on relationships with loved ones .
For Taylor , it separated him from his wife and some of his closest friends .
Three days after his release , Taylor received a phone call from his childhood friend , Kenny , who had sent Taylor letters and magazines in prison but never visited .
" There was a lot of people that could not stand to see me in prison , " Taylor explained .
The two friends grew up as University of North Carolina basketball fans .
This spring , they reunited in front of the television to cheer their favorite team on .
Taylor 's marriage was another relationship that suffered when he was in prison .
His wife of 10 years , Becky Taylor , supported him throughout the trial .
But several months after he entered prison , they divorced .
For their first face - to - face meeting in 16 years , Taylor 's ex-wife came for dinner at their daughter 's house .
The conversation was cordial .
She had moved to another suburb and remarried .
But the comfortable ease he once felt around her had faded .
" It was the loss that hit me , " Taylor said .
" I just do n't know her that well anymore . "
But some things are just like he remembered .
Taylor spent last weekend at Lake Jordan State Park , one of his favorite retreats .
Before prison , he used to go boating and water ski in the summer with his daughter .
This time , they sat on the lake front watching the dark , still water and inhaling the crisp air .
" It was the largest body of water I had seen in a long time , " Taylor said .
After three weeks of living with his daughter , Taylor knew he needed to pull his life together .
He knew he could n't stay in his grandson 's room forever .
He 's looking for a car .
He 's gone online to build a model of the Honda Accord he wanted using the slim laptop his family bought for him .
They did n't have computers that skinny in 1993 , he pointed out .
He went to the barbershop for a haircut to prepare for job interviews .
There , a woman cut his hair with scissors .
In prison , he said , other inmates used toenail clippers to trim his hair .
Taylor says he sometimes feels overwhelmed by the daunting tasks ahead -- getting a job with medical benefits and finding a place to live .
Two - thirds of those exonerated will not become financially independent , according to the Life After Exoneration Program .
Sometimes , he said , it feels as if his body is being yanked in too many different directions .
His father has helped him pursue some job leads .
So far , he 's had no luck .
" I can't live in my grandson 's room forever , " he said .
" When I have a routine , that 's where the happiness is going to be . "
But he 's in no rush .
He 's got a daughter and grandson to get to know -- and plenty of people to catch up with .

Are geeks and feminists allies or enemies ?
One feminist geek tackles the question head - on with her praise of a Lord of the Rings heroine — but geekdom has more to offer than its ( few ) female characters .

Cath Elliott , writing in the Guardian , seeks to rehabilitate Tolkien 's saga in the face of accusations of misogyny .
She writes , " I do n't hold with the theory that LOTR geekdom is an exclusively male preserve .
In fact some of the most ardent LOTR fans that I 've ever come across have been women . "
While acknowledging that the books do n't have many female characters ( Peter Jackson had to beef up the few roles there were to give his actresses some screen time ) , Elliott holds up Rohan warrior Éowyn as a feminist exemplar .
She writes ,
Éowyn is up there with all the best kick - ass feminist heroes .
She 's brave , she 's rebellious , and most importantly of all , she 's gender non-conformist .
In fact , it 's her refusal to bow to patriarchal conditioning and accept her designated gender role that ultimately saves the day .

Elliott knows her Tolkien , and musters some relatively " kick-ass " Éowyn quotes ( " But no living man am I !
You look upon a woman . " )
So at first I was n't sure why I felt sort of peeved by her analysis .
On further reflection , I think it has to do with her conclusion :
" Obviously Éowyn's not the only reason I love The Lord of the Rings , but when people question how , as a feminist , I can be a LOTR fan , she 's definitely my excuse , and I 'm sticking with her . "

I know Elliott 's not trying to snatch anyone 's F - card — but I do n't believe that " as a feminist " I need an " excuse " for liking anything .
More to the point , I do n't think a single female character is a great excuse at all .
Girl geeks have long complained about the relative lack of interesting women in their favorite films and shows , and the fact that Star Trek envisioned an interstellar military that clothed its female officers in miniskirts was certainly a bit alienating for young women who aspired to climb both career and actual ladders .
While later shows ( obviously Battlestar Galactica , less obviously Bablyon 5 , which even featured a lesbian character ) offered exceptions to the unspoken rule that space is full of dudes , one lady with a sword does n't really change the fact that Middle Earth , both onscreen and on the page , is apparently 95 % male .
Reproductive questions aside , this does make it harder for female readers / viewers to see themselves in Tolkien 's alternate world , which I 'd argue is one of the great pleasures of geek art .
But , there 's another :

Geek culture is , fundamentally , about outsiderness .
It 's often literally about aliens ( or , in LOTR 's case , about monsters and men / hobbits who become monsters ) , but it's also a marginal subculture that appeals to people who feel marginalized .
Geek guys are often those who reject or feel threatened by traditional notions of masculinity , and geek culture 's status as a refuge for men fleeing Tucker - Maxpectations can make it both friendly and unfriendly to feminists — a wide - open space for gender non-conformism and a hiding place for Nice Guys ( TM ) .
But marginal subcultures have something to offer women , too , especially those who chafe against gender norms much as some geek guys do .
And that something may have more to do with an overarching outsider narrative than with individual swordswomen .

I frequently get bored at movies with no female characters , and I understand the desire to identify .
At the same time , to define a geek classic 's feminist cred in terms of its women misses the reason why some feminists like it .
Feminism itself often gets its adherents branded as " weird , " and over the last fifty years or so , geek culture has offered a source of weird pride .
You could argue that this source is drying up — both because geekness is almost mainstream now , and because those who wish it were n't have in some cases become so self - congratulatory that they 're just as bad as cool kids .
But at its heyday it ran far broader and deeper than the character of Éowyn , who is unfortunately not very broad or deep .
This is n't to say that fantasy , sci - fi , comic books and the like could n't use more female characters — or , perhaps more importantly , more female artists .
It 's just that geek culture , at its best , is a place where the margins become the center — and that 's as good an " excuse " as any .
The Sorority Of The Ring [ Guardian ]
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Last week ’s failed plot to bomb a U.S. passenger jet has exposed lingering fissures within the U.S. intelligence community , which had information from interviews and clandestine intercepts but did not put the pieces together , officials said .

Turf wars between U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies are nothing new .
But lapses that allowed a Nigerian suspect to board a Detroit - bound plane with a bomb on Christmas Day , and the finger - pointing that followed , have raised questions about sweeping changes made to improve security and intelligence - sharing after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
President Barack Obama has ordered preliminary findings by Thursday into what he described as a “ systemic failure ” by federal authorities for allowing the botched December 25 attack .
A senior aide said Obama would seek accountability at the highest levels , stoking fears in the intelligence community of a shake - up .
Another official said the review would show “ where the dots should have been connected ” and why they were not .
Two officials said a focus of the White House review was what happened to intelligence after it was relayed to the National Counterterrorism Center , created in 2004 to collect , integrate and analyze the information as it is gathered .
U.S. intelligence and counterterrorism officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said spy agencies picked up important information about the suspected would - be - bomber , 23 - year - old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , and about the intentions of al Qaeda leaders in Yemen , in the months before the attempted bombing .
The intelligence trail began at least four months ago , when the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between al Qaeda leaders in Yemen discussing the possibility of using a “ Nigerian ” bomber , according to one official briefed on the intelligence .
NO ‘MAGIC PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE ’
The CIA first learned of Abdulmutallab in November , when his father came to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and sought help in finding him , a spokesman said .
The agency said it then worked with the embassy to add Abdulmutallab and his possible Yemeni contacts to the U.S. terrorism database and forwarded biographical information about him to the National Counterterrorism Center .
Although worrying , a U.S. intelligence official said the information the CIA received about Abdulmutallab was sketchy .
“ Abdulmutallab ’s father did n’t say his son was a terrorist , let alone planning an attack .
Not at all , ” the official said .
“ I ’m not aware of some magic piece of intelligence that suddenly would have flagged this guy -- whose name nobody even had until November -- as a killer en route to America , ” the intelligence official added .
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat , said “ restrictive ” counterterrorism policies were partly to blame by discouraging authorities from placing Abdulmutallab on a “ no - fly ” list , or from revoking his U.S. visa .
The policies , Feinstein said , should be changed so the U.S. government can watchlist and deny visas to anyone who is “ reasonably believed to be affiliated with , part of , or acting on behalf of a terrorist organization . ”
Republican Representative Michael Castle singled out the National Counterterrorism Center , or NCTC , the agency that was “ designed to connect the dots on terrorism . ”
“ Red flags ” were missed across the board , he said .
Abdulmutallab had no checked luggage ; he paid for his ticket with cash ; and British officials had rejected his visa renewal application and had his name on their own watch list .
Some officials pointed to long - standing tensions between the CIA and Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair , whose office was created in the wake of the September 11 attacks .
A sweeping 2004 intelligence overhaul left gaps in authorities and responsibilities , fueling the discord , they said .
In recent months , the two agencies have sparred over a range of turf issues , including the CIA ’s control over clandestine operations , according to officials , forcing the White House to intervene .
“ The United States government set up NCTC -- and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence -- to connect the dots on terrorism , ” the U.S. intelligence official said , underlining the growing fissure .
“ If somebody thinks it could have been done better in this case , they know where to go for answers . ”
The NCTC and Blair ’s office declined to comment on any rift .
In a statement , Blair said information - sharing within the intelligence community had been “ drastically improved ” but acknowledged that gaps remained .
You just know the next level is much more awesome

PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup 's underemployment measure hit 20.0 % on March 15 -- up from 19.7 % two weeks earlier and 19.5 % at the start of the year .
Gallup Daily tracking makes it possible to monitor the underemployment rate throughout the month , rather than just once per month , making it the best and most timely way to measure the U.S. jobs situation .
The findings underscore why Americans say the most important problem facing the nation today is jobs and unemployment .
Gallup 's underemployment measure is based on more than 20,000 phone interviews collected over a 30 - day period and reported daily .
Gallup 's results are not seasonally adjusted and tend to be a precursor of government reports by approximately two weeks .
More Part - Time Employees Seeking Full - Time Work
Gallup classifies Americans as underemployed if they are unemployed or working part - time but wanting full - time work .
On March 15 , Gallup 's unemployment rate was 10.3 % -- essentially the same as the 10.4 % of March 1 , but down from 10.8 % in mid-February .
However , this decline in the percentage of unemployed Americans was more than offset over the past 30 days by an increase in the percentage of those working part - time but wanting full - time work , from 9.0 % in mid-February to 9.7 % in mid-March .
Gallup 's data suggest that while the U.S. unemployment rate has declined over the past month , the employment gains may be largely taking the form of new part - time jobs .
Many of those acquiring these new jobs may be Americans who find that , although they would prefer to be working full - time , only part - time work is available .
Focus on Underemployment , Not Unemployment
Even with historic healthcare legislation under consideration , Congress passed and the president signed a new jobs creation bill on March 18 .
No doubt , national attention will shortly shift to unemployment and anticipation of the government 's April 2 report of the March unemployment rate .
In this regard , Gallup 's mid-March unemployment rate is likely indicative of the not - seasonally adjusted unemployment rate the government will release in April , as is Gallup 's broader underemployment rate .
The danger associated with focusing on unemployment is reflected by the recent statement of Morgan Stanley economists suggesting that the U.S. may add as many as 300,000 jobs in March owing to an improvement in the weather , economic growth , and the government 's hiring of temporary census workers .
If anything close to this number of new jobs is announced by the government in early April , there is likely to be an enthusiastic , possibly even celebratory , response .
Government officials are liable to tout the continued benefits of last year 's stimulus and the future benefits of the new jobs bill .
Many Wall Streeters will likely argue that the surge in jobs is simply another confirmation of the strength of the overall economic recovery .
However , before policymakers celebrate too much , they should note Gallup 's recent findings involving its new , more inclusive measure of underemployment .
To be sure , there are some benefits associated with the unemployed getting part - time jobs , no matter the source .
For example , Gallup 's self - reported spending data show that part - time workers who want full - time work spent on average 24 % more per day ( $ 51 ) during the past 30 days than did the unemployed ( $ 41 ) .
While this represents an improvement and is good for the economy , it is not nearly as good as the 85 % higher daily spending of those having full - time jobs ( $ 76 ) .
It is also often suggested that a growth in part - time jobs may indicate future growth in full - time work -- that companies hire part - time workers before committing to hiring new full - time employees .
While this is sometimes the case , it may not be so at this point in the U.S. economy : Gallup data show that one in three part - time employees who are wanting full - time work are currently " hopeful " about finding a full - time job in the next 30 days -- not much of an endorsement of the idea that today 's new part - time work will progress to full - time jobs .
Regardless of how one interprets the shifts taking place between part - time and full - time jobs , it is important that policymakers focus on the broader goal of reducing underemployment , not just unemployment .
Part - time , temporary jobs like those associated with census - taking are far better than no job and may reduce the unemployment rate , but they do not represent the kind of job creation needed for a sustainable economic recovery .

For Gallup Daily tracking , Gallup interviews approximately 1,000 national adults , aged 18 and older , each day .
Gallup 's employment metrics are based on nightly interviews with approximately 675 national adults who are part of the workforce .
Results reported each day are based on a 30 - day rolling average , aggregated from telephone interviews with approximately 20,000 adults .
For these results , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones and cellular phones .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Reader Clifford McC. and his ( female ) partner both receive Bicycling magazine ( which , he explains , is more of a free advertisement that they get whether they want to or not ) .
In any case , this month ’s issue was the 2010 Buyer ’s Guide and , though the issues each received were identical , the one addressed to his partner was stickered :
The sticker read , “ BONUS ! SPECIAL WOMEN’S SECTION . ”
Perhaps they were trying to be inclusive , but a sticker advertising a special women ’s section just goes to show that the magazine is , first - and - foremost , for men .

In the last three general elections – 2004 , 2006 , and 2008 — young voters have given the Democratic Party a majority of their votes , and for all three cycles they have been the party ’s most supportive age group .
This year , 66 % of those under age 30 voted for Barack Obama making the disparity between young voters and other age groups larger than in any presidential election since exit polling began in 1972 .
This pattern of votes , along with other evidence about the political leanings of young voters , suggests that a significant generational shift in political allegiance is occurring .
This pattern has been building for several years , and is underscored among voters this year .
Among voters ages 18 - 29 , a 19 - point gap now separates Democratic party affiliation ( 45 % ) and Republican affiliation ( 26 % ) .
In 2000 , party affiliation was split nearly evenly among the young .
Young voters are more diverse racially and ethnically than older voters and more secular in their religious orientation .
These characteristics , as well as the climate in which they have come of age politically , incline them not only toward Democratic Party affiliation but also toward greater support of activist government , greater opposition to the war in Iraq , less social conservatism , and a greater willingness to describe themselves as liberal politically .
Young people were not , however , crucial to Barack Obama ’s victory , according to the exit polls .
Obama would have lost Indiana and North Carolina , but carried other key states such as Ohio and Florida , as well as the national vote .
But young people provided not only their votes but also many enthusiastic campaign volunteers .
Some may have helped persuade parents and older relatives to consider Obama ’s candidacy .
And far more young people than older voters reported attending a campaign event while nearly one - in - ten donated money to a presidential candidate .
While Obama captured 66 % of the youth vote , compared with McCain ’s 31 % , voters age 30 and older divided roughly evenly between the two candidates .
Among those ages 18 - 29 , Obama took a majority among whites ( 54 % - 44 % ) , and captured more than three - fourths of young Hispanic voters ( 76% - 19 % ) .
However , among both younger and older voters , there was no difference in the vote of those with college experience and those without .
As with older voters , a gender gap appears in young voters ’ support for the Democratic ticket : 69 % of younger women voted Democratic , compared with 62 % of comparably aged men .
Describing the Young Voter
One of the most striking features of young voters is their racial and ethnic diversity .
Just 62 % of voters age 18 - 29 identify as white , while 18 % are black and 14 % Hispanic .
Four years ago , this age group was 68 % white .
In 2000 , nearly three - quarters ( 74 % ) of young voters were white .
Women significantly outnumber men among younger voters , constituting 55 % of those 18 - 29 and 30 - 44 .
Among voters ages 45 - 64 , 52 % are female , while 51 % of voters age 65 and older are women .
Compared with those age 30 and older , fewer young voters say they are affiliated with a religious tradition ( 16 % vs. 12 % overall ) , and fewer report regular attendance at worship services .
Among all voters , 40 % attend religious services weekly or more often ; among those 18 - 29 , just 33 % do so .
Party Identification and Issues
The Democrats ’ overall advantage in party identification in the 2008 election was driven in large part by the strong Democratic leaning of young voters .
Voters ages 18 - 29 were by far the most Democratic age cohort in the election ; 45 % identified as Democrats , compared with smaller percentages who identified as Republican ( 26 % ) or independent ( 29 % ) .
Older voters also tilted Democratic this year , though by nowhere near the margin found among those under age 30 .
The party gap among young voters has expanded over the last four years .
Since 2004 , Democratic identification among voters under age 30 has increased 8 points , while Republican identification has fallen by 9 points .
The percentage of young voters declining to identify with either of the two major parties remained stable at 29 % .
In 2000 , young voters were about evenly split between the two parties : 36 % Democratic , 35 % Republican .
Notably , young voters were actually somewhat less Democratic than older voters in 2000 .
For example , those age 65 and older were 4 points more likely than the youngest slice of the electorate to be Democrats .
Consistent with their strong Obama vote and their Democratic Party affiliation , young voters were distinctively liberal in their views on several policy questions .
Yet they were similar to older voters in the relative importance of different issues to their vote .
Young voters differ most from older voters in their liberal views on the proper scope of government .
Nearly seven - in - ten ( 69 % ) of voters ages 18 - 29 favor an expanded role for government , agreeing that it should do more to solve problems ; fewer ( 27 % ) say the government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals .
Opinion on this question is more closely divided among older age cohorts and a narrow plurality of those age 45 and older says government is doing too much .
Young voters also stand out for their opinions on the Iraq war and offshore drilling .
A wide 77 % - majority of voters under age 30 disapprove of the U.S. war in Iraq , making them at least 15 points more negative on the war than older age groups .
While the public as a whole disapproves of the war , opinion is less lopsided with 36 % approving of the war .
Young voters have soured considerably on the war over the past four years ; in 2004 , 52 % approved of the original decision to use military force against Iraq , and at that time , young voters ’ opinions mirrored those of the larger voting public .
While voters overall favor offshore drilling by a margin of more than two - to - one ( 68 % to 28 % ) , those under age 30 express somewhat less support for offshore drilling than do older voters .
Yet even so , a 57 % - majority of young voters favors drilling for oil in U.S. waters where it is currently not allowed .
Fully 72 % of those ages 45 - 64 , and 74 % of those age 65 and older support increased oil production in U.S. waters .
Nearly a third of young voters ( 32 % ) describe themselves as liberal , compared with 22 % of all voters .
Those under 30 are about as likely as all voters to call themselves moderate , but are significantly less likely to identify as conservative : just over a quarter ( 26 % ) of young voters do so .
By contrast , voters in older age cohorts are much more likely to call themselves conservative as opposed to liberal .
Despite holding more liberal views on many issues , young voters share the same issue priorities as the electorate at large .
More than six - in - ten ( 61 % ) young voters see the economy as the nation ’s most important problem , about the same share as among the general voting public ; the war in Iraq is a distant second on the minds of young voters — as it is among all voters — with 12 % naming it the country ’s top problem .
Voters under age 30 differ somewhat from all voters in viewing energy policy ( 10 % top problem ) as a more pressing issue than terrorism ( 5 % top problem ) ; other age cohorts generally consider the issues to be of similar importance or give a slight priority to terrorism .
Mobilization and Turnout
In addition to providing Barack Obama and other Democrats with strong support this year , young voters were unusually active in the campaign .
According to Pew ’s post-election survey of voters , fully 28 % of young voters in battleground states said they had attended a campaign event , far more than among other age groups .
They were less likely than older voters to contribute money to the campaign , but according to the survey nearly one - in - ten ( 9 % ) did so , compared with the overall average of 17 % .
But the electoral influence of young voters also depends on efforts made to mobilize them .
According to the exit polls , young voters in key battleground states this year were far more likely to have been contacted by the Obama campaign than by the McCain campaign – and in some states they were more likely than older voters to have been contacted , a significant reversal from past patterns .
Nationally , a quarter of voters ( 25 % ) 18 - 29 say someone contacted them in person or by phone on behalf of the Obama campaign about coming out to vote .
By contrast , just 13 % were contacted by the McCain campaign .
In 2004 , nearly the same share of young voters was reached by the Kerry campaign ( 22 % ) as was reached by the Bush campaign ( 19 % ) .
But the disparity was much larger in some of the key battleground states .
In Pennsylvania and Nevada , which Obama carried by double - digit margins , more than half of voters under age 30 said they were contacted by the Obama campaign ( 54 % in Pennsylvania and 61 % in Nevada ) .
The McCain campaign reached considerably fewer young voters in those states — 30 % in Pennsylvania and 26 % in Nevada .
Obama ’s get - out - the - vote operation also reached three times as many young voters as McCain ’s operation in Indiana ( 45 % vs. 15 % ) and twice as many in Florida ( 32 % vs. 16 % ) .
The Obama campaign also reached more voters than the McCain campaign across some older age groups , though the advantage was generally more modest than that among 18 - 29 year - olds .
In North Carolina , for example , 46 % of voters under age 30 reported being contacted by someone in the Obama campaign about coming out to vote , compared with 29 % who reported being contacted by the McCain campaign .
However , Obama ’s get - out - the - vote advantage narrows somewhat among those ages 30 - 44 ( 11 points ) and ages 45 - 64 ( 6 points ) and completely disappears among those age 65 and older ( 29 % each ) .
With the exception of Virginia , Nevada , and Wisconsin , the two campaigns were about even in their efforts to turn out voters age 65 and older in the swing states .
Obama reached far more older voters than McCain in Virginia ( 55 % vs. 45 % ) and Nevada ( 47 % vs. 38 % ) , while McCain reached more voters age 65 and older in Wisconsin ( 58 % vs. 46 % ) .
Official estimates of voter turnout among age groups wo n’t be available for several months , but the exit polls indicate that mobilization efforts aimed at young people may have paid off .
Voters ages 18 - 29 turned out at a higher rate in 2008 than in 2004 in several battleground states .
Young voters increased their share of the total electorate by five points in Indiana , four points in North Carolina and Virginia — all of which experienced sizeable increases in overall voter turnout — and by lesser amounts in six other key states .
By contrast , the young declined as a share of the total in Florida , Pennsylvania , and Ohio .
Nationally , young voters were estimated to be 18 % of the total , up slightly from 17 % four years ago .

VANCOUVER ( Reuters ) - Nodar Kumaritashvili , a 21 - year - old Georgian luger , died in a horrific crash on a training run on Friday , casting a pall over the Winter Olympics hours before the Games were to be declared open .
Kumaritashvili slammed into a pillar at 90 mph after being thrown off the sled as it bounced over the rim on the 16th and final bend of the lightning fast track at the Whistler Sliding Center .
The tragedy darkened a mood that had been one of celebration , as Vancouver prepared to welcome the world on the day of the opening ceremony , to be held indoors in a first for the Winter Olympics .
International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge , tears welling in his eyes and his voice cracking , had trouble expressing his shock at the death of a young athlete competing at his first Olympics .
“ I have no words to describe how we feel , ” said Rogge , who confirmed that Georgia is considering the country ’s participation in the Games .
It was all so different on Friday morning in downtown Vancouver , where residents took to the streets to cheer on torch - bearers .
Small groups of anti-Games protestors swapped chants with pro-Olympic fans , many decked out in Canadian colors , but there was no serious trouble .
Speculation was rife about who would be given the honor of lighting the cauldron at the ceremony , with many tipping Wayne Gretzky as the man most likely after the former ice hockey great was spotted in the city this week .
WEATHER THREAT
The other two concerns prior to the official opening were Lindsey Vonn ’s bruised shin and the fog and rain that was wreaking havoc with the Alpine skiing downhill training sessions .
Vonn arrived worried that a bruised shin might stop her going for five gold medals in Alpine skiing but there was good news for her many fans on Friday as her husband revealed she was getting better all the time .
Vonn ’s cause was helped by the unrelentingly bad weather up in Whistler .
The opening women ’s skiing event , the super - combined scheduled for Sunday , has been postponed , with no time to complete the necessary training run .

The damp and foggy weather also meant the final men ’s downhill training run was canceled .
Kumaritashvili ’s crash at a Whistler track regarded as the fastest in the world came the day after a luge federation official had told Reuters that sliding tracks needed to be slowed down .
Training was suspended immediately after the crash , which made for unbearable viewing , and the IOC said an inquiry was under way .

Like Rogge , Vancouver Games chief John Furlong had to fight back tears as he spoke of the death of Kumaritashvili , whose father is the head of the Georgia Luge Federation .
“ We are heartbroken beyond words , ” Furlong said .
“ This athlete came to Canada with hopes and dreams that this would be a magnificent occasion in his life .
I am told by members of his delegation that he was an incredibly spirited person .
He came here to experience what being an Olympian was . ”
Despite the tragedy , the Games will go on and the BC Place arena will be crammed full of people there to see the cauldron brought to life by the final , as yet unidentified , torch - bearer .
It will feel like a tribute for Kumaritashvili .

Artist Statement
With an artistic training in figurative realism and a background in graphic design , my paintings unite my interest in the psyche as expressed through the human form and a personal graphic aesthetic .
Thematically , my paintings address the complexity of memory , by blurring the lines between recollection , projection , and reality .
Each painting becomes a psychological landscape or waking dream , reinforcing the fluid relationships between time , memory and place .
The projected image as object , and the notion of projection , is the most dominant visual metaphor pervading the compositions and gives my paintings the look of theater , video and installation art .
By merging both real and fictitious images in these painted fictional documentaries , I explore the conflation of our media - saturated lives and our lived reality ; we live among images and in many ways as images .
Our memories of events have become distorted .
With media today , we have grown accustomed to watching ourselves and living from a voyeuristic standpoint .
With these paintings , the viewer ’s imagination plays an important role in the piece , while also being implicated in the voyeurism depicted .

TheStreet.com , the financial Web site founded by loudmouth stock picker and TV personality Jim Cramer , is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The publicly traded company attracted the attention of regulators because of accounting woes at a former subsidiary called Promotions.com , TheStreet.com said yesterday .
The Street.com revealed the news in an SEC filing explaining why it will be late reporting its annual financial results .
Last summer , TheStreet.com announced there were “ issues ” related to how it had been recording revenue at Promotions.com , the marketing company it acquired in 2007 .
An internal probe ensued and resulted in several quarters of delayed earnings results for the parent company , frustrating investors .
In recent months , TheStreet.com seemed to be coming into the clear .
In December , it announced that it had sold its “ membership interest ” in Promotions.com for $ 3.1 million in cash and notes .
And in January , it filed its long - awaited second - and third - quarter results for 2009 after announcing it had finally concluded its review , which went back to 2008 earnings .
But just as things appeared to be getting back to normal , earlier this month the SEC asked to have a second look at the findings of TheStreet.com ’s internal probe , said a person close to the company .
TheStreet.com “ is cooperating fully with the investigation , ” CEO Daryl Otte told The Post .
Cramer , the host of “ Mad Money ” and a former hedge - fund manager , co-founded TheStreet.com in 1996 .
He remains a commentator on the site as well as chairman of the company ’s board .

This post demonstrates the problem with the temperature station data .
Again this is station , 25563 which has the following extensive metadata .
222 25563 0 ANADYR ' 64.78 177.57 6 1 77 R -9FLxxC O 5 A- 9TUNDRA
That ’s it .
Sometimes there are several listings for the multiple versions in the ‘ raw ’ data , however in this case there is a single entry for 8 separate timeseries .
The “ R ” is a rural classification , however this town has 11,000 inhabitants according to Wiki– and we know Wiki is never wrong .
That census was in 2002 and just to be clear — rural in GHCN means not associated with a town of 10,000 or more people .
Why the hell ca n’t we afford good temperature records ?
The google embedded map is awesome .
You can drag it , zoom in and out , switch from satellite ground images to maps .
Very cool .
We ’ve seen the plots already of these stations , and many have wondered if we ’re seeing the same station information from the exact same instrument .
Indeed that ’s exactly how I treated this data at first but there might be more to it .
Unfortunately for you guys ( and me ) the best way to see what ’s up with the data is an ugly table — with numbers .
The first 8 columns after the year are the GHCN data , the last column on the right is Dr. Phil Climategate Jones version .

Climategate Jones has obviously found some method for combining ( Gluing ) the data , however it does n’t seem from this station to be unreasonable ….. just opaque .
Nothing visually jumps out at me for the true automated method but it follows the GHCN data reasonably well .
Perhaps you guys can figure it out .
I need to mention that there are max / min files with GHCN “ raw ” data .

Dear Readers ...
Ever since I took over running the Linux Gazette , I 've found it to be a fascinating experience : it 's presented me with a variety of surprises , required a lot of hard thinking about the larger issues as well as dealing with problems that pop up out of nowhere and demand immediate action - and much of it has been just plain hard work .
It 's also been a blast - and I 'm so grateful to my fellow contributors , staff and authors both , that words fail me in trying to express it adequately ( and that 's quite the statement for someone who considers himself a crafter of words and a lover of language ! )
To all of you who have made LG what it is , I 'm truly grateful - both as a Linux user and as the Editor - in - Chief .
Doubly so as the latter , since your contributions have built LG into a fun , useful , informative vehicle for sharing Linux info and thereby gave me a chance to explore my own abilities and experience my own limitations ( as a friend of mine was fond of saying when speaking of painful experiences , " ... and much learning occured therefrom . " )
If you hold learning in the same regard and respect as I do - and having been a teacher during most of my professional life , as well as always believing that education is one of the keystones to a better future for the entire world , I hold it in high esteem indeed - that is one of the best gifts one could ever receive .
This does not , however , mean that there are no problems or difficulties here .
If anything , it means that there are more of them than ever - and that they mutate in shape , size , charm , spin , and flavor .
Daily .
As you probably already know , good system design requires feedback ; without it , control input means little or nothing , and such systems either spend most of their time idle or shift into destructive run-away conditions and fail , sometimes spectacularly and with much attendant fallout .
For any publication , that feedback is very important ;
For a web - based , volunteer effort like ours , it 's critical .
And yet ...
I 'm not a marketing guru ; far from it .
In fact , I know next to nothing when it comes to promoting LG or getting its name out there , beyond doing the best job I can of putting out a quality publication .
I am , however , very aware that this is not all there is to running a publication like LG ... and I feel that lack quite strongly and am rather troubled by my inability to figure out a strong , direct method of addressing it .
In short , it boils down to the question of " can a volunteer - run publication survive and prosper in a world of glitzy commercial ones , and can it continue to provide quality content without sponsorship ? "
I feel sure that it can - but despite having put a lot of thought into it , I do n't ( yet ) know what that means in terms of direction , planning , or action .
If any of you , dear readers , have relevant ability or expertise , your advice and help would be much appreciated .
The month in review
Last month , in this very space , I asked for you , our readers , to write in ; to let us know that you were reading LG , that it mattered to you - in short , to tell us whether LG 's continued existence was a value to the Linux community , as I believe it is .
The response has been nothing short of phenomenal and tremendously heartening : for the last month , I 've been buried under a huge pile of supportive email from all over the world , with a number of offers of help and ideas for improvement .
It was amazing to see , and again , all of you have my thanks .
One thing stands out most clearly , though : it seems that we are " pricing ourselves out of the market " by producing content with great quality .
It 's funny when you think about it - and not a little aggravating when seen from another perspective .
You see , at the end of every month , our editors and proofreaders put in a lot of work to polish all those articles - and after they 're done , I and my wife go over them with a fine - tooth comb to make sure that they 're as readable and as clear as possible .
At times , that last edit can be like sweating blood , and can involve anything from basic spelling correction to rewriting entire paragraphs to make them clearer , more comprehensible .
Many of the comments that we 've received contain high praise for the clarity and readability of our articles ; I do n't find this at all surprising , since we all put in a very large amount of work to make it so .
However , the * bad* effect here is that it makes us look so professional that many of our readers think " Wow , I could never write like that .
My stuff would look really amateurish next to all these professionals .
I should n't even bother trying !
I saw a whole lot of that in the responses ; lots and lots of people who would be happy to write , but ... only ... there 's this REALLY HIGH BAR to jump over ...
ARRRRRRRRGH !!!
This is just ... wrong , in many different ways and for a variety of reasons .
For one , you only get to be a good writer by writing - and I like to think that , over the years , we 've helped quite a number of people become good , or at least much better writers ( I would like nothing better than for LG to be known , among other things , as a resource for people who want to learn to write well . )
For another , your writing - yes , even yours !
- can look pretty darn polished if you 1 ) can take criticism and 2 ) have a good proofreading / editing team - and we have one here , all shiny and capable and ready for your use , free of charge .
Trust me , folks - that 's a great offer , and if you have any aspirations as a writer and want to write about Open source topics , this is the place to do it .
Most of all - writing from the just - started , not - sure - what - I 'm - doing new Linux users is what we want most desperately .
Please , remember this always : LG is all about looking at the world with a fresh set of eyes .
It 's about exploration ; it 's about making mistakes and learning from them .
Most of all , it 's about growing by learning .
Just like Linux itself , and the community around it .
It 's about all of us , and the force that we bring into the world to oppose the stodgy , inbred , stale world created by proprietary computing and closed - source practices .
It 's about the willingness to stay open , alert , and sensitive in the face of challenges , and dealing with Fear , Uncertainty , and Doubt - the weapons of the proprietary world - with courage , creativity , and laughter .
It is , as I 'm reminded by my 2 - year - old son 's outraged squeal of " mySE 'F !! ! "
( " I 'll do it myself ! " ) when I try to do something for him that he knows how to do , about doing things your own way , in your own time - because " I 'll do it instead of you " is at most a temporary good , is of limited utility , and is proper only to small children and incompetents .
To have a valid claim to being an adult and a responsible human being , you have to sweat and struggle and bleed and do it all wrong , again and again - because a thousand instances of having it done for you , no matter how quickly or well , still leave you an ignorant slave , but doing it on our own even once , even in some barely - functioning fashion , grants you not only the learning experience , which you 'll own for the rest of your life , but your independence and freedom .
And this is the best reason to write , contribute , and participate : we 're designing , building , and maintaining freedom .
Please join us .

The economy grew in the fourth quarter by 5.9 % , the most in years .
The adjusted monetary base is exploding .
Bank reserves are literally through the roof .
The Fed is flooding money into the system in an effort to get banks to lend .
An historically normal response by banks ( to increase lending ) would have been massively inflationary , causing the Fed to stomp on the brakes .
Despite raising the almost meaningless discount rate ( as who uses it ? ) , this week Ben Bernanke assured Congress of an easy monetary policy , with rates remaining low for a long time .
Many ask , how can this not be inflationary ?
This week we look at some fundamentals of money supply and the economy .
If you understand this , you wo n't get misled by people selling investments , telling you to buy this or that based on some chart that shows whatever they are selling to be what you absolutely have to have to protect your portfolio and / or make massive profits .
And we touch on a few odds and ends .
And yes , I can't resist , a few more thoughts on Greece .
It will make for an interesting letter , as I 'm writing on a plane to San Jose .
And it will print a bit longer than usual , because there are a lot of charts .
Before we get into the meat of the letter , I want to give you a chance to register for my 7th ( where do the years go ? ! ) annual Strategic Investment Conference , cosponsored with my friends at Altegris Investments .
The conference will be held April 22 - 24 and , as always , in La Jolla , California .
The speaker lineup is powerful .
Already committed are Dr. Gary Shilling , David Rosenberg , Dr. Lacy Hunt , Dr. Niall Ferguson , and George Friedman , as well as your humble analyst .
We are talking with several other equally exciting speakers and expect those to firm up shortly .
Look at that lineup .
These are the guys who got the calls right over the past few years .
They called the housing crisis , the credit bubble , and the recession .
And , in my opinion , these are some of the best in the world at giving us ideas about where we are headed .
Comments from those who attend the annual affair generally run along the lines of , " This is the best conference we have ever been to . "
And each year it seems to get better .
This year we are going to focus on " The End Game , " that is , on the paths the various nations are likely to take as they try to solve their various deficit problems , and how that will affect the world and local economies and our investments .
We make sure you have access to our speakers and get your questions answered , and you 'll come away with excellent , practical investment ideas .
This conference sells out every year , and it looks like it will do so this year .
You do not want to miss it .
There is a physical limit to the space .
Every year I have to tell people , including good friends , that there is no more room .
Do n't wait to sign up .
There is still an early - registration discount .
And while it pains me to say it , you must be an accredited investor to attend the conference , as there are regulations we must follow in order to offer specific advice and ideas .

Where Is All that Greek Gold ?
Last week I mentioned the ( what seemed to me and much of the world ) odd incident of Greek politicians talking about the need for Germany to pay its debts to Greece .
I got this response from a Greek reader .
Comments afterword .
" Dear Mr. Mauldin ,
I am an avid reader and I just wanted to correct you about a comment in one of your articles , " The Pain in Spain " , specifically :
' Somehow they forgot about the German government paying 115 million deutschmarks in 1960 -- not a small sum back then . '
This repayment of 1960 is undeniable .
but the total amount owed was $ 10 billion ( $ 3.5 billion for the return of the gold stolen and the repayment of the war loans Greece was forced into giving Germany , and $ 7 billion in war reparations awarded to Greece in 1946 ) .
As the DM / $ parity was then four for one , this means they gave Greece $ 29 million out of the $ 10 billion owed .
Germany also proclaims that they have given Greece over the years , in one form or another , € 16.5 billion .
But the fact of the matter is that despite these alleged payments , the issue of the war loans and gold is still not settled .
Greece has never stopped asking for the money to be paid back ... it is estimated that this sum owed now totals $ 70 billion [ I assume the Greeks want interest – JM ] .
So even taking into account the € 16.5 billion , more than $ 50 billion is still owed .
Helmut Kohl refused to even discuss the repayment , presenting as an excuse that this amount was owed by the whole of Germany and until Germany is unified the issue could not be discussed .
Guess what , Germany is unified ....
Best Regards ,
Anthony Kioussopoulos
P.S. Do not take my e-mail as a refusal to acknowledge the fault of successive Greek governments in creating this mess ; just take it as a correction for a specific issue . "
+++++
The point here is not that Anthony is 100 % right , though his statements have the ring of authenticity .
The point is that the Greeks believe it .
And thus my lack of surprise last week when I noted that leading Greek politicians of both the conservative and liberal parties were talking the same line .
This is an issue that runs across the Greek political spectrum .
And that makes the situation all the more intractable , as emotional responses are not the stuff of rational debates .
( I should note that if the US demanded payment from Europe of all the money we loaned them after the war , at full interest , our national balance would be a lot better .
But I doubt that ever gets brought up , nor should it at a remove of 65 years . )
This week saw riots and a national strike as Greek unions demonstrated against budget cuts .
Yet polls seem to indicate a majority of Greeks recognize the need for rather serious austerity measures .
As I have documented , they really have no good choices , only very bad and disastrous choices .
The austerity measures that will be forced on them by market realities if they default will be far worse than those they can self - impose over time .
In fact , yesterday EU inspectors visiting Athens told authorities they see a deeper than expected recession .
Two very condensed reports from European media :
1 . After the German magazine Focus ran an issue with a Photoshopped picture of Venus de Milo giving the middle finger to " Greek con artists " ( referring to the fraud the Greeks perpetrated when they joined the EU by hiding debt ) , street protests demanding the boycott of German goods were organized in Athens and endorsed by the Greek administration .
There was also name calling by the Greek administration , blaming Germany for all of Greece 's economic and financial problems because the Nazis stole all of Greece 's gold in World War II .
In general , the Greek public believes that all this is just excuse - making on the part of the Government , but a boycott is loudly supported by members of all the public workers ' unions .
( Reuters report )
The situation is exacerbated by news today that Greece needs to refinance $ 27bn of bonds in March , vs. the statements JUST TWO DAYS AGO that only half that amount was coming due , and then not until April and May .
2. Financial Times Deutschland reported the results of a poll of German banks that was conducted yesterday .
No German bank polled said it would make any further investments in Greek sovereign debt .
The following banks and building societies are at risk of collapse due to excessive Greek bond holdings : Hypo Real Estate ( $ 13 billion exposure ) , Commerzbank ( $ 7 billion exposure , and the bank was bailed out last year by the German government ) , LBBW ( $ 4 billion ) , Bayern Landesbank ( $ 2.2 billion ) .
It should be pointed out that Greece is a small country , with 11 million people and a GDP of $ 313 billion that is running a trade deficit of $ 11bn .
Banking experts generally stated that any private purchases of Greek bonds are now completely out of the question .
Any future aid will have to be government to government , and that will exclude Germany , as Angela Merkel stated earlier in the week .
Within the eurozone , there are no other countries outside of Germany that have , or can raise , any capital to invest in Greece .
( Hat tip to Steve Stough for the above points . )
For what it 's worth , I do not see Germany bailing out Greece in the current climate .
If Germany were to force Greece to undertake the severe measures they would be required to take for a bailout , the streets of Greece would be full of demonstrators denouncing Germany .
I just do n't see it happening .
If not Germany , who ?
France ?
Spain ?
Italy ?
They all have their own very real problems .
Everyone else is too small .
The US will not .
Neither will China .
My guess is that at the end of the day ( which will come soon ) the IMF is going to have to step in .
It will be a blow to European pride , but what else is there ?
The Euro and a Conspiracy of Hedge Funds
The lead story in this morning 's Wall Street Journal is that hedge funds are holding " idea meetings " and deciding that shorting the euro is a good bet .
Der Spiegel called them " secret meetings , " as if somehow a cabal of hedge funds is conspiring to push the euro down .
A few points for the writers of Der Spiegel :
There is no secret about the problems with the euro .
Let 's see , when the head of Germany 's leading debt - management agency warned this week that the euro would collapse if any member defaulted on its debt , was he part of a secret conspiracy ?
If he is right , do you want to bet that Greece will behave , and go long the euro ?
The currency market is a $ 2 trillion dollar a DAY market .
That 's over $ 50 trillion a month .
Even with 20:1 leverage , $ 50 billion in hedge funds shorting the euro is a drop in the bucket , and I seriously doubt anywhere close to that much is at risk .
George Soros won his bet against the pound sterling because the pound was fundamentally flawed and overvalued , and he put his money where his mouth was .
If a hedge fund is betting against the euro , someone has to be on the other side of that trade .
Are those guys ( on the other side ) conspiring in secret to drive the euro up and the dollar down ?
Are they in " secret " meetings to take advantage of the poor , dumb , misinformed hedge funds ?
Who are they ?
The world needs to know who is conspiring against the dollar and other currencies !
Whatever .
One side will be wrong .
Fundamentals will out .
I get invited to " idea dinners " from time to time .
They are indeed private , but they do n't rise to the level of " secret . "
I do very little trading , but these meetings help to hone my ideas , and I hope that helps make this letter a better source for you .
The Journal wrote that these hedge - fund managers expect the euro to go to parity with the dollar , as if that is some novel idea .
I made that prediction in 2002 when the euro was at $ .88 , suggesting that it would rise to $ 1.50 and then fall back to parity by the middle of the next decade .
Maybe it will get there a little faster than I thought .
Stay tuned , and I do NOT suggest making 20:1 bets on currency moves .
A lot of those hedge funds will lose a lot of money if the market moves against them .
So Where 's the Inflation ?
Now for a series of graphs .
First , let 's look at the Adjusted Monetary Base ( or M0 ) .
This is the one monetary aggregate that the Federal Reserve actually controls .
Notice that it exploded in the middle of 2008 , as the Fed started quantitative easing and pushed rates to zero .
They were desperate to try and thaw out the credit markets that had frozen .
That in turn caused M1 to increase .
But the broader measure on money that is M2 rose into 2009 and has then gone sideways .
Normally the stimulus of such raw money growth in M0 would have M2 exploding upward , as you get a money multiplier effect .
We all know that a US bank can lend out about nine times the deposits it has on hand .
When the Fed puts money into the system , it can be multiplied rather quickly if banks choose to lend .
This is called the money multiplier .
" Restated , increases in central bank money may not result in commercial bank money because the money is not required to be lent out – it may instead result in a growth of unlent reserves ( excess reserves ) .
This situation is referred to as ' pushing on a string ' : withdrawal of central bank money compels commercial banks to curtail lending ( one can pull money via this mechanism ) , but input of central bank money does not compel commercial banks to lend ( one can not push via this mechanism ) . " ( Wikipedia )
This described growth in excess reserves has indeed occurred in the financial crisis of 2007 –2010 , with US bank excess reserves growing over 500 - fold , from under $ 2 billion in August 2008 to over $ 1,000 billion recently .
Look at the chart below .
This is what has all the gold bugs salivating .
Where else has this happened without hyperinflation ?
Now let 's turn to our old friend Paul Samuelson and his textbook that we all read in Econ 101 to learn about the money multiplier :
" By increasing the volume of their government securities and loans and by lowering Member Bank legal reserve requirements , the Reserve Banks can encourage an increase in the supply of money and bank deposits .
They can encourage but , without taking drastic action , they cannot compel .
For in the middle of a deep depression just when we want Reserve policy to be most effective , the Member Banks are likely to be timid about buying new investments or making loans .
If the Reserve authorities buy government bonds in the open market and thereby swell bank reserves , the banks will not put these funds to work but will simply hold reserves .
Result : no 5 for 1 , ' no nothing , ' simply a substitution on the bank 's balance sheet of idle cash for old government bonds . "
–( Samuelson 1948 , pp. 353–354 )
And that is what has happened .
And all those mortgage bonds and other assets the Federal Reserve has purchased ?
They have been put right back into the Fed by the banks .
There has been no money multiplier .
In fact , the money multiplier , as measured by the ratio of MO to M1 growth is at its lowest level ever .
Look at the graph below :
What this graph shows , astonishingly , is that a dollar added to the monetary base now has a NEGATIVE multiplier effect .
Without showing yet another chart , bank lending has fallen percentagewise the most in 67 years .
The actual amount of bank loans is falling each and every quarter , with no signs of a bottom .
Consumers are reducing their debt and leverage .
Bank loans are being written off at staggering rates .
Over 700 banks ( I think that is the figure I saw ) are officially on watch by the FDIC , with more banks being closed each week .
There is at least $ 300 - 400 billion in losses on commercial real estate waiting to be written down .
Housing foreclosures are rising and hundreds of billions have yet to be written off .
As more families fall into unemployment or underemployment , there will be more writedowns .
Is it any wonder that banks are having to shore up their balance sheets and make fewer loans ?
With capacity utilization just off all - time lows , why should we expect businesses to borrow to increase capacity ?
Inventory levels are much lower than two years ago .
Businesses no longer need to finance as much inventory .
They simply need less .
Dennis Gartman writes :
" Effectively the Fed had become a cash machine rather than a monetary expansion machine .
At the end of last year , the multiplier had actually fallen to less than 1.0 and the trend remains downward .
If anyone had told us five years ago that the money multiplier would be down to 1.0 we would have laughed .
The laugh , however , would have been upon us , for it is there and it is still falling .
Hard it shall be to sponsor strong economic growth when no one really wants to take a loan or when few banks want to make a loan .
The " game " of banking has been turned upon its head , and the strength of the economy suffers while inflationary pressures ( at least for now ) remain virtually non-existent . "
Next week ( or within a few weeks ) we will review the velocity of money , as the normal , accustomed relationships about money supply and inflation are proving to be wrong .
We live in extraordinary times .
We are coming to the End Game of the debt supercycle that has lasted for 70 years .
Everything is changing in front of our eyes .
It compels us to understand the basics of how economies function , and what is both different and not different about the times we are in .
No Help for Homebuilders
Before we close , this note from Mark Hanson about the home - building market :
" In January , builders sold a whopping 1000 houses per day nationally .
During the same month , Foreclosures rang up at 4300 and Notice - of - Defaults at 5100 per day nationally .
What a mess .
I really thought earlier in the year with massive mortgage rate and tax stimuli -- and the purposeful lack of distressed inventory due to HAMP and other mortgage mod and foreclosure prevention initiatives -- that builders had a shot at some volume .
" But their window of opportunity has now passed .
With HAFA coming on line and foreclosures , short sales and deeds - in - lieu about to dump significantly more distressed inventory on the market throughout 2010 , the odds that of any meaningful pickup in builder output or sales is significantly decreasing daily . "
The Singularity , San Antonio , Home , and Addictions
It is time to hit the send button .
In order to have some mercy on you , gentle reader , I am saving the last 8 pages of this letter for another time .
All things in moderation .
As noted above , I am on a plane to San Jose , where I will take a short ride to NASA Ames to spend the next 9 days listening to experts talk about how various technologies will change over the next 10 years , and how that will impact business , society – well , everything .
I am really pumped about it .
12 hours a day of lectures and some local tours , with a small group that appears to include some very bright attendees ( from their bios ) .
Your humble analyst will speak for just an hour on the future of the world economy .
Sadly , my assessment will not be as optimistic as theirs , at least with regard to the next 5 years .
If I am allowed , I am going to publish my abbreviated notes in next week 's letter , assuming I can take notes and keep up at the same time .
Then I must miss the final day , as I fly to San Antonio for a speech on Saturday morning to the top level of Cambridge brokers , then back home for a month !
A whole month !
Maybe I can catch up on my writing and emails .
I met with George Friedman of Stratfor this Tuesday .
( Tiffani went with me , her first trip away from my granddaughter Lively .
Ryan got to play Mr. Mom . )
I was sitting in George 's office at the end of the day , waiting for everyone else to show up so we could go to dinner .
I had been busy trying to coordinate meetings and keep up with my reading and research , emails , and phone calls .
" George , I have a problem .
I feel like I am drinking information through a fire hose .
I am addicted to information .
It is beginning to interfere with my productivity , as I get so much high - quality material from the best sources that I feel I need to absorb .
Each bit of information becomes a clue to the larger puzzle .
But I have to write more .
I am going to have to start randomly deleting things every now and then if I am going to stay on top of it all , and get some of these books that are in me done . "
I am determined to have a life outside of work ( family and friends are important ) , and am for the most part successful at that , but I am not getting done all that I wish I could do when I 'm at work .
And there are books piled on my desk that simply scream for attention .
I thought George would understand .
He has some 90 analysts all over the world feeding him up - to - the - minute analysis on country and issue situations .
Surely , he must have an idea for me on how to handle the " download " problem .
" John , " he replied quietly , sighing heavily , " I know what you mean .
But if I started randomly deleting , I 'd be afraid I would miss something important .
What else can you do but keep at it ? "
It is the conundrum of our age .
I hope , gentle reader , that I help you in some ways to keep up and stay informed without overloading you !
Have a great week , and learn something new !
Your really ready to think about the future analyst ,

One of UNESCO ’s World Heritage Site and the Philippines ’ official nominee to the new 7 wonders of nature is the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park .
It was popularly known for its lush old growth tropical forest , interesting wildlife , pristine white sand beaches and unspoiled natural beauty .
It is located in Bahile , in the west coast of Palawan , and was formerly called St. Paul Subterranean River National Park because it forms part of the lush and limestone - filled Mount Saint Paul .
It is also considered one of the longest underground river of the world .
The best features of this underground river are its limestone karst mountain landscape with major formations of stalactite and stalagmites , and several chambers .
It also winds through a cave before flowing directly into the South China Sea .
The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park is one of the most distinguished biodiversity conservation areas of the Philippines .
Two - third of the place is covered by lush tropical rainforest from the shoreline to the highest peak , and one - third is thinly vegetated karst limestone .
It has become a habitat for thousands of variety of flora and fauna including endangered species .
The park was declared a premier ecotourism destination and has been inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites for its outstanding universal value and ecological significance as a natural site of intense beauty .
It ’s the longest navigable underground river and reputedly the most beautiful subterranean river in the world .
As a natural area , it has attracted an increasing number of conservationist , scientist , students , photographers , wildlife watchers and nature lovers .
Visitors can enjoy bird watching , mountain trekking , and exploring the deeper part of the forest .
At the mouth of the cave , a clear lagoon is framed by ancient trees growing right to the water 's edge .
Monkeys , large monitor lizards , and squirrels find their niche on the beach near the cave .
Bridges , trails , and boats provide access to the park and the underground river , and some accommodation and camping facilities are provided .
The Puerto Princesa Underground River is included in the 28 finalist to become the New Seven Wonders of Nature .
The New 7 Wonders of Nature or N7WN are untouched natural wonders which have had no human intervention .
People of the world will then have approximately 2 years to vote among the 21 Finalists for the Official New 7 Wonders of Nature , to be revealed in 2011 .
So , whatever kind of traveler you are : a trekker , a tourist or a mere adventure - lover , you must never miss this World Heritage Site .
This should be part of your itinerary .

HE is one of Britain 's best - loved celebrity chefs but Jamie Oliver was reduced to tears after his attempt to cook up a war against fat in the States was angrily rebuffed by locals , a new US TV series airing this week shows .
In Jamie Oliver 's Food Revolution , the self - styled health guru kicked off the series by travelling to Huntington , West Virginia recently named as the unhealthiest city in America with the highest rate of diabetes .
Hot on the success of his UK reality series , which saw Oliver transform the British school food program , he confidently pledged to " inspire and show America that just a little effort makes a massive difference . "
However , the city 's adult population , nearly half of whom are considered obese , were far from keen to be preached to on the topic of healthy eating .
In one clip of the show , which ran a preview on Sunday , a talk show host at a local radio station is seen berating a stunned Oliver , commenting : " We do n't want to sit around eating lettuce all day .
Who made you king ? "
" I thought miserable bastards like that only existed in England , " Oliver moaned to the cameras afterwards .
His attempts to motivate were yet again thwarted when he visited an elementary school which served pizza to their students for breakfast .
" In all my years , I 've never seen pizza served for breakfast , " Oliver said , as the canteen chefs insisted they thought it was a nutritious meal .
Eventually , Oliver , famed for his can - do attitude and celebrity clients including Brad Pitt , is seen sobbing , " they do n't understand me , they do n't know why I 'm here " .
The preview met with mixed reviews in US media , but a commentary in the New York Post commended " blue - collar English bloke " Oliver 's persistence in the face of " mean and downright scary " city residents .
Lobbyists enjoyed record revenues while the rest of the country was struggling amid a deep recession , according to a report out Friday .
Last year saw a more than 5 percent increase in lobbying expenditures as compared to 2008 , said a new report released Friday by the Center for Responsive Politics , a campaign finance watchdog .

More than $ 3.47 billion was spent on lobbying in 2009 , about $ 170 million more than in 2008 , according to the watchdog ’s analysis .
“ Lobbying appears recession - proof , ” said Sheila Krumholz , the center 's executive director , in a statement .
“ Even when companies are scaling back other operations , many view lobbying as a critical tool in protecting their future interests , particularly when Congress is preparing to take action on issues that could seriously affect their bottom lines . ”
Lobbyists have said business for them managed to remain upbeat throughout 2009 despite the poor economy because of the Obama administration ’s aggressive legislative agenda .
With expanded Democratic majorities on Capitol Hill from the 2008 election , the White House pushed sweeping bills to reform the healthcare industry , tackle climate change and bring Wall Street under control .
None of that ambitious legislation has come to fruition yet , but President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE and other Democrats will want to finish those bills this year , so expect a busy 2010 for lobbying as well .
The healthcare debate took up much of the oxygen in Washington last year .
So not surprisingly , the pharmaceutical and health products industry spent a record amount last year — close to $ 266.8 million — on federal lobbying .
That is the biggest lobbying expenditure ever by a single industry in one year , according to the report .
The report appears to tracks with an analysis by The Hill last month that showed at least 18 of the top 25 lobbying firms saw their revenue increase from 2008 to 2009 .
Perennial powerhouses Patton Boggs and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld topped the list , but The Hill ’s analysis also showed remarkable growth for the Podesta Group , Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck and Holland & Knight during the recession .

A while back I had the opportunity to interview one of our greatest living novelists — Haruki Murakami .
He spoke for about an hour at the midtown offices of his publisher , Random House .
At the time , Murakami had just released and was promoting his fourteenth book , After Dark .
We did n’t meet to discuss the novel , though .
Instead we talked about the transcendent possibilities of great fiction .
When I asked him about his favorite book of the past fifty years , here ’s how he responded .
[ #image : / photos / 5582927ae52bc4b477a99a46 ] ||| Never Let Me Go.jpg | ||
My favorite book of the past fifty years is Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro .
I read all of Ishiguro ’s books , every book he publishes I read .
It ’s a routine .
But Never Let Me
Go is my favorite .
It tells the story of three children who grow up sheltered from the rest of society at a boarding school in the English countryside .
I do n’t want to talk too much about the plot , but I will say that it ’s a very sad story .
And a prophetic story .
I had lunch with Ishiguro several years ago .
He told me that he was almost finished with a new book .
He would n’t tell me the title , though .
We talked mostly about music .
He likes jazz very much , and so do I .
And he asked me if I know of any good Japanese jazz musicians .
I said , ’ Yeah , I know somebody .
I ’ll bring the CD to your hotel .
And I brought the disc , which was called " Never Let Me Go . " I guess it was a coincidence .
I was living in Cambridge [ England ] when Never Let Me Go was published .
I read the book in English , which is my second language .
It took me four or five days because I had to read it very carefully .
But if it had been written in Japanese I would have read it in a single sitting .
This book carried me somewhere else .
A good book can do that .
It ’s a physical feeling , like I was squeezed by some force .
It ’s a feeling I love .
When I was a kid , I was moved so many times .
When you grow old , those occasions become rare .
But this book gave me that feeling .
It ’s a physical feeling .
I love the feeling .
It also gave me the feeling of being isolated .
Your soul , your mind should be isolated sometimes .
You need that .
I need that .
And I get that from this book .
It ’s serene , it ’s beautiful , and it ’s scary .
America , he insisted , had " gone the way of the Brokeback Mountain , " before adding : " God 's wrath is upon this nation .
And he 's pouring out that wrath by killing these soldiers and maiming these soldiers in Iraq and sending them back in body bags .
And it 's only going to get worse . "
Though we " met " by way of a cable television connection , I remember how disturbed his fiery eyes left me .
Gas prices near $ 3 a gallon
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gas prices continued to climb higher , rising for a fifth consecutive day and coming closer to $ 3 a gallon .
The average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline rose slightly on Sunday to $ 2.747 , from $ 2.743 the day before , according to motorist group AAA .
Nationwide , gas prices have increased eight cents over the last five days .
Prices were highest in the state of Alaska , at $ 3.373 a gallon , AAA reported .
They were cheapest in Wyoming , at an average $ 2.494 a gallon .
The national average gas price is now higher than it was at any point in 2009 .
But prices are still down $ 1.45 , or 35 % , from the record high price of $ 4.114 that AAA reported on July 17 , 2008 .
Gas prices have been rising recently as the price of crude oil has pushed higher .
Last week , oil averaged about $ 82.30 a barrel , barely below a 14 - month high .
Oil prices have been supported by frigid temperatures across much of North America and Europe , which has increased demand for heating fuels .
Some analysts say pump prices could top $ 3 a gallon in the weeks ahead if crude prices rise near $ 90 a barrel .

UPDATED : The 153 - page bill makes a number of changes to the Senate bill .
The highlights :
-- Increases the tax credits for middle - income families who buy insurance .
-- Reduces the penalty for not buying insurance from $ 750 to $ 695 .
But the bill also requires some people to pay a share of their income as a penalty and that number was raised from 2 percent to 2.5 percent .
-- It closes the gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage by 2011 and gives seniors who fall into the gap this year a $ 250 rebate .
-- It eliminates the Cornhusker Kickback and covers 100 percent of the increased Medicaid costs of all states until 2016 and decreases each year thereafter .
-- Requires that doctors that care for Medicaid patients be reimbursed at the full rate .
-- Spends $ 250 million to fight waste , fraud and abuse .
-- Delays and blunts the tax on high - end insurance plans in keeping with the deal Democrats struck with the labor unions .
However , it does lower the index at which plans will be taxed , making it likely that more plans will be affected over time .
-- Imposes a Medicare tax on unearned income for families making more than $ 250,000 .
-- Includes student loan reform .

The news that a tenth of all cooking oil used in China may be made from recycled sewage and laced with toxic contaminants has stunned China .
Originating from a report on a state radio station , the news that “ Chinese are eating 3,000,000 tons of ‘ recycled cooking oil ’ each year , but it is 100 times more toxic than arsenic ! ” spread throughout China in a matter of days .
The cooking oil is apparently “ recycled ” from raw sewage taken from sewers and elsewhere , which is heated and filtered .
After filtration the liquid is transparent and free of particulate matter , and can be rendered into cooking oil .
Fears over the toxicity of the recycled oil are high .
Significant levels of aflatoxins have been detected , a poison said to be “ 100 times more toxic than arsenic , ” and known to cause growth defects in children and cancer .
Viral and bacterial contaminants are thought not to be a problem , assuming the sewage - oil is properly boiled in preparation .
Despite the obvious hygiene and safety problems of using treated sewage in cooking , its usage is thought to be widespread , as the “ recycled ” cooking oil is all but indistinguishable from normal cooking oil , in all but one aspect – its price .
It costs only 300 yuan ( $ 45 ) a ton to manufacture , half the price of regular oil , and it is said to be common use throughout China – estimates are that it constitutes a tenth of all cooking oil used in China .
Chinese food safety regulators , such as they are , launched an immediate emergency investigation , although it is not clear if they actually previously approved the activity .
China ’s record on food safety is of course already utterly abysmal , but if as widespread as reported this could turn out to be the most damaging scandal to date , as cooking oil is an integral part of food preparation in China .
Nations importing cheap cooked foodstuffs from China may also be concerned that they have been inadvertently poisoning their children by trading with a nation in which regulation and business ethics are all but unknown .
Greetings celebratory Fold !

So , for his birthday , here ’s the challenge :
Summarize your favorite episode of Gilligan ’s Island or Stargate SG - 1 for JB ’s reading pleasure ( if he even reads this .
I ’d never know because he ’s not decent enough to ever comment ) .
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JB !

You ’re in traffic , and another driver cuts you off .
Someone asks an innocent question , but it somehow leads to raised voices .
A
At a press conference yesterday , researchers announced the completely unexpected : a Siberian cave has yielded evidence of an entirely unknown human relative that appears to have shared Asia with both modern humans and Neanderthals less than 50,000 years ago .
The find comes courtesy of a single bone from individual 's hand .
Lest you think that paleontologists are overinterpreting a tiny fragment , it was n't the shape of the bone that indicates the presence of a new species — it was the DNA that it contained .
The paper that describes the finding comes courtesy of the Max Planck Institute 's Svante Pääbo , who has been actively pursuing the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome .
It seems likely that this particular bone fragment was targeted due to suspicions that it might also provide an additional Neanderthal sequence .
The site , called Denisova , is in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia , an area that has had hominins present as early as 125,000 years ago .
The sample itself came from a layer of material that dates from between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago .
Neanderthal DNA was found in a sample from the same time period less than 100 km away , while artifacts indicate that modern humans were also present in the region by 40,000 years ago .
So , there was no apparent reason to suspect that the bone would yield anything more than a familiar sequence .
And in fact , most of the first half of the paper simply describes the methods used to construct a complete sequence of the mitochondrial DNA , including over 150 - fold coverage of the genome , and an alignment program designed to account for the errors typical of ancient DNA sequences .
About the only surprise here is that Pääbo 's group has switched from using 454 sequencing machines to those made by Illumina .
Various checks indicate that the sequence the authors obtained contains damage that 's typical of ancient DNA , and that it all comes from a single individual .
So far , quite typical .
Things got quite unusual when they attempted to align the sequence to the mitochondrial DNA from the hominin species that were likely to be present at that time and place : human and Neanderthal .
Instead of clustering with one or the other , the Denisova mitochondrial genome was a clear outlier , having about 385 differences with the typical human mitochondrial genome .
In contrast , Neanderthals only differ from modern humans by an average of 202 .
The obvious interpretation is that the Denisova lineage split off before modern humans and Neanderthals did .
If we accept that Neanderthals are a distinct species of hominin ( and we do ) , then this sample clearly represents yet another one .
Building a tree with the chimpanzee genomes and assuming a divergence time of 6 million years , the data indicates that the Denisova lineage diverged about a million years ago .
At that point , Homo Erectus was already a global species , but our human ancestors were still in Africa .
That suggests that the Denisova variant probably originated in , or at least near , Africa as well , although there 's no way to tell whether it was a distinct species before it started migrating , or whether it became an isolated population because of a migration .
The paper is in the format of a Nature letter , which allows only a paragraph for discussion .
The authors use that space primarily to note that , 40,000 years ago , southern Siberia was a very busy place as far as hominins are concerned , with at least three different species present within a very narrow time frame .
If we accept that the Indonesian hobbits are yet another distinct species — and the relevant community seems to be leaning that way — then it appears that there were at least four distinct hominin species cohabiting the globe in the very recent past .
As surprising as that is , it 's only a small fraction of the implications of this work .
For starters , there 's the whole idea that we can identify a new species without having any idea what it actually looked like — in fact , without having any idea of whether it would be physically distinct enough from any of the other hominin species around that we 'd even have known it were a separate species based on the bones .
The authors also briefly touched on a separate issue : this ability will be unevenly distributed in space and time .
DNA simply lasts longer in cool climates , as evidenced by the recent announcement that DNA had been obtained from a polar bear sample that was over 100,000 years old .
So , any species that was stuck near the equator — like the hobbits — are unlikely to be in on the DNA revolution .
This is especially unfortunate given the fact that , as noted above , a lot of the most interesting action in hominin origins seem to have been taking place in Africa .
Then there 's the whole question of what else we might be missing .
Avoiding contamination issues with modern DNA is easiest if the entire excavation is designed around a sterile technique from the start , meaning bones that have been previously excavated are n't ideal .
At the moment , at least , sequencing from a single sample is also pretty labor intensive ( this paper had seven authors ) , meaning we are n't likely to be able to just start sequencing any bone fragments we stumble across .
Figuring out how to prioritize what might be informative will be a real challenge .
If that seems like a lot of questions for a short and fairly technical paper ( and it is ) , it 's a product of the fact that this paper seems truly exceptional .
Because of the rich history of most fields of science , there are n't a whole lot of truly unexpected results , since you typically know that there are people working in a given area .
But this finding is truly a stunning one , and really seems to be a complete surprise .

Why is the national security community treating the " Enemy Belligerent , Interrogation , Detention , and Prosecution Act of 2010 , " introduced by Sens.
John McCain and Joseph Lieberman on Thursday as a standard proposal , as a simple response to the administration 's choices in the aftermath of the Christmas Day bombing attempt ?
A close reading of the bill suggests it would allow the U.S. military to detain U.S. citizens without trial indefinitely in the U.S. based on suspected activity .
Read the bill here , and then read the summarized points after the jump .
According to the summary , the bill sets out a comprehensive policy for the detention , interrogation and trial of suspected enemy belligerents who are believed to have engaged in hostilities against the United States by requiring these individuals to be held in military custody , interrogated for their intelligence value and not provided with a Miranda warning .
( There is no distinction between U.S. persons -- visa holders or citizens -- and non-U.S. persons . )
It would require these " belligerents " to be coded as " high - value detainee [s ] " to be held in military custody and interrogated for their intelligence value by a High - Value Detainee Interrogation Team established by the president .
( The H.I.G. , of course , was established to bring a sophisticated interrogation capacity to the federal justice system . )
Any suspected unprivileged enemy belligerents considered a " high - value detainee " shall not be provided with a Miranda warning .
The bill asks the President to determine criteria for designating an individual as a " high - value detainee " if he / she : ( 1 ) poses a threat of an attack on civilians or civilian facilities within the U.S. or U.S. facilities abroad ; ( 2 ) poses a threat to U.S. military personnel or U.S. military facilities ; ( 3 ) potential intelligence value ; ( 4 ) is a member of al Qaeda or a terrorist group affiliated with al Qaeda or ( 5 ) such other matters as the President considers appropriate .
The President must submit the regulations and guidance to the appropriate committees of Congress no later than 60 days after enactment .
To the extent possible , the High - Value Detainee Interrogation Team must make a preliminary determination whether the detainee is an unprivileged enemy belligerent within 48 hours of taking detainee into custody .
The High - Value Detainee Interrogation Team must submit its determination to the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General after consultation with the Director of National Intelligence , the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency .
The Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General make a final determination and report the determination to the President and the appropriate committees of Congress .
In the case of any disagreement between the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General , the President will make the determination .
Note that the president himself does n't get to make the call .

Directed Panspermia : Seeding the Galaxy
Panspermia , the idea that life might travel through space to seed other planets and even other star systems , is a fascinating topic for conjecture , and our understanding of the survival of various forms of life in extreme environments only adds to its appeal .
But just as SETI has an active counterpart that seeks to send rather than simply receive interstellar messages , so panspermia has its own advocates for a new kind of mission :
To seed the stars from Earth .
A group called SOLIS ( Society for Life in Space ) has sprung up around the notion .
Its goal :
To propagate our family of organic Life throughout the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond .
We propose to seed young planetary systems in star - forming interstellar clouds .
We shall design and launch directed panspermia missions carrying the microbial representatives of Life by the year 2050 .
So says the SOLIS Web site and so says society coordinator Michael Mautner , who is a research professor in chemistry at Virginia Commonwealth University .
Mautner has in the past worked with solar sail expert Gregory Matloff on propulsion systems that would make it possible to seed new solar systems and has written up the idea for the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society .
Now he offers a new paper for the Journal of Cosmology that focuses on what he believes to be our obligation to proceed with directed panspermia , ensuring that life does not come to an end .
Panspermia as Obligation
In a short article at Physorg.com , Mautner states his premise :
“ We have a moral obligation to plan for the propagation of life , and even the transfer of human life to other solar systems which can be transformed via microbial activity , thereby preparing these worlds to develop and sustain complex life .
Securing that future for life can give our human existence a cosmic purpose . ”
The idea is that once we have identified planets with conditions suitable for life ( and protoplanetary situations where life might one day develop ) , we should send organisms to seed these worlds as a way of accelerating local processes of evolution .
Even the arrival of such a payload onto a comet or asteroid in a distant planetary system could pave the way for its eventual transportation to a habitable planet by local panspermia , in much the same way that material from Mars has occasionally made its way to Earth .
From accretion disks and interstellar clouds to planets identified by Kepler as being in the habitable zone of their stars , the list of targets should be extensive .
The propulsion challenge is less of a problem than you might think , for Mautner is in no hurry to get there .
Solar sail methods might take hundreds of thousands or even millions of years to deliver their payload , but the idea is long - term survival of life .
Capsules containing about 100,000 microorganisms each and weighing 0.1 micrograms would be the delivery mechanism .
Ethics Among the Stars
All of which leads us to the ethical dilemma .
How do we choose our targets so as not to disturb already existing life ?
Mautner considers this in his paper ( internal references omitted for brevity ) :
Can panspermia missions perturb existing extraterrestrial life ?
At present , there is no conclusive scientific evidence for extraterrestrial life ; though admittedly not all scientists share this opinion …
Every living cell needs thousands of complex components as DNA , proteins and membranes , and the probability of these components coming together to originate life may be very small even on billions of planets …
If we still detect extraterrestrial life , we can avoid these targets .
In any case , we can target new solar systems where life could not have evolved yet .
We may seed a few hundred new solar systems , that will secure the future of our family of gene / protein life but will leave all the other hundred billion stars in the galaxy and their possible indigenous life unperturbed .
Yes , we can target locations where life is not likely to have already evolved , but how accurate can our assessments be given the constraints of current observational technology ?
Moreover , even that approach leads to potential problems .
Panspermia assumes movement of life ’s building blocks and even life itself through space .
Seed a planetary system with life and it could be millions of years before that life moved from an asteroid in the system to a planet in the habitable zone , one that in the interval had developed life forms of its own .
We can never be sure we are not displacing local life .
Mautner thinks even this scenario is not a showstopper :
If there is local life there that is fundamentally different , it will not be affected ; if it is gene / protein life , it may be enriched and we can induce higher evolution .
The new biospheres may prepare the way for human colonization if interstellar human travel becomes possible .
Which Life Survives ?
But I ’m thinking that sending cyanobacteria to other star systems to consume toxins and pump out oxygen is a dangerous form of meddling because it assumes that forms of life related to our biosphere are the ones that should survive .
Ian O’Neill has an amusing but pointed take on this in a recent post :
If our life takes hold of a planet where another life had the opportunity to evolve into an interstellar civilization in a couple of billions of years time , would n’t we be in violation of some kind of cosmic anti-monopoly regulation ( or at least in violation of the Prime Directive ) ?
And there ’s another thing to ponder :
What if “ life ” is the universal equivalent of some kind of infection .
Is life rare because the universe has a very strong immune system ?
Firing our genetic code far and wide could be considered to be biological pollution .
I ’m all for spreading the human influence around the galaxy , but I think this can only be considered if we physically go to these alien worlds , to evaluate these places in person before we start setting up home .
Blindly sending life from Earth to habitable worlds and planet - forming accretion disks seems a little reckless , especially as we have no clue about the consequences if we started impregnating unsuspecting planets .
As we await results from Kepler and more from CoRoT , we still have no realistic assessment of the number of terrestrial planets around stars in our galaxy , nor do we have spectroscopic data that can tell us whether or not such worlds bear life .
Is the meaning of life wrapped up in self - propagation , as Mautner ’s paper suggests ?
If so , then pushing life from our biosphere outward is simply fulfilling our basic purpose .
But perhaps there is more to life , including the ethical responsibility to let life take its own directions in those niches where it has already taken hold .
I ’m not persuaded by a panbiotic ethics that does n’t take into account the huge gaps in our knowledge about how and where life may form .

[ This article is excerpted from Society Without Coercion . ]
The belief that government is necessary to ensure social order is a pure superstition , based upon a psycho- epistemological process different in no important respect from the belief in goblins and witches ....
At the outset , let it be made clear that government is nothing but men acting in concert .
The morality and value of government , like any other association of men , will be no greater and no less than the morality and value of the men comprising it .
Since government is nothing but men , its inherent authority to act is in no way greater or different than the authority to act of individuals in isolation .
If it is moral for government policemen to arrest suspect criminals , it is also moral for " private policemen " to do so .
If it is moral for government to try and imprison men , then it is also moral for nongovernmental corporations to do so .
Government has no magic powers or authority not possessed by private individuals .
Let he who asserts that government may do that which the individual may not assume the onus of proof and demonstrate his contention .
The basic reason why a social order could , and would , arise in the absence of governments ( as they are known today ) is the fact that man has an objective need for social order and protection from initiatory force .
This objective need would create human associations producing order in society .
The morality and permanence of these associations will be determined by the morality and rationality of the men creating and working in them , as is the case for any social institution .
Perhaps the strongest attack on " anarchism " — certainly the most vitriolic — was made by Ayn Rand .
In her article on " The Nature of Government , " she states the following :
A recent variant of anarchistic theory , which is befuddling some of the younger advocates of freedom , is a weird absurdity called " competing governments . "
Accepting the basic premise of the modern statists — who see no difference between the functions of government and the functions of industry , between force and production , and who advocate government ownership of business — the proponents of " competing governments " take the other side of the same coin and declare that since competition is so beneficial to business it should also be applied to government .
Instead of a single , monopolistic government , they declare , there should be a number of governments in the same geographical area , competing for the allegiance of individual citizens , with every citizen free to " shop " and to patronize whatever government he chooses .
Remember that forcible restraint of men is the only service a government has to offer .
Ask yourself what a competition in forcible restraint would have to mean .
One cannot call this theory a contradiction in terms , since it is obviously devoid of any understanding of the terms " competition " and " government . "
Nor can one call it a floating abstraction , since it is devoid of any contact with or reference to reality and cannot be concretized at all , not even roughly or approximately .
One illustration will be sufficient : suppose Mr. Smith , a customer of Government A , suspects that his next - door neighbor , Mr. Jones , a customer of Government B , has robbed him ; a squad of Police A proceeds to Mr. Jones ' house and is met at the door by a squad of Police B , who declare that they do not accept the validity of Mr. Smith 's complaint and do not recognize the authority of Government A . What happens then ?
You take it from there .
Once one gets past Miss Rand 's typically vitriolic rhetoric ( which only indicates that Miss Rand is quite hostile to what she mislabels as " competing governments " ) one finds that she has essentially one argument .
Miss Rand asserts that what is properly designated as " competing agencies of retaliatory force " or a free market of justice would not work , because the competing agencies would end up protecting criminals and shooting it out with each other .
One can only term this a straw man argument .
The situation which Miss Rand " describes " is patently absurd .
If competing agencies of retaliatory force protected criminals , they would not be competing agencies of retaliatory force at all .
Rather , they would be criminal gangs , plain and simple .
Further , it would be sheer insanity for individuals " subscribing " to competing criminal gangs to live on the same " turf . "
In this respect , Miss Rand is correct .
However , what I and every other advocate of a society without coercion are advocating are not " competing governments " ( a misnomer ) or " competing criminal gangs " ( an ethical monstrosity ) , but " competing agencies of retaliatory force , " which Miss Rand has in fact not dealt with at all .
In the situation described above , in which neighbors subscribed to competing police departments , what is certain ( if they were in fact police departments operating on the basis of objective law , rather than criminal gangs operating on the basis of mob rule — which is what Miss Rand described ) is that Police B would accept the validity of Police A , or in fact the validity of any reputable police department , and cooperate with them in the arrest of Mr. Jones .
Police B certainly would not protect Mr. Jones from justice if there was objective evidence that Mr. Jones had committed a crime , nor would Police A proceed to attempt to arrest Mr. Jones unless there were such evidence .
In this manner , objective law would eliminate coercive " shootouts . "
Once competing police departments begin to function , standard operating procedures would be created to deal with such cases .
At least two possible procedures come to mind : either by stipulation , the police department to which a man subscribed would be the only one which could incarcerate him ; or , by stipulation , the police department where the complaint was filed would incarcerate him .
In the extreme , there would be little motivation for policemen to put their lives on the line for a suspected thief , and if competing police departments operated as Miss Rand falsely pictures , then they would quickly go out of business due to the attrition rate of policemen killed in the " line of duty . "
This is only one of the flaws of Miss Rand 's argument .
Other problems include her failure to explain exactly how government can morally outlaw competing agencies of retaliatory force , or what it is that prevents the state police from shooting it out with the county police in similar situations .
Clearly , both Miss Rand 's premises and logic are in error in this case .
BAGHDAD , Iraq , Dec. 13 - Less than two days before nationwide elections , the Iraqi border police seized a tanker on Tuesday that had just crossed from Iran filled with thousands of forged ballots , an official at the Interior Ministry said .
The tanker was seized in the evening by agents with the American - trained border protection force at the Iraqi town of Badra , after crossing at Munthirya on the Iraqi border , the official said .
According to the Iraqi official , the border police found several thousand partly completed ballots inside .
The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly , said the Iranian truck driver told the police under interrogation that at least three other trucks filled with ballots had crossed from Iran at different spots along the border .
The official , who did not attend the interrogation , said he did not know where the driver was headed , or what he intended to do with the ballots .
