How much money can you make growing weed ?
Growing weed is lucrative , as you may already know .
But just how lucrative ?
How much money can you for instance make with a spare room ?
Remember some UK police forces have pretty much claimed they are no longer pursuing small scale cannabis growers .
There are even cannabis clubs operating with the agreement of progressive thinking local police .
A program on the BBC ‘ hash in the attic ‘ revealed all .
This is quite an old program now so you can probably add a little to the projected income figures .
You could have 3 or 4 plants in a wardrobe , generating £ 2-300 every 3 or 4 months .
Using a spare room you can generate £ 10 - 15 k ( $ 16 - 24 k ) ever year .
You could generate 1 kilo every ten weeks , selling a little to friends ( that ’s what the program said ! )
If you used a whole house you could have 5 crops per year at around £ 15 k per crop – adding up to a pretty massive £ 70 k ( $ 116 k ) per year .
Industrial operations can easily make £ 400 k ( $ 663 k ) per year .
That would be generating 30 - 50 kilos per crop .
Each crop could be worth around £ 120k .
Another interesting fact the program brought up was that 1900 cannabis plants can make a huge £ 500 k ( $ 829 k ) every eight weeks !
And it ’s so easy to buy your own cannabis seeds !
Maybe they are trying to tell us something .
Development in the 21st Century
I would like to start today with a story about America that often goes untold .
It ’s the story of what can happen around the world when American know - how , American dollars , and American values are put to work to change people ’s lives .
Like many of you , I have seen the transformative power of development and the passion and commitment of aid workers who devote their careers to this difficult work .
I have seen it in a village in Indonesia , where new mothers and their infants received nutritional and medical counseling through a family planning program supported by our government .
In Nicaragua , where poor women started small businesses in their barrio with help from a U.S - backed microfinance project .
In the West Bank , where students are learning English today through a program that we sponsor .
In South Africa , where our development assistance is helping bring anti-retrovirals to areas ravaged by HIV and AIDS .
I have also traveled across this country and heard farmers , factory workers , teachers , nurses , students , and hard - working mothers and fathers wonder why the United States is spending taxpayer dollars to improve the lives of people in the developing world when there is so much hardship here at home .
That ’s a fair question — one that I ’d like to address today :
Why development in other countries matters to the American people and to our nation ’s security and prosperity .
The United States seeks a safer , more prosperous , more democratic , and more equitable world .
We can not be assured of that progress when one - third of humankind live in conditions that offer them little chance of building better lives for themselves or their children .
We cannot stop terrorism or defeat the ideologies of violent extremism when hundreds of millions of young people see a future with no jobs , no hope , and no way ever to catch up to the developed world .
We cannot build a stable global economy when hundreds of millions of workers and families find themselves on the wrong side of globalization , cut off from markets and out of reach of modern technologies .
We cannot rely on regional partners to help us stop conflicts and counter global criminal networks when those countries are struggling to stabilize and secure their own societies .
We cannot advance democracy and human rights when hunger and poverty threaten to undermine the good governance and rule of law needed to make rights real .
We cannot stop global pandemics until billions of people gain access to better health care , and we cannot address climate change or scarcer resources until billions gain access to greener energy and sustainable livelihoods .
Development was once the province of humanitarians , charities , and governments looking to gain allies in global struggles .
Today it is a strategic , economic , and moral imperative — as central to advancing American interests and solving global problems as diplomacy or defense .
Because development is indispensable , it demands a new approach .
For too long , our work has been riven by conflict and controversy .
Differences of opinion over where and how to pursue development have hardened into entrenched , almost theological , positions that hinder progress and hold us back .
These stand - offs are n’t fair to the experts who put their lives on the line doing their work .
And they are n’t fair to the American taxpayers who , by and large , want to do good in the world , so long as their money does n’t go to waste .
It ’s time for a new mindset for a new century .
Time to retire old debates and replace dogmatic attitudes with clear reasoning and common sense .
And time to elevate development as a central pillar of our foreign policy and to rebuild USAID into the world ’s premier development agency .
The challenges we face are numerous .
So we must be selective and strategic about where and how we get involved .
But whether it ’s to improve long - term security in places torn apart by conflict , like Afghanistan , or to further progress in countries that are on their way to becoming regional anchors of stability , like Tanzania , we pursue development for the same reasons : to improve lives , fight poverty , expand rights and opportunities , strengthen communities , and secure democratic institutions and governance ; and in doing so , advance global stability , improve our own security , and project our values and leadership in the world .
A new mindset means a new commitment to results .
Development is a long - term endeavor ; none of the changes we seek will happen overnight .
To keep moving in the right direction , we must evaluate our progress and have the courage to rethink our strategies if we ’re falling short .
We must not simply add up the dollars we spend or the number of programs we run , but measure the results — the lasting changes that those dollars and programs have helped achieve .
And we must share the proof of our progress with the public .
The elementary school teacher in Detroit trying to send her kids to college and the firefighter in Houston working hard to support his family are funding our work .
They deserve to know that when we spend their tax dollars , we ’re getting results .
We must also be honest that , in some situations , we will invest in places that are strategically critical but where we are not guaranteed success .
In countries that are incubators of extremism , like Yemen , or are ravaged by poverty and natural disasters , like Haiti , the odds are long .
But the cost of doing nothing is potentially far greater .
We must accept that our development model cannot be formulaic — that what works in Pakistan may not work in Peru .
So our approach must be case by case and country by country — analyzing needs , assessing opportunities , and tailoring our investments and our partnerships in a way that maximizes the impact of our efforts and dollars .
Two important reviews of our nation ’s development policy are now underway : the inaugural Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review , led by officials from USAID and the State Department ; and the Presidential Study Directive on U.S. Global Development Policy , which is led by the White House and includes representatives from the more than 15 agencies that contribute to our global development mission .
As these reviews are completed and recommendations are sent to the president , new ideas and approaches will be refined .
In the meantime , I ’d like to share a few of the ways in which we are already taking steps to make sure that development delivers lasting results for the American people and people worldwide .
First , we are adopting a model of development based , as President Obama has said , on partnership , not patronage .
In the past , we have sometimes dictated solutions from afar , often missing our mark on the ground .
Our new approach is to work in partnership with the people in developing countries by investing in evidence - based strategies with clear goals that the countries have taken the lead in designing and implementing .
This kind of rights - respecting development , built on consultation rather than decree , is more likely to engender the local leadership necessary to turn good ideas into lasting results .
True partnership is based on shared responsibility .
We want partners who have demonstrated a commitment to development by practicing good governance , rooting out corruption , and making their own financial contributions to development programs .
We expect our partners to practice sound economic policies , including levying taxes on those who can afford them , just as we do ; or , in countries rich in natural resources , managing those resources sustainably and devoting some of the profits to development .
The American taxpayer cannot pick up the tab for those who are able but unwilling to help themselves .
Some might say it is risky to share control with countries that have n’t had much success developing on their own .
But we know that many countries have the will to develop , but not the capacity .
That ’s something we can help them build .
One approach is that of the Millennium Challenge Corporation , which focuses on countries that have met rigorous criteria , from upholding political rights and the rule of law to controlling inflation and investing in girls ’ education .
Under MCC compacts , we provide funding and technical support ; the country provides the plan and leads the way toward achieving it .
Early indications of the program are promising .
We ’re using our resources to help countries cultivate their ability to build their own future .
This approach points to the difference between aid and investment .
Through aid , we supply what is needed to the people who need it — be it sacks of rice , cartons of medicines , or millions of dollars to fill a budget shortfall .
But through investment , we seek to break the cycle of dependence that aid can create by helping countries build their own institutions and their own capacity to deliver essential services .
Aid chases need ; investment chases opportunity .
This is not to say that the United States is abandoning aid .
It is still a vital tool , especially as an emergency response .
But through strategic investments in programs like the Millennium Challenge Corporation , we hope to one day put ourselves out of the aid business , because countries will no longer need this kind of help .
Our commitment to partnership extends not only to the countries where we work , but to other countries and organizations working there as well .
New countries are emerging as important contributors to global development , including China , Brazil , and India — nations with the opportunity to play a key role , and with the responsibility to support sustainable solutions .
Long - time leaders like Japan , the United Kingdom , Canada , the Netherlands , Sweden , and Norway continue to reach billions through their long - standing work in dozens of countries .
Multilateral organizations like the World Bank , the IMF , the UN Development Program , and the Global Fund have the reach and resources to do what countries working alone cannot , along with valuable expertise in infrastructure , health , and finance initiatives .
Non-profits like the Gates Foundation , CARE , Oxfam International , and the Clinton Foundation bring their own resources , deep knowledge , extensive networks , and commitment to humanitarian missions that complement our work in critical ways .
And private businesses are able to reach large numbers of people in a way that ’s economically sustainable , because they bring to bear the power of markets .
Companies like Starbucks , which has worked to create supply chains from coffee - growing communities in the developing world that promote better environmental practices and better prices for farmers ; or Unilever / Hindustan , which has created soap and hygiene products that the very poor — long - overlooked by business — can afford .
Engaging in partnerships with countries and organizations like these will open up opportunities and increase our impact .
Second , we are working to integrate development more closely with defense and diplomacy in the field .
I know that the word " integration " sets off alarm bells .
There is a concern that integrating development means diluting it or politicizing it — giving up our long - term development goals to achieve short - term objectives or handing over more of the work of development to our diplomats or defense experts .
That is not what we will do .
What we will do is leverage the expertise of our diplomats and military on behalf of development , and vice versa .
The three Ds must be mutually reinforcing .
The experience and technical knowledge that our development experts bring to their work are irreplaceable .
Whether trained in agriculture , public health , education , or economics , our experts are the face , brains , heart , and soul of U.S. development worldwide .
They take our ideas , dollars , and commitment and turn them into real and lasting change in people ’s lives .
Some of the most transformative figures in the history of development represent the convergence between development and diplomacy .
People like Norman Borlaug , the father of the Green Revolution ; Jim Grant , whose global immunization campaigns saved millions of children ; and Wangari Maathai , whose Green Belt Movement has planted millions of trees in Kenya and trained thousands of women to be leaders in conservation .
These development giants combined outstanding technical expertise with a passionate belief in the power of their ideas .
They did whatever it took to convince at times reluctant leaders to join them , and as a result , helped build and lead national and regional movements for change .
Today , we have many such " development diplomats " working at USAID .
They embody the integration between development and diplomacy that , when allowed to exist , can amplify both of these disciplines .
For example , development projects can be stalled or stymied by too little support from leaders — particularly programs that target marginalized populations , like people with HIV , women , or refugees .
In those cases , our diplomats can help make the difference .
They have the access and leverage to convince government ministers to give these development programs their support .
Development also furthers a key goal of our diplomatic efforts : to advance democracy and human rights worldwide .
I remember vividly my visit some years ago the village of Saam Njaay in Senegal , where a former Peace Corps volunteer , Molly Melching , set up a village - based NGO called Tostan .
And through Tostan ’s projects , women in the village began speaking out about the health consequences and pain of female genital mutilation , an accepted practice there .
This collective awakening led to a village - wide discussion and soon the village voted to end the practice .
Men from Saam NJaay traveled to other villages to explain why FGM was bad for women and girls — and by extension , their families and communities — and other villages banned it too .
A grassroots political movement grew and eventually the government passed a law banning the practice nationwide .
Sadly , enforcement has been harder to achieve because cultural norms are so entrenched .
But the larger point is that the experience in this village demonstrates how development , democracy , and human rights can and must be mutually reinforcing .
Democratic governance reinforces development , and development can help secure democratic gains .
So those who truly care about making human rights a reality know that development is an integral part of that agenda .
Development is also critical to the success of our defense missions , particularly where poverty and failed governments contribute to instability .
Consider the situation in Afghanistan .
Many people ask whether any development programs can succeed there .
The answer is yes .
The World Bank , for example , supports a reconstruction and rural infrastructure initiative called the National Solidarity Program , which has made progress even in that challenging environment .
Through the program , more than 18,000 Community Development Councils have been elected and more than 15,000 infrastructure projects have been completed .
Progress is difficult .
But it is possible .
That is why , as we prepare to send 30,000 new American troops , along with several thousand troops from our allies in NATO and the International Security Force , we are also tripling the number of civilians on the ground .
They include agriculture experts who will help farmers develop new crops , so they do n’t have to grow opium poppies , and education experts who will help make schooling more accessible to girls so they can become pillars of their country ’s future progress .
The work of these development experts helps make future military action more remote .
It is much cheaper to pay for development up front than to pay for war over the long run .
And in Afghanistan and elsewhere , U.S. troops are helping to provide the security that allows development to take root .
In places torn apart by sectarianism or violent extremism , long - term development gains are far less likely .
In the past , coordination between the Three Ds has often fallen short , and everyone has borne the consequences .
Secretary Gates , Administrator Shah , and I are united in our commitment to change that .
The United States achieves the best results when we approach our foreign policy as an integrated whole , greater than the sum of its parts .
Third , we are working to improve the coordination of all the development work taking place across Washington .
In the 21st century , many government agencies have to think and act globally .
The Treasury Department leads and coordinates our nation ’s engagement with the international financial system .
The Justice Department fights transnational crime .
The Department of Energy works with global partners to develop new energy sources .
Disease control is a global challenge in an interconnected world ; so is the quality of our air and waterways .
But as a growing number of agencies broaden their scope internationally , even working on the same issue from different angles , coordination has lagged behind .
The result is an array of programs that overlap or contradict .
This is a source of growing frustration and concern .
But it ’s also an opportunity to create more forceful and effective programs .
The challenge now facing USAID and the State Department is to work with all the other agencies to coordinate , lead , or support effective implementation of the administration ’s strategy .
Indeed , this is part of our core mission .
Through our permanent worldwide presence , our strategic vision , and our charge to advance America ’s interests abroad , we can help align overseas development efforts with our strategic objectives and national interests .
This will not be easy , but it will make our government ’s work more effective , efficient , and enduring .
And we are already emphasizing this kind of coordination with our food security initiative , which brings together the Department of Agriculture ’s expertise on farming , USAID ’s experience with extension services , the Millennium Challenge Corporation ’s know - how on road building , and the contributions of several other agencies .
We know that attracting investment and expanding trade are critical to development .
So we are looking to coordinate the foreign assistance programs at USAID , MCC , and other agencies with the trade and investment initiatives of the U.S. Export - Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation .
And we seek to build on the success of regional models of coordination like the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act .
We also need to ask hard questions about who should be doing the work of development .
For too long , we ’ve relied on contractors for core contributions and diminished our own professional and institutional capacities .
This must be fixed .
Contractors are there to support us , not supplant us .
USAID and the State Department must have the staff , the expertise , and the resources to design , implement , and evaluate our programs .
This is why we are increasing the numbers of foreign service officers at USAID and the State Department .
And the QDDR is developing a set of guidelines for how we work with and oversee contractors , to make sure we have the right people doing the right jobs under the right conditions .
Fourth , we are concentrating our work in what development experts call sectors and what I think of as areas of convergence .
In the past , we invested in many programs across many fields , spreading ourselves thin and reducing our impact .
Going forward , we will target our investment and develop technical excellence in a few key areas , like health , agriculture , security , education , energy , and local governance .
Rather than helping fewer people one project at a time , we can help countries activate broad , sustainable change .
To start , we are investing $ 3.5 billion over the next three years in partner countries where agriculture represents more than 30 percent of GDP and more than 60 percent of jobs , and where up to 70 percent of a family ’s disposable income is spent on food .
Farming in these places plays such a large role that a weak agricultural sector often means a weak country .
Small family farmers stay poor , people go hungry , economies stagnate , and social unrest can ignite , as we have seen with the riots over food in more than 60 countries since 2007 .
By offering technical support and making strategic investments across the entire food system — from the seeds farmers plant to the markets where they sell their crops to the homes where people cook and store their food — we can help countries create a ripple effect that extends beyond farming and strengthens the security and prosperity of whole regions .
We are applying the same approach in the field of health .
One of our countries ’ most notable successes in development is PEPFAR , which has helped more than 2.4 million people with HIV receive life - saving anti-retroviral medications .
Now PEPFAR will be the cornerstone of our new Global Health Initiative .
We will invest $ 63 billion over the next six years to help our partners improve their health systems and provide the care their people need , rather than rely on donors to keep a fraction of their population healthy while the rest go with hardly any care .
Fifth , we are increasing our nation ’s investment in innovation .
New technologies are allowing billions of people to leapfrog into the 21st century after missing out on 20th - century breakthroughs .
Farmers armed with cell phones can learn the latest local market prices and know in advance when a drought or flood is on its way .
Mobile banking allows people in remote corners of the world to use their phones to access savings accounts or send remittances home to their families .
Activists seeking to hold governments accountable for how they use resources and treat citizens use blogs and social networking sites to shine the spotlight of transparency on the scourges of corruption and repression .
There is no limit to the potential for technology to shrink obstacles to progress .
And the United States has a proud tradition of producing game - changers in the struggles of the poor .
The Green Revolution was driven by American agricultural scientists .
American medical scientists have pioneered immunization techniques .
American engineers have designed laptop computers that run on solar energy so new technologies do n’t bypass people living without power .
This innovation tradition is even more critical today .
And we are pursuing several ways to advance discovery and make sure useful innovations reach the people who need them .
We are expanding our direct funding of new research .
We ’re exploring venture funds , credit guarantees , and other tools to encourage private companies to develop and market products and services that improve the lives of the poor .
We are seeking more innovative ways to use our considerable buying power — for example , through advance market commitments — to help create markets for those products , so entrepreneurs can be sure that breakthroughs made on behalf of the poor successfully reach them .
Here again , there is potential for fruitful partnership between our government and the dozens of American universities , laboratories , private companies , and charitable foundations that chase and fund discovery .
With help from the State Department , U.S. tech companies are working with the Mexican government , telecom companies , and NGOs to reduce narco- violence , so citizens can easily and anonymously report gang activity in their neighborhoods .
We ’ve brought three tech delegations to Iraq , including a recent visit by Eric Schmidt , the CEO of Google , who announced that his company will launch an Iraqi government YouTube channel to promote transparency and good governance .
And we ’re sending a team of experts to the Democratic Republic of Congo this spring to begin the process of bringing mobile banking technology to that country .
Of course , innovation is not only the invention of new technologies .
It ’s any breakthrough idea that transforms lives and reshapes our thinking .
Like Muhammad Yunus ’s belief that poor women armed with credit could become drivers of economic and social progress .
Or the insight behind conditional cash transfer programs , which seamlessly and successfully integrate efforts to fight poverty and promote education and health .
These innovations have traveled the world ; New York City launched a conditional cash transfer program modeled after Mexico ’s ; Muhammad Yunus ’s Grameen Bank has opened a branch in Queens .
We must ensure that other extraordinary innovations are also discovered and disseminated .
Sixth , we are focusing more of our investments on those most responsible for growing the world ’s food , caring for the world ’s sick , and raising the world ’s children : women and girls .
And I want to commend the Center for Global Development for the ground - breaking work they are doing to advance girls ’ health , with their remarkable report titled " Start with a Girl . "
It ’s a comprehensive blueprint for action , and I look forward to working with them to carry it out .
Women and girls are one of the world ’s greatest untapped resources and a terrific return on investment .
Studies have shown that when a woman receives even just one year of schooling , her children are less like die in infancy or suffer from illness or hunger — and they ’re more likely to go to school themselves .
And one reason that microfinance is ubiquitous around the world is because women have proven to be such a safe and reliable credit risk .
The money they borrow is not only invested and re-invested , and turned into a profit , it is used to improve conditions for their families .
And it is almost always repaid .
I have seen for myself the transformative power of microlending in women ’s lives and their families and communities ’ lives from Bangladesh to Costa Rica to South Africa to Vietnam and dozens of countries in between .
You know the proverb , " Give a man a fish and he ’ll eat for a day , but teach a man to fish and he ’ll eat for a lifetime " ?
If you teach a woman to fish , the impact is even greater .
It takes a woman to teach a village .
So today , the United States is taking steps to put women front and center in our development work .
We are beginning to disaggregate by gender the data we collect on our programs , to measure how well our work is helping improve women ’s health , income , and access to education and food .
We ’re starting to design programs with the needs of women in mind — by hiring more women as extension workers to reach women farmers , or women health educators to improve our outreach to women and girls .
And we are training more women in our partner countries to carry forward the work of development themselves — for example , through our scholarships to women agricultural scientists in Kenya .
This is not only a strategic interest of the United States , it is an issue of personal importance to me , and one I have worked on for almost four decades .
I will not accept words without deeds when it comes to women ’s progress .
I will hold our agencies accountable for ensuring that our government and our foreign policy support the world ’s women and achieve lasting , meaningful results on these issues .
As we apply these six approaches , more will follow — some new ; some variations on the past ; all reflecting our commitment to find , test , and embrace ideas that work and to learn from our work at every step of the way .
A half century ago , President Kennedy outlined a new vision for the role of development in promoting American values and advancing global security .
He called for a new commitment and a new approach to match the realities of the post - war world .
And his administration created the United States Agency for International Development to lead that effort and make the United States the world leader in development .
In the decades since , our nation ’s development efforts have helped eradicate smallpox and reduce polio and river blindness .
We ’ve helped save millions of lives through immunizations ; put two million people with HIV on life - saving anti-retroviral medications ; and made oral rehydration therapy available worldwide , greatly reducing infant deaths .
We ’ve helped educate millions of young people .
We ’ve provided significant support to countries that have flourished in a number of sectors , including economic growth , health , and good governance — countries like South Korea , Thailand , Mozambique , Botswana , Rwanda , and Ghana .
And we ’ve supplied humanitarian aid to countries on every continent in the wake of hurricanes , earthquakes , famines , floods , tsunamis , and other disasters .
Americans can and do take pride in these achievements , which not only have helped humanity but also have helped our nation project our values and strengthen our leadership in the world .
And these efforts have not been the work of government alone — which , most people do n’t realize , contributes only about one percent of our budget to foreign assistance .
The balance is made up the generous spirit of Americans and is reflected across our nation ’s landscape , from farms to civic groups to churches to charities .
Over the years , the American people have opened their hearts and wallets to causes ranging from eradicating polio in Latin America to Saving Darfur to helping poor people in Asia purchase livestock to investing in microenterprise on multiple continents .
And the cumulative effect of all of this private giving is literally to double the amount our country spends on foreign assistance .
Today , we must call on that same American spirit of giving to meet the challenges of a new century .
Not only giving materially but giving time and talent .
So those of you who care deeply about development … who care deeply about the future of our country and our world … help us enlist more Americans in this effort .
Help us recruit technology experts , business leaders , farmers , teachers , doctors , lawyers .
And help us tap into the talents of the first global generation of Americans — the young men and women graduating from our colleges and universities , the finest in the world .
Encourage them to volunteer .
To intern .
To work not only for NGOs but to lend their energy and skill to the State Department and USAID .
And I promise that with Raj ’s help , we will do more on our end to make sure that our doors are open to this emerging pool of thinkers and doers .
Development work is never easy .
But it is essential to creating a world in which more people in more places have the opportunity to live up to their God - given potential — a world that is more equitable , democratic , prosperous , and peaceful .
Thank you .

Need a break from your righteous and entirely legitimate rage at Congress for its unconscionable failure to pass real health reform ?
Consider the paranoid rantings of Chuck Norris , who sees every move Congress makes as a " clandestine , " " under - handed , " and " near - secret " attempt to " drive a sword through the womb of the unborn " – even , gasp , Jesus .
" What would have happened if Mother Mary had been covered by Obamacare ?
What if that young , poor and uninsured teenage woman had been provided the federal funds ( via Obamacare ) and facilities ( via Planned Parenthood ) to avoid the ridicule , ostracizing , persecution and possible stoning because of her out - of - wedlock pregnancy ? "

Gamers and literacy .
Or the alleged the lack thereof .
The recent explosion of rage about me over at Kotaku.com ( based on a fairly healthy dose of misreporting ) has led me to consider this topic .
I could explain the connection in a long and boring paragraph .
But who cares ?
The end result is what is more relevant .
I ’ve heard it time and time again : Gamers do n’t read .
Gamers are borderline illiterate .
Gamers are subhuman monsters that communicate through a series of bluetooth transmitted grunts .
And while this is certainly true of some gamers ( just as it ’s certainly true of some politicians or doctors or teachers ) ; I have quite a bit of trouble with this sweeping generalization .
Because I am a gamer .
And I read .
A lot .
In fact , I ’m reading three different books right now .
Well … not right now right now .
Because in the current “ right now ” I ’m actually writing .
Though in that regard , I ’m a gamer who writes as well as reads .
I sometimes wonder how I manage this , what with me being a sub - human blue - tooth enabled grunting slack jawed illiterate gamer .
Grawrg !
Games fun !
Books not games !
Burn books !
Grar !
Stereotypes are easy .
They make everything conform oh so nicely .
Let ’s not think about people as individuals .
Let ’s instead focus on a single negative aspect of a culture that may or may not exist and blow it out of proportion .
I know that it is said that there is some truth in stereotypes .
Sure .
If you generalize something enough , and apply it to a large enough section of the populace , you ’re going to find a way to substantiate your beliefs .
But that behavior is considered childish for a reason .
Why ?
Because it ’s childish .
There .
You had to go and make me say it , did n’t you ?
Anyway … gamers and reading .
The things about this particular stereotype that strikes me as strange … almost all the hardcore gamers I know are voracious readers .
I worked in book stores for years .
You know who I met there ?
Gamers .
Lots of them .
You know what the very well read staff of said stores typically liked to do ?
Play games .
I ’ve attended San Diego Comic Con for the last 17 years straight .
These days , well over a hundred thousand people attend this event .
Massive amounts of nerd culture bursting under one sun baked roof .
And the vast majority of people I have met there over the years ?
Gamers who read .
Readers who game .
And I do n’t just wander the halls in silence , looking at my shoes while hoping to stumble across a hot cosplay girl .
No .
I work a booth .
My job at conventions is to talk to people .
To find out what they like and why they like it .
And I also attended WonderCon for 20 + years .
And every APE .
And multiple show ’s in Seattle and New York and Oregon and Michigan and so on .
I attend as many as 5 conventions a year .
And my experience has been the same at each event .
Everytime .
I meet people who like to play games and like to read .
Over the years , it ’s probably safe to say I ’ve met thousands and thousands of gamers that read .
On a strictly personal level , I ’m lucky enough to know a lot of smart people .
People way smarter than me .
People with degrees in psychology , literature , mathematics , ect… .
And they ’re all hardcore gamers .
And they all read .
A lot .
All the time .
Now , I ’m no professional sociologist .
As a thick skulled knuckle dragging gamer , I do n’t even really know what sociologists do .
I presume they make some kind of studies of sub-cultures and social behaviors .
Probably in some real book learned , educated sort of “ smart - guy - look - at - me - my - tie - doesn ’t - just - clip - on ” way .
The aforementioned studies are probably written up into papers of some merit without ever using a controller or a combo move .
As I am so ignorant in the ways of the elitist college type folks , I will happily concede that there are probably a dozen or so studies out there that suggest I ’m wrong in some capacity .
But let ’s be fair .
Those studies are likely very boring and dry .
Far too long for my weary gamer eyes to read .
So yes … there are gamers who do n’t read .
There are also gamers who do n’t pay their taxes and gamers who shoplift and gamers who beat up old ladies .
And yes , there are even gamers who will somehow inadvertently misinterpret this as a crusade against gamers .
Because most everyone is a gamer now .
Whether they ’re smart or stupid or young or old .
Grandmother playing Farmville through the Facebook account she uses to try and keep tabs on her grandchildren ?
Gamer .
3 year old playing Flash animated Bob the Builder games on a hand me down junk laptop ?
Gamer .
Advance Math professor playing Left 4 Dead after work ?
Gamer .
Politicians , construction workers , doctors , plumbers , editors , actors , ect… Gamers .
Any of them or all of them .
And while some of them may not read , I hardly see how that is the fault of gaming .
The reality is , some people will never be readers , whether they play games or not .
Last month , a Brooklyn - based non-profit organisation called the Hebron Fund , which supports Jewish settlers in the Israeli - occupied city of Hebron , held a fundraiser at the New York Mets ' stadium , Citi Field .
The fundraiser went forward despite calls for its cancellation from grassroots human rights organisations from the US , Palestine and Israel .
The fact that the Hebron Fund likely raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for extremist Israeli settlers at a major US venue with little public scrutiny is a troubling sign for those who hope that the US can play a constructive role in achieving a just peace in the Middle East .
Perhaps more worryingly , according to Washington Post columnist David Ignatius : " A search of IRS records identified 28 US charitable groups that made a total of $ 33.4 m in tax - exempt contributions to settlements and related organisations between 2004 and 2007 . "
Some of the larger organisations , including Friends of the Ateret Cohanim and Friends of Ir David , both leading the Jewish settler takeover of Palestinian East Jerusalem , are based in New York City .
Israeli settlements violate the Geneva convention 's prohibition against an occupying power transferring its population into occupied territory , and Israeli settlement expansion directly contradicts the US call for a settlement freeze .
Hebron 's Jewish settlers , who are supported by the Hebron Fund , are openly fundraising in New York City .
Under the protection of the Israeli military , they are expanding settlements in Hebron 's Old City and driving out the Palestinian residents .
The Hebron Fund 's extremist positions are clear .
Hebron Fund executive director Yossi Baumol told The American Prospect that " [ d] emocracy is poison to Arabs " , " Israel must not give Arabs a say in how the country is run " and " [ y ] ou 'll never get the truth out of an Arab " .
Hebron 's chief rabbi , Dov Lior , a featured participant in some Hebron Fund events , recently praised a new book that says it is permitted for a Jew to kill civilians who provide moral support to an enemy of the Jews , and to even kill young children , if it is foreseeable that they will grow up to become enemies .
Settlers and the Israeli army routinely attack and terrorise Palestinians in Hebron , according to human rights groups such as B'Tselem in Israel .
In 1994 , Hebron settler Baruch Goldstein massacred 29 unarmed Palestinians who were praying in a Hebron mosque .
One of the honorees at the 2009 Hebron Fund dinner , Noam Arnon , called Goldstein " an extraordinary person ' ' in 1995 .
In 1990 Arnon called three Jewish terrorists who were convicted of killing three Palestinians and maiming two Palestinian mayors " heroes " .
Though the Hebron Fund tells the IRS that its purpose is to " promote social and educational wellbeing " , in 2008 Baumol assured New York radio listeners : " There are real facts on the ground that are created by people helping the Hebron Fund and coming to our dinners . "
A 2007 appeal explained : " Dozens of new families can now come live in Hebron ... waiting for you to be their partners in the redemption of Hebron . "
Baumol dedicated the 2009 fundraiser to protesting at " racist limitations , led by President Barack Obama on Jewish growth " .
Settlers frequently claim that preventing Jews from living anywhere they want in the Israeli - occupied West Bank is " racist " , regardless of the settlers ' severe infringement on the rights of longstanding Palestinian residents .
Settlers justify their takeover of Hebron by invoking the massacre of 67 Jewish residents of Hebron by Palestinians in 1929 .
But rather than equality , Hebron 's settlers aim for superior rights enforced from the barrel of a gun .
Non-profit organisations like the Hebron Fund play a substantial role in fuelling the Middle East conflict , but largely fly under the radar in the US .
They brazenly hold public fundraisers , and the media generally ignore them .
Major US advocacy organisations that claim to oppose Israeli settlements typically fail to criticise them .
In one rare mainstream media report , David Ignatius highlighted the US government 's self - defeating policy , writing that " critics of Israeli settlements question why American taxpayers are supporting indirectly , through the exempt contributions , a process that the government condemns " .
Until the public , advocacy groups , media and the US government scrutinise and rein in settlement non-profits like the Hebron Fund , policy statements about peace in the Middle East will do nothing to stop the daily violence and dispossession suffered by Palestinians .

Before a Veiled Rhea
The small moon Mimas passes in front of the larger moon Rhea , which is partly obscured by Saturn 's rings , in this movie from NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft .
Observations of mutual moon - crossing events , in which one moon passes close to or in front of another , help scientists refine their understanding of the orbits of Saturn 's moons .
This movie is a concatenation of 10 still images obtained over a span of about 6 minutes .
The images were re-projected to a uniform view and computer interpolation was used to smooth the moons ' motions between the frames .
In this video , Mimas ( 396 kilometers , 246 miles across ) moves in front of the rings .
Rhea ( 1,528 kilometers , 949 miles across ) reveals the delicate separations within the rings as the thin line of the F ring appears before the backdrop of the mid-southern latitudes of the moon .
Mimas travels at an average speed of 14 kilometers per second ( 31,000 mph ) .
Rhea 's average speed is about 8 kilometers per second ( 18,000 mph ) .
( For other movies like this one , see PIA11692 and PIA11693 . )
In this view Rhea , at a distance of approximately 2.7 million kilometers ( 1.7 million miles ) , is farther from Cassini than Mimas .
Mimas is closer to the spacecraft at a distance of approximately 2 million kilometers ( 1.2 million miles ) .
This view looks toward the northern , sunlit side of the rings from just above the ring plane .
The images were taken in visible light with Cassini ’s narrow - angle camera on Oct. 19 , 2009 .
The view was obtained at a Sun-Mimas - spacecraft , or phase , angle of 95 degrees .
Scale on Mimas is 12 kilometers ( 7 miles ) per pixel .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute , Boulder , Colo .

" How on earth can Australian taxpayers trust this bloke to deliver a $ 43 billion National Broadband Network ? "
Opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin said .
" This information goes to the heart of confidential negotiations and Senator Conroy has released terms of those negotiations in the public arena further jeopardising this entire process . "
A spokesman for Senator Conroy said the commercially sensitive information was " tabled by mistake and the Government regrets the error " .
In the Senate today , Senator Conroy rejected calls from the Opposition that he resign over the matter .
But he said : " I take responsibility ... it was a mistake . "
The report , written by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and dated January 2009 , is an assessment of proposals for building the next - generation broadband network .
It contains highly detailed information about the value of Telstra 's existing copper network assets ( between $ 8 billion and $ 33 billion ) , extensive financial details including its cost of capital , network access prices and an analysis of funding uneconomic services in the bush .
Telecommunications analyst Paul Budde said this information was critical to negotiations between Telstra and the Government over how large a share - if any - Telstra should have in the NBN and the amount of assets it needs to hand over to obtain that share .
" This should not have happened .
The Government should have been far more careful .
It has breached trust and that 's not a good thing , " Budde said .
" It could indirectly damage Telstra in its negotiating position ... it allows competitors to meddle in the whole discussion by commenting on this report and in that way undermining Telstra 's position . "
But Budde noted that some of the confidential information revealed in the report was already known to industry figures , although not in such detail .
Detailed appendix information about providing broadband services to commercially unviable areas would allow critics to test Telstra 's public claims with the reality .
" That particular appendix would give ammunition to people who have been arguing that there will be other ways to skin the cat if you do n't leave it up to Telstra and give it to other players in the market , " Budde said .
Other appendixes in the report , such as one examining whether Telstra should be structurally separated to improve competition , could be used " to suss out how genuine Telstra is in its approach " , Budde said .
Loading
" Telstra was saying you do n't have to structurally separate us to get the outcome you want , so this document could be used to say Telstra is right or wrong , " he said .
But if Telstra is upset about the Government 's mistake , it is not showing it publicly .
The telco refused to comment on the matter .
Between June 1592 and May 1594 it was shut due to an outbreak of bubonic plague .
Then followed a golden period , when plays including Dr Faustus and Tamburlaine by Christopher Marlowe were performed .
It shut in 1605 when its lease expired .
In a wonderfully ironic twist on the recent Supreme Court ruling , an actual corporation has announced it is running for Congress .
Why not ?
If corporations have all the rights of people , why ca n’t they run for public office ?

Basically , the first four answers have covered why the equator is generally hot , BUT , that is not always the case !
Cayambe is a 19,000 foot tall mountain in Ecuador that lies on the equator and it is snow capped year - round , and not just a little bit of snow either .
I know this evades your main intent for asking , but you said " always " and I wanted to point out the exception .
We were two sombre boys hunched in our coats , grim winter settling in .
The college was at the edge of a small town way upstate , barely a town , maybe a hamlet , we said , or just a whistle stop , and we took walks all the time , getting out , going nowhere , low skies and bare trees , hardly a soul to be seen .
This was how we spoke of the local people : they were souls , they were transient spirits , a face in the window of a passing car , runny with reflected light , or a long street with a shovel jutting from a snowbank , no one in sight .
We were walking parallel to the tracks when an old freight train approached and we stopped and watched .
It seemed the kind of history that passes mostly unobserved , a diesel engine and a hundred boxcars rolling over remote country , and we shared an unspoken moment of respect , Todd and I , for times past , frontiers gone , and then walked on , talking about nothing much but making something of it .
We heard the whistle sound as the train disappeared into late afternoon .
This was the day we saw the man in the hooded coat .
We argued about the coat — loden coat , anorak , parka .
It was our routine ; we were ever ready to find a matter to contest .
This was why the man had been born , to end up in this town wearing that coat .
He was well ahead of us and walking slowly , hands clasped behind his back , a smallish figure turning now to enter a residential street and fade from view .
“ A loden coat does n’t have a hood .
A hood is n’t part of the context , ” Todd said .
“ It ’s a parka or an anorak . ”
“ There ’s others .
There ’s always others . ”
“ Name one . ”
“ Duffel coat . ”
“ There ’s duffel bag . ”
“ There ’s duffel coat . ”
“ Does the word imply a hood ? ”
“ The word implies toggles . ”
“ The coat had a hood .
We do n’t know if the coat had toggles . ”
“ Does n’t matter , ” I said .
“ Because the guy was wearing a parka . ”
“ ‘ Anorak ’ is an Inuit word . ”
“ So what . ”
“ I say it ’s an anorak , ” he said .
I tried to invent an etymology for the word “ parka ” but could n’t think fast enough .
Todd was on another subject — the freight train , laws of motion , effects of force , sneaking in a question about the number of boxcars that trailed the locomotive .
We had n’t stated in advance that a tally would be taken , but each of us had known that the other would be counting , even as we spoke about other things .
When I told him now what my number was , he did not respond , and I knew what this meant .
It meant that he ’d arrived at the same number .
This was not supposed to happen — it unsettled us , it made the world flat — and we walked for a time in chagrined silence .
Even in matters of pure physical reality , we depended on a friction between our basic faculties of sensation , his and mine , and we understood now that the rest of the afternoon would be spent in the marking of differences .
We headed back for a late class .
“ An anorak is substantial .
The thing he was wearing looked pretty flimsy , ” I said .
“ And an anorak would have a fur - lined hood .
Consider the origin of the word .
You ’re the one who brought up the Inuits .
Would n’t an Inuit use fur to line his hood ?
They have polar bear .
They have walrus .
They need coats with bulk and substance top to bottom . ”
“ We saw the guy from behind , ” he said .
“ How do you know what kind of hood it was ?
From behind and from a distance . ”
Consider the origin of the word .
I was using his Inuit lore against him , forcing him to respond reasonably , a rare sign of weakness on his part .
Todd was a determined thinker who liked to work a fact or an idea to the seventh level of interpretation .
He was tall and sprawling , all bony framework , the kind of body not always in synch with its hinges and joints .
Somebody said that he seemed the love child of storks , others thought ostriches .
He did not seem to taste food ; he consumed it , absorbed it , ingestible matter of plant or animal origin .
He spoke of distances in metres and kilometres , and it took me a while to understand that this was not an affectation so much as a driving need to convert units of measurement more or less instantaneously .
He liked to test himself on what he knew .
He liked to stop walking to emphasize a point as I walked on .
This was my counterpoint , to let him stand there talking to a tree .
The shallower our arguments , the more intense we became .
I wanted to keep this one going , to stay in control , to press him hard .
Did it matter what I said ?
“ Even from a distance the hood looked too small to be fur - lined .
The hood was snug , ” I said .
“ A true anorak would have a hood that ’s roomy enough to fit a woollen cap underneath .
Is n’t that what the Inuits do ? ”
The campus appeared in fragments , through ranks of tall trees on the other side of a country road .
We lived in a series of energy - efficient structures with solar panels , turfed rooftops , and red cedar walls .
Classes were held in the original buildings , several massive concrete units known collectively as the Cellblock , a bike ride or long walk away from the dorms , and the flow of students back and forth in tribal swarms seemed part of the architecture of the place .
This was my first year here , and I was still trying to interpret the signs and adapt to the patterns .
“ They have caribou , ” I said .
“ They have seal meat and ice floes . ”
At times , abandon meaning to impulse .
Let the words be the facts .
This was the nature of our walks — to register what was out there , all the scattered rhythms of circumstance and occurrence , and to reconstruct it as human noise .
The class was Logic , in Cellblock 2 , thirteen of us seated along both sides of a long table , with Ilgauskas at the head , a stocky man , late forties , beset this day by periodic coughing .
He spoke from a standing position , bent forward , hands set on the table , and often stared for long moments into the blank wall at the other end of the room .
“ The causal nexus , ” he said , and stared into the wall .
He stared ; we glanced .
We exchanged glances frequently , one side of the table with the other .
We were fascinated by Ilgauskas .
He seemed a man in a trance state .
But he was n’t simply absent from his remarks , another drained voice echoing down the tunnel of teaching years .
We ’d decided , some of us , that he was suffering from a neurological condition .
He was not bored but simply unbound , speaking freely and erratically out of a kind of stricken insight .
It was a question of neurochemistry .
We ’d decided that the condition was not understood well enough to have been given a name .
And if it did not have a name , we said , paraphrasing a proposition in logic , then it could not be treated .
“ The atomic fact , ” he said .
Then he elaborated for ten minutes while we listened , glanced , made notes , riffled the textbook to find refuge in print , some semblance of meaning that might be roughly equivalent to what he was saying .
There were no laptops or handheld devices in class .
Ilgauskas did n’t exclude them ; we did , sort of , unspokenly .
Some of us could barely complete a thought without touch pads or scroll buttons , but we understood that high - speed data systems did not belong here .
They were an assault on the environment , which was defined by length , width , and depth , with time drawn out , computed in heartbeats .
We sat and listened or sat and waited .
We wrote with pens or pencils .
Our notebooks had pages made of flexible sheets of paper .
I tried to exchange glances with the girl across the table .
This was the first time we ’d been seated face to face , but she kept looking down at her notes , her hands , maybe the grain of the wood along the edge of the table .
I told myself that she was averting her eyes not from me but from Ilgauskas .
“ F and not - F , ” he said .
He made her shy , the blunt impact of the man , thick body , strong voice , staccato cough , even the old dark suit he wore , unpressed , to every class , his chest hair curling up out of the open shirt collar .
He used German and Latin terms without defining them .
I tried to insert myself into the girl ’s line of sight , scrunching down and peering up .
We listened earnestly , all of us , hoping to understand and to transcend the need to understand .
Sometimes he coughed into his cupped hand , other times into the table , and we imagined microscopic life forms teeming toward the tabletop and ricocheting into breathable space .
Those seated nearest him ducked away with a wince that was also a smile , half apologetic .
The shy girl ’s shoulders quivered , even though she was sitting at some distance from the man .
We did n’t expect Ilgauskas to excuse himself .
He was Ilgauskas .
We were the ones at fault , for being there to witness the coughing , or for not being adequate to the seismic scale of it , or for other reasons not yet known to us .
“ Can we ask this question ? ” he said .
We waited for the question .
We wondered whether the question he ’d asked was the question we were waiting for him to ask .
In other words , could he ask the question he was asking ?
It was not a trick , not a game or a logical puzzle .
Ilgauskas did n’t do that .
We sat and waited .
He stared into the wall at the far end of the room .
It felt good to be out in the weather , that wintry sting of approaching snow .
I was walking down a street of older houses , some in serious need of repair , sad and handsome , bay window here , curved porch there , when he turned the corner and came toward me , slightly crouched , same coat , face nearly lost inside the hood .
He was walking slowly , as before , hands behind his back , as before , and he seemed to pause when he saw me , almost imperceptibly , head lowered now , path not quite steady .
There was no one else on the street .
As we approached each other , he veered away , and then so did I , just slightly , to reassure him , but I also sent a stealthy look his way .
The face inside the hood was stubbled — gray old man , I thought , large nose , eyes on the sidewalk but also noting my presence .
After we ’d passed each other , I waited a moment and then turned and looked .
He was n’t wearing gloves , and this seemed fitting , I ’m not sure why , no gloves , despite the unrelenting cold .
About an hour later , I was part of the mass movement of students going in opposite directions , in wind - whipped snow , two roughly parallel columns moving from old campus to new and vice versa , faces in ski masks , bodies shouldering into the wind or pushed along by it .
I saw Todd , long - striding , and pointed .
This was our standard sign of greeting or approval — we pointed .
I shouted into the weather as he went by .
“ Saw him again .
Same coat , same hood , different street . ”
He nodded and pointed back , and two days later we were walking in the outlying parts of town .
I gestured toward a pair of large trees , bare branches forking up fifty or sixty feet .
“ Norway maple , ” I said .
He said nothing .
They meant nothing to him , trees , birds , baseball teams .
He knew music , classical to serial , and the history of mathematics , and a hundred other things .
I knew trees from summer camp , when I was twelve , and I was pretty sure the trees were maples .
Norway was another matter .
I could have said red maple or sugar maple , but Norway sounded stronger , more informed .

Two clips for you on this slow news night , one from this afternoon ’s GB and the other from this morning ’s surprisingly charming interview with Imus .
The common thread , if you ’re looking for one , is what Beck feels his obligations are as a parent .
And as a child , I guess :
As hard as it is to believe , sniffing around his mother ’s decades - old suicide has been something of a hobby for left - wing media lately .
Let ’s hope there ’s room in their civility scrapbook for that one .
Starting Monday , celebrations and events across the world will highlight the beginning of the UN's Year of International Biodiversity and the loss of our richly varied flaura and fauna , which is estimated to be as high as 1,000 times the natural rate as a result of human activities .
Ahmed Djoghlaf , the general secretary of the treaty signed by 192 countries since 1992 to protect biodiversity , is blunt about efforts to preserve the health of biodiversity since the Rio Earth summit 18 years ago .
Governments worldwide have failed to meet the treaty 's target of reversing the trend for declining biodiversity , he says , and urgently need momentum to hit its targets for 2020 .
Biodiversity is integral to our daily lives .
It is not about the loss of exotic species which have been the focus of conservation activities by the foundations and trusts of wealthy nations .
It is about the vital resources which underpin the wealth and health of the world 's poor and that provide the vital needs for the heath and wellbeing of us all .
The equivalent to the Stern report for biodiversity is called The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( TEEB ) .
It warns that our neglect of the natural services provided by biodiversity is an economic catastrophe of an order of magnitude greater than the global economic crisis .
Year on year , the irreversible loss of natural diverse genetic resources impoverishes the world and undermines our ability to develop new crops and medicines , resist pests and diseases , and maintain the host of natural products on which humans rely .
Equally significant , are the vital natural services that the world 's ecosystems provide .
These include providing vital oxygen , decomposing waste , removing pollutants , providing the natural buffers that help manage drought and flood , protect soil from erosion , ensure soil fertility , and provide breeding nurseries to maintain fish ocean stocks .
The list goes on , and among these immeasurable vital functions of nature is of course its ability to absorb carbon dioxide .
The ability of forests , bogs and salt marches , tundra , coral and ocean plankton to sequester carbon should be our greatest ally in managing the increased emissions of fossil fuel activity – a key theme of the climate negotiations in Copenhagen last month .
Rather than seeing biodiversity and ecological mechanisms being eroded , we need to see a massive effort towards finding a more effective sustainable relationship between human society and nature .
This is not a scientific or environmental issue , it is a social question and an ethical one about what our generation leaves for those in the future .
• Dr Robert Bloomfield is the coordinator for the UK International year of biodiversity , which features talks , exhibitions , public dialogues , art work and citizen science experiments encompassing both science and the arts .
" Palestine " is no more .
Call it a " peace process " or a " road map " ; blame it on Barack Obama 's weakness , his pathetic , childish admission – like an optimistic doctor returning a sick child to its parents without hope of recovery – that a Middle East peace was " more difficult " to reach than he imagined .
But the dream of a " two - state " Israeli - Palestinian solution , a security - drenched but noble settlement to decades of warfare between Israelis and Palestinians is as good as dead .
Both the United States and Europe now stand idly by while the Israeli government effectively destroys any hope of a Palestinian state ; even as you read these words , Israel 's bulldozers and demolition orders are destroying the last chance of peace ; not only in the symbolic centre of Jerusalem itself but – strategically , far more important – in 60 per cent of the vast , biblical lands of the occupied West Bank , in that largest sector in which Jews now outnumber Muslims two to one .
This majority of the West Bank – known under the defunct Oslo Agreement 's sinister sobriquet as " Area C " – has already fallen under an Israeli rule which amounts to apartheid by paper : a set of Israeli laws which prohibit almost all Palestinian building or village improvements , which shamelessly smash down Palestinian homes for which permits are impossible to obtain , ordering the destruction of even restored Palestinian sewage systems .
Israeli colonists have no such problems ; which is why 300,000 Israelis now live – in 220 settlements which are all internationally illegal – in the richest and most fertile of the Palestinian occupied lands .
When Obama 's elderly envoy George Mitchell headed home in humiliation this week , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated his departure by planting trees in two of the three largest Israeli colonies around Jerusalem .
With these trees at Gush Etzion and Ma'aleh Adumim , he said , he was sending " a clear message that we are here .
We will stay here .
We are planning and we are building . "
These two huge settlements , along with that of Ariel to the north of Jerusalem , were an " indisputable part of Israel forever . "
In the face of a PR nightmare , Pennsylvania authorities have withdrawn all charges against two members of Tortuga accused of using Twitter to aid protesters at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh .
At a hearing today , instead of oral arguments regarding a defense motion to unseal the secret 18 - page affidavit authorizing the arrests of Elliott Madison and Michael Wallschlager at a motel just outside of Pittsburgh , the prosecution immediately moved to withdraw all charges against the two before the defense had a chance to argue its case .
Although clear from the beginning that these charges were absurd based on the State ’s very own laws , our housemates were incarcerated for 36 hours , had their van towed and belongings confiscated , and one house member was given $ 30,000 in straight bail .
The District Attorney and his spokesperson were at pains to explain why the State would drop all charges against these dangerous twitterists and of course , refused to admit that these charges were unconstitutional and a heavy - handed attempt to scare anarchists and others from protesting in ways unsanctioned by the government .
Instead , the prosecution says they decided that pursuing the charges “ would be unwise ” after consulting other law enforcement agencies and because of other pending investigations .
The secret affidavit authorizing the arrests in Pennsylvania is set to become public on Nov. 23rd .
We imagine the Pennsylvania State Police will seek an extension to keep this document sealed — perhaps in order to hide the flimsiness of their secret evidence ?
However , no matter the reason , we will fight to unseal this document and we will not let the State hide behind sealed evidence , obscure innuendo , and other traditional tactics used by secret police .
Though it is a victory that all the charges against our two housemates were dropped in Pennsylvania , we cannot forget that there is still a mysterious grand jury and other “ ongoing investigations ” out there .
While we may be free from criminal proceedings now , we are still under the threat of future charges / indictments .
What these might be , when they might happen , and what cause the State has is , of course , secret .
Although our only option is to wait and see , we refuse to let them go about their business ruining our lives in peace and quiet and will continue fighting them every step of the way .

With 100 caps to his name - more than any other player in Welsh history - he has one of the fiercest reputations on the field , and a row of missing front teeth to prove it .
At 6ft 3in and 16st of pure muscle , his masculinity has always been an absolute given .
As a young man he bonded with rugby mates in the pub over tales of sexual conquests , and flirted with pretty girls eager to bag a sporting hero .
Living a lie : Gareth Thomas pictured with wife and teenage sweetheart Jemma before their marriage ended in 2006
After his marriage in 2002 to teenage sweetheart Jemma - the woman he called his ' rock ' - he spoke movingly of their desire to become parents and the heartbreak of her suffering three miscarriages .
And if anyone dared to suggest he was anything other than 100 per cent straight , Gareth ' Alfie ' Thomas was prepared to make them see the error of their ways .
With his fists , if necessary .
But , as he admits in the Daily Mail today , it was all a pretence , a fragile artifice - and one which came crashing down around his ears on November 4 , 2006 , following a Wales game in Cardiff .
Breaking down in tears in the changing rooms of the Millennium Stadium , Gareth finally realised he could not go on living a lie .
Keeping his true sexuality a secret was destroying him .
That secret , which he'd kept hidden his entire career , was - he admits now - ' like a tight knot in my stomach , always threatening to seep out ' .
He says : ' I was like a ticking bomb .
I thought I could suppress it , keep it locked away in some dark corner of myself , but I could n't .
' It was who I was , and I just could n't ignore it any more .
' I 'd been through every emotion under the sun trying to deal with this .
' You wake up one morning thinking : " I can handle it .
Everything is fine , " and the next morning you do n't want anyone to see your face , because you think that if people look at you , they will know . '
That summer , he had confessed the truth to his devastated wife Jemma , unable to cope with the guilt of deceiving her .
But even as their marriage crumbled , he 'd somehow hoped to maintain his charade for the rest of the world .
' My life seemed to be falling apart .
Jemma and I were splitting up , and I was scared of the future and being single again as a gay man , ' says Gareth , 35 .
' A coach named Scott Johnson , a great man , came up to me in the dressing room after the game for a chat and I just broke down in tears .
' He said : " What 's up ? " ' I said : " Me and Jemma have split , " and he said : " Oh no , what 's happened ? "
Then he said : " I know what 's happened , I know what it is . " '
Somehow , the coach had guessed .
Secret : Gareth has won 100 caps for Wales and captained his country to the Grand Slam and the British Lions
' He took me out of the team room to the medical room , locked the door and I told him everything .
After keeping it secret for so long , I felt a huge rush of relief .
' Scott said : " Right , I 've got to speak now to three or four players in the Welsh team because you need the boys to surround you and support you .
You can't cope with this on your own , " and he was right .
' He told two of my team - mates , Stephen Jones and Martyn Williams , and as I sat in the bar waiting for them , I was absolutely terrified , wondering what they were going to say .
' But they came in , patted me on the back and said : " We do n't care .
Why did n't you tell us before ? "
' Two of my best mates in rugby did n't even blink an eyelid .
Martyn said he never had a clue , would never have thought it .
' I felt everyone was protecting me and closing in tight around me .
No one distanced themselves from me , not one single person . '
Since that confession to his closest circle of friends three years ago , Gareth says his team - mates at his club , the Cardiff Blues , now know - and apparently do n't care .
Today , however , he has taken the remarkable decision to go public .
It 's his choice .
No one has forced his hand .
He just feels attitudes have changed and the time is right for sport to start accepting openly gay people in the same way other professions have in recent years .
Also , a big supporter of the NSPCC , he does n't want desperate young people confused over their sexuality , or worried about any other issue , to suffer in silence , as he did for almost 20 years , too terrified to tell anyone .
The number of boys calling ChildLine about their sexuality has increased to 3,500 a year .
' I 've been through all sorts of emotions with this , tears , anger and absolute despair , ' he says .
' I was n't sure if I ever wanted to let people know , and , to be honest , I feel anxious about people 's reactions and the effect it might have on my family .
' It 's been really tough for me , hiding who I really am , and I do n't want it to be like that for the next young person who wants to play rugby , or some frightened young kid .
' I do n't know if my life is going to be easier because I 'm out , but if it helps someone else , if it makes one young lad pick up the phone to ChildLine , then it will have been worth it .
' My parents , my family and my friends all love me and accept me for who I am , and even if the public are upset by this , I know the love of those people who mean the most to me will never change .
' I 'm not going on a crusade , but I 'm proud of who I am .
I feel I have achieved everything I could ever possibly have hoped to achieve out of rugby , and I did it being gay .
' I want to send a positive message to other gay people that they can do it , too . '
Attitudes were very different when Gareth , a postman 's son , started his professional career with Bridgend as a teenager .
Sometimes I felt so alone and depressed .
I 've stood on so many cliff edges
He believes that had he been openly gay back then , he would never have reached rugby 's highest echelons .
' It is the toughest , most macho of male sports , and with that comes an image , ' he says .
' In many ways , it is barbaric , and I could never have come out without first establishing myself and earning respect as a player .
' Rugby was my passion , my whole life , and I was n't prepared to risk losing everything I loved . '
Not that he was prepared , initially , to accept that he was gay - despite realising , aged 17 , that he did n't feel attracted to women in the same way that his mates were .
He had girlfriends , experimented sexually , but ultimately avoided intimacy .
' When I was 16 or 17 I knew I was gay , but knowing and accepting are two very different things .
' I could never accept it because I knew I would never be accepted as a gay man and still achieve what I wanted to achieve in the game .
' I would play along with the other lads .
I had all the chit-chat .
I knew which girls to flirt with , which girls to say were nice , which ones to say were n't .
' I 'd make up stories about sexual conquests to fit in .
' I became a master of disguise and could play the straight man down to a tee , sometimes over - compensating by getting into fights or being overly aggressive because I did n't want the real me to be found out .
' So I created this alter ego , knowing full well that I was living in my little fantasy bubble , my shell .
' But when you withdraw into yourself you start to feel lonely , upset , ashamed .
You create this inner world which is dark .
' I was never ever attracted to any of my rugby mates ; I was really good at switching off my emotions and I would n't have even considered crossing that line .
' My biggest fear was that if my rugby mates knew , they 'd all think I fancied them and reject me .
' If anything , rugby was my saviour .
On the pitch I could forget who I was , escape all the confusion , ' says Gareth , who retired from international rugby in 2007 but plans to continue playing with the Cardiff Blues for as long as he can .
Break up :
The divorce between Gareth and Jemma will soon be finalised , but he says they are still in love with each other and remain friends
Gareth 's first gay sexual encounter was with a male , non -rugby - playing friend , when he was 18 , a one - off encounter which left him feeling ashamed and frightened .
' At the time it felt right , but afterwards it felt wrong and I promised myself it would never happen again , ' he says .
' I just completely denied everything .
Everything I was n't supposed to think or feel went through a trap door in my mind and was forgotten .
' I used to hope that I would wake up one morning , all these feelings would be gone and I 'd be like the rest of them , be one of the boys without having to pretend .
' I used to pray constantly and ask God : " You have given me this great talent to play rugby .
There must be some kind of answer . "
But there was n't one . '
It was at a friend 's 18th birthday party that Gareth met his future wife Jemma .
' The craziest thing about Jemma is that I genuinely did love her .
She was the nicest , most caring , understanding , prettiest girl I had ever met , ' he says .
' It was such a confusing time because I had amazingly strong feelings for her , yet I knew I had taken who I was and put it in a little ball and pushed it in a corner .
' She took all of me , except that little ball , which was waiting to leak out at any time .
' Because I liked and loved Jemma so much , when we got really close , I felt : " Wow , this is really great ! "
' I wanted to make love to her because of my feelings for her .
It would n't have mattered to me if she was a man , a woman or an alien . '
The relationship , however , was on - off for a long time before their church wedding in the pretty village of St Brides Major , near Bridgend , in 2002 .
Gareth says this was not only because international rugby took him away for long stretches of time and required total commitment , but also because he was struggling to contain his sexuality .
I 'm proud of who I am .
I feel I have achieved everything I could ever possibly have hoped to achieve out of rugby , and I did it being gay .
He admits that occasionally , during their ' off ' periods , he gave into his urges and secretly met men , afterwards hating himself for doing so and repressing his sexuality again - a destructive cycle which would repeat itself throughout his career .
' It 's so difficult to be so close to someone , and every day tell them that you love them and hear them say they love you , knowing the words were true , but also knowing that the real me wanted to take over , ' he says .
Knowing he might be gay , and having had secret sexual encounters with other men during their on - off courtship , was it fair to ask Jemma to marry him ?
Now that he has finally accepted who he is , Gareth is consumed with guilt over the upset he caused her .
They separated in late 2006 and their divorce is soon to be finalised .
Jemma now lives in Spain where she works as an accountant .
But they remain friends and he says they still love each other .
' I do n't regret the marriage .
I hope I have good years to come , but I had some of the most fantastic years of my life with Jemma .
' Our wedding day was brilliant .
I loved it .
Jemma was stunning and I was so very happy .
' I took those vows seriously and I would n't have married her if I had n't thought I could make a go of being the perfect husband . '
Did he not have cold feet at all , though ?
Gareth says : ' I wanted to get married .
We went to church together every week and I used to pray as hard as I could .
' I would say to God : " I have Jemma , I love her .
Please take away these feelings that I have . "
' I really wanted this marriage to be for the rest of my life , and I felt confident I could keep this other part of me locked away indefinitely .
' I still felt attracted to other men , but I squashed those feelings .
I decided I could accept the attraction , provided I never did anything about it . '
Changed : Gareth holds the 2005 Six Nations trophy with Michael Owen .
Now retired from international rugby , he hopes to continue playing for Cardiff for as long as he can
This , however , would prove to be impossible for Gareth .
His love for Jemma did not rid him of these urges , and when he was playing away fixtures near London , he would more often than not be drawn to gay bars and clubs after the games .
' I loved Jemma to bits , she was my wife , I would have died for her , but keeping this secret was driving me crazy , ' he says .
' It felt as if I had a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other .
' One would be saying to me , as I stood outside a gay bar : " Go on in and have a look , " while the good one would be saying : " No , do n't do it ! "
' If I walked in , there would always be an element of fear .
I would wonder who I was going to bump into , who was going to see me ? ' says Gareth , who insists he always practised safe sex .
' Cheating on Jemma made me feel horrible and guilty .
Every time it happened , I promised myself " never again " , but it was something I felt I needed to do to survive .
' I felt that if I did n't give in , it would be more destructive to me and Jemma .
' Sometimes I felt so alone and depressed .
I 've stood on so many cliff edges .
' I used to go to the cliffs overlooking the beach near our cottage in St Brides Major and just think about jumping off and ending it all .
' It 's a lot easier to think : " If I have n't got to open my eyes , then I do n't have to worry .
If I do n't have to think about it , then I do n't have any pain . "
' But I could never have done it .
It was like a cry for help .
I did n't have the guts and I loved my life , my rugby and my family too much .
' But just thinking about it helped , got it out of my system .
' Sometimes I 'd think : " I do n't want to be like this .
I want to kill myself . "
Then the reality hits home .
' It was n't that I really wanted to die , I just wanted everything to be different , for it all to go away . '
The craziest thing about Jemma is that I genuinely did love her .
She was the nicest , most caring , understanding , prettiest girl I had ever met
Despite believing his father Barry , 60 , mother Yvonne , 61 , and older brothers Steven , 40 , and Richard , 37 , would love and accept him no matter what , he found it impossible to confide in them .
' To tell them I was gay would have been to accept the reality , ' says Gareth , ' and I was n't ready for that .
' Sometimes it 's hardest to speak to those closest to you . '
It was in 2006 , however , that Gareth 's life completely unravelled .
Having moved in 2004 from Bridgend to Celtic Warriors and then to the French Club Toulouse , Gareth should have been on a high after 2005 's stunning sporting triumphs , which included winning the Heineken Cup .
Instead , he became caught up in the controversy surrounding the sudden departure of the Wales national coach , and stood accused of leading a player revolt .
Hours after appearing in a heated television discussion to defend his team against charges of ' player - power ' , Gareth - having been previously injured in a match with his French club - collapsed from a ruptured artery and suffered a ministroke .
A few weeks later , his wife Jemma suffered her third miscarriage .
Not long after this , he realised he could no longer carry the burden of his secret and confessed to his wife at their home in France .
' I was changing , getting more and more pent - up .
I loved Jemma , but not 100 per cent , and I just felt she deserved better .
It was n't fair on her , ' he says .
' One night , on impulse , I just said : " I ca n't lie to you any more , and I 've got to tell you that I 'm gay . "
' She is the nicest person in the world and tried to be understanding , but of course she was angry and upset .
We were both in tears .
' I suffer every day now knowing how much I hurt her saying it , but I think it was best in the long run : I 'm gay and she had to know .
' I told her I was sorry and I still apologise now .
' I still love her to the depth of my bones .
She 's an amazing woman .
' We had some of the best years together , but I feel guilty that if I had never married Jemma , she might have met someone else who might still be with her .
' At first , we both felt we could n't just walk away from each other , and there was a part of us which wondered if we could carry on as man and wife .
' But over a three - month period we gradually drifted apart and Jemma went back to Wales .
' I think she would have felt a lot more pain if it had been another woman .
She could have thought : " What 's wrong with me ?
What could I not give you ? "
' But because I was gay and was attracted to men , she knew it was nothing she 'd ever be able to change . '
So now Gareth is single and free to date whomever he pleases without fear of being ' outed ' .
He says he feels like a teenager again , re-living his youth , discovering who he really is .
He hopes , now that he has gone public , he can still go out with male friends without people assuming he 's with a lover .
' Just because you are gay , does n't mean you fancy every man who walks the planet , ' he says .
' I do n't want to be known as a gay rugby player .
I am a rugby player first and foremost .
I am a man .
' I just happen to be gay .
It 's irrelevant .
What I choose to do when I close the door at home has nothing to do with what I have achieved in rugby .
' It 's pretty tough for me being the only international rugby player prepared to break the taboo .
' Statistically I can't be the only one , but I 'm not aware of any other gay player still in the game .
' I 'd love for it , in ten years ' time , not to even be an issue in sport , and for people to say : " So what ? " '

That Japanese propensity to try new things is the other reason Google is intent on staying put in Japan .
Over the years , Japan has become a testing lab for many of the Web giant ’s cutting - edge new ideas , especially in mobile technology .
Google ’s Tokyo - based programmers , immersed in Japan ’s mobile and Web culture , have become a valuable source of ideas for the entire company .
Overseas markets now account for half of Google ’s revenue , and the company is becoming more keenly aware of the need to tailor its services to local markets , as well as the advantages of absorbing ideas from outside the United States , company executives say .
“ Japan made us realize that non-U.S. ideas can go global , ” David Eun , a vice president for Google , said on a recent trip to Japan , where he closed deals with two Japanese broadcasters to allow YouTube to run some of their content .
Google Japan ’s offices occupy several floors in a skyscraper in Shibuya , a Tokyo neighborhood popular with start - ups that is also a hangout for the city ’s hippest teenagers .
Minutes away from where Google developers work , young Japanese perch on sidewalks , playing with their Web - enabled cellphones , thumbs flying and eyes glued to the tiny screens .
But most of those trendsetters do not regard Google as being very Japanese  a big headache for the company .
Google has never been able to overcome Yahoo ’s advantage as the first Web - based search engine .
And although 35 percent of Yahoo Japan is owned by Yahoo in Sunnyvale , Calif. , it is viewed as a local company .
“ Yahoo Japan is a Japanese company , and most of their employees are Japanese people who fluently understand how the Japanese mind - set and business work , ” said Nobuyuki Hayashi , a technology analyst .
“ But Google ’s still a foreigner who ’s learned how to speak some Japanese . ”
Popularizing Google in Japan has been fraught with 21st - century versions of the cultural mishaps that have long plagued American companies here .
In May , Google was forced to reshoot its entire “ Street View ” image stock in Japan  with a camera positioned to capture views 15 inches lower  after intense criticism that the service peeked over fences and into people ’s homes , invading privacy .
The narrower width of Japan ’s roads made the service especially intrusive , bloggers fumed .
The capital 's mayor is expected to sign the bill into law
Lawmakers in Mexico City have become the first in Latin America to legalise gay marriage .
City legislators passed the bill 39 - 20 , with five abstentions .
The city 's mayor is now widely expected to sign the bill into law .
Gay marriage is only allowed in seven countries and some parts of the US .
Certain parts of Latin America allow civil unions for same - sex couples .
The Catholic Church and conservative groups had opposed Mexico City 's move .
The bill calls for a change in the definition of marriage in the city 's civic code - from the union of a man and a woman to " the free uniting of two people " .
Regional differences
Lawmaker David Razu had proposed the change to give same - sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples regarding social security and other benefits .
Mexico City 's legislature is dominated by the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party , which has already legalised abortion and civil unions for same - sex couples .
Spokesman Oscar Oliver told AFP news agency that city legislators were now taking up a measure in the bill that would allow married same - sex couples to adopt children .
A handful of cities in Argentina , Ecuador and Colombia permit gay unions .
Uruguay alone has legalised civil unions nationwide and allowed same - sex couples to adopt children .
Last month , an Argentinean court narrowly blocked what would been the continent 's first gay marriage .
In a last - minute challenge , a court referred the case to the country 's Supreme Court , which is due to rule on the issue .

Roy E. Disney , the nephew of Walt Disney who helped revitalize the Walt Disney Studio ’s famed animation division and at times publicly feuded with top executives at the company , died on Wednesday at Hoag Memorial Presbyterian Hospital in Newport Beach , Calif. , following a year - long battle with stomach cancer , according to a spokeswoman from the company .
He was 79 .
Mr. Disney served as a director emeritus and consultant to the company until his death .
From 1984 - 2003 , he held the post of vice chairman of the board of directors of the Walt Disney Company and chairman of the studio ’s animation department .
He resigned in 2003 citing “ serious differences of opinion about the direction and style of management ” and subsequently helped lead an investor uprising that culminated with the departure of Michael Eisner as chief executive and chairman .
“ He was much more than a valued 56 - year company veteran , ” said Bob Iger , president and chief executive of the company .
“ Roy ’s true passion and focus were preserving and building upon the amazing legacy of Disney animation that was started by his father and uncle .
Roy ’s commitment to the art of animation was unparalleled and will always remain his personal legacy and one of his greatest contributions to Disney ’s past , present and future . ”
John Lasseter , chief creative officer for Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios , added , “ I first met Roy when I was still an animation student at CalArts .
Not only did I consider him a personal friend , but he was a great man who believed deeply in the art of animation .
He put his heart and soul into preserving Disney ’s legendary past , while helping to move the art of animation into the modern age by embracing new technology . ”
Mr. Disney was born in Los Angeles on Jan. 10 , 1930 , to Roy O. Disney and Edna Francis Disney .
His father and his uncle co-founded the company .
As a child , Roy E. Disney would often play in the animation studio hallways , with animators using him as a test audience as they toiled on films like “ Pinocchio . ”
He began his entertainment industry career in 1952 , working as an assistant film editor on the “ Dragnet ” TV series .
He joined the Walt Disney Company in 1953 as an assistant film editor , where his credits included the landmark Academy Award - winning “ True - Life Adventures ” features , “ The Living Desert ” and “ The Vanishing Prairie . ”
As a writer and production associate , he received an Oscar nomination for his work on the short subject “ Mysteries of the Deep ” in 1959 , and in 2003 as producer for “ Destino . ”
From writing , Disney went on to produce and direct some 35 other TV and theatrical productions , including the landmark 1968 documentary “ Varda , the Peregrine Falcon , ” before leaving in 1977 to become an independent producer and investor .
An avid sailor – he held numerous yacht racing records – Mr. Disney was also the chairman of Shamrock Holdings , a family investment enterprise that he organized in 1978 .
“ Roy and I enjoyed a 35 - year friendship and partnership that was simply special , ” said Stanley Gold , president of Shamrock Holdings .
“ We faced many business challenges together , had fun in the process and enjoyed a wide variety of professional successes .
Roy was a man who was steadfastly loyal to his principles and to his friends .
He was a gracious , humble gentleman who could make the tough decisions life sometimes requires . ”
The first time I heard a waitress was forced to foot the bill when a customer skipped out , I thought surely this was the policy of a rogue manager .
That was in early August .
After four months of interviews with servers and managers at dozens of restaurants here and around the country , I now know otherwise .
A growing number of restaurant patrons are eating meals and ducking out before paying .
That 's illegal .
Waiters and waitresses assigned to their tables are getting stuck with the tab .
That 's illegal , too .
As a U.S. Labor Department spokesperson put it in an e-mail response to my questions :
" It is a violation for employers to improperly require tipped employees to pay for customers who walk out without paying their bills or for incorrectly totaled bills . "
I will not name any particular restaurant because my research indicates so many are violating federal law by requiring their servers to cover customers ' unpaid bills .
It strikes me as unfair to single out one .
I will , however , give my list to the Labor Department .
Related content
In several instances , managers told me they did n't know the practice was illegal .
Occasionally , a manager argued that employees signed an agreement to cover unpaid bills .
But that 's an illegal contract .
Some discussions revolved around what exactly they wanted their servers to do when they suspect a customer is leaving without paying .
Many said they want servers to hunt down a manager immediately , which would require them to leave behind the other tables they are supposed to be policing .
Some servers told me they occasionally have run out to parking lots to stop fleeing customers .
Bad idea .
Last year , a waitress in Columbus was paralyzed when she chased an escaping customer and he struck her with his car .
In 2003 , a waitress in Irving , Texas , ran out to get the license plate of a group leaving without paying a $ 100 tab .
She died after their car hit her .
The driver was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
Many restaurants , including some chains , do it right .
Perkins Restaurant and Bakery in Brooklyn , for example , does not require servers to cover unpaid tabs .
But Manager Darin McGlothin has worked at plenty of places that do .
McGlothin has been in the restaurant industry for 22 years , and his six previous employers docked servers .
He has learned how to discern which customers are more likely to be freeloaders .
" It 's less common in large groups , " McGlothin said .
" Sometimes , it 's an honest mistake .
A large party will get to talking and forget who 's paying , but they remember and come back .
We 've had that happen twice in the last three weeks .
They 're always so embarrassed , and quick to apologize . "
Parties of two or three , he said , are more likely to scam .
" If one gets up to go to the bathroom and another leaves , they may be planning not to pay .
Or if they get jumpy or agitated as bill time comes . "
For those employers who plead ignorance of the law , now you know .
You can immediately stop charging employees for customers ' unpaid bills .
You also should reimburse servers who 've been illegally socked with customers ' tabs .
To thwart dishonest customers , many restaurants are requiring their servers to deliver the bill soon after the meal arrives .
So I implore patrons , try not to bristle when a server hands you the bill long before you 've finished eating .
Just pay it .
You can still order dessert or another drink later .
If you are a server , please do n't chase down a customer who just walked out without paying .
Not ever .
It is not your job , and it could be dangerous .
Finally , if you 're a server whose employer is saddling you with bills that customers refuse to pay , the U.S. Department of Labor wants to hear from you .
Call its help line at 1-866-487-9243 .
It 's a toll - free number , because when it comes to justice in the workplace , you should n't foot the bill .

Parents in Glasgow occupied yet another primary school this week ; the latest in a series of school occupations which have taken place over the past year .
Taking action in response to proposals to close St. Matthew 's Primary School , five concerned parents barricaded themselves inside the school and announced their intention to remain there until their demands were met .
Protests have also taken place at three other schools in the area set to close .
These threatened closures are the most recent in a concerted campaign by councils across Greater Glasgow to shut of schools and nurseries .
In early 2009 , Glasgow City Council announced plans to close at least 13 primary schools and 12 nurseries across the city .
The consultations for these closures have been branded flimsy at best by angry parents who feel the decision had , in many cases , been finalized before the public consultation was even finished .
Over the past year budget deficits have led to council cutbacks across Glasgow , with a £ 75 million shortfall in North Lanarkshire where St. Matthew 's is located .
As the predicted cost of the 2014 Commonwealth Games soars to £ 454 million , it perhaps comes as no great surprise that the council is using the excuse of low pupil numbers and building disrepair to mask their attempts at cost -cutting .
Both Glasgow City Council and North Lanarkshire Council have responded to parents ' protests with threats and intimidation .
During the Wyndford Primary occupation in early 2009 , the school 's water and electricity was cut off after a council worker posing as a safety inspector gained entry .
The protest was only able to continue thanks to donations of bottled water from local residents .
In this latest occupation , the parents staging the sit-in at St. Matthew 's were threatened with the prospect of the pupils being sent to another school because two of the occupiers do not possess a Disclosure Scotland form .
The tactic of occupation now seems one which is more readily employed since the closures were announced , with a number of similar actions having taken place across the city over the past year .
Various individual campaigns have been linked together under the ' Save Our Schools ' banner and local parents have proved that they are unwilling to let these threats to their children 's future go ahead without a fight .

Two weeks ago Washington Post reported that U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan named federal prosecutor Henry Schuelke to investigate whether gross prosecutorial misconduct tainted the government 's case against now - former Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska .
At issue , whether prosecutors withheld critical evidence from the defense or whether the case was improperly handled under pressure to meet deadlines .
US Attorney General Eric Holder , in a stunning move , threw out the government 's corruption case against Stevens last April and issued the following statement :
After careful review , I have concluded that certain information should have been provided to the defense for use at trial .
In light of this conclusion , and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case , I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial .
Holder also relocated attorneys who worked on the case including William H. Welch II , who ran the Department 's public integrity unit .
WaPo failed to report that William Welch is currently under criminal contempt of court for his role in the case against Stevens .
Welch was also involved in the prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
Siegelman was convicted of bribery in 2006 and served nine months in prison before his release was ordered pending appeal .
Despite Welch 's pending legal issues , his name continues to be listed on recent filings in Siegelman 's case .
Siegelman finds this " quite curious as he's been hot after my prosecution for a good long time now . "
Aside from alleged governmental misconduct in the Siegelman case , there are paramount legal issues that have been recognized by 91 former State Attorneys General and a group of First Amendment law professors across the country .
And yet , while the DOJ is making a point to review Republican cases , not one case against a Democrat has been completely overturned and , as Siegelman told me in a recent interview , he believes very little has changed at the department , other than the names " at the top " ...
Both prestigious groups protesting the Siegelman prosecution insist no crimes have been committed , and the former AG 's signed a petition for Writ of Certiorari [ PDF ] to the US Court of Appeals , urging Siegelman 's case to be heard .
The petition argues :
a public official may not be prosecuted for the receipt of a campaign contribution in the absence of an explicit quid pro quo connection between the campaign contribution and an official act .
In 1990 the US Court of Appeals ruled :
the prosecution must demonstrate an explicit quid pro quo connection between a payment and an official act in campaign contribution cases , to wit , an explicit promise or agreement made in return for a contribution .
According to the petitioners , the 11th Circuit court failed to prove Siegelman personally benefited from HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy 's contribution , noting :
The Eleventh Circuit adopted an extraordinarily expansive and unprecedented interpretation of the explicit quid pro quo standard necessary to sustain a conviction .
While Judge Emmet Sullivan 's request for an independent prosecutor to be appointed to the case has been answered , the calls to throw out Siegelman 's case by retired Federal Judge U.W. Clemon has fallen on deaf ears .
Last May Clemon sent a letter [ PDF ] to US Attorney General Eric Holder calling for the investigation of the Justice Department 's prosecution of the former Alabama Governor accusing federal prosecutors of allegedly jury - pool " poisoning " and " judge - shopping " in Siegelman 's case after he initially threw it out .
Clemons told Holder in his letter :
The 2004 prosecution of Mr. Siegleman in the Northern District of Alabama was the most unfounded criminal case which I presided in my entire judicial career .
In my judgment , his prosecution was completely without legal merit ; and it could not have been accomplished without the approval of the Department of Justice .
But the Department of Justice , for some reason , has not budged on overturning the political prosecutions of Democrats such as Siegelman --- begging the question as to whether it believes the Democrats were properly tried .
Just last month , Obama 's Solicitor General Elena Kagan issued a brief urging the US Supreme Court to deny hearing Siegleman 's appeal .
When asked , during a recent interview , why he thought Kagan filed the petition against his appeal , Siegelman told me : " The people making the decisions are the same people who have been making the decisions all along .
We 've changed things at the top but the people who are doing the work , certainly doing the work on my case are the same who worked under George Bush and Karl Rove .
There 's no change .
These people [ have ] a vested interest in the outcome and they 're going to keep fighting for the same results . "
Siegleman 's case highlights gross conflicts of interest and prosecutorial misconduct by State Prosecutor Leura Canary .
Canary 's husband Bill Canary , a close friend of Karl Rove , worked for Siegleman 's gubernatorial opponent in Alabama , Bob Riley .
Canary 's wife Leura investigated and indicted Siegelman one month before the 2006 gubernatorial election while her husband was running Riley 's own campaign against Siegelman .
Leura Canary claims she went to the Department of Justice and asked whether she should recuse herself from the case , but says she was told she could remain on the investigation .
Nonetheless , Canary publicly stated in an abundance of caution , she would step down from the case .
However , it was later revealed that she never fully removed herself from Siegelman 's prosecution , and emails show she consulted prosecutors during his trial .
Siegleman 's legal team filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain documents from DOJ to determine who instructed Canary to remain on the case .
To date , the Department has refused to turn over those documents to lawyers as well as House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
Siegelman says this information could be critical to his appeal .
" For some reason they 're stonewalling and this is information that we feel we 're entitled to .
It could show that Leura Canary had a financial and political conflict or she lied about it . "
He adds : " What I find a complete paradox is that Canary came forward and said she talked to the people at DOJ and said there was n't a conflict but I 'm going to recuse myself anyway .
If they actually put that in a memo then there 's a serious problem there because there was a financial and political conflict and we proved it .
So if someone gave her a green light to go forward after we proved that her husband was a paid consultant working for my opponent than there 's someone at Justice who should get their pink slip from Eric Holder . "
Leura Canary did not return calls for an interview .
Recent disclosures in Stevens trial indicate prosecutors failed to turn over all relevant materials to the defense --- a discovery that many believe prompted Holder to drop Stevens ' case .
Siegelman 's legal team alleges the prosecution also withheld key documents , emailed jurors during the course of the trial and interviewed / coached former Siegelman aide and star witness , Nick Bailey on nearly 70 occasions to make sure he had his story straight .
Bailey has signed sworn statements confirming he was offered a deal on unrelated extortion charges in exchange for his cooperation with prosecutors .
Bailey was the key witness in the DOJ 's charge that HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy bribed the former governor by arranging $ 500,000 in donations to Siegelman 's education lottery campaign .
The former assistant testified that in exchange for the donation , Siegelman would appoint Scrushy to the state 's hospital oversight board .
Last July ,
The BRAD BLOG covered Bailey 's involvement , and subsequent admissions of inappropriate prosecutorial behavior , in some detail .
Corroborating Bailey 's charges of prosecutorial shenanigans is DOJ whistleblower Tamarah Grimes , who provided Department superiors and members of Congress with evidence Siegelman and Scrushy 's rights were violated .
Siegelman and Scrushy cited her revelations heavily in their motions since June 26 , 2009 , for a new trial based on new evidence .
Siegelman says he believes that the Administration appears to be sitting on its hands with regards to reviewing his case and other Demcorats who were politically targeted by the Bush Administration .
" I think Holder 's well aware of my case and other cases so there 's been a decision made not to do anything for what reason I do n't know but it 's pretty clear they 've made a decision not to do anything , " he says .
If the court 's current opinion stands , Siegelman says it will give prosecutors way too much discretion to pick , choose and charge defendants and get a prosecution in cases of legal campaign contributions .
Meanwhile , the Supreme Court is expected decide very soon whether it will hear Siegleman 's case .

Tokyo's trains can be very crowded at rush hour
A railway company in Japan is to install special cameras on its Tokyo commuter trains to help deal with the problem of groping on public transport .
The cameras are to be fixed on the ceiling of carriages on the Saikyo line , which is known for attracting sexual predators .
Some 2,000 complaints for groping are filed with Tokyo police every year .
In a survey , four in five women report being molested on public transport , and some trains have women - only carriages .
The planned cameras will be fixed on carriage ceilings or overhead racks in a pilot project as early as this month .
Gropers ' recommendations
Signs will advise travellers that they are under surveillance , according to a spokesman for the East Japan Railway company .
Sexual harassment has been a significant problem on Japan 's trains for years .
More than 6,000 people were arrested last year on suspicion of groping or taking unsolicited photographs .
Several suspects arrested in recent months are said to have told officers they had targeted particular train lines because of recommendations they had read on websites .
Train gropers - or chikan - are common characters in Japanese popular culture .

Hexayurt , a semi- permanent structure that can be built to house a family of eight from about $ 100 ’s worth of cheap material , is a critical solution for the mess in Haiti .
If implemented in the current situation , hexayurts can house the brunt of displaced survivors until more permanent aid is forthcoming .
Ask your local government and NGO bodies to consider using the hexayurt as part of their relief effort .
The Hexayurt is a new kind of sheltering solution .
To make the simplest hexayurt , make a wall by putting six sheets of plywood on their sides in a hexagon .
Cut six more sheets in half diagonally , and screw them together into a shallow cone .
Lift with a large group on to the wall , and fasten with more screws .
This shelter will last for several years and costs less than $ 100 .
It may be ideal for a variety of disaster relief situations .
Here are the key points .

A letter sent from : The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley
1 January 2010
His Excellency Mr. Kevin Rudd ,
Prime Minister , Commonwealth of Australia .
Prime Minister ,
Climate change : proposed personal briefing
Your speech on 6 November 2009 to the Lowy Institute , in which you publicly expressed some concern at my approach to the climate question , has prompted several leading Australian citizens to invite me come on tour to explain myself in a series of lectures in Australia later this month .
I am writing to offer personal briefings on why “ global warming ” is a non-problem to you and other party leaders during my visit .
For convenience , I am copying this letter to them , and to the Press .
Your speech mentioned my remarks about the proposal for world “ government ” in the early drafts of what had been intended as a binding Copenhagen Treaty .
These proposals were not , as you suggested , a “ conspiracy theory ” from the “ far right ” with “ zero basis in evidence ” .
Your staff will find them in paragraphs 36 - 38 of the main text of Annex 1 to the 15 September draft of the Treaty .
The word “ government ” appears twice at paragraph 38 .
After much adverse publicity in democratic countries , including Australia , the proposals were reluctantly dropped before Copenhagen .
You say I am one of “ those who argue that any multilateral action is by definition evil ” .
On the contrary : my first question is whether any action at all is required , to which – as I shall demonstrate – the objective economic and scientific answer is No .
Even if multilateral action were required , which it is not , national governments in the West are by tradition democratically elected .
Therefore , a fortiori , transnational or global governments should also be made and unmade by voters at the ballot - box .
The climate ought not to be used as a shoddy pretext for international bureaucratic - centralist dictatorship .
We committed Europeans have had more than enough of that already with the unelected but all - powerful Kommissars of the hated EU , who make nine - tenths of our laws by decree ( revealingly , they call them “ Directives ” or “ Commission Regulations ” ) .
The Kommissars ( that is the official German word for them ) inflict their dictates upon us regardless of what the elected European or any other democratic Parliament says or wishes .
Do we want a worldwide EU ?
No .
You say I am one of “ those who argue that climate change does not represent a global market failure ” .
Yet it is only recently that opinion sufficient to constitute a market signal became apparent in the documents of the IPCC , which is , however , a political rather than a scientific entity .
There has scarcely been time for a “ market failure ” .
Besides , corporations are falling over themselves to cash in on the giant financial fraud against the little guy that carbon taxation and trading have already become in the goody - two - shoes EU – and will become in Australia if you get your way .
You say I was one of “ those who argue that somehow the market will magically solve the problem ” .
In fact I have never argued that , though in general the market is better at solving problems than the habitual but repeatedly - failed dirigisme of the etatistes predominant in the classe politique today .
The questions I address are a ) whether there is a climate problem at all ; and b ) even if there is one , and even if per impossibile it is of the hilariously - overblown magnitude imagined by the IPCC , whether waiting and adapting as and if necessary is more cost - effective than attempting to mitigate the supposed problem by trying to reduce the carbon dioxide our industries and enterprises emit .
Let us pretend , solum ad argumentum , that a given proportionate increase in CO2 concentration causes the maximum warming imagined by the IPCC .
The IPCC ’s bureaucrats are careful not to derive a function that will convert changes in CO2 concentration directly to equilibrium changes in temperature .
I shall do it for them .
We derive the necessary implicit function from the IPCC ’s statement to the effect that equilibrium surface warming ΔT at CO2 doubling will be ( 3.26 ± ln 2 ) C° .
Since the IPCC , in compliance with Beer ’s Law , defines the radiative forcing effect of CO2 as logarithmic rather than linear , our implicit function can be derived at once .
The coefficient is the predicted warming at CO2 doubling divided by the logarithm of 2 , and the term ( C/C 0 ) is the proportionate increase in CO2 concentration .
Thus ,
ΔT = ( 4.7 ± 1 ) ln( C/C 0 ) | Celsius degrees
We are looking at the IPCC ’s maximum imagined warming rate , so we simply write –
ΔT = 5.7 ln( C/C 0 ) | Celsius degrees
Armed with this function telling us the maximum equilibrium warming that the IPCC predicts from any given change in CO2 concentration , we can now determine , robustly , the maximum equilibrium warming that is likely to be forestalled by any proposed cut in the current upward path of CO2 emissions .
Let me demonstrate .
By the end of this month , according to the Copenhagen Accord , all parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change are due to report what cuts in emissions they will make by 2020 .
Broadly speaking , the Annex 1 parties , who will account for about half of global emissions over the period , will commit to reducing current emissions by 30 % by 2020 , or 15 % on average in the decade between now and 2020 .
Thus , if and only if every Annex 1 party to the Copenhagen Accord complies with its obligations to the full , today ’s emissions will be reduced by around half of that 15 % , namely 7.5 % , compared with business as usual .
If the trend of the past decade continues , with business as usual we shall add 2 ppmv/year , or 20 ppmv over the decade , to atmospheric CO2 concentration .
Now , 7.5 % of 20 ppmv is 1.5 ppmv .
We determine the warming forestalled over the coming decade by comparing the business - as - usual warming that would occur between now and 2020 if we made no cuts in CO2 emissions with the lesser warming that would follow full compliance with the Copenhagen Accord .
Where today ’s CO2 concentration is 388 ppmv –
Business as usual : ΔT = 5.7 ln( 408.0/388 ) = 0.29 C°
– Copenhagen Accord : ΔT = 5.7 ln( 406.5/388 ) = 0.27 C°
= “ Global warming ” forestalled , 2010 - 2020 : 0.02 C°
One - fiftieth of a Celsius degree of warming forestalled is all that complete , global compliance with the Copenhagen Accord for an entire decade would achieve .
Yet the cost of achieving this result – an outcome so small that our instruments would not be able to measure it – would run into trillions of dollars .
Do your Treasury models demonstrate that this calculation is in any way erroneous ?
If they do , junk them .
You say “ formal global and national economic modelling ” shows “ that the costs of inaction are greater than the costs of acting ” .
You ask for my “ equivalent evidence basis to Treasury modelling published by the Government of the industry and employment impacts of climate change ” .
I respond that the rigorous calculation that I have described , which your officials may verify for themselves , shows that whatever costs may be imagined to flow from anthropogenic “ global warming ” will scarcely be mitigated at all , even by trillions of dollars of expenditure over the coming decade .
Every economic analysis except that of the now - discredited Lord Stern , with its near - zero discount rate and its absurdly inflated warming rates , comes to the same ineluctable conclusion : adaptation to climate change , in whatever direction , as and if necessary , is orders of magnitude more cost - effective than attempts at mitigation .
In a long career in policy analysis in and out of government , I have never seen so cost - ineffective a proposed waste of taxpayers ’ money as the trillions which today ’s scientifically - illiterate governments propose to spend on attempting – with all the plausibility of King Canute – to stop the tide from coming in .
Remember that I have done this calculation on the basis that everyone who should comply with the Copenhagen Accord actually does comply .
Precedent does not look promising .
The Kyoto Protocol , the Copenhagen Accord ’s predecessor , has been in operation for more than a decade , and it was supposed to reduce global CO2 emissions by 2012 .
So far , after billions spent on global implementation of Kyoto , global CO2 emissions have risen compared with when Kyoto was first signed .
Remember too that we have assumed the maximum warming that the CO2 imagines might occur in response to a given proportionate increase in CO2 concentration .
Yet even the IPCC ’s central estimate of CO2 ’s warming effect , according to an increasing number of serious papers in the peer - reviewed literature , is a five - fold exaggeration .
If those papers are right , after a further decade of incomplete compliance and billions squandered , warming forestalled may prove to be just a thousandth of a degree .
Now ask yourself this .
Are you , personally , and your advisers , personally , and your administration ’s officials , personally , willing to make the heroically pointless sacrifices that you so insouciantly demand of others in the name of Saving The Planet For Future Generations ?
I beg leave to think not .
At Flag 1
I have attached what I have reason to believe is a generally accurate list of the names and titles of the delegation that you led to Copenhagen to bring back the non-result whose paltriness , pointlessness and futility we have now rigorously demonstrated .
There are 114 names on the list .
One hundred and fourteen .
Enough to fill a mid-sized passenger jet .
Half a dozen were all that was really necessary – and perhaps one from each State in Australia .
If you and your officials are not willing to tighten your belts when a tempting foreign junket at taxpayers ’ expense is in prospect , why , pray , should the taxpayers tighten theirs ?
You say that climate - change “ deniers ” – nasty word , that , and you should really have known better than to use it – are “ small in number but too dangerous to be ignored ” , and “ well resourced ” .
In fact , governments , taxpayer - funded organizations , taxpayer - funded teachers , and taxpayer - funded environmental groups have spent something like 50,000 times as much on “ global warming ” propaganda as their opponents have spent on debunking this new and cruel superstition .
And that is before we take account of the relentless prejudice of the majority of the mainstream news media .
How , then , it is that we , the supposed minority who will not admit that the emperor of “ global warming ” is adequately clad , are somehow prevailing ?
How is it that we are convincing more and more of the population not to place any more trust in the “ global warming ” theory ?
The answer is that the “ global warming ” theory is not true , and no amount of bluster or braggadocio , ranting or rodomontade will make it true .
You say that our aim , in daring to oppose the transient fashion for apocalypticism , is “ to erode just enough of the political will that action becomes impossible ” .
No .
Our aim is simply to ensure that the truth is widely enough understood to prevent the squandering of precious resources on addressing the non-problem of anthropogenic “ global warming ” .
The correct policy response to a non-problem is to have the courage to do nothing .
No interventionist likes to do nothing .
Nevertheless , the do - nothing option , scientifically and economically speaking , is the right option .
You say that I and others like me base our thinking on the notion that “ the cost of not acting is nothing ” .
Well , after a decade and a half with no statistically - significant “ global warming ” , and after three decades in which the mean warming rate has been well below the ever - falling predictions of the UN ’s climate panel , that notion has certainly not been disproven in reality .
However , the question I address is not that but this .
Is the cost of taking action many times greater than the cost of not acting ?
The answer to this question is Yes .
Millions are already dying of starvation in the world ’s poorest nations because world food prices have doubled in two years .
That abrupt , vicious doubling was caused by a sharp drop in world food production , caused in turn by suddenly taking millions of acres of land out of growing food for people who need it , so as to grow biofuels for clunkers that do n’t .
The scientifically - illiterate , economically - innumerate policies that you advocate – however fashionable you may conceive them to be – are killing people by the million .
You say my logic “ belongs in a casino , not a science lab ” .
Yet it is you who are gambling with poor people ’s lives , and it is you – or , rather , they – who are losing : and losing not merely their substance but their very existence .
The biofuel scam is born of the idiotic notion – a notion you uncritically espouse – that increasing by less than 1/2000 this century the proportion of the Earth ’s atmosphere occupied by CO2 may prove catastrophic .
At a time when so many of the world ’s people are already short of food , the UN ’s right - to - food rapporteur , Herr Ziegler , has roundly and rightly condemned the biofuel scam as nothing less than “ a crime against humanity ” .
The scale of the slaughter is monstrous , with food riots ( largely unreported in the Western news media , and certainly not mentioned by you in your recent speech ) in a dozen regions of the Third World over the past two years .
Yet this cruel , unheeded slaughter is founded upon a lie : the claim by the IPCC that it is 90 % certain that most of the “ global warming ” since 1950 is manmade .
This claim – based not on science but on a show of hands among political representatives , with China wanting a lower figure and other nations wanting a higher figure – is demonstrably , self - servingly false .
Peer - reviewed analyses of changes in cloud cover over recent decades – changes almost entirely unconnected with changes in CO2 concentration – show that it was this largely - natural reduction in cloud cover from 1983 - 2001 and a consequent increase in the amount of short - wave and UV solar radiation reaching the Earth that accounted for five times as much warming as CO2 could have caused .
Nor is the IPCC ’s great lie the only lie .
If you will allow me to brief you and your advisers , I will show you lie after lie after lie after lie in the official documents of the IPCC and in the speeches of its current chairman , who has made himself a multi-millionaire as a “ global warming ” profiteer .
However , if you will not make the time to hear me for half an hour before you commit your working people to the futile indignity of excessive taxation and pointless over - regulation without the slightest scientific or economic justification , and to outright confiscation of their farmland without compensation on the fatuous pretext that the land is a “ carbon sink ” , then I hope that you will at least nominate one of the scientists on your staff to address the two central issues that I have raised in this letter : namely , the egregious cost - ineffectiveness of attempting to mitigate “ global warming ” by emissions reduction , and the measured fact , well demonstrated in the scientific literature , that a largely - natural change in cloud cover in recent decades caused five times as much “ global warming ” as CO2 .
It is also a measured fact that , while those of the UN ’s computer models that can be forced with an increase in sea-surface temperatures all predict a consequent fall in the flux of outgoing radiation at top of atmosphere , in observed reality there is an increase .
In short , the radiation that is supposed to be trapped here in the troposphere to cause “ global warming ” is measured as escaping to space much as usual , so that it cannot be causing more than around one - fifth of the warming the IPCC predicts .
My list of the Copenhagen junketers from Australia ’s governing class is attached .
All those taxpayer dollars squandered , just to forestall 0.02 C° of “ global warming ” in ten years .
Yet , in the past decade and a half , there has been no “ global warming ” at all .
Can you not see that it would be kinder to your working people to wait another decade and see whether global temperatures even begin to respond as the IPCC has predicted ?
What is the worst that can happen if you wait ?
Just 0.02
C° of global warming that would not otherwise have occurred .
It ’s a no -brainer .
Yours faithfully ,

We 've told you about Operation Chokehold , the attack on AT&T 's network scheduled for Friday , but now AT&T has something to say about as well .
They 're not exactly happy and throw around words like " irresponsible , " " pointless , " and " nothing amusing . "
Ouch !

This is what an AT&T spokesperson contacted by Cult of Mac said about the plot :
We understand that fakesteve .
net is primarily a satirical forum , but there is nothing amusing about advocating that customers attempt to deliberately degrade service on a network that provides critical communications services for more than 80 million customers .
We know that the vast majority of customers will see this action for what it is : an irresponsible and pointless scheme to draw attention to a blog .

I sincerely doubt that this statement will affect Operation Chokehold 's attempt to make the AT&T network pee its panties as it runs crying to mama , but I suppose we 'll see what happens this Friday .
What are your guesses though ?
Will iPhone data start crawling at an even slower pace than usual ?

The fastest man-made object ever built , the Pluto - bound New Horizons probe , is now closer to the former planet than Earth , just a little under four years after its launch .
It 's currently traveling at about 31,000 miles an hour and is located about 1.527 billion miles from Earth .
" Today , 29 Dec 2009 , New Horizons crossed a milestone boundary – henceforth we 're now closer to Pluto than to Earth .
Go New Horizons ! " the mission 's controllers tweeted Tuesday .
The spacecraft will be the first to fly by Pluto , the planet or dwarf planet or plutoid , and on to the other objects lurking in the Kuiper Belt at the edge of the solar system .
While the craft is hibernating most of the time while it awaits its July 2015 rendezvous with Pluto , it was roused for a Jupiter flyby that yielded some gorgeously detailed images of that planet and its satellites .
Unlike an orbiter , much of the New Horizons activity will come in an action - packed nine day period around July 14 , 2015 when the craft approaches and then passes by Pluto .
During that time , the probe will capture 4.5 gigabytes of data , which it will keep sending on the four - and - a - half - hour trip back home for months .
With its main mission accomplished , the craft will continue moving away from the sun , following in the extrasolar footsteps of the earlier Pioneer and Voyager missions , drifting ever farther away from us .
Instead of the plaques attached to the earlier ships , which presumably identify the spacecraft as artifacts of Earthly civilization , New Horizons carries a DVD inscribed with 450,000 names of supporters and some of the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh , who discovered Pluto in 1930 .

VIDEO - In the backdrop of reconciliation efforts between Hamas and Fatah , Hamas ' television aired a cartoon titled " Special Mission " slandering the Palestinian Authority apparatuses , which , according to the clip , serve Israel and the settlers .
Turkish Propaganda Turkish TV show has IDF soldiers ' killing ' Palestinian kids Daniel Edelson
New prime - time program on Ankara 's state - sponsored channel TRT1 depicts monstrous image of Israeli military as bloodthirsty , murderous .
Foreign Minister Lieberman summons acting Turkish ambassador following
Ynet report , says ' This is a serious case of state - sponsored incitement ' Turkish TV show has IDF soldiers ' killing ' Palestinian kids
The video portrays a Palestinian officer carrying out orders of IDF troops while being humiliated by them , and assitsting settlers .
The eight - minute video takes place near the security coordination HQ .
Palestinian officer Bahlul ( clown ) is shown to be asked by his Israeli counterpart : " What is your mission ? " to which he replies : " To defend the rule of law . "
When the Israeli officer asks what that is , the Palestinian replies : " To defend settlers . "
He also notes that settler provocations will not be disturbed or responded to by the Palestinians when asked how he would react in such a case .
The video portrays Bahlul as saying that should he get an order from his Israeli colleague to arrest his family members he would do it .
He notes that he is willing to fight the resistance and even shine the shoes of the Israeli officer and as a bonus to kiss them as well .
" I 'll divorce my wife if you tell me to , " he said .
The Palestinian officer is also seen trying to defend an Israeli settler who shot Palestinian children in Hebron .
He shouts at the settler " you just killed my people , but I will respond with a commitment to peace . "
At this point in the clip , Bahlul draws a dove and presents it to the settler who had went on a killing spree by his father 's orders .
According to the setller 's father " the most delicious thing is to kill Palestinians and drink their blood . "
In the video Bahlul is also seen beating a Palestinian boy since his Israeli counterpart told him that the child had hurled stones at soldiers .
Reconciliation ?
Meanwhile , Hamas politburo chief Khaled Mashaal said Sunday the Islamist group was in the final stages of achieving reconciliation with the rival Palestinian Fatah party after he met Saudi Arabian officials to try to narrow the rift .
At the end of the meeting he said , " There has been progress in efforts to reach a reconciliation , Hamas is willing to sign the Egyptian reconciliation document , as long as its comments will be taken into account . "
However , Fatah Central Committee member Mohammed Dahlan said that Hamas was n't ready and able to reach reconciliation .
He further noted , " There 's an alliance of interests between Hamas and Israel to weaken the PA and harm it .
The only chance to reach reconciliation is when the sane people in Hamas decide to go back on the coup they carried out . "
' By having a paywall , you are cutting your journalism off from the world ' guardian.co.uk
The Guardian editor - in- chief , Alan Rusbridger , has delivered a riposte to Rupert Murdoch 's campaign to introduce paywalls to newspaper websites , claiming that it could lead the industry to a " sleepwalk into oblivion " .
Delivering the 2010 Hugh Cudlipp lecture at London College of Communication today , Rusbridger said that universal charging for newspaper content on the internet would remove the industry from a digital revolution which is allowing news organisations to engage with their readers more than ever before .
Rusbridger described universal paywalls as " a hunch " and said that the newspaper industry would learn valuable lessons from trying different business models , including staying generally free while charging for specialist content or asking readers to pay on different platforms , such as mobile .
Last year Murdoch revealed that he would introduce charges for access to all his news websites , including the Times , Sunday Times and the News of the World by this summer .
Last week the New York Times confirmed that it too would introduce a paywall to its website by 2011 .
Rusbridger pointed out that News Corp has frequently used the price of news to attack rivals .
" Murdoch , who has in his time flirted with free models and who has ruthlessly cut the price of his papers to below cost in order to win audiences or drive out competition ( ' reach before revenue ' , as it was n't called back when he slashed the price of the Times to as low as 10 p ) , this same Rupert Murdoch is being very vocal in asserting that the reader must pay a proper sum for content – whether in print or digitally , " he said .
" Fleet Street is the birthplace of the tradition of a free press that spread around the world .
There is an irreversible trend in society today which rather wonderfully continues what we as an industry started – here , in newspapers , in the UK .
" It 's not a ' digital trend ' .
It 's a trend about how people are expressing themselves , about how societies will choose to organise themselves , about a new democracy of ideas and information , about changing notions of authority , about the releasing of individual creativity , about resisting the people who want to close down free speech .
" If we turn our back on all this and at the same time conclude that there is nothing to learn from it then , never mind business models , we could be sleepwalking into oblivion .
" If you erect a universal pay wall around your content then it follows you are turning away from a world of openly shared content .
Again , there may be sound business reasons for doing this , but editorially it is about the most fundamental statement anyone could make about how newspapers see themselves in relation to the newly - shaped world . "
The Guardian editor told an audience of academics and journalists in London that it is more important than ever to focus on journalism : " If you think about journalism , not business models , you can become rather excited about the future .
If you only think about business models you can scare yourself into total paralysis . "
Rusbridger quoted Sir Martin Sorrell , one of the most influential figures in advertising , who said he expected the digital share of his $ 14bn ( £ 8.6 bn ) business to more than double by 2014 .
With the global financial crisis gripping , Rusbridger said it was too soon to write off digital advertising as a significant element in supporting journalism .
He added that his commercial colleagues currently believed a paywall would earn a fraction of what the Guardian was already earning in digital revenues .
It was not right to hobble the BBC and other excellent public service broadcasters to give pay walls a better chance of success , Rusbridger said before noting that British newspapers thinking about pay walls had to compete with a free Sky TV news site as well as the BBC .
Governments , NGOs , scientists , arts organisations and universities were all learning how to publish their own content and link it .
Newspapers had to be part of this web , not simply " on " it .
Rusbridger said that newspapers ' growth of digital audiences ought to be a cause for celebration .
" In an industry in which we get used to every trend line pointing to the floor , the growth of newspapers ' digital audience should be a beacon of hope . "
He said the Guardian 's digital growth was currently running at 40 % – with serious areas of content growing fastest .
" Growth is n't being bought by tricks or by setting chain - gangs of reporters early in the morning to rewrite stories about Lady Gaga or Katie Price .
In that same period last year , our biggest growth areas were environment ( up 137 % ) , technology ( up 125 % ) and art and design ( up 84 % ) .
He noted that roughly a third of the Guardian 's 37 million unique users came from North America – at a total marketing spend over 10 years of only $ 34,000 ( £ 20,942 ) .
He contrasted the influence of UK papers in the US with that of 50 years ago , when the Manchester Guardian 's total foreign sale was 650 .

O'Brien said money men had replaced creative people at record labels
The music industry is suffering because financial pressures mean money is being put ahead of creativity , Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien has warned .
" I sense , and many artists sense , that it 's become dominated by money , and the need to make more money , " he said .
" And I think the problem with that is that the creativity 's gone out of the industry , the fun . "
O'Brien said the climate had changed in the last 10 years and " certainly it 's changed since we were signed " in 1991 .
O'Brien is a leading member of the Featured Artists ' Coalition , a lobby group for artists ' rights , which has often been at odds with the major record labels .
His band , who are currently in the studio , were signed to EMI until 2003 .
They released their last album In Rainbows via their own website as well as striking a one - off deal with independent label XL .
' Long - term problem '
Making comparisons with the industry in the 1960s and 70s , O'Brien said : " You realise there 's something hugely missing now .
" And I think that 's fun and creativity .
That was the main thing .
And I think the problem is that in the last 10 - 15 years it 's become about money and the money men are now running the companies , whereas traditionally it 's always been the creatives .
" So I think that 's a long - term thing and that 's important for the general health of the industry . "
O'Brien 's comments were made in a video message to the Midem music conference in Cannes .
He said the music industry 's current upheavals , however , presented big opportunities to bring creativity back .
" What 's great about the moment is the very fact that we 're living in this time of change , huge uncertainty , and of course these times are always accompanied by fear for some people .
" But I think there 's huge scope for massive innovation and creativity and that 's exactly what this industry needs , in my humble opinion . "

Norwegian developer Funcom has apparently sent out newsletters to Age of Conan : Hyborian Adventures - users with inactive accounts , notifying them that any low - level characters remaining on their accounts will be deleted as part of maintenance in the near future , unless the users choose to reactivate their accounts .
All characters belonging to active accounts , as well as characters above level 20 on inactive accounts will remain available after the maintenance .
In the message , of which a copy can be found after the jump , Funcom also offers the former users a ‘ limited time offer ’ of an additional 7 days of playing time if they choose to reactivate their accounts at this time .
Several recipients of the message have already complained about the move , feeling that Funcom is blackmailing them into reactivating their subscription and holding their low - level characters hostage for ransom , with the ‘ limited time offer ’ being viewed by some as an insult - to - injury .
The full message that was sent out by Funcom was as follows :
NASHVILLE , Jan. 30 ( UPI ) --
Tennessee high schools will be getting guidelines from the state next fall on teaching the Bible as part of a secular curriculum .
The state Board of Education approved the guidelines Thursday , implementing a 2008 state law calling for " non-sectarian , non-religious academic study of the Bible , " The ( Nashville ) Tennessean reported .
The guidelines include a requirement that literature from other religions be available for students .
Bible courses cannot be compulsory .

Brenda Ables , a social studies specialist with the state , said schools are not required to offer a Bible class .
Schools that have been offering courses in the Bible do not have to change their curriculum unless they have a court challenge .
Hedy Weinberg , head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee , said few details had been released .
She said the board appeared to have been sensitive to constitutional issues .
" Whether these classes are constitutional depends on who teaches them and how they are taught , " she said .
" The devil is in the details . "

Blitz Ball :
A strategy game disguised as an arcade title , the game is about racking up points by setting up combos strategically .
The player controls a cannon and fires balls into the play field to hit and clear the ' ORBS ' in the field .
Each ORB must be hit a specific number of times to be removed and every cannon ball launched will turn into and orb in the end .
Shatter the ' ORBS ' and score high !
This little game is surprising , just once you think you 've got a system down and are racking up the big points it turns around throws a curveball at you .

Which Anarchism ?
Which Autonomism ?
Between Anarchism and Autonomist Marxism
Heather Gautney
WorkingUSA
Vol.12 , No.3 , September 2009
Anarchists and autonomist Marxists played a vital role in the development of the Alternative Globalization Movement ( AGM ) , especially with regard to their distinct contributions and insights in the realm of strategy and organization .
Despite their common anticapitalist and antiauthoritarian orientation , however , their practical and theoretical approaches to issues of organization and change remain substantially different and in some contexts have been deeply divisive .
This paper explores the theoretical and practical similarities and differences between anarchists and autonomists .
It begins with an analysis of the tenuous binary between “ lifestyle ” and “ social ” anarchism , primarily within the U.S. , where anarchism has significantly impacted AGM activism .
What follows is a discussion of autonomist movements in Italy and Germany from the 1950s onward .
The article then compares both tendencies in terms of how they balance the organizational requisites for change with their desires for freedom .
After the smashing of the Niketown and Starbuck ’s windows at the 1999 Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , the mainstream press marveled at the appearance of a new generation of “ anarchist ” protesters .
Time Magazine journalist Michael Krantz wrote about “ How Organized Anarchists Led Seattle into Chaos ” to gripe about the young vandals and express his awe at how well organized they seemed to be : “ The anarchist movement today is a sprawling welter of thousands of mostly young activists populating hundreds of mostly tiny splinter groups espousing dozens of mostly socialist critiques of the capitalist machine .
Ironically , the groups are increasingly organized . . . ” ( Krantz 1999 ) .
Newsweek , The Wall Street Journal , and various other mainstream newspapers and magazines later derided these same activists as young , violent and destructive , politically incoherent , and terrorist .
Seattle was just one of many manifestations of the Alternative Globalization Movement ( AGM ) , whose origins can be traced to the anti-International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) riots of the 1970s in Peru , Liberia , Ghana , Jamaica , Egypt , and Germany in the 1980s ( Katsiaficas 2001 ; Starr 2006 ) .
A truly global movement , from the 1990s onward the AGM was composed of a vast network of social and political actors including indigenous peoples ’ movements ; human rights and ecology advocates ; socialists , communists , and social democrats ; nongovernmental organization ( NGO ) , interfaith and trade union activists ; and many others .
The AGM essentially served as a catchall for the large collection of groups and movements opposed to neoliberalism , although there was not , by any means , general consensus regarding the mechanisms of resistance or what alternative social and political formations might replace it .
Oftentimes , divisions among participants were reflected in the names different groups assigned to the AGM ’s network .
In an effort to combat media misrepresentation of the “ antiglobalist ” label , for example , some activists and organizations resorted to the name “ Global Justice Movement ” to emphasize their goal to establish more egalitarian forms of globalization .
Although popular , especially among NGOs , the title proved to be less than inadequate because philosophical and ethical meanings of “ justice ” varied so significantly among the network ’s constituents .
Interfaith groups , for example , derive their sense of justice from divine law and posit God as an ultimate authority .
Others locate justice in a universal rule of law that they feel has been violated by neoliberalism ’s privileging of corporate interests and uneven and undemocratic distribution of political power .
These groups designated “ civil society ” and public opinion as key representatives of justice but also acknowledge the authority of legal structures and systems of civil and political rights .
While these first two groups may have welcomed the “ Global Justice Movement ” title , others , including many anarchists and autonomists , reject it entirely because they do not acknowledge states , nations , deities , or legal systems as legitimate authorities over social life or guarantors of freedom .
[ See also : ‘ Anti-capitalism ’ as ideology … and as movement ? ’ , Aufheben , 2002 / Treason Press pamphlet , 2003 . ]
Despite the diversity of political , ethical , and tactical orientations in the AGM , anarchists attracted a great deal of attention in and outside the movement , especially in the U.S. Police and mainstream media identified anarchists with the “ black bloc , ” whose dramatic appearance and unconventional tactics appeared as something new and threatening .
[ See also : The Black Bloc Papers : An Anthology of Primary Texts From The North American Anarchist Black Bloc 1998 - 2005 , Edited and compiled by David Van Deusen & Xavier Massot of The Green Mountain Anarchist Collective , 2009 . ]
Within the movement , however , anarchism has inspired a much broader array of activists .
As Barbara Epstein ( 2001 ) commented , “ ( m ) any among today ’s young radical activists , especially those at the center of the anti-globalization and anti-corporate movements , call themselves anarchists . . . anarchism is the dominant perspective within the movement . ”
While Epstein perhaps inappropriately assigns the label “ anarchism ” to a politically heterogeneous set of actors , her instinct is not entirely wrong .
Many of the activists in the AGM , for example , adopted direct - action tactics and organizational forms that reflect key aspects of anarchist praxis .
As David Graeber ( 2002 ) put it ,
The very notion of direct action , with its rejection of a politics which appeals to governments to modify their behavior , in favor of physical intervention against state power in a form that prefigures an alternative — all of this emerges directly from the libertarian tradition .
Anarchism is the heart of the movement , its soul ; the source of most of what ’s new and hopeful about it .
Alongside anarchists , other prominent groups in the AGM , like the Italian tute bianche ( “ white overalls ” ) , cited autonomist Marxism as their primary influence .
In the opening pages of Storming Heaven , Steven Wright ( 2002 ) describes the influence of autonomisim on the “ upsurge of anti-statist politics ” associated with the AGM : “ [ i ] f much of this resurgence can rightly be claimed by various anarchist tendencies , autonomist Marxism has also encountered renewed interest of late ” .
This renewed interest is based in large part on anarchist and autonomist movements ’ common emphasis on building alternative forms of sociality outside electoral , state , and other forms of conventional politics and cultural practice .
While some of these groups literally seek to “ smash the state ” as well as the corporation , school , and other agents of social control , others remain committed to movement building and challenging all illegitimate forms of authority that deflect power away from everyday people ( Graeber and Grubacic 2004 ) .
Many autonomists and anarchists believe that radical change , and ultimately , freedom and the good life , can be discovered through direct action ( protests , but also various forms of “ squatting ” ) and the development of cooperative projects and countercultural communities , and not through the realization of a predetermined revolutionary moment or participation in electoral processes abstracted from the conditions of daily life .
They distinguish themselves from other groups on “ the left ” by linking their antistatism with an anticapitalist critique of the ways in which exploitation and the logic of state sovereignty have permeated all levels of social life .
They tend to be critical of progressive NGOs and social democratic groups that seek to bolster social programs and political influence within legal structures and the electoral sphere rather than argue for a more systemic change .
Despite their common anticapitalist , antiauthoritarian , and antisystemic orientation — which has set them apart from other groups in the AGM — substantial differences exist among anarchists and autonomists over issues related to strategy , organization , and practice .
This article explores some of these theoretical and practical similarities and differences .
It begins with an analysis of the tenuous binary between “ lifestyle ” and “ social ” anarchism , primarily within the U.S. , where anarchism has significantly impacted the movements .
What follows is a discussion of autonomist movements in Italy and Germany from the 1950s on .
The article then compares both tendencies in terms of how they balance the organizational requisites for change with their desires for freedom .
Born in Europe in the mid-1800s , anarchism as a political strategy has varied in its relevance in the landscape of left politics both in the U.S. and beyond .
In the 1930s , for example , anarchism took a backseat to Communist Party and trade union politics and the industrial and unemployed workers ’ movements that empowered them .
Thirty years later , it emerged in the context of the 1960s counterculture , which was critical not only of the state but of most other forms of authority .
While the mainstream civil rights movement focused primarily on juridical solutions to racial inequality , anarchists made strange bedfellows with Christian civil rights activists concerned with organizational ethics and direct action .
In the throes of the Cold War , they also found kindred spirits in the New Left , especially among radical feminists and student groups characterized by their rejection of centralized and bureaucratic organization .
Sixties activists were not only critical of capitalism but also of the patriarchal state and all forms of authority , overregulation , and social control ( see Haraway 1991 ; Rupp and Taylor 1999 ; Willis 1992 ) .
Into the 1970s , the anti-Vietnam era produced a mix of militants also critical of Old Left bureaucracy — factions of Students for a Democratic Society , for instance — and while the antinuclear power movements in the U.S. and Europe featured affinity groups and consensus decision making popular among today ’s anarchists , they also gave birth to punk , which resisted the cultural consensus of the conservative 1980s on the level of style .

As countless theorists have pointed out , it is nearly impossible to present a single theory of anarchism .
Not only are there multiple strands — anarcho - syndicalism , primitivism , mysticism , communist anarchism , libertarian socialism , and so on — but anarchism itself generally eschews the very idea of formulating ( for them , imposing ) a general , all - encompassing theory to explain social phenomena , especially revolution and social change .
Anarchism is perhaps better understood by its methods and principles rather than through a single , unified theory or political strategy ( Chomsky 2005 , 18 ; Graeber 2004 ; Grubacic 2006 ; Neal 1997 ) .
Because of the lack of a unified theory , anarchism is often criticized as aimless , formless , and strategically unrealistic in advanced capitalist societies marked by deep consumerism and acute political hierarchy .
Advocates point out , however , that it is precisely within technologically advanced societies that decentralized , nonhierarchical , and radically democratic forms of organization can occur , even on a global scale ( Aronowitz and DiFazio 1994 ; Chomsky 2005 ) .

Anarchism may resist submission to a general theory , but it does not lack an organizational perspective .
Historically , anarchist organizations have ranged from small affinity groups and decentralized communities to large - scale movements and networks .
The origins of affinity group praxis can be traced back to the 1930s [ sic ] with the Spanish Federación Anarquista Ibérica , anarcho - syndicalists working inside the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo trade union that organized a mass movement of several thousands .
In more contemporary settings , affinity groups were used in the 1970s anti nuclear power campaigns in Germany and the U.S. ( Starhawk 2008 ) , and more recently , among groups at anti-G8 , WTO , and World Bank protests associated with the AGM ( Alach 2008 ) .
[ NB .
Affinity groups originally emerged in the late nineteenth century among Spanish anarchist - communist workers .

On the FAI , see : Stuart Christie , We The Anarchists ! : A Study Of The Iberian Anarchist Federation ( FAI ) 1927 –1937 , AK Press , 2008 ; We , The Anarchists – An Interview with Stuart Christie ( by Chuck Morse ) , Revolution by the Book , February 2 , 2009 . ]
The affinity groups in the U.S. AGMs were comprised of roughly five to fifteen people , with an agreed upon commitment of mutual support .
The extent of the commitment within groups could vary widely : some converged specifically for demonstrations , direct actions , and other political activity , whereas others connected more regularly in the spheres of daily life such as the university or high school , community , and work settings .
In addition to providing mutual support , they shared common political views or interests that served as a basis for their collective affinity .
Trust and political compatibility were the glue that held many of these groups together , especially in vulnerable protest situations but also in the spaces of the every day .
Despite the importance of organization to many anarchists , the public perception of them as individualist and nihilistic is not entirely unfounded , but it is widely misunderstood .
Anarchist individualism is often associated with “ lifestyle anarchism , ” which has its roots in the egoism of Max Stirner .
Stirner was by no means a nihilist , but he did argue for the primacy of self - determination and self - mastery over the demands and obligations of social life including those associated with friends and family .
Among anarchists , lifestylers are often counterposed , albeit tenuously , to “ social anarchists ” who advocate for an antiauthoritarianism or statelessness rooted in the thought of Michael Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin , both of whom identified as socialists .
In his critique of lifestyle anarchism , Murray Bookchin ( 1995 ) traced the development of lifestylism from Stirner to nineteenth - century bohemians , who , he asserted , selfishly romanticized their alienation from mainstream society , expressed through “ outrageous ” clothing , and “ aberrant ” lifestyles .
Bookchin also pointed to more contemporary examples of lifestylism including Hakim Bey ’s well - known essay on Temporary Autonomous Zones ( TAZs ) , in which Bey extols the virtues of “ autonomous ” spaces for release and self - actualization , off the grid of social control .
TAZs are spaces that enable one to live authentically , release his or her self from past and future , and experience moments of freedom in the present .
They offer a positive experience of individual freedom but also operate as a counterforce against the intrusion of state and market in the subjective realm ( Bey 1991 ) .
Bey ’s TAZ is said to have influenced the development of the wildly popular Burning Man festival , which eventually became co-opted by commercial enterprises as well as seemingly spontaneous “ flash mobs , ” in which groups of mostly strangers engage in nonsensical concerted actions such as meeting in public places dressed in silly outfits or freezing like statues at an agreed upon moment in frequently traveled venues like New York ’s Grand Central Station or shopping malls .
Despite the popularity of these experiences , Bookchin discredits Bey ’s work as “ an insurrection lived in the imagination of a juvenile brain , a safe retreat into unreality ” that ignores “ the basic social relationships of capitalist exploitation and domination . . . overshadowed by metaphysical generalizations about the ego and la technique , blurring public insight into the basic causes of social and ecological crises — commodity relations that spawn the corporate brokers of power , industry , and wealth ” ( Bookchin 1995 ) .
Similar to bohemianism , the punk subculture in Britain and the U.S. in the late 1970s and 1980s has also been categorized as part of the lifestyle tradition .
In the throes of the Reagan - Thatcher era , punks used the anarchist symbol — an “ A ” within a circle around it — to signify their penchant for chaos and refusal of authority but also for its shock value .
Some groups , like The Clash , exhibited strong Marxist tendencies , while others — the Sex Pistols , for instance — openly referred to themselves as anarchists in songs like “ Anarchy in the UK , ” which displayed a more nihilistic tendency : “ When there ’s no future , how can there be sin ?
We ’re the flowers in the dustbin .
We ’re the poison in your human machine .
We ’re the future , your future ” ( Sex Pistols 1977 ) .
Others , like Crass , reflected a more “ social ” anarchist disposition .
Crass criticized groups like The Clash and Sex Pistols for selling out to record labels and producers and becoming part of what they called the “ pop machine . ”
They were also critical of Oi ! and Chaos punks ’ machismo and produced an album — Penis Envy — entirely dedicated to radical feminism .
The band ’s anticapitalist project also involved selling records at low [ prices ] , playing free shows and benefits ( their last show was a benefit for striking miners ) and engaging in acts of sabotage such as spray - painting over advertisements in subway stations ( Appleford 2005 ) .
While “ punk ” was anything but homogenous , it did involve a radical and defiant “ Do It Yourself ” culture that fused lifestylism with social activism .
Punks created their own music , clothing stores , record labels , and presses outside the mainstream .
In this regard , it constituted a distinct form of revolt and refusal that played out on ( and disrupted ) the landscape of culture and style .
In doing so , it gave voice to significant numbers of young people disillusioned with the status quo and the authority structures that supported it .
In his effort to recover a political project for anarchism , Bookchin ignores how punk and bohemianism operated as social formations that exercised their power through the collective resistance of authority structures manifest in cultural norms and values .
Punks ’ challenge to authority hinged on what Dick Hebdige called their “ power to disfigure . ”
Mainstream fashion , music , and behavioral norms were not only refused ; they were actively and publicly violated .
Moreover , punk signified a breakdown in the very idea of consensus .
Because its refusal was motivated by desires for freedom and disgust for the status quo , and not relative deprivation , punks ’ resistance cut across class boundaries , disrupting typical categories of social and political representation altogether ( Hebdige 1979 , 5 – 22 ) .
Punks ’ disdain for authority and the legacy of the 1960s and early 1970s manifested in a seeming nihilism that was really about highlighting social problems they faced as a generation , including the steep decline in and betrayal of trade unionism , the death of working class culture , lack of future job prospects for young people , and the failure of a once vibrant left to pose significant challenges to the hegemony of the conservative right .
The distinction between lifestyle and social anarchism becomes even muddier when considering tactical issues , a subject that has won anarchists a great deal of media attention but also considerable trouble and controversy .
In the post -9/11 U.S. , for example , police began labeling property destruction as a terrorist act , justifying preemptive searches and other infringements on activists ’ civil liberties ( Starr 2006 , 61 ) .
Even before 9/11 , property destruction by anarchists and other groups was punished heavily : in 2001 , for example , twenty - two - year - old Jeffrey Luers was sentenced to over twenty - two years in prison for torching three sports utility vehicles ( SUVs ) and attempted arson of an empty oil tanker .
Years later , Stanislas Meyerhoff was sentenced to thirteen years for setting fire to a Eugene police substation , an SUV dealership , a tree farm , and a ski resort in Vail , Colorado .
During the hearing , the presiding judge told Meyerhoff : “ It was your intent to scare and frighten other people through a very dangerous and psychological act .
. . .
Your actions included elements of terrorism to achieve your goal ” ( Bernard 2007 ) .
Anarchists from Eugene were also held responsible for the widespread property damage in Seattle even though people from other areas and other political standpoints were involved .
Activist formations like the Earth Liberation Front ( ELF ) have been targeted by the FBI and named “ eco-terrorists ” even though ELF is really just a marker for any group or individual eco-activist ( ELF 2009 ) .
[ See : Green Is The New Red . ]
Because these activists claim to be motivated by concern for the environment and go to great lengths to ensure that their actions do not harm and threaten human and animal life , it is inaccurate to characterize them as nihilistic or terroristic , as compared to anarchists like “ Unabomber ” Ted Kaczynski1 or Alexander Berkman .
2
According to Avery Starr , sabotage , as a tactic , focuses on “ disruption when other options appear ineffective or impossible ” and is not aimed at inflicting violence , especially on people .
For groups like the Animal Liberation Front and ELF , the term ecotage has been used to describe a brand of self - defense ( the defense of animals and the environment ) that aims to “ move beyond ” civil disobedience but remain nonviolent .
As Starr ( 2006 ) points out , while such tactics have become controversial for today ’s militants , sabotage has been used by progressive movements throughout history , from labor struggles in the late nineteenth century to the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and anti nuclear power activity in Germany and elsewhere ( 64–5 ) .
In the context of the AGM protests , some socially oriented anarchists decided to forego property destruction or direct confrontation with police because they did not want to endanger other groups .
During the 2002 anti-World Economic Forum ( WEF ) demonstrations in New York , for example , anarchists engaged in “ snake marches ” ( roving , unsanctioned marches ) away from the main demonstration so as to not attract police brutality .
AGM activists accommodated their diversity of tactics on a broader scale through the practice of zoning protest territories according to level of risk : ( 1 ) “ green ” zones did not involve risk of arrest or police attack ; ( 2 ) “ yellow ” were reserved for civil disobedience and nonviolent direct action ; and ( 3 ) “ red ” included more confrontational tactics such as property destruction .
Red zones tended to be positioned in close proximity to meeting sites and police lines ( Starr 2006 , 67 ) .
The zone structure was used in protests around the world , but at events like the anti-Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) in Quebec City or the anti-G8 in Genoa , the sheer volume of tear gas in the air , the unruly nature of the events , and excessive police force made it difficult , if not impossible , for such lines to be maintained .
Despite efforts to embrace an array of tactics , the black bloc remained a subject of controversy within the AGM , especially among activists from liberal democratic NGOs , pacifists , and those associated with political parties and state officials .
Some activists of color derided their actions as symptomatic of race and class privilege ( Starr 2006 ) , and others chastised them for escalating police violence and rendering fellow protesters vulnerable to attack , asserting that the black bloc “ discredits the movement as a whole and that tactics should be decided democratically , not by small groups acting autonomously ” ( Epstein 2001 ) .
The black bloc was also scrutinized by people in and outside the movement for the increased police presence they tended to attract , which , their critics contended , diverted public funds away from much needed social services .
Perhaps the most serious criticism , however , was waged after the anti-G8 protests in Genoa when Italian police allegedly installed undercover officers and neofascists into the demonstration , and , posing as black bloc protesters , vandalized cars and small businesses to foster a poor public image of the AGM protesters and exacerbate divisions among them ( Graeber 2001 ; The Guardian 2008 ) .
It worked : many people in the movement scorned the black bloc for its rogue tactics , which , they asserted , made it difficult to differentiate between them and police provocateurs , endangered masses of people , and undermined the efforts of those more interested in large - scale disobedience than guerilla tactics or property destruction .
In an interview with Il Manifesto , for example , tute bianche spokesperson Luca Casarini criticized the black bloc at Genoa , asserting that “ They ’re people who believe that all it takes to strike at capitalism is to break a shop window .
. . .
We think differently .
We believe in a process of social transformation ” ( Shawki 2001 ) .
[ See also : ‘ Unmask Simulations In White Overalls ’ , Sasha K , 2001 . ]
Contrary to popular belief , the black bloc is not a particular group or organization ; it is a tactic that is said to have originated with the European autonomist and militant squatter youth ( Autonomen ) in the 1980s who were distinguished by their all - black clothing and masks ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 177 ) .
Black blocs are not necessarily composed of people who identify as “ anarchist , ” although their methods may reflect anarchist principles .
At AGM protests in the U.S. , for example , they tended to operate in “ free association , ” converging only temporarily for particular events or actions and organizing nonhierarchically .
Even when they did not agree on tactics at a given moment , there was a strong culture of tolerance and autonomy : each member was free to decide how and when to participate .
It is important to note , however , that the constitution of black blocs change with each action or venue .
Sometimes they increase the visibility of protests and provoke more direct confrontation with police or meeting delegates ; other times , they participate in main marches or protect them from police attack .
At anti-Iraq and Afghanistan war marches in the U.S. , they participated in legally sanctioned marches and , in some cases , heightened tensions by burning effigies or dramatically breaking out of central marches in packs to rove the city .
At the “ A16 ” ( April 16 ) protest in Washington , DC against the World Bank and the IMF , members of the black bloc served as a buffer from police ; at the World Bank and IMF summit in Prague in September 2000 , they threw stones at the cops and were generally more confrontational .
[ See : Crowd Bites Wolf , 2001 . ]
In Quebec City , they played a central role in breaching the large security wall around the meeting site , winning favor from other protesters ( Starr 2006 , 67 ) .
According to David Graeber , “ The spectacle of the Black Bloc [ in Quebec ] , armed with wire cutters and grappling hooks , joined by everyone from Steelworkers to Mohawk warriors to tear down the wall , became — for that very reason — one of the most powerful moments in the movement ’s history ” ( Graeber 2002 ) .
While protest tactics among lifestyle and social anarchists may not serve as reliable markers of difference , perhaps a clearer distinction can be established by looking at how each conceptualizes and attempts to operationalize freedom and autonomy .
Lifestyle anarchists emphasize spontaneity , temporariness , and the production of an underground , subversive existence against the fixed boundaries of conventional life .
Anarcho - primitivists , like John Zerzan , call for a return to the wild ( “ rewilding ” ) or primitive life as a way to recapture the freedom of nature , outside a market - dominated life mediated by technological developments and civilizing processes .
They tend to focus on personal freedom and escape as a solution to society ’s ills rather than understanding freedom as a collective construct .
Sean Penn ’s 2007 film “ Into the Wild ” depicts a diluted version of such primitivism through the life and death of Christopher McCandless , a young college graduate influenced by the work of Tolstoy and Thoreau , who rejected his middle - class life to “ rewild ” in the Alaskan forest .
[ See also : Derrick Jensen . ]
In contrast to anarchists interested in personal authenticity and building a life at the margins , social anarchists engage in movement building , community outreach , and collective forms of resistance , although many of them also enjoy unconventional lifestyles and live in squatter communities or other kinds of cooperative housing arrangements .
Unlike primitivists , they laud technological inventions like the Internet because it facilitates cooperation and interconnection .
Social anarchists are more apt to build relationships with other movement actors , including nonanarchists , whereas lifestylers are more likely to get involved in small group direct actions or retreat entirely into a life underground .
Many activists in the AGM , including “ social ” anarchists , cite the Italian Autonomia Operaia ( “ Worker ’s Autonomy ” ) movement of the 1970s as a significant influence .
Worker ’s Autonomy has its roots in operiasmo or workerism , which was a central force in the development of the Italian Left from the 1950s to the end of the 1970s .
Workerism emerged from Italian Communist Party ( PCI ) and Socialist Party critics like Raniero Panzieri and others , who sought to rethink Marxism amid a fledging , post - World War Two Italian economy that , within the span of the decade , would experience intense industrialization and economic growth .
Workerism ’s specificity lay in its focus on “ the real factory ” rather than building political programs based on abstract analyses of capitalism .
As Steven Wright put it , “ The most peculiar aspect of Italian workerism . . . was to be the importance it placed upon the relationship between the material structure of the working class , and its behavior as a subject autonomous from the dictates of both the labor movement and capital ” ( Wright 2002 , 3 , 6 ) .
For workerists , autonomy meant that class struggle would occur autonomously from the circulation of capital but also that it would not be led by traditional organizations of the Left such as the PCI or the country ’s national trade union , the Italian General Confederation of Labour ( CGIL ) ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 7 ) .
In its early years , however , workerism would maintain an ambiguous relationship to the PCI and the CGIL ; some supported PCI and union involvement in worker organization , while others rejected them vehemently as agents of compromise .
Following the war , Italian workers were making substantial gains in and outside the factory — from improvements in working conditions to “ freezes upon both layoffs and the price of bread ” — but Italy ’s industrializing process required a docile labor force , and the PCI , with its newfound political power , would more than once sell out its worker base for political gain ( Wright 2002 , 7 , 9 ) .
A key figure in the development of workerist thought , Panzieri , emphasized the importance of self - critique and - interrogation and a “ refusal of party - specificity , ” seeking to return to workers themselves as a source of revolutionary struggle rather than a revisionist party or abstract theoretical framework .
For Panzieri , Marxist intellectuals should be directly involved in worker struggles and conduct sociological “ worker ’s enquiries ” in order to understand the needs and experiences of Italy ’s factory workers .
Another distinctive characteristic of workerism in the early period was its emphasis on the working class as an engine of capitalist production .
Renowned workerist Mario Tronti ( 1965 ) theorized the antagonistic power arrangements that constituted capitalist production , positioning labor as a critical force within the logic of capital and observing the ways in which worker ’s resistance repeatedly forced capital to adjust and redefine itself — that is , to reload .
For Tronti , a revolutionary , anticapitalist project would involve breaking this relationship by way of a refusal of work .
Other workerists during this period advocated worker control over the factory ( self - management ) rather than a breaking of the fundamental power relationship between capital and labor outlined by Tronti ( 1972 ; Wright 2002 , 16 –21 , 37–9 ) .
[ See also : Harry Cleaver , Reading Capital Politically , 2000 : @ infoshop.org ( PDF ) | @ libcom.org . ]
The “ Hot Autumn ” of 1969 would mark a sea change in the development of Italian autonomism , as hundreds of thousands of workers protested in the streets , occupied factories , and committed acts of sabotage in them ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 18 ) .
In addition to playing a central role in the autonomous labor movement , workerists built alliances with other social subjects including students , feminists , the unemployed , and migrant and technical workers , as many of them were becoming key protagonists in the Italian scene .
Debates over the role of students in and outside the university permeated workerist debates alongside the ongoing controversies over unions and the PCI ( 18 ) .
Actions like the “ go - slow ” and other acts of sabotage on the shop floor circumvented union and party involvement , further dividing the traditional left from the autonomists while broadening the latter ’s movement base ( Wright 2002 , 118–19 ) .
In the mid-1970s , autonomist activity took the form of various acts of “ self - reduction ” in which people all over the country refused price increases on service , electricity , and phone services , signifying yet another wave of activism that did not involve unions or the PCI .
Nor were these acts of resistance limited to workers .
Self - reduction was accompanied by a surge in squat activity by university and high school students , which set the stage for Italy ’s vibrant social center movement ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 22 ; Wright 2002 , 172 ) .
Although the move was certainly not unanimous , workerist theorists made a conceptual shift from the “ mass worker ” to the “ socialized worker , ” which reflected the infusion of these new social subjects in the horizon of contention .
While the concept of the “ mass worker ” focused on the factory , the “ socialized worker ” included those whose productive activities were performed in the realm of social reproduction as much of the grassroots resistance associated with the Hot Autumn and again , in the mid-1970s , was led by women , young people , and neighborhood committees , acting autonomously from formal political institutions .
While workerists contributed a great deal to the development of Italian autonomism , the women ’s movement also played an integral role .
Feminists focused on transformation in the realm of everyday life and on politicization of seemingly personal issues like divorce and abortion , seeking to construct autonomous spaces for women and challenge the machismo of the traditional and workerist left .
Feminists of all stripes founded their own abortion clinics and shelters for victims of rape and domestic violence , and formed consciousness - raising groups to deal with issues specifically related to patriarchy and its manifestations in the lives of women .
Feminists like Mariarosa Dalla Costa argued for recognition of women ’s work in the household as unpaid labor — wages for housework — while others such as Alisa del Re suggested a refusal of housework because it ran the risk of relegating women to the home rather than liberating them ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 27–33 ) .
Students also played an important role in the development of autonomism in the late 1960s and 1970s .
They criticized government cutbacks , fought neofascist groups and politicians , and occupied universities and squat houses .
The Metropolitan Indians ( MI ) represented one of the more creative elements of the student movement , operating by way of affinity - based collectives rather than through traditional political organizations .
The MI argued against the military industrial complex and animal cruelty and for the legalization of drugs .
In the spirit of self - reduction , they refused to pay for bus services and housing , as well as cultural commodities like films and records .
The MI and other student groups forged alliances with the workerists but remained uniquely countercultural in their expression .
Deeply influenced by the events in Italy and the vitality of its movements , the Autonomen in Germany emerged from a confluence of tendencies including the feminist and anti nuclear power movements , as well as punk and squatter subcultures .
Feminists in Germany tackled many of the same issues as their Italian counterpoints including divorce , abortion , and domestic violence .
Moreover , they defined autonomy in nonpatriarchal terms as personal autonomy and focused on facilitating an existence that was not defined in relation to men .
To that end , feminist autonomy involved establishing women ’s institutions — for example , shelters for victims of domestic violence and women ’s social centers — as spaces strictly for and by women .
It also involved applying their concept of personal autonomy to the problem of organization : feminist organizations eschewed hierarchy , operated without defined leadership or charismatic figures , and did not depend on existing party structures ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 74–5 ) .
The organizational structures and ethics that characterized feminist autonomy prefigured the Autonomen ’s rejection of defined leadership , hierarchy , and centralism .
Rather than involve spokespersons , Autonomen speakers would go so far as to sit in trucks or wear masks to conceal their identity at protest events .
Their decentralized , amorphous character not only protected them from police infiltration , but more importantly , enabled them to remain free from divisive hierarchies .
Italian autonomism , on the other hand , to this day remains marked by a culture of celebrity .
Many of Autonomia ’s leaders suffered severe repression , exile , and incarceration as a result of their conspicuous involvement .
Even today , their spokespersons are targeted by neofascists and police , and they remain steeped in legal battles associated with their civil and social disobedience .
Unlike the Italian Marxists , the Autonomen rejected the use of unifying theories of revolution and counterpower , but they did operate according to loose sets of principles : they rejected the idea of a revolutionary party or vanguard , emphasized difference ( what Katsiaficas has called “ continuing differentiation ” ) , and believed in self - determination in all aspects of life ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 9 ) .
Like their Italian counterparts , they engaged in confrontational protest , counterculture , parody , and sabotage to fight gentrification , fascism , and the state ’s increasing use of nuclear power , and they did so autonomously from traditional political parties .
With the rise of neo -Nazism in the 1990s , Autonomen were crucial in waging an antifascist resistance by defending immigrants and other “ marginals ” from attack , when police and the traditional left had abandoned them .
Despite such egalitarian efforts , however , the decentralized nature of Autonomen life left them vulnerable to allegations of opportunism with regard to squatting , and to some , their practice of wearing all black appeared to encourage conformity among the ranks .
More serious criticisms , however , regarded contradictions within the movement regarding the use of physical force against their adversaries and cases of domestic violence against women in Autonomen squatter communities ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 177–9 ) .
Like their Autonomen predecessors , social anarchists generally reject the idea of forming a centralized political organization , but they tend to coalesce according to three key political organizational principles — prefiguration , antiauthoritarianism , and anticapitalism .
Prefiguration really embodies the latter two because it combines anarchists ’ anticapitalism and antiauthoritarianism into an overarching organizational ethic that aims to balance their desires for freedom with problems of structure , coordination , and mediation .
These anarchists believe that movements and their organizations should “ prefigure ” the political and social relations they seek to establish : “ [ W ] hat different anarchist organizations have in common is that they are developed organically from below , not engineered into existence from above .
. . .
They try to reflect as much as is humanly possible the liberated society they seek to achieve , not slavishly duplicate the prevailing system of hierarchy , class and authority ” ( Bookchin 1969 ) .
[ On Bookchin , see : Withered Anarchism : A Surrebuttal to Murray Bookchin , Bob Black , C.A.L.
Press , 2006 ; Being a Bookchinite , Chuck Morse , negations , October 8 , 2007 . ]
Prefiguration also references the temporal aspects of social change theorized by antiauthoritarian movements .
Andrej Grubacic , for example , describes anarchism ’s emphasis on prefiguration as “ life despite capitalism , ” which includes constructing commons , autonomous spaces , and other forms of sociality in the here and now while foreshadowing what a “ life after capitalism ” would look like and , theoretically , moving toward it ( Grubacic 2005 ) .
Concern for prefiguration was also present in classical Italian autonomism insofar as workerists refused party and union abstractions of workers ’ lived experience .
Their approach , however , was also fraught with contradictions including their machismo culture , their ambiguous relationship to the PCI and the CGIL , the privileging of charismatic leaders and intellectuals , and their lack of recognition of alternative discourses of resistance such as feminism ( as antipatriarchal ) or Third Worldism ( Wright 2002 , 113 ) .
Hardt and Negri ( 2000 , 2004 ) have since offered a new interpretation of contemporary struggles that more closely resembles that of anarchist praxis with regard to the ethic of prefiguration discussed in Grubacic ’s work .
In Multitude , for example , they posit a co-temporality of resistance and organization that involves the ontological multitude “ from the standpoint of eternity ” — ” throughout history humans have refused authority and command , expressed the irreducible difference of singularity , and sought freedom in innumerable revolts and revolutions ” — and the historical or “ not - yet ” multitude , which “ will require a political project to bring it into being ” ( Hardt and Negri 2004 , 221 ) .
While the ethic of prefiguration lies somewhere between the two multitudes , Hardt and Negri’s ( 2000 , 207 ) emphasis on political organization and claim that “ Globalization must be met with counter - globalization ” and “ Empire , with a counter - Empire ” has drawn criticism from anarchists .
Richard Day , for example , has characterized Empire as an expression of a hegemonic project that runs the risk of eating its own children .
To Hardt and Negri ’s question , “ How can all this be organized ?
Or better , how can it adopt an organizational figure ? ”
Day suggests an “ anarchist ” response :
you are posing yourself the wrong questions .
“ All of this ” is always already organized , and your “ we , ” whatever that might be , cannot “ give ” it anything without destroying what it is .
You must “ be still , and wait without hope / for hope would be hope for the wrong thing . ”
That is , you must trust in non-unified , incoherent , non-hegemonic forces for social change , because hegemonic forces cannot produce anything that will look like change to you at all ( Day 2005 , 155 ) .
Among anarchists like Day , the ethic of prefiguration runs counter to the notion that today ’s movements must assimilate to existing power structures in order to challenge them .
Rather than attempt to obtain power ( or develop a counterpower ) , many of today ’s anarchists seek to diffuse it .
[ See also : John Holloway , Change The World Without Taking Power , Pluto Press , 2002 .
Like Hardt and Negri , Holloway is dismissive of anarchism .
A more sympathetic approach is detailed in A.R. Giles - Peters , ‘ Karl Korsch : A Marxist Friend of Anarchism ’ , Red & Black , No.5 , April 1973 . ]
The second principle , antiauthoritarianism , generally refers to anarchism ’s antistatist character , which dates back to Mikhail Bakunin in the nineteenth century .
The state was at the center of anarchism ’s break with Marxism , and Bakunin , in particular , warned of the dangers of a Marxist “ red bureaucracy . ”
Marx theorized the transition from capitalist to communist society as involving a seizure of state power by the working class , but Bakunin rejected this idea citing “ the true despotic and brutal nature of all states ” ( Bakunin 1950 ) .
While Marxists viewed the state as an executive of the ruling class and asserted ruling class control over the means of production as the ultimate relation of oppression , anarchists saw the state as an autonomous entity with its own logic of domination ( Mueller 2003 ; Newman 2004 ) .
Even though Marx and Engels , and later , Lenin , theorized the proletarian state as a key transitional moment in history that would eventually “ wither away , ” 3 anarchists claimed that the seizure of the state by the working class essentially boiled down to another form of tyranny , temporary or not .
Moreover , for anarchists and autonomist Marxists , orthodox Marxism ’s focus on the working class as a “ universal class ” has not translated well to the mid- to late twentieth and twenty - first centuries , in part because it ignores the ways in which disaffection and desires for change among women , young people , and racial , ethnic , and sexual minority groups cut across traditional class boundaries .
In his famous essay “ Listen , Marxist ! ” Bookchin went so far as to assert that while Marxism may have been liberating a century ago , by the 1970s it had turned into a “ straitjacket . ”
According to Bookchin , the working class had been “ neutralized as the ‘ agent of revolutionary change ’ ” and class struggle suffered a “ deadening fate by being co-opted into capitalism .
. . .
Our enemies are not only the visibly entrenched bourgeoisie and the state apparatus but also an outlook which finds its support among liberals , social democrats . . . [ and ] the ‘ revolutionary ’ parties of the past , and . . . the worker dominated by the factory hierarchy , by the industrial routine , and by the work ethic ” ( Bookchin 1971 ) .
Although anarchism is historically antistatist , many of today ’s anarchists acknowledge that states can play an important role in providing social welfare services and protections against the detrimental effects of unregulated capitalism .
Some , like Chomsky , assert that supporting the state sector in contemporary ( neoliberal ) societies may even constitute a step toward its abolition ( Chomsky 2005 , 212–20 ) .
Instead of a universal rejection of the state , anarchist antiauthoritarianism involves placing the burden of proof on existing authority structures and limiting or dismantling the power of institutions or individuals whose authority proves to be illegitimate ( Chomsky 2005 , 118–30 ; Graeber and Grubacic 2004 ) .
While anarchists concede that states are oftentimes more well equipped than grassroots movements to ensure a sound infrastructure and social welfare for everyday people , they are critical of the system of coercion that undergirds state authority , which , for them , ultimately limits its potential to serve as an agent of liberatory change ( Graeber 2006 ) .
This anarchist critique of authority also extends to other media of social control including the family , educational systems , physical and mental health care facilities , as well as norms regarding sexuality , religion , and artistic expression ( Chomsky 2005 , 178 ) .
This critique of authority and emphasis on the ubiquitous nature of control can also be found in the work of Hardt and Negri , who share anarchism ’s penchant for postmodern thought .
In Empire , they build on Deleuze ’s ( 1992 ) concept of societies of control , which represent a new plateau or level of maximization in which the state is understood as both everywhere and nowhere .
Rather than disciplining subjects by way of institutional mediations , as Foucault4 would have , Deleuze identified such institutions as in - crisis : the family , the church , and the trade union were no longer relevant as central devices of domination ( and resistance against it ) .
Rather , control involved a pervasive logic ( of capitalist production ) that extended beyond institutional mediations into the whole of social space .
Hardt and Negri apply Deleuze ’s control society to discuss the new arrangements of sovereignty characteristic of the post - Cold War age of Empire , arguing that institutional mediations had soured , civil society withered , and nation - states no longer operated as the uppermost apparatuses of power .
Sovereignty — the power to impose order — wrests in the hands of multinational corporations and supranational institutions like the IMF and the World Bank that trump the sovereignty of nation - states .
Opposition to Empire is achieved via the multitude , a social multiplicity that acts in common while maintaining differences among its constituents , rather than a homogenous class formation or other false unity .
Multitude involves an understanding of the expansive nature of exploitation and control in contemporary societies that , paradoxically , offers innumerable opportunities for resistance , not bound to social class , identity politics , or national liberation ( Hardt and Negri 2004 , 92 ) .
Autonomists like Katsiaficas have been critical of previous waves of autonomist theory , especially that associated with workerism , because of its focus on labor and production at the expense of other categories of transformation .
Katsiaficas has targeted Negri in particular not only for his allegiance to Marxist categories of analysis but also for his charismatic personal style .
Katsiaficas notes that while Negri and his cohort played an important role in theorizing workers ’ struggles beyond traditional , Old Left categories — to involve unpaid housework and white - collar workers , for example — his work continues to provide only “ a partial understanding of the universe of freedom . ”
For Katsiaficas , Negri ’s theoretical approach “ constricts human beings and liberation within the process of production . . . patriarchy ( and race ) need to be understood in their own right , as autonomously existing , not simply as moments of capital .
. .
What occurs between men and women under the name of patriarchy is not the same as what happens between bosses / owners and workers ” ( Katsiaficas 2006 , 223 ) .
Katsiaficas ’s criticism is echoed by Steven Wright , who provides a more sympathetic account of Negri ’s history as well as that of operiasmo .
He too criticizes Italian autonomist Marxism ’s tendency to flatten the real experiences of people into abstract categories and ignore important differences among them .
He veers significantly from Katsiaficas , however , in that he situates such contributions within a highly volatile and revolutionary context in which movement protagonists like Negri could certainly be said to have had a tiger by the tail ( Wright 2002 , 224 ) .
Nonetheless , these criticisms bear strong resemblance to that of autonomist Marxism ’s anarchist critics like Graeber and Day .
In terms of their anticapitalist orientation , anarchists and autonomist Marxists share Marxism ’s concern for social inequality and alienation as well as its emphasis on labor as an important concept through which to understand human history and potential .
Autonomists , from Tronti to Hardt and Negri , have theorized the ways in which the exploitation they witnessed in the factory extended into the whole of social life .
Italian autonomists ’ concept of the “ social factory , ” for example , enabled them to move beyond traditional , reductionist concepts of class struggle and toward a theory of the ubiquitous nature of capitalist exploitation that included the recognition of women ’s work in the household as a critical site of social reproduction .
From the basis of these ideas emerged the more contemporary concept of immaterial labor , that is , labor that helps define the creative ( cultural , informational ) content of commodities , standards of taste , and norms and public opinion , produced on a massive scale , and no longer strictly the domain of the ruling class .
At the turn of the twentieth century , theorists of immaterial labor locate an increased tendency toward intellectual and affective labor , even in occupations that were previously limited to manual tasks .
Calling into question conceptions of labor ( among workerists and other Marxists ) as a force in dialectical relation to the forces of capital , they characterize immaterial labor as immanently cooperative because its valorization may occur outside the capital relation : “ Today productivity , wealth , and the creation of social surpluses take the form of cooperative interactivity through linguistic , communicational , and affective networks .
In the expression of its own creative energies , immaterial labor thus seems to provide the potential for a kind of spontaneous and elementary communism ” ( Hardt and Negri 2000 , 294 ) .
Anarchist Richard Day ( 2005 ) adds nuance to this analysis , pointing out that in addition to the increased intellectual aspect of even the most mundane physical jobs , such trends have also involved a routinization of artistic and intellectual production .
He contends that Hardt and Negri may be overstating this increased intellectualization and its liberatory effects , however , since the information economy has also required its share of unskilled laborers performing mundane , backbreaking tasks ( Day 2005 , 146 ; also see Graeber 2008 ) .
Despite their differences , autonomist Marxists and anarchists alike oppose private property and argue for a direct reappropriation of resources by people and not through the state or any other mediations ( Epstein 2001 ) .
In this regard , their antiauthoritarianism and anticapitalism are interrelated : anarchism insists on “ democratic control over one ’s life , ” but it also advocates for social ownership of the means of production , a kind of “ stateless socialism ” ( Chomsky 2005 ) .
They use the term “ mutual aid , ” initially theorized by Kropotkin , to refer to the voluntary exchange of goods and services for the mutual benefit of members of a given society .
[ See : Harry Cleaver , ‘ Kropotkin , Self - valorization And The Crisis Of Marxism ’ , 1992 . ]
Contemporary autonomist groups ( and some anarchists ) and AGM activists employ a similar ethic in their attempts to reinvigorate commons , a concept that has its roots in the property - sharing practices of medieval Europe but generally refers to any resource that is ( or should be ) collectively shared .
Against the dominant system of private property , commons are “ forms of direct access to social wealth , access that is not mediated by competitive market relations ” ( DeAngelis 2004 ) .
In keeping with the antiauthoritarian ethos of anarchist and autonomist thought , “ commons ” is also used to reference coordinated , cooperative practices that are not directed by a central point of command nor from some “ spontaneous harmony . ”
Naomi Klein has located a “ reclaiming of the commons ” in contemporary anti-advertising campaigns , street and subway raves , open - source software , and other forms of Internet pirating in which people trade commodities like music and film instead of buying them from multinational corporations ( Hardt and Negri 2004 , 222 ; Klein 2001 , 50 ) .
While some of these practices are reminiscent of Bey ’s TAZs in terms of their temporality and countercultural character , many anarchists and autonomists engage in antiprivatization efforts more in resistance to neoliberalism and corporate influence over social and cultural life than for the purposes of self - mastery or - aggrandizement .
In the Italian context , for example , squatting and “ self - reduction ” in the 1960s and 1970s gave birth to the social center movement , comprising hundreds of squats in various parts of the country , usually on the outskirts of urban areas or in industrial zones .
The first wave of centers emerged amid the shift from industrial to flexible forms of production that left vacant large stretches of cityscape in urban centers around the world .
In Milan , industrial production gave way to an economy based on the finance , fashion , and service industries that brought with them high rents and low wages , at least for those lucky enough to still have a job : between 1971 and 1989 , 280,000 of the city ’s workers joined the ranks of the unemployed ( Mudu 2004 ) .
By 2004 , however , over 250 social centers had been active in Italy , ranging from large complexes like Rivolta in Marghera ( outside of Venice ) to small spaces in southern Italy , run by two or three people ( Mudu 2004 ) .
The first social center , Leoncavallo , was occupied in Milan in 1975 , but like many centers , it has been closed and reopened over the years because of police pressure .
Social centers involve a diverse array of social subjectivities , and Italy has a long history of geographic specificity with regard to its movement formations and their political legacies .
Nonetheless , a common thread among contemporary social centers is their desire and effort to take back what neoliberalism has taken away .
To that end , social centers tend to offer an assortment of public services including housing and documentation services for immigrants and homeless people , condom distribution for prostitutes , day care or housing for homeless children , counseling and caregiving for battered women , and many others .
They also provide spaces for a variety of activities : concerts by popular bands , nightlife , art installations , theater , political meetings and conferences , radio and TV broadcasting , and activist organizing .
While corporate music venues tend to charge high admission fees and the spaces themselves are highly regulated , social centers operate outside the coercive realm of corporations and the state , and inhabitants can essentially do as they please ( in good faith ) without drug crackdowns , age restrictions , and curfews .
The low cost of concert admissions enables participation from a broader audience , and proceeds are fed back into the centers .
About half of the social centers in Italy have acquired some degree of legal status as of this writing , but not without controversy .
Rivolta , for example , was occupied in 1996 ; an empty factory in the industrial town of Marghera , it was owned privately and slated to be sold and transformed into a large commercial area .
After the space was squatted , the municipality decided , at the urging of sympathetic government officials in the Green and Democratic parties , to designate most of the space for “ social use . ”
The other half of the centers remain unsanctioned and therefore subject to enclosure .
5
Legal status tends to be more difficult for those located in areas with higher price tags on real estate , and squatters who live and work in those spaces must remain on guard for police infiltration .
Moreover , some of them view the sanctioned centers as less authentic in keeping with their antipathy to conventional political entities .
Some of the disputes among social centers correspond to the divisions among anarchists and autonomist groups outlined in this article .
U.S. activists tend to be less divided over issues related to political legacy , yet they face their own set of challenges building political and social alternatives in an enormously diverse country without a functional left .
Nonetheless , a surprising number of anarchist bookstores , magazines , recording groups and labels , food cooperatives , concert venues , and other social formations continue to flourish .
Similar to their Italian counterparts , antiauthoritarian groups in the U.S. also engage in service provision campaigns that are informed by their belief in a reinvigoration of a commons .
The anarchist group Food Not Bombs ( FNB ) , for instance , was founded on an acknowledgement of food “ as a right , not privilege . ”
The first FNB was formed in Cambridge , Massachusetts in 1980 by antinuclear activists , but the network has grown to include hundreds of local chapters and has links to various groups like EarthFirst ! , the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee , the Anarchist Black Cross , the Industrial Workers of the World , and several others .
FNB chapters are indeed diverse and they do not employ formal leaderships or central apparatuses .
They recover food that would otherwise be thrown out and serve fresh , vegetarian meals to hungry people free of charge .
For example , FNB served food to survivors of California earthquakes , 9/11 rescue workers , and victims of the Sri Lankan tsunami , as well as residents of New Orleans abandoned by the local and federal government in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
Conclusion
Anarchists and autonomists have focused on solving what is perhaps the most important question for egalitarian social movements today : how to balance the organizational requisites for change with movements ’ desire for freedom and autonomy .
To that end , they have operationalized their ethic of autonomy by creating organizational forms that involve decentralized , autonomous units interconnected via networks , a term often used by anarchists and autonomists alike to discuss both the theory and practice of their organization .
[ Which term — along with the closely - related concept of ‘ netwar ’ — has also been employed by RAND Corporation analysts John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt in Networks and Netwars : The Future of Terror , Crime , and Militancy . ]
Skeptical of electoral and juridical ( rights - based ) solutions to social problems , they reject the imposition of national boundaries and other spatial arrangements that deny the autonomy of local communities and fix social relations around artificial borders .
These groups understand such boundaries to be “ artificial ” in the sense that they do not conform to the more organic ways in which communities emerge and reproduce — especially in the context of globalization in which freer flows of goods and services are matched by highly regulated and policed immigration systems .
Instead , they argue for alternative forms of social organization comprising self - determined and - managed communities and local units that allow for an unbridled flow of people around the globe in lieu of boundaries imposed by states .
Such ideas manifest concretely in the organization of AGM protests by groups like the Direct Action Network ( DAN ) , which was initially founded to coordinate the demonstrations against the WTO in Seattle but remained active in organizing subsequent , large - scale protests and other events .
DAN fostered interconnections among a broad variety of groups by way of voluntary association , which meant that groups and individuals were not required to adopt a political line or adhere to any other kind of false unity .
DAN fostered interlockings and negotiations , but there was never any overarching subordination , nor was any single entity in the network privileged over another .
Groups entered into DAN to fill a basic need ( e.g. , defend a squat house ) or plan an event ( e.g. , teach - ins , civil disobedience ) , but the network was never seen as a means or a step toward a defined end .
Despite their commitment to party politics , for example , members of various local Green parties participated alongside community organizers , NGO activists , professional journalists , students , and various , unaffiliated others without using the network for electoral gain .
At the beginning of each DAN meeting , “ Points of Unity ” were established via consensus process , and most often , these Points involved an explicit understanding of the network as one “ comprised of autonomous agents . ”
DAN ’s praxis was less about an enforced movement toward some ideal state of affairs or support for a single project or politician than about linking heterogeneous groups with unique histories and producing stable interactions among them .
In this respect , DAN abided by principles shared by both anarchists and autonomists : it was noncoercive , nonhierarchical , decentralized , and interested in maximizing the freedom of all groups involved .
It conjoined various social movement struggles and overcame the problem of centralism by developing a principled , action - oriented network that protected the autonomy of its constituents and enabled their participation .
This experience may be instructive for movements attempting to solve the age - old problem of “ organization versus autonomy ” because its constituents found ways to connect disparate groups and tendencies without becoming subsumed in the kind of zero-sum , sectarian maneuvering that continues to divide the left and radical movements around the world .

He served fourteen years in prison for his attempted assassination of Henry Clay Frick .

3 . In The Manifesto of the Communist Party ( 1848 ) , Marx and Engels state : “ [t ] he immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties : Formation of the proletariat into a class , overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy , conquest of political power by the proletariat . ”
In Anti-Duhring , Engels ( 1877 ) further explains : “ The first act by which the state really comes forward as the representative of the whole of society — the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society — is also its last independent act as a state .
State interference in social relations becomes , in one domain after another , superfluous , and then dies down of itself .
The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things , and by the conduct of processes of production .
The state is not ‘ abolished . ’
It withers away .
This gives the measure of the value of the phrase ‘ a free people ’s state , ’ both as to its justifiable use for a long time from an agitational point of view , and as to its ultimate scientific insufficiency ; and also of the so - called anarchists ’ demand that the state be abolished overnight . ”
In State and Revolution , Lenin further discusses the “ withering away of the state . ”

Dear Sandra ,
When I called in this , my manager ’s office , a few moments ago I was handed my very first American fan letter – and it was from you .
I was so pleased that I had to sit down and type an immediate reply , even though Ken is shouting at me to get on with a script he badly needs .
That can wiat ( wi-at ?
That ’s a new English word which means wait ) .
I ’ve been waiting for some reaction to the album from American listeners .
There were reviews in Billboard and Cash Box , but they were by professional critics and they rarely reflect the opinions of the public .
The critics were very flattering however .
They even liked the single “ Love You Till Tuesday ” .
I ’ve got a copy of the American album and they ’ve printed the picture a little yellow .
I ’m really not that blond .
I think the picture on the back is more ‘ me ’ .
Hope you like those enclosed .
In answer to your questions , my real name is David Jones and I do n’t have to tell you why I changed it .
“ Nobody ’s going to make a monkey out of you ” said my manager .
My birthday is January 8th and I guess I ’m 5 ’ 10 ” .
There is a Fan Club here in England , but if things go well in the States then we ’ll have one there I suppose .
It ’s a little early to even think about it .
I hope one day to get to America .
My manager tells me lots about it as he has been there many times with other acts he manages .
I was watching an old film on TV the other night called “ No Down Payment ” a great film , but rather depressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way Of Life .
However , shortly after that they showed a documentary about Robert Frost the American poet , filmed mainly at his home in Vermont , and that evened the score .
I am sure that that is nearer the real America .
I made my first movie last week .
Just a fifteen minutes short , but it gave me some good experience for a full length deal I have starting in January .
Thankyou for being so kind as to write to me and do please write again and let me know some more about yourself .
Yours sincerely ,
( Signed , ‘ David Bowie ’ )
An international team of environmental scientists led by the University of Pennsylvania has shown that sea - level rise along the Atlantic Coast of the United States was 2 millimeters faster in the 20th century than at any time in the past 4,000 years .
Sea - level rise prior to the 20th century is attributed to coastal subsidence .
Put simply , land is being lost to subsidence as the earth continues to rise in response to the removal of the huge weight of ice sheets during the last glacial period .
Using sediment cores from the U.S. Atlantic coast , researchers found significant spatial variations in land movement , with the mid-Atlantic coastlines of New Jersey , Delaware and Maryland subsiding twice as much as areas to the north and south .
Coastal subsidence enhances sea - level rise , which leads to shoreline erosion and loss of wetlands and threatens coastal populations .
Researchers corrected relative sea - level data from tide gauges using the coastal - subsidence values .
Results clearly show that the 20th - century rate of sea - level rise is 2 millimeters higher than the background rate of the past 4,000 years .
Furthermore , the magnitude of the sea - level rise increases in a southerly direction from Maine to South Carolina .
This is the first demonstrated evidence of this phenomenon from observational data alone .
Researchers believe this may be related to the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and ocean thermal expansion .
" There is universal agreement that sea level will rise as a result of global warming but by how much , when and where it will have the most effect is unclear , " said Benjamin P. Horton , assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at Penn .
" Such information is vital to governments , commerce and the general public .
An essential prerequisite for accurate prediction is understanding how sea level has responded to past climate changes and how these were influenced by geological events such as land movements . "
The study provides the first accurate dataset for sea - level rise for the U.S. Atlantic coast , identifying regional differences that arise from variations in subsidence and demonstrate the possible effects of ice - sheet melting and thermal expansion for sea level rise .
The results appear in the Dec. 1 issue of the journal Geology .
The study was supported by the National Science Foundation , the Thouron Family and the University of Pennsylvania .
The study was performed by Simon E. Engelhart and Horton of the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at Penn , Bruce C. Douglas of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University , W. Richard Peltier of the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto and Torbjörn E. Törnqvist of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences and the Tulane / Xavier Center for Bioenvironmental Research at Tulane University .
Google has introduced the latest tool in its bid to photograph Australia – the Google Street View Trike , which makes its debut at Taronga Zoo today .
While Google Street View cars – equipped with a camera mounted on the roof – have been used to capture many of Australia ’s roads for Google Maps , the pedal - powered Street View Trike goes off - road .
The 110kg modified bicycle is mounted with a Street View camera and GPS system .
In a release , Google said : “ The Street View Trike will help Google gather images of off - the - beaten track and pedestrian - only locations across the country , taking Street View beyond road - accessed landmarks such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge to places like Taronga Zoo and perhaps even national parks . ”

Google Australia engineering manager Raul Vera said : “ We ’re lucky enough to live in a country with some of the most spectacular natural environments and architectural features on the globe , and the Trike will allow us to get off - road to share these marvels with people around Australia and the world .
The Google Street View images collected by the trike will be live on Google Maps later this year .
The National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research ( NIWA ) , accused last week of fiddling the long term New Zealand temperature record to create spurious warming , has released information showing that the attack mounted by the NZ Climate “ Science ” Coalition and Climate Conversation Group has no merit .
The NIWA announcement shows that the warming trend in the long term record is also found when weather stations with long term records that require no corrections are used .
From the release :
Dr Jim Salinger has identified from the NIWA climate archive a set of 11 stations with long records where there have been no significant site changes .
When the annual temperatures from all of these sites are averaged to form a temperature series for New Zealand , the best - fit linear trend is a warming of 1 °C from 1931 to 2008 .
We will be placing more information about this on the web later this week .
I ’ll have more detail on that series when it ’s made available .
So the warming in the record is robust , found in sites all round New Zealand , and does n’t depend on mysterious adjustments .
But the Treadgold / CSC report also made claims about data being hidden :
Requests for this information from Dr Salinger himself over the years , by different scientists , have long gone unanswered , but now we might discover the truth .
That ’s an outright lie , as the NIWA release shows .
For more than two years , New Zealand Climate Science Coalition members have known of the need to adjust the “ seven station ” data .
They have had access to : the raw data
the adjusted data ( anomalies )
information needed to identify the adjustments made by Dr Salinger
information needed to develop their own adjustments .
The NIWA release cites emails to CSC members Vincent Grey and Warwick Hughes in July 2006 , which provided all the references required to calculate the necessary adjustments themselves .
In particular , all the information about the station site changes has been publicly available since 1992 and details of the methodology since 1993 !
So where does this leave Treadgold and the CSC ?
They have published a report , issued press releases and made blog posts that misrepresent the facts , and have shown themselves incapable of conducting good science .
They have proven themselves morally and ethically bankrupt , and should — if they had any decency — withdraw and apologise .
But I wo n’t be holding my breath .

A staff member of the right - wing NSW Liberal MP David Clarke has stood aside after being linked to a spoof You Tube video involving Adolf Hitler .
Charles Perrottet is the second Liberal Party staffer to stand down over the video clip .
In the clip , the Hitler biopic Downfall has been re-subtitled to portray the Federal MP Alex Hawke as an enraged Adolf Hitler , making reference to a factional stoush inside the state Liberal Party .
A link to the video has been sent to a number of news outlets including the ABC .
The war in the Liberal Party 's right - wing has been prompted by a split between the former allies Alex Hawke and the Upper House MP David Clarke .
Before being elected to Federal Parliament Mr Hawke was a staffer for Mr Clarke .
The dispute partly centres on two state seats in Sydney 's north - west .
Some local Liberals want to depose the Castle Hill MP Michael Richardson and the member for Baulkham Hills Wayne Merton .
Sources have told the ABC that they are angry at Mr Hawke because they believe he is determined to see that Mr Clarke loses his preselection for the Liberal Party in the Upper House .
At the weekend the Nazi clip claimed its first scalp with Malcolm Turnbull 's media adviser Thomas Tudehope resigning after being linked to the video .
Now Mr Perrottet , has also stood down while the matter is investigated by the Liberal 's State Director , Mark Neeham .
Mr Perrottet and Mr Tudehope both deny involvement in the production or dissemination of the video .
Chaotic meeting
The stoush in the party 's right - wing also made the news last month , when police were called to the Castle Hill electorate office of Alex Hawke .
Mr Hawke says about 40 uninvited people were trying to force their way inside during a Young Liberals meeting .
Sources from the opposing faction say they had every right to be there and claim police were only called when Alex Hawke realised his supporters were out - numbered .
Police say 13 officers responded but no action was taken .
Alex Hawke is the MP for the Federal seat of Mitchell .
Last month the head of the Mitchell Federal Electoral Conference Tim Abrams quit - sources say he felt he could no longer work with Mr Hawke .
The dispute has angered the New South Wales opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell who last year claimed to have ended the factional warfare in his party .

Now that the holidays have come and pass , you are probably feeling more stressed out than ever .
Not only are you tired from all the shopping , buying , gift wrapping , exchanging , returning , cooking , serving , and entertaining , but you are probably also stressed out that “ vacation ” is now over …and it is time again to get your ass back to work !
“ Stress is an ignorant state .
It believes that everything is an emergency . ” – Natalie Goldberg
There are plenty of things to be concerned about .
The economy continues to hurt , and this new hole in our wallets does n’t help .
On top of this , life ’s daily burdens are always there to add fuel to the fire .
That is why it is important we set aside time for relaxation .
Over the past couple of weeks , I have been coaching some people who have various concerns about stress and anxiety .
Some folks are just tired from obligations with work and family , and they want to feel more at ease .
Others get nervous in certain situations , like speaking in public or approaching a certain girl ; they want to know how to overcome these worries .
Whatever the situation may be , my method for dealing with stress and anxiety is fairly simple but effective when practiced consistently .
Here are some of the fundamentals to know so that you can begin on your own .
You will find these concepts especially helpful to integrate into your new year workload .
Here is to a more productive , more free , more spontaneous , and much more easy - going 2010 !
Start With The Breath
When times get difficult , the breath is always there to draw attention to .
I remember when I would lose my temper as a child and my parents would always tell me to “ take 10 deep breaths . ”
At the time , I absolutely hated the advice , and it would only make me more angry .
But overtime I have realized the power of turning our attention to our own breathing .
No matter how we are feeling , there is always a rhythm to the breath .
It is consistent , it is always there , and that is what makes it such a reliable object of meditation .
The more consistent you are at bringing your awareness back to the breath , the more centered you will be throughout your day .
This means you will have less of a dependency on certain outcomes : you will be able to let go of the things you ca n’t control , and dedicate more energy to the things you can control .
In my article “ How Stress Ruins Everything … ” I mention how important this “ control factor ” can be in the accumulation of daily stress .
And even when there are many situations where we do n’t have much much control , we can always shift our focus to areas where we do have control , and by doing that we can maintain a healthy mind .
When I tell people to bring their attention to their breath , I tell them to pay attention to its subtle sensations : the feeling of cool and fresh air coming in and the feeling of warm and stale air coming out .
I tell them to feel the sensations of air filling up their lungs .
I then suggest they make notes of the motions of the breath , how it is steady and rhythmic like the waves of a calm sea .
The Black Cloud Of Tension
The next step I usually take is a visual exercise .
I have the person imagine all their stresses , anxieties , worries , and concerns in the form of an ugly cloud .
I usually have the individual choose how the cloud looks .
I personally like mine to be a mixture of green and brown , like some kind of sludge from a raw sewage system .
Others like to picture a thick black cloud as if it were from a burning building .
Whatever kind of cloud you may imagine , make it detailed and meaningful , and be sure it symbolizes all of your stresses and worries .
Imagine the cloud coming from the exhalation of your breath and through the pores of your skin as it accumulates above you .
Imagine yourself feeling lighter and more relaxed with each breath and moment that passes .
Then let the cloud drift slowly away from you .
Take your time with this process , feel the changes as they happen , and then allow yourself to go into a deeper state of relaxation .
Pay Attention To The Feelings
There is a difference between thinking about relaxation and actually being relaxed .
We can imagine ourselves on a nice summer day , tanning at the beach , with a glass of lemonade and a good book .
And like the black cloud example above , these visualizations will help .
But it is just as important to pay attention to the subtle sensations that make up these experiences .
When you set aside time to be relaxed , make sure you feel your muscles stretching out and become less tense .
Feel the little , nagging ache in your head dissipate .
Feel light , more comfortable , rejuvenated , and fresh !
Focus on these feelings .
Become familiar with them , and that will help you re-create these states in the future .
When you are visualizing a relaxing scenario , associate yourself fully into the experience .
Imagine what it would be like to have a black cloud of tension actually lift above you .
What it would feel like ?
How does it change your physiology ?
What about if you were at a beach , or some other scenario where you find yourself comfortable and relaxed ?
Pay attention to the feelings .
Relaxation And Productivity
Allotting time towards feeling these states of deep relaxation can have tremendous benefits in our own productivity .
Just like when we do n’t get enough sleep , not enough relaxation can keep us in a drowsy and zombified state .
That is why it is important to monitor and manage our energy , not just at night before bed , but throughout the day as well .
Bradley Whitwell , a Brain and Mind Research Institute senior research fellow , says that allowing employees to have mid-workday naps can help them become more alert and productive in the workplace .
Other states of deep relaxation , like those found in a disciplined meditation practice , should yield similar result .
However , there are a couple of benefits deep relaxation techniques have over napping .
To start , you do n’t have to worry about waking up mid-REM when you consciously practice relaxation .
You probably have had some experiences in the past waking up mid-REM , especially those naps where you end up feeling more tired and out - of - sync then you were beforehand .
Another benefit of consciously practicing relaxation is that you can better choose what times you spend to relax .
You may only have 15 - 20 minutes before your next business meeting .
A power nap could be risky , but spending that extra time focusing on your breathing can accomplish a just - as - desirable state without having to re-boot yourself completely .
In this way , “ conscious relaxation , ” as I have been calling it , is of much greater convenience than your typical afternoon nap .
Type - A Personality And Health Implications
Being stressed and busy - minded is easy .
Despite how little we may enjoy it , we can drain ourselves fairly “ effortlessly ” just by going through our daily motions .
We get so easily caught in worrying about little things like , “ What am I going to make for dinner ? ” or “ Did I forget to take out the trash again last night ? ” that we forget to take a step back to catch our breath .
Maybe this tendency towards busy - ness is because we find it more natural to overexert ourselves then to just sit and be comfortable ?
There are so many societal pressures to multi-task and be productive , rather than to spend time sitting in leisure without being called a bum .
This does n’t make either more important .
I think we should find a balance .
Despite how much we have been conditioned to see virtue in this busy lifestyle , especially those of us like me who live near a major industrialized city , relaxation can help both our quality and quantity of life .
Sure , having a Type - A personality may get you a few extra thousand dollars a year , but the stresses could just as well take off ten or more years of your life .
One 9 - year study with over 9,000 men , aged 35 - 59 , found that Type A personalities were more than twice as likely to have coronary heart disease .
Meanwhile , a report by BBC News illustrates that countries who take part in afternoon rests ( or siestas ) are less likely to suffer from heart disease and other similar risks .
Do n’t be someone to work your entire life towards material gains but never have the time to enjoy any of it .
Relaxation Takes Practice
Without practice , sitting with the intent of relaxing can prove to be much more difficult than we first imagine .
Sometimes with all of our worries and concerns it can even make us more anxious and uneasy .
That is why I tell people “ relaxation takes practice . ”
One of the most common hurdles to relaxing is that we get too wrapped up in our thoughts .
We begin thinking about how we need to get X , Y , and Z done before next week , or we ca n’t stop re-playing in our heads that stupid thing we said to our girlfriend earlier that morning .
I wo n’t say that these concerns are a waste of time .
There may be a time and place for them – but not during relaxation .
For now when we devote time to being relaxed , we need to let our thoughts pass without putting too much emphasis or energy into them .
If you are focused enough on the process of relaxing , then you wo n’t have the energy to mind these thoughts and worries .
They will arise , but they will pass .
Just stay in - tune to your own state of rest and comfort .
That is what you are doing now , while you are relaxing .
So be fully aware and concentrated on that .
But this concentration will take practice .
Most likely you will get distracted during the first few times you try to cultivate these states .
It is okay and normal , but be aware that it is up to your own time , effort and dedication to make this practice work .
It is not just about reading this post , but setting aside the time to do it .
One Last Thing
In summary , I want you to focus on relaxation as a valuable endeavor .
No matter what point of your life you may be , there are probably stresses and anxieties you are dealing with .
Therefore I want you to practice these tools , become familiar with them , and integrate them into your daily routine .
There is a great benefit to being able to relax , replenish your energy , and re-direct it in a more alert and focused state of being .
A forensic team last week in Ayacucho unearthed the bodies of 25 schoolchildren and five adults , buried 26 years ago in three mass graves in the village of Umasi , nine hours south of the city of Huamanga , Ayacucho .
The exhumation was ordered by the Ayacucho sub- provincial criminal court , acting on testimonies from five witnesses who stated that army personnel killed the children and adult peasants in November 1983 .
According to the witnesses , a column of Sendero Luminoso rebels ‘ recruited ’ “ at least 40 people ” in the village of Raccaya on Nov.25 , 1983 , most of them fourth and fifth grade children ( 10 - 12 yrs old ) , and led them on a forced march for more than 10 hours on a circuitous route to the village at Umasi , where they stopped for food and shelter in the school building ( the villages are only about an hour and a half apart on a bad road ) .
A teacher at Umasi sought help from the military base at Canaria , and at dawn on Nov.27 , two military patrols approached the area , surrounded the school and threw grenades into two of the schoolrooms , injuring children and the Senderistas , who surrendered .
The witnesses said the military raped girls and women , and shot the children and five adults .
Two large graves were dug to bury the bodies , and a third grave was dug to bury two bodies that did not fit into the others .
The forensic team , lead by archaeologist Luis Rueda , found the three graves some 60 m ( 200 ft ) behind the Umasi elementary school .
They carried out the excavations last week , Dec.14 - 20 .
The first excavation yielded a scene of children ’s bodies piled on top of each other .
Although the massacre occurred 26 years ago , the bodies are fairly well preserved .
Most of the children were dressed in school uniforms .
The massacre occurred a year after the military took over the fight against Sendero Luminoso from the police force .
The Canaria base was under orders from the Los Cabitos base in the city of Ayacucho , and under the command of General Clemente Noel , political and military chief of Ayacucho and Huancavelica .
Policies outlined in Lima and executed by officers with no knowledge of Quechua nor understanding of Andean peoples and customs , led to broad suspicion and harsh counter - insurgency tactics .
Reports by the press of military excesses and extra-judicial executions of civilians were consistently denied by President Fernando Belaunde and the Ministry of Interior .
The situation in Raccaya and Umasi was common during the internal war , in which remote villages were caught in the middle , watched and threatened by Shining Path one day and by the military the next .
The Ayacucho criminal court has reported its preliminary findings to the Public Ombudsman and to Peru ’s human rights association , Aprodeh .
The forensic team , meanwhile , have begun their laboratory work in the city of Ayacucho to identify the bodies and causes of death .
Governments should prepare for the worst if aliens visit Earth because beings from outer space are likely to be just like humans , a leading scientist is claiming .
Extra - terrestrials might not only ­resemble us but have our foibles , such as greed , violence and a tendency to exploit others ' resources , says Simon ­Conway Morris , professor of evolutionary ­paleobiology at Cambridge University .
And while aliens could come in peace they are quite as likely to be searching for somewhere to live , and to help themselves to water , minerals and fuel , Conway Morris will tell a conference at the Royal Society in London tomorrow .
His lecture is part of a two - day conference at which experts will discuss how we might detect life on distant planets and what that could mean for society .
" Extra - terrestrials … wo n't be splodges of glue … they could be disturbingly like us , and that might not be a good thing – we do n't have a great record . "
The US space agency 's search for alien life is based upon the mantra " follow the water " , a strategy reflecting the fact that , on Earth , where there 's water there 's life .
Recent missions have ­revealed ice on the moon and Mars .
Astronomers have detected more than 400 planets outside our solar system , some of which sit in the ­" Goldilocks zone " where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to form .
Conway Morris will argue that alien life is most likely to occur on a planet similar to our own , with organisms made from the same biochemicals .
The process of evolution will even shape alien life in a similar way , he added .
" My view is that Darwinian evolution is really quite predictable , and when you have a biosphere and evolution takes over , then common themes emerge and the same is true for intelligence .
" If you have a planet much smaller than ours , the gravity is so weak it loses its atmosphere .
If the planet is much bigger , its gravity is so strong that everything crawls around on the ground , because you do n't have to fall far to break everything .
It 's fantastically dull . "
The meeting is the first in a series that marks the Royal Society 's 350th anniversary .
Future conferences will tackle the science of ageing , vaccines , stem cells and geoengineering : the use of technology to protect the planet from the adverse effects of climate change .
Albert Harrison , a professor of psychology at the University of California , Davis , who is speaking at the meeting tomorrow , will raise concerns about the radio signals humans are sending out to any eavesdropping aliens .
Scientists have used telescopes to listen for alien broadcasts for more than 20 years , but we have also beamed our own signals into space .
Harrison wonders if we might be sending the wrong kind of messages .
" Some of them are serious , but there 's a lot of hoopla , like love letters and commercials .
What would we make of an alien civilisation if the first thing we translated from them was a commercial for a snack food ? " he said .
In the spring , scientists will debate whether Earth should be more proactive in trying to make contact with aliens by broadcasting signals to solar systems that might harbour life .
Some enthusiasts believe any alien civilisation capable of reaching us can only have survived long enough to develop the necessary technology by solving major social problems , such as war , poverty and discrimination .
Harrison disagrees .
" I do think there 's a risk in active searches for extra-terrestrials .
The attitude seems to be they 're friendly , they 're a long way away , and they can't get here .
But if you wake up one morning and an armada of extra-terrestrial spaceships are circling Earth , that prediction wo n't necessarily hold , " Harrison said .
If life has evolved elsewhere in our cosmic neighbourhood , we should find out by detecting their waste gases in the atmosphere of their planet or by discovering remnants of extra-terrestrial microbes in meteorites or alien soil samples , he said .
Harrison dismisses fears of public panic if alien life is discovered , of the kind which reportedly followed Orson Welles ' infamous radio broadcast of War of the Worlds in 1938 .
" The public reaction was overstated .
Most people who thought the broadcast was real took sensible actions to protect themselves , " Harrison said .
" Surveys suggest most people think they will be fine , but they worry about others freaking out . "
Ted Peters , professor of systematic theology at the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary in California , has surveyed religious groups to understand whether confirmation of extra-terrestrials could trigger the collapse of religion on Earth .
His research suggests not , but he believes Christians should clarify whether God 's creation covers the whole of space or just Earth .
Imagine , for a moment , that you are in one of pop 's most cherished alt - rock bands .
After 15 years together , during which you have dealt with all manner of upheaval , from record company fall - outs and line - up changes to debilitating drug addiction , your image is that of a serious band that tackles serious subjects .
Now , with your latest album , you want to cheer things up a little , offer some light relief to your listeners .
So what do you do ?
" Simple , " grins Wilco 's Jeff Tweedy .
" You hire a camel and throw it a birthday party . "
As Wilco devotees – and they are increasingly many – will already know , Tweedy is referring to the cover image of the band 's self - titled seventh album , released to glowing reviews earlier this year , which depicts a camel standing in a garden terrace in a party hat .
In the foreground is a table with a birthday cake on it and six empty chairs .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Originally , we thought of having a really old man having a birthday party but once we found the camel it became painfully obvious that the party should be for him , " smiles Tweedy .
" I wanted someone to look at the image and go , ' What the hell is that ?
How did that happen , and why was n't I invited ? ' "
It had the desired effect .
When the album was released , online forums started debating the cover 's meaning .
While a few serious souls read it as a statement on the Middle East peace process and man 's futile pursuit of happiness , the majority saw it for what it was :
Wilco letting their hair down .
Wilco ( the album ) is a work that radiates confidence and contentment , recalling the simplicity of the band 's early LPs A.M. and Being There .
The first track , simply titled " Wilco ( the song ) " , finds Tweedy paying tribute to their fans against chugging Velvet Underground guitars , and pledging that no matter how tough things get , " Wilco will love you , baby . "
Elsewhere , he cheerfully grapples with matters that he has come to accept are beyond his control .
Pondering existential mysteries in " Deeper Down " , he states , " I adore the meaninglessness of the ' this ' we can't express , " while on " Solitaire " he concludes , " Once I thought without a doubt , I had it all figured out ...
It took too long to see I was wrong to believe in me only . "
It 's tempting to look at Wilco 's upbeat demeanour , together with their decision to name their seventh album after themselves in the manner of a new band releasing its debut , and conclude that they are drawing a line under the turmoil that has come to define the group , that they are somehow wiping the slate clean .
" I guess there 's an element of that , " says Tweedy cautiously .
" After 40 years Glen Campbell put out a record called Meet Glen Campbell , which is kind of cool .
But we struggled with a lot of other titles that felt more exemplary of what the music was .
But nothing else felt quite so succinct . "
If the album has an overriding theme , it is the acceptance of life 's uncertainties .
" I think there 's a liberating nature to that concept , " says Tweedy .
" It allows for a playfulness and an engagement in life that is more enjoyable than the alternative .
I 've aspired to convey some of those things for a long time now , maybe not so clearly before because it has n't been so clear to me .
But I do believe that the greater ability you have to tolerate ambiguity , the more successfully you can steer your life .
The alternative point of view – the complete dismissal of ambiguity , trying to rationalise irrationality – can be very destructive . "
Tweedy is known for his philosophical bent , and it has served he and his music well .
If there 's a band that has learned to negotiate and overcome acts of randomness and misfortune , it 's Wilco .
First , there have been the frequent line - up changes – only Tweedy and the bassist , John Stirratt , remain from the original group , who formed in 1994 from the ashes of the alt - country outfit Uncle Tupelo .
Since then , a succession of musicians have come and gone , including Jay Bennett , who left in 2001 after relations broke down with Tweedy and who died unexpectedly earlier this year .
More unsettling still has been Wilco 's relationship with the industry in which they operate .
In 2001 , their record company Reprise , an offshoot of Warners , rejected their album , Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , on the grounds that it lacked any discernible singles , and dropped them from the label .
The band responded by buying back the master tapes and streaming them for free on the internet .
Half a million people downloaded the album and , as word got around that they were back on the market , Wilco found themselves in the unlikely position of being courted by 30 different labels .
After much deliberation they re-signed to another Warners imprint , Nonesuch , meaning they were effectively paid twice for the album by the same record company .
In 2003 , the band endured further turmoil when , during the recording of A Ghost Is Born , Tweedy checked himself into rehab for an addiction to painkillers , taken to suppress the migraines and panic attacks that had afflicted him since he was a child .
The ferocity of these attacks were grimly captured in Sam Jones 's Wilco documentary , I Am Trying to Break Your Heart , which showed Tweedy bent over and vomiting from the pain .
Wilco 's unwillingness to wallow in difficulty is as admirable as their ability to confront it .
Tweedy 's hackles rise slightly when I ask to what extent personal and professional drama has fed his art .
" I did n't aspire to have drama surrounding records and I did n't welcome chaos as some sort of gateway to creativity , " he says .
" These things are just our experience .
Aside from the consolation that music can provide in itself , I think there 's a consolation in seeing that suffering does n't have to go to waste .
The unfortunate flipside of that is that people romanticise it to the point where they think that it can't exist without the suffering .
The cliché of the tortured artist is something I really detest .
The thing that I find most repulsive is that , more often than not , what is perceived as suffering by followers of any particular artist is really an unwillingness to suffer .
Drug addiction in particular grows out of an unwillingness to suffer when suffering is part of the human condition . "
Tweedy certainly knows a thing or two about this , although with his painkiller addiction under control , he has fewer headaches than he used to .
Where once they were almost constant , they are now reduced to one or two a month .
" There is a relationship between migraines and panic disorder , and once I had managed my panic disorder , I think that eliminated a fair amount of headaches that escalated through panic into a migraine , " he says .
" One thing I 'm certain about is that when you 're active in an addiction to painkillers , your body really wants to have pain , especially if you 're wanting a rationale to be provided for something you know is wrong . "
When Tweedy was growing up in Chicago his heroes were not rock 'n ' roll peacocks , but outsiders and misfits .
" The Minutemen , Hüsker Dü , The Replacements , I liked the anti-hero kind of thing , " he says .
" I tended to be pretty suspicious of people that were comfortable enough in their skin to act like rock stars .
I 'm just not that guy .
I 'm not David Lee Roth , as much as I 'd love to be .
I mean , that would be a handy set of skills to just get up there and shake it about for a couple of hours . "
Along with their finely tuned survival instincts , the secret of Wilco 's longevity , I suggest , has surely been the enduring modesty of their ambitions .
" Well , I gave up on the idea of being a sensation a long , long , long time ago , " Tweedy grins .
" That made appeals to my ambition a lot less attractive .
Record companies always make appeals to your ambition in the same way that credit card companies appeal to people 's desire to have status or things .
We could n't afford those things – tour buses , videos , for instance – so we did n't have them .
That 's always been the mindset . "
Even so , Wilco 's fan base has broadened incrementally over the last 15 years , with each album selling more than the last .
Wilco ( the Album ) peaked at number four in the US album charts , a career best for the band .
Tweedy is delighted but at the same time he is n't one to dwell on chart positions and units shifted .
These days , he says , he sees a calmer future for Wilco in the years ahead .
Is that just wishful thinking ?
" Put it this way , I would think that it will be easier to survive the next 15 years than it has been to survive the last 15 .
We 're more fit now in almost every way for whatever is coming down the pike .
I think we 'll be around for a while yet . "
Wilco ( the Album ) is out now on Nonesuch

Damien Hirst with his painting White Roses and Butterflies
Contemporary artist Damien
Hirst is best known for his headline - grabbing conceptual artworks , which include animals suspended in formaldehyde .
One of the biggest hitters in the art world , Hirst has chosen to put that all to one side and return to the craft of painting .
The exhibition of his new work , which has opened at the Wallace Collection in London , has been scrutinised by numerous art critics .
TOM LUBBOCK - THE INDEPENDENT
Damien
Hirst has painted some paintings , entirely by hand .
So far he has made his name with other kinds of art : with assemblages , mainly involving dead animals and pills , and paintings , painted by other people .
But now he has risked his fame , with some paintings done by his own hand .
They 're thoroughly derivative .
Their handling is weak .
They 're extremely boring .
Hirst , as a painter , is at about the level of a not - very - promising , first - year art student .
He is in his mid-forties .
Read the full review SARAH CROMPTON - DAILY TELEGRAPH
The effect is , initially , dazzling .
Hirst has lined the walls of two long galleries with striped blue silk wallpaper , commissioned at his own expense from the same French factory that makes the paper for all the Wallace 's walls .
Hirst 's skill has been criticised by reviewers
The problems with the exhibition begin when you study the paintings themselves .
Although they have impact as a group , individually many of the paintings simply do n't pass muster .
Details are tentatively painted ; compositions fall apart under scrutiny .
So it is brave of him to begin to paint in this way  but anyone who first encountered Hirst through these works would be entirely justified in wondering what all the fuss had been about .
Read the full review ADRIAN SEARLE - THE GUARDIAN
Hirst 's paintings lack the kind of theatricality and grandeur that made Bacon succeed .
At its worst , Hirst 's drawing just looks amateurish and adolescent .
His brushwork lacks that oomph and panache that makes you believe in the painter 's lies .
He can't yet carry it off .
Whatever his borrowings ,
Hirst did all this himself , unaided by his armies of assistants .
He fills up his art with dead things : even the iguanas look stuffed .
But these paintings are a memento mori for a reputation .
Read full review RACHEL CAMPBELL - JOHNSON - THE TIMES
The paintings are dreadful .
Think Francis Bacon meets Adrian Mole .
So why are these works now hanging in the Wallace Collection ?
What are they doing in the home of such masters as Rembrandt or Poussin , Titian or Fragonard ?
The answer is simple : they are by Damien Hirst .
Take a step farther and a pale , silk - papered boudoir transforms into what feels more like a teenage boy 's bedroom .
You can almost smell the brooding odours of existential angst .
The artist who has made his reputation with shock now produces works that are shockingly bad .

How to convert any AVCHD , mts , m2ts files to MOV freely on mac ?
I finished filming a movie and the files was in AVCHD format and I need to convert them to .
Mov format but however when I convert them on the program I have they turn out in 720 p which is extremely grainy .
Or are their any programs that will let you convert with original quality ?
Or can I change the files well after I put them in my editing program ?
As we know , AVCHD is a format created for recording high definition video onto DVD discs , SD / SDHC memory cards , " Memory Stick " and hard disk drives by most tapeless consumer camcorders .

Bacterium could work directly on grass or crop waste .
Switch grass could be made into diesel cleanly and quickly .
PVSTOCK .COM / ALAMY
In a bid to overcome the drawbacks of existing biofuels , researchers have engineered a bacterium that can convert a form of raw plant biomass directly into clean , road - ready diesel .
So far , biofuels have largely been limited to ethanol , which is harder to transport than petrol and is made from crop plants such as maize ( corn ) and sugarcane , putting vehicles in competition with hungry mouths .
In this week 's Nature , researchers from the University of California , Berkeley , and the biotech firm LS9 of South San Francisco , California , among others describe a potential solution : a modified Escherichia coli bacterium that can make biodiesel directly from sugars or hemicellulose , a component of plant fibre ( see page 559 ) .
The method can be tailored to produce a host of high - value chemicals , including molecules that mimic standard petrol , and could be expanded to work on tougher cellulosic materials , the researchers say .
The work identifies a potentially cost - effective way of converting grass or crop waste directly into fuel , filling gas tanks without raising global food prices or increasing hunger and deforestation in far - flung locales .
Moreover , the process is much more climate friendly than manufacturing ethanol from maize , and produces higher - energy fuels that are interchangeable with current petroleum products .
The next step is to scale the process up and adapt it to cellulose , which makes up the bulk of plant material .
“ The process has a lot of promise for actually being commercialized . ”
" It 's a nice milestone in the field of biofuels , and it has a lot of promise for actually being commercialized , " says James Liao , a metabolic engineer and synthetic biologist at the University of California , Los Angeles .
LS9 's calculations , performed with the help of the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois , show that the biodiesel that it is preparing to market reduces greenhouse - gas emissions by 85 % compared with standard diesel .
That calculation is based on using Brazilian sugarcane , which is a much more efficient feedstock than maize ; LS9 says that the shift from sugars to biomass as a feedstock would reduce greenhouse gases even further .
The company has been working to convert sugars into tailored molecules for several years , says co-author Stephen del Cardayre , LS9's vice - president for research and development .
However , their university collaborators went two steps further , eliminating the need for additives and then folding in the ability to use hemicellulose as a feedstock .
" This paper is a representation of the types of efforts that are going to move us to biomass , " he says .
The researchers basically amplified and then short - circuited E. coli 's internal machinery for producing large fatty - acid molecules , enabling them to convert precursor molecules directly into fuels and other chemicals .
The team then inserted genes from other bacteria to produce enzymes able to break down hemicellulose .
In all , the authors report more than a dozen genetic modifications .

The results could buoy LS9 , says Mark Bünger , a research director at business consultancy Lux Research in San Francisco .
Like its competitors , including Amyris of Emeryville , California , and South San Francisco - based Solazyme , LS9 struggled for funding in 2008 and early 2009 because of the drop in oil prices and the economic downturn , Bünger says .
But LS9 made it through , securing US $ 25 million in new funding from various sources , including a strategic partnership with oil giant Chevron last September .
The company plans to open a commercial - scale demonstration plant later this year .
Imam Ali was the Caliph of the Muslim Community from 656 to 661 .
Like the anecdote above there are several examples of Imam ’s excellence in leadership and governance .
He has written an excellent piece of document which is now called as “ The Richest Treasure “ .
It ’s a letter written to the Governor of Egypt Malik al - Ashtar , giving details on the duties and rights of the ruler , taking into account the various classes in society .
The message in the letter is timeless .
The United Nations urged the Arab nations to use that letter as a model .
It even makes for an excellent Corporate Bible for Managers & Entrepreneurs .

Video apparently showing extra-judicial killings by Sri Lankan troops is genuine , a UN envoy has said .
UN special rapporteur Philip Alston said three independent experts had confirmed the video was authentic , renewing calls for a war crime inquiry .
The footage - which Sri Lanka says is fabricated - shows a man dressed as a soldier shooting a man in the head .
It was allegedly filmed in January during the final stages of the bloody conflict with Tamil Tigers rebels .
The government in Colombo said it concluded the video was fake after conducting its own investigation .
Bodies on ground
But Mr Alston , the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings , told reporters : " The conclusion clearly is that the video is authentic . "
He said the video had been examined by three US - based independent investigators .
He named them as Peter Diaczuk , an expert in firearms evidence , Daniel Spitz , a prominent forensic pathologist , and Jeff Spivack , an expert in forensic video analysis .
At the same time he noted that there were " a small number of characteristics of the video which the experts were unable to explain " .
" Each of these characteristics can , however , be explained in a manner entirely consistent with the conclusion that the videotape appears to be authentic , " he added .
The UN official also called on the Sri Lankan government to hold an independent inquiry into possible war crimes committed by both sides of the conflict .
It is not clear where the footage , which also shows other bodies on the ground , was taken .
The video was provided to the BBC and other media organisations by a group called Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka , which said it showed " the reality of the behaviour of the government forces during the war " .
Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka said the video had been taken in January 2009 using a mobile phone .
Sri Lankan troops finally defeated the Tamil Tigers last May - after nearly 26 years of war .

In February , David Bahati , the mover of the controversial Anti-Homosexuality Bill is expected to attend a prayer breakfast in the American capital of DC .
Mr Bahati , according to reports , may speak at the event where President Barack Obama – a gays - tolerant liberal president , is also expected to attend .
On Friday , Mr Bahati said he would attend .
The event is organised by The Fellowship - a conservative Christian organisation , which has deep political connections and counts several high - ranking conservative politicians in its membership .
“ I intend to attend the prayer breakfast , ” said Mr Bahati – himself a part organiser of the Ugandan equivalent of the national prayer breakfast .
This week , citing international pressure , President Yoweri Museveni advised his party ’s National Executive Committee , his cabinet and the NRM parliamentary caucus to “ go slow ” on the Bill .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict on Tuesday linked the Church ’s opposition to gay marriage to concern about the environment , suggesting that laws undermining “ the differences between the sexes ” were threats to creation .

The pope made his comments in an address to diplomats in his yearly assessment of world events .
The main theme of the address was the environment and the protection of creation .
“ To carry our reflection further , we must remember that the problem of the environment is complex ; one might compare it to a multifaceted prism , ” he said .
“ Creatures differ from one another and can be protected , or endangered , in different ways , as we know from daily experience .
One such attack comes from laws or proposals which , in the name of fighting discrimination , strike at the biological basis of the difference between the sexes , ” he said .
“ I am thinking , for example , of certain countries in Europe or North and South America , ” he said .
This was a clear reference to legislation either enacted or proposed in several part of the world .
Last month , Mexico City became the first capital in Catholic Latin America to allow same - sex marriage .
In California , the U.S. state ’s ban on gay marriage goes to trial on Monday in a federal case that plaintiffs hope to take all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and overturn bans throughout the nation .
Gay marriage is legal is several U.S. states and some European countries .
“ Yet freedom can not be absolute , since man is not God , but the image of God , God ’s creation .
For man , the path to be taken cannot be determined by caprice or willfulness , but must rather correspond to the structure willed by the Creator , ” he said .
In his speech to diplomats from more than 170 countries , the pope repeated the themes of his message for the Church ’s World Day of Peace on January 1 , which said industrialized nations must recognize their responsibility for the environmental crisis , shed their consumerism and embrace more sober lifestyles .
CLIMATE CHANGE
He told the diplomats that he was concerned about the failure to reach agreement on climate change at the Copenhagen summit last month .
“ I share the growing concern caused by economic and political resistance to combating the degradation of the environment , ” he said , adding that he hoped “ it will be possible to reach an agreement for effectively dealing with this question ” at follow - up conferences in Bonn and Mexico City this year .
“ The issue is all the more important in that the very future of some nations is at stake , particularly some island states , ” he said .
In other parts of his French - language speech , Benedict repeated calls for “ appropriate management ” of natural resources , particularly in economically disadvantaged nations .
He said enormous resources were going to military spending “ and the cost of maintaining and developing nuclear arsenals ” instead of being diverted to help the poor .
Benedict decried what he called “ indifference , amounting practically to resignation of public opinion worldwide ” of conflicts such as those in Darfur , Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
This weekend , fans flocked to San Francisco to see Sir Patrick Stewart , William Shatner and a gorgeous array of Trek pageantry .
But more importantly crowds answered the age - old , all - important question : who would win in a fight between Kirk and Picard ?

After the big Picard and Kirk panel this weekend at the SF Star Trek Convention , the audience was polled on three imperative questions : who would win in a fight , who would make a better US president , and who would be the better kisser ?
According to SF
Weekly the answer to the big fight question was :
Captain Kirk won the votes here , even though some attributed their votes to Patrick Stewart 's admission during the Q&A that he had stopped eating red meat .
" Kirk is just a baddass , " said one fan , explaining her vote .

OTTAWA–The United States ' renewed efforts in Afghanistan will in no way affect Canada 's decision to pull its soldiers out of the war - torn country by 2011 , Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said Tuesday from Brussels , where he is attending a NATO meeting .
Cannon said while President Barack Obama 's commitment of 30,000 additional troops is welcome , Canada 's military role will end in July 2011 " and we will respect the ( House of Commons ) motion to the letter . "
" Canada welcomes the additional military and civilian resources the United States will deploy to Afghanistan , particularly to the south .
Additional U.S. resources will help to provide a more secure environment for the Afghan people , " he said .
Cannon did say that by having more American troops in the dangerous southern part of the country will allow Canada to concentrate on training the Afghan National Security Forces and " place responsibility for security back in the hands of Afghans . "
" We look forward to furthering our collaboration with the United States in order to reach our ultimate and common goal of leaving Afghans and Afghanistan that is better governed , more peaceful and more secure , " he said .
Cannon said Canada is " recognized and respected " as a leader in security and reconstruction operations in southern Afghanistan , the most dangerous and difficult environment in the country , which is expected to continue in some capacity after the pullout .
" Now while our military mission will end in 2011 Canada will continue to have an ongoing development and diplomatic relationship with Afghanistan through the Canadian embassy in Kabul , " he said .

And maybe it 's " everything associated with a minority group has to go through an extra layer of justification " in its background , and I really need to grow a sense of humor or something ( see userpicture ) , but frankly , the idea that suddenly my bastard whoreson of a language needs to practiceis ludicrous .
English is a language of Norman knights trying to pick up Saxon barmaids ( and all parties involved are fooling around with the Celts on the side because they have sexy syntax ) that aggressively pursues other languages to beat them up for their stray vocabulary , and someone 's prating on about a coinage having hybrid parentage ?

One of the things that came out of Markdown , One Year Later was that we really needed to open source our C# server - side implementation of Markdown .
While the client side implementation of Markdown is already open sourced , there are two sides to the Markdown story on Stack Overflow — what appears in the Javascript preview on the client , and what is rendered in C# on the server and ultimately stored in the database .
While we are trying to normalize the client and server implementation over time —
I ’ve made significant progress in the last two weeks in doing so — there are inevitably small differences that creep in over time .
It would be nice to have more eyeballs on this process to assist .
Since the original C# library we used for Markdown was not open source , this was a problem .
I mailed the author , Milan Negovan , and he granted copyright to me .
Hi there , guys !
Sure , I do n’t mind at all .
I ’ve always wanted the community to improve and contribute to its development , but never found the proverbial bandwidth to run the project that way .
Cheers !
Milan
So , I ’ve released our C# implementation of Markdown under a proper open source license — as MarkdownSharp !
http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/
I ’ve already made a few changes to properly package it as a decent open source project :
included relevant links , documentation , and related files
added MDTest 1.1 test suite
added Simple test suite
both NUnit and console runnable tests
standard Benchmark with short , medium , and long Markdown samples
refactored and profiled for 2 x – 5 x more performance
the Stack Overflow specific changes ( such as stricter italics / bold ) are configurable , so you can toggle them on and off .
One nice side effect of this process is that I ’ve been able to incorporate quite a few bug fixes , some of them fairly serious .
The failure to escape backticks was a big one , and there was a subtle bug involving a single character of whitespace that caused all < hr /> s to be wrapped in paragraph tags since .. well , forever .
Anyway , take a look at the project , feel free to browse the source , and please contribute whatever you can to make it better for everyone .
AUSTRALIA'S iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge is rusting as the world 's most relentless paint job fails to keep up .
Despite raising $ 84.785 million in toll revenue in the past financial year , the Roads and Traffic Authority ( RTA ) admitted large sections of the bridge were rusting and in need of a paint job , The Daily Telegraph reports .
While the bridge 's safety and integrity was not at risk , the RTA said a section of the 503 m arch span overlooking Sydney ’s popular amusement park , Luna Park , needed a makeover .
" There is some flaking and minor surface rusting on the northwestern side of the bridge , where paint has broken down due to environmental exposure , " an RTA spokesman said after seeing photos taken by The Daily Telegraph .
The government said it spends about $ 15 million a year on routine maintenance of Sydney Harbour Bridge 's structure alone and , yes , the paint job continues .
About 485,000sq m of steelwork - the equivalent of 60 football fields - needs to be painted .
It takes 30,000l of paint for just one coat of the Harbour Bridge .
" Surface rusting is expected in the normal life cycle of painted steel bridges in harsh marine environments , " the RTA spokesman said .
" Regular repainting is an essential and ongoing part of the Sydney Harbour Bridge maintenance program . "
But industry experts blasted the Government for failing to properly maintain the Harbour Bridge .
" I suppose it is just another indication of the lack of infrastructure spending in this state , " New South Wales Civil Contractors Federation boss David Elliott said .
" If we can't get something as simple as the Harbour Bridge right , how are we going to get other projects right . "
A painting expert , who did not wish to be named , said there was clearly a breakdown in the Harbour Bridge 's coatings , especially around the bolt heads , which indicated water was seeping in .
" Such breakdown should be treated as soon as possible , given the exposure to extreme elements , " he said .
" The longer it is left in this state the structural integrity of the Bridge may be compromised . "
Opposition roads spokesman Andrew Stoner said taxpayers deserved better than this .
" Millions of dollars are spent on fireworks each year to showcase the Bridge , but misguided priorities from State Labor means Sydney 's much - loved coathanger has gone without , " he said .
The bridge is maintained by a team of almost 100 RTA workers , most at the site full - time .
The RTA said it has scheduled work to repaint the rusted section of the Bridge " within coming weeks " , weather permitting .

The research that brought to light the fossils of Ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid species that lived 4.4 million years ago in what is now Ethiopia , has topped Science 's list of this year 's most significant scientific breakthroughs .
The monumental find predates " Lucy , " -- previously the most ancient partial skeleton of a hominid on record -- by more than one million years , and it inches researchers ever - closer to the last common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees .
Science and its publisher , AAAS , the nonprofit science society , recognize the Ardipithecus ramidus fossils , including the partial skeleton named " Ardi , " as 2009 's Breakthrough of the Year .
They also identify nine other important scientific accomplishments from this past year in a top ten list , appearing in a special news feature in the journal 's 18 December 2009 issue .
The Ardipithecus research " changes the way we think about early human evolution , and it represents the culmination of 15 years of painstaking , highly collaborative research by 47 scientists of diverse expertise from nine nations , who carefully analyzed 150,000 specimens of fossilized animals and plants , " said Dr. Bruce Alberts , editor - in - chief of Science , in a related editorial .
Back in October , an international team of scientists offered this first comprehensive , peer - reviewed description of Ardipithecus .
This research appeared in a special issue of Science , published on 2 October 2009 ( http://www. sciencemag. org / ardipithecus / ) .
Until then , the fossil record contained only scant evidence of other hominids older than " Lucy . "
After analyzing the skull , teeth , pelvis , hands , feet , and other bones , they determined that Ardipithecus possessed a mix of " primitive " traits , shared with its predecessors -- the apes of the Miocene epoch -- and " derived " traits , which it shared exclusively with later hominids .
However , many of its traits do not appear in modern - day African apes .
One surprising conclusion , therefore , is that it is likely that the African apes have evolved extensively since we shared that last common ancestor , which thus makes living chimpanzees and gorillas poor models for the last common ancestor and for understanding our own evolution since that time .
The first Ardipithecus fossils were actually dug up in 1994 , but the team of researchers responsible for their discovery was careful not to rush the findings to the public .
Instead , more than a decade of detailed analysis and documentation followed , as the experts sent their fossils to various laboratories around the world for evaluation .
This collaborative , international effort to study " Ardi " and her environment represents a major scientific landmark of both discovery and analysis .
Science 's list of the nine other groundbreaking achievements from 2009 follows .
Pulsars Detected by Fermi : NASA 's Fermi Gamma - Ray Space Telescope helped to identify previously unknown pulsars -- highly magnetized and rapidly rotating neutron stars -- and shed light onto their unique gamma-ray emissions .
Rapamycin : Researchers found that tinkering with a key signaling pathway produces life - extending benefits in mice -- the first such result ever achieved in mammals .
The discovery was particularly remarkable because the treatment did not start until the mice were middle - aged .
Graphene :
In a string of rapid - fire advances , materials scientists probed the properties of graphene -- highly conductive sheets of carbon atoms -- and started fashioning the material into experimental electronic devices .
Plant ABA Receptors : Solving the structure of a critical molecule that helps plants survive during droughts may help scientists design new ways to protect crops against prolonged dry periods , potentially improving crop yields worldwide and aiding biofuel production on marginal lands .
LCLS at SLAC : SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory unveiled the world 's first x-ray laser , a powerful research tool capable of taking snapshots of chemical reactions in progress , altering the electronic structures of materials , and myriad other experiments spanning a wide range of scientific fields .
Gene Therapy Comeback : European and U.S. researchers made progress in treating a fatal brain disease , inherited blindness , and a severe immune disorder by developing new strategies involving gene therapy .
Monopoles :
In an experimental coup , physicists working with strange crystalline materials called spin ices created magnetic ripples that model the predicted behavior of " magnetic monopoles , " or fundamental particles with only one magnetic pole .
LCROSS Finds Water on the Moon :
In October , sensors aboard a NASA spacecraft detected water vapor and ice in the debris from a spent rocket stage that researchers deliberately crashed near the south pole of the Moon .
Hubble Repair :
In May , a nearly flawless final repair mission by space - shuttle astronauts gave the Hubble Space Telescope sharper vision and a new lease on life , resulting in its most spectacular images yet .
Areas to Watch : Science 's predictions for hot science topics in 2010 include cancer cell metabolism , the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer , exome sequencing and disease , pluripotent stem cells for neuropsychiatric disease , and the future of human space flight .
The special news feature will also revisit last year 's Breakdown of the Year - - the financial meltdown -- and explore the effects of this year 's Virus of the Year - - H1N1 flu -- on scientific research and collaborations .

The $ 2 Trillion Man
As 2009 winds down , the pundits are already beginning to tally what Barack Obama has achieved during his first year in office .
Even his more well - intentioned detractors contend that , though he may have made a high - profile speech or two , the new U.S. president can boast of few concrete achievements in foreign policy .
Obama himself accepted the Nobel Peace Prize as a “ call to action , ” rather than a reward for his work , and gave himself only a “ B + ” grade during his recent interview with Oprah Winfrey .
Yet in one sense , Obama achieved more in the first 11 months of his presidency than his predecessor managed to in eight years .
My research clearly shows that he has begun to restore America ’s good name , an intangible asset with highly tangible ( read : lucrative ) consequences .
As head of state , Obama has boosted the value of “ Brand America ” by just over $ 2 trillion , up from $ 9.7 trillion in 2008 to $ 11.8 trillion this year .
That means U.S. goods , services , people , and even the country ’s landscape are about 20 percent more enticing to the global market than they were in 2008 .
I know this because I track the value of countries ’ brand images closely from year to year .
Since 2005 , my Anholt - GfK Roper Nation Brands Index ( NBI ) has regularly measured the international perceptions of 50 countries by polling between 20,000 and 40,000 people in 20 to 40 countries .
We have asked them to detail their perceptions of other countries ’ human rights records , education systems , cultural lives , products , sporting prowess , and even kindness to strangers .
I originally launched the NBI because public perceptions of countries are critically important to their prosperity in a globalized world .
What people believe about other places may be biased , utterly misconceived , weirdly distorted , unfairly negative , undeservedly positive , outdated , and ludicrously simplified .
But it matters .
Countries with a powerful , positive image find it easier to attract tourists , investors , donors , talent , respect , and the attention of international media and foreign governments .
They are more successful in exporting their products , services , ideas , culture , and people to the world .
Countries with weak or negative images , by contrast , find these transactions more difficult and expensive .
None of this was captured by GDP , economic productivity , or any host of other economic measures — a hole that the index was meant to fill .
Value of Brand America ( in trillions of dollars )
But I also wanted to test my hypothesis that national images are very stable .
Country images are not like public opinion , which can fluctuate literally from day to day .
People are reluctant to change their minds about other countries , partly because they do n’t think about them very often or very deeply , and partly because countries ’ images are deeply ingrained in the culture of the population that holds them .
Chinese views of Japan , for example , are really part of the Chinese culture , and vice versa .
Indeed , hardly any country ’s image has altered more than 1 or 2 percent since the NBI was launched .
Perceptions about a given place remained more or less constant even as it was hit by political and economic upheaval , terrorist attacks , and natural disasters .
Nor did the countless , ruinously expensive publicity campaigns optimistically designed to “ brand ” countries push up any ratings for the better .
There have been just two exceptions to this remarkable inertia : Denmark in 2006 and the United States today .
Following the publication in 2006 of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Muhammad , Denmark ’s image collapsed in Muslim countries in the survey .
In Egypt , for example , Denmark had typically been ranked around 15th in most categories , with a high ranking of seventh for its governance .
Following the cartoons ’ publication , both its governance and overall rankings dropped to 35th out of the 39 countries then included in the study .
It has still not recovered its prestige today .
The reason was clear :
Unlike most major news events that take place in other countries , which wo n’t strike people as especially relevant and consequently wo n’t affect their beliefs about that country , the cartoons were personal .
Many Muslims felt that “ Denmark ” had deliberately reached out to offend them , and their views of that country changed as a result .
The second exception occurred this year and was even more dramatic .
The United States , which had languished around seventh place in my index since 2005 , shot up to first place , and not just in the perceptions of one or two countries .
For a sample representing some 60 percent of the world ’s population and 77 percent of its economy , America is suddenly the most admired country on Earth .
First is , I believe , the United States ’ natural position .
It happens that since 2005 ( and no doubt before ) , a dark phase in America ’s international relations had held it in an unnaturally low spot on the list .
Obama ’s election “ released ” the country , returning it to its usual position as the world ’s most admired country .
( Interestingly , since the survey was launched , the United States has never departed from first place in the eyes of the Muslim respondents surveyed ) .
Closer analysis of the data shows that much of the boost comes from improved international opinion of the American people themselves .
After the re-election of George W. Bush to a second term , I began to record falling scores not just for U.S. foreign policy but also for U.S. people , culture , products , and even — by a delightfully illogical extension — the U.S. landscape .
Now , the world appears to have absolved Americans of any perceived sin , having elected the “ right ” president .
Even the country ’s rolling hills and city skylines , it seems , are fully restored to their former grandeur in the eyes of the world .
Redemption of the brand means more than just the warm and fuzzy feeling one gets when thinking about the United States .
By combining the NBI data with a range of economic and industrial statistics , it is possible to hazard a brand valuation for a country , much as corporations value their brands .
Working with Brand Finance , a consultancy that specializes in valuing the intangible assets of corporations , we estimate that the value of “ Brand America ” has jumped from $ 9.7 trillion in 2008 to $ 11.8 trillion today .
Even more remarkably , that increase comes even as the global recession has seen U.S. GDP growth decline 2.3 percentage points over the last year .
That number is value that Obama has added to the U.S. economy simply by taking office and making the right speeches .
So to those who say Obama has achieved little , my research suggests otherwise .
His mere presence has begun to restore the United States to a position of respect and credibility — and consequently , of influence — that no amount of political , economic , or military might could muster .
And it is an absolutely necessary achievement if Washington is to wield any moral authority in the world .
In at least one of his responsibilities as head of state , the sacred responsibility of upholding the good name of his country , Obama has had a pretty good first year .
Billi Gordon is 6 feet 1 and weighed 701 pounds when he was admitted to Cedars - Sinai Medical Center last month .
Offering directions to his room , he could n’t resist adding , “ I will be the large black man in the hospital bed . ”
For most of his adult life , he has been that large black man , never denying his girth , using it to disarm and entertain , creating a theatrical comedy career -- in drag -- before pursuing research in neuroscience .
“ Do you know how hard it is to go from being a legendary diva to being a brain doctor ? ” he asked .
Though Gordon , 55 , has not ignored his size , for years he denied its consequences .
Then his body stopped letting him do so .
As he sat on his bed , even a hospital gown that fell below his knees could not hide the mysterious mass that has been growing for several years from his upper right thigh .
It now spreads between his legs , almost to his feet .
It is a saddlebag of skin , smooth in places , dimpled in others .
“ Otherwise , I have beautiful legs , ” he said .
As Gordon has widened , his life has narrowed .
By the end of the summer , he could n’t fit into his red Mustang convertible .
Scrubs were the only street clothes he could wear .
He was too heavy even for weight - loss surgery .
He has been in and out of the hospital since late spring .
His longest stay began in mid-August and lasted a month .
Two days after he was released in September , he buckled at the knees and fell to the floor from the weight of the growth .
He was sent back to Cedars .
“ I think when he could n’t get up and when he could n’t walk , that was the first time I heard fear in his voice , ” said his cardiologist , Walter Kerwin .
Gordon ’s size makes everything more complicated -- even diagnosing his ailments .
Whether the growth was a cancerous tumor ( unlikely ) or a glut of swollen soft tissue caused by poor lymphatic flow ( probable ) , Gordon needed an MRI .
But no MRI machine at Cedars -- or any other hospital his doctors could locate -- would hold him .
The maximum weight limit of the largest MRI machine is 550 pounds .
Gordon and his medical team speculated that the Los Angeles Zoo might have one big enough .
( It does n’t .
Urban myth , says the zoo ’s chief vet . )
But before anyone found out for certain , Gordon took action .
He began dieting -- not so much to fit into an MRI machine as to prepare for the likelihood of high - risk surgeries to remove the mass .
After a lifetime of diets and a diet pill disaster , after seeing his weight drop into the 300s and soar close to 1,000 , Gordon opted for an 1,800 - calorie - a- day , mostly liquid protein diet , aided by the diuretic Lasix .
He had finally reached a point where he could no longer co-opt his obesity for cleverness , for a TV role , for a funny book .
He had become imprisoned by it .
“ About this growth on my leg -- I ’m grateful I have it , ” he said recently .
“ And I ’ll tell you why .
Because it has taught me humility , and it ’s taught me gratitude for things I otherwise took for granted -- sitting in my car or walking down the street . ”
Gordon can outline in meticulous detail all the factors that he believes have played a part in his weight struggle -- a thyroid problem , stress , depression , a bad reaction to beta blockers , even the fact that his late mother was bipolar .
“ Bipolar disorder in the next generation appears as a metabolic disorder where people go from being hyperkinetic to being overly sedentary , ” Gordon said .
Sometimes the problem was just too much food .
“ I went through a depression and gained 200 pounds , ” he said of a six - month period earlier this year .
“ Have I made some bad food choices ?
I wish I had a dollar for every one I made .
I could buy an MRI machine . ”
But apathy , he insists , is not among his problems : “ Do you honestly think if I could do anything about this , I would n’t ? ”
Gordon invites people to laugh at his jokes about his size .
But he bristles if others are irreverent about him .
He can leverage his presence -- physical and theatrical -- to intimidate , casting a withering glance at anyone he suspects of disrespect .
He delights in recounting his first meeting with Kerwin , his now - beloved cardiologist .
“ Mr. Gordon . . . " the cardiologist began .
“ It ’s Dr. Gordon , ” corrected his soon - to - be patient .
One day a cheerful volunteer stopped by his hospital room .
As he left , he turned to one of Gordon ’s visitors .
“ I have magazines , ” the volunteer said .
“ Maybe you can pick some out for her later . ”
Her ?
Gordon smirked .
“ Happens all the time , honey . ”
He once made a nice living off his feminine features .
With his soft face and bosomy chest , he slipped easily into drag , posing for humorous greeting cards and playing loud - talking , imperious women for comic relief .
In drag , he had a small role in an episode of “ Married With Children ” and appeared in the Eddie Murphy comedy “ Coming to America . ”
As a writer , he penned an episode of the late - '80s sitcom “ 227 " and several humor books .
( “ Eat This Book : The Last Diet Book ” featured Gordon on the cover in a black strapless dress , with one hand on a cocked hip . )
When Gordon and his partner married in a ceremony 21 years ago , Gordon wore a long white wedding gown and a wide - brimmed hat .
“ He was always strictly in drag , ” said Gordon ’s husband , an intensely private man who asked not to be named .
“ It was very convincing .
There are people who still think he ’s a woman , ” he said , laughing .
Gordon ’s husband is 45 , about 5 foot 9 and weighs 150 pounds .
He says of Gordon , “ I accept him for all he is . ”
Still , over the years he tried everything , including locks on the refrigerator , to stop Gordon ’s weight -- 400 pounds when they married -- from ballooning .
He said he does n’t expect Gordon to get thin , just lighter :
“ My greatest hope for him would be to lose weight that would free him .
He ca n’t get to places he needs to go to , he ca n’t get to places where he wants to go .
He has this synthetic life -- it ’s TVs and computers and a room .
It was n’t like this before . ”
Gordon grew up in tiny Dowagiac , Mich. , a “ happy fat boy , ” weighing around 300 pounds in high school .
At the University of Michigan , he became addicted to the diet pill Preludin -- now off the market -- and slipped down to 172 pounds .
He fled Ann Arbor before graduating , his thinking addled by the drug , he says , and aimlessly drove to South Dakota and then on to L.A .
“ OK , this epitomizes how naive I was : I decided I would go to California to get off drugs , ” he said .
“ I ’m extremely lucky .
Just like I woke up on a back road in South Dakota , I could have awakened in Jeffrey Dahmer ’s apartment wearing a bun and lettuce . ”
His life in Los Angeles , as he tells it , was tumultuous .
He worked as an escort , a male prostitute , a female prostitute -- in that order .
It was n’t until the mid-80s that he discovered his talent for comic writing and performing as a woman .
In the mid-'90s , he finished the course work for his bachelor ’s degree at Michigan .
He also returned to being a man -- womanly primping , he jokes , took too much time away from studying -- and went on to earn a doctorate in 2004 from Union Institute & University , a nontraditional school geared toward adult , working students doing independent study .
His degree was in arts and sciences , with a concentration in integrative behavioral neuroscience .
“ He is so outgoing , friendly , loving beyond belief , ” said Mark Cohen , a neuroscientist and professor of psychiatry at UCLA School of Medicine , who supervised Gordon ’s post - doctoral work .
“ He brings in a perspective that has been interesting in the lab . ”
Cohen urged him to lose weight .
“ I ’ve told him so many times that this is near - suicidal . ”
After working in Cohen ’s lab , Gordon became a researcher at the UCLA Center for Research , Education , Training , and Strategic Communication on Minority Health Disparities .
He did most of the work from home on his computer .
When the grant that paid him ran out , the jobs available at UCLA would have required his presence on campus -- an impossibility , he says .
Gordon ’s doctors have tried to find ways to shrink the growth without surgery .
They even looked into liposuction .
But ultrasound images -- the best they can get without an MRI -- indicate that the mass is a patchwork of tissue and fluid that ca n’t be drained .
“ He is literally like a sponge , ” said Amy Weinberg , his longtime internist .
So the likely option is surgery at some point .
The mass is just one of the hazards of his morbid obesity .
“ It would n’t take much to make him really , really sick or for him to die , ” Weinberg said .
“ So I spend a lot of time worrying about him and trying to think of things we can do .
He ’s constantly on my mind . ”
She chuckled .
“ He ’ll love hearing that . ”
Twelve days after returning to Cedars in September , Gordon had dropped 99 pounds -- give or take 10 or 20 or 30 pounds .
Weighing him in his bed is an inexact science .
After two weeks , he was discharged once again and returned to his modest home in Mar Vista , still hooked up to intravenous antibiotics .
His first full day home , he grew depressed .
“ I just started calling people and said , ‘ I ’m scared and lonely , come talk to me . ’ ”
He took this as a positive sign .
“ I would never have done that in the past .
I would have said , ‘ Hello , Domino’s ?
What ’s your special ? ’
And I would have grabbed a jar of pickles and eaten them all .
And drunk the juice .
And I did n’t do that .
Because I ’m not giving up my life to this . ”
After two days home , he got out of bed in his Tiffany blue room and stood on his scale .
He weighed 583 pounds .
Last week he replaced the liquid diet with a regimen of lean protein , fruits and vegetables .
He has plans .
He wants to raise money for his own research , and he hopes to finish his memoir .
“ Yes , I was in denial .
It was a psychic survival mechanism .
But I ’m not in denial now , ” he said .
He can walk again now .
He gets out of bed , draped in a hospital gown , and strides easily through the house .
As soon as he reaches the front porch , he is winded .
Still , it ’s progress .
“ Before I went to the hospital , I had to use the walker to get out of the bedroom , ” he says .
“ There was no freestyle walking , as I call it .
Now there is . ”
Last Thursday , Gordon weighed 532 pounds .
Weinberg began trying to schedule his MRI .
On Saturday , he fit into his car .
He texted , “ Triumph city ! ! ”
Then he drove to the beach .

For the first time in American history , a majority of union members are government workers rather than private - sector employees , the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday .
In its annual report on union membership , the bureau undercut the longstanding notion that union members are overwhelmingly blue - collar factory workers .
It found that membership fell so fast in the private sector in 2009 that the 7.9 million unionized public - sector workers easily outnumbered those in the private sector , where labor ’s ranks shrank to 7.4 million , from 8.2 million in 2008 .
“ There has been steady growth among union members in the public sector , but I ’m a little bit shocked to see that the lines have actually crossed , ” said Randel K. Johnson , senior vice president for labor at the United States Chamber of Commerce .
According to the labor bureau , 7.2 percent of private - sector workers were union members last year , down from 7.6 percent the previous year .
That , labor historians said , was the lowest percentage of private - sector workers in unions since 1900 .
This BBC
News report about a trans only prison in Italy raises more questions than it answers :
Italy is to open one of the world ’s first prisons for transgender inmates , reports say .
The prison , at Pozzale , near the Tuscan city of Florence , is expected to house inmates who mainly have convictions for drug - related offences and prostitution . [… ]
It is thought that Italy has a total of some 60 transgender prisoners .
The centre will house about 30 people , according to reports .
The BBC ’s Duncan Kennedy , in Rome , says that until now transgender prisoners have been located in women ’s prisons where they are often segregated for their own safety .
Segregated for our safety ?
For this transsexual woman trying to make her way through this spirit - crushing and brutally ciscentric world , there is no such thing as a safe space – and let ’s not forget that there ’s more to transphobic violence than physical attacks .
So at best , all I can hope for is a safer space – and my experience is that the only real safer spaces I have found are , without exception , trans only .
Even when interacting with my most trustworthy allies , with the best will in the world , their cis privilege is an ever - present threat , no matter how muted or apparently under control .
In the context of this report , as long as there is even one cis person present – whether that ’s another prisoner or a member of the prison staff – no transsexual woman can ever consider herself “ safe ” .
To me , there are two very obvious problems with this form of segregation .
First , it denies our identities as women , as women who are transsexual .
Both the decision and the news report leave cis people as the unmarked class which automatically positions us as some sort of less - authentic women and men .
It Others us as a third gender – in this case , “ transgender inmates ” .
What is meant by transgender ?
I understand it to be an umbrella term which may include – for example – cross-dressers , and transsexual women who are undergoing a comprehensive medical / surgical / legal / social transition , as well as transsexual women who maybe are n’t considering surgery .
What about non-binary identified people ?
Additionally , I consider the term to also include self - identified men who may be transsexual – and the needs of each group are likely to differ widely .
So is this prison to accommodate transgender men as well as transgender women ?
If so , then male privilege will come into play , yet the question seems to have been left completely unexamined by the Italian authorities .
Or is the segregated prison to be further divided into areas exclusively for trans women and areas exclusively for trans men ?
And do n’t even start me on the potential ways that this proposal will , without a shadow of a doubt , completely fail people who were born sexually ambiguous or chromosomally atypical or who may otherwise fall under the catch - all term ‘ intersex ’ .
My second problem is that this “ solution ” further oppresses us as a minority group : if cis society really wants to serve our interests , then it needs to deal with the root of the problem and not the symptoms .
It needs urgently to stop seeing our existence as some sort of threat , and realise that it is failing – on a massive and undocumented scale – to be a truly inclusive society .
I simply cannot see how segregating all the “ transgender inmates ” in the country under one roof goes any way towards solving that problem and helping cis society to integrate fully with ours , to the point where these constructed divisions between us no longer ( need to ) exist .
And that is why I cannot see this as anything other than – at best – one step forward and two steps back .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States will run state - wide tests in Alaska on Wednesday of the country ’s Emergency Alert System , which uses television and radio to inform the public in the event of a national emergency .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a statement that the tests , which have been planned since September , would be conducted at 10 a.m. ( 2 p.m. EST / 1900 GMT ) .

As a result of the End - of - Year deals digital content distribution platform Steam was running over the past days , the service has apparently run out of unique serial / registration keys for the popular sci-fi RPG Mass Effect .
On Friday , Bioware ’s 2007 masterpiece was available on the service for one third of it ’s regular price and at this new $ 5 price level , demand has gotten so high that Steam users who purchase the game at this moment will not be able to play the game until Steam has replenished their stock of unique keys .
They made the following statement on their site :
Oops , this is embarrassing .
Due to high demand we have temporarily run out of unique keys for this title .
You may , by all means , purchase at the awesome sale price but may not be able to play until we receive more unique product keys .
It should n’t take too long , we have sent armed guards to the publisher ’s house to get them out of bed , drive them to their secret lair and produce more keys .
The long - awaited sequel to Mass Effect will launch later this month on PC and Xbox 360 .
Those who are quick might still benefit from the last few offers Steam is currently offering , which includes Torchlight , Left 4 Dead 2 , Grand Theft Auto IV , Bioshock , Killing Floor and other games at heavily reduced prices .
These offers can be found here and last until 12:00 EST .

Forget about usefulness , beauty alone is reason enough to justify conservation
George Monbiot
Tuesday January 13 , 2004
The Guardian
Last week , the journal Nature published a report suggesting that , by 2050 , around a quarter of the world ’s animal and plant species could die out as a result of global warming .
To these we must add the millions threatened by farming , logging , hunting , fishing and introduced species .
The future is beginning to look a little lonely .
Does it matter ?
To most of those who govern us , plainly not .
To most of the rest of us , the answer seems to be yes , but we are not quite sure why .
We have little difficulty in recognising the importance of other environmental issues .
Climate change causes droughts and floods , ozone depletion gives us skin cancer , diesel pollution damages our lungs .
But , while most people feel that purging the world of its diversity of animals and plants is somehow wrong , the feeling precedes a rational explanation .
For the past 30 years , the conservation movement has been trying to provide one .
Its efforts have , for the most part , failed …
Biodiversity , in other words , matters because it matters .
If we are to protect wildlife , we must do it for ourselves .
We need not pretend that anything else is bidding us to do so .
We need not pretend that anyone depends upon the king protea or the golden toad or the silky sifaka for their survival .
But we can say that , as far as we are concerned , the world would be a poorer place without them .

U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker -- who will be overseeing a federal court challenge to Prop 8 starting this Monday ( January 11 ) -- is considering whether or not to open the court room to TV cameras .
The court just announced that it is seeking public comment on the proposal to televise the trial -- and that all comments must be submitted to the court by a Friday deadline .
Not surprisingly , supporters of Prop 8 -- which took away the right of same - sex couples to marry in California -- do not want the trial to be televised .
We have just this one chance to make our voices heard -- thousands of Americans calling for equality , transparency and accountability .
That 's why we 're teaming up with the Courage Campaign to collect as many signatures as possible asking Judge Walker to televise the case .
We need your signature now :

For most of us , social networking sites are just for fun - checking what our friends are doing , organising our weekends or playing games when the boss is not looking .
But the stakes for users of sites like Facebook and Twitter are set to increase dramatically tomorrow , as the US government launches a competition that offers cunning web users the chance to win thousands of dollars .
In a nine - day challenge run by Darpa , the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency , members of the public are being offered a grand prize of $ 40,000 if they successfully use the internet and social networks to track down a series of balloons hidden across America .
Under the rules of the competition , known as the Darpa Network Challenge , 10 large red balloons will be launched simultaneously at secret location across the United States tomorrow .
Players have until December 14 to find out where they were located , and the first person - or group of people - to track them all down will scoop the jackpot , the equivalent of more than £ 24,000 .
The rules are relatively loose : the balloons , which each measure eight feet in diameter , will be placed at fixed locations that are easily accessible and visible from nearby roads but will only be visible for one day .
More than 300 teams have already signed up to take part and officials expect a number - from offering a reward online to sifting through various social networking sites to scan for sightings of the balloons .
" The most innovative ideas we probably have n't heard about yet , because there is an incentive to keep them secret , " said Peter Lee , director of the agency 's transformational convergence technology office .
On the surface , the premise seems a little wacky for a government agency that uses its annual budget of more than $ 3bn to create technology for use by the US military .
After all , the organisation , has helped fund technological breakthroughs such as the internet and unmanned aerial vehicles in its different incarnations over the years .
But despite the whimsical nature of the task , Darpa officials say they are not running the challenge for fun .
According to the event 's organisers , the challenge is an attempt to find out more about how large - scale problems can be solved by using the net and social networks to enhance " timely communication , wide - area team building and urgent mobilisation " .
The idea is that through observing how the various groups attempting the task fare , the organisation will learn a significant amount about the way computer systems and popular websites can be used to harness collective intelligence .
" We are not interested in the balloons - we already know where those are , " said the group 's deputy director , Norman Whitaker .
" It 's the techniques people use to solve the challenge we 're focused on . "
It is not the first time Darpa has taken an offbeat approach to its research for the Pentagon .
In recent years , the agency has run a number of other competitions open to the public , including a series of races pitting computer - controlled driverless cars against each other .
The latest challenge has already attracted a wide spread of interest from academics and computer scientists , as well as from some more unexpected quarters .
Record - breaking balloon artist Larry Moss has said that he will also be attempting to locate the targets .
Moss , who is based in Rochester , New York , says that if he wins the top prize , he will spend his winnings making a special tribute balloon in the shape of a giant flying cupcake .
" It 's a logical extension of my plans , " he said .
Our “ recent ” ( geologically speaking ) temperature history :
By Lawrence Solomon in the Financial Post
Thank your lucky stars to be alive on Earth at this time .
Our planet is usually in a deep freeze .
The last million years have cycled through Ice Ages that last about 100,000 years each , with warmer slivers of about 10,000 years in between .
We are in - betweeners , and just barely — we live in ( gasp ! ) year 10,000 or so after the end of the last ice age .
But for our good fortune , we might have been born in the next Ice Age .
Our luck is even better than that .
Those 10,000 - year warm spells are n’t all cosy - warm .
They include brutal Little Ice Ages such as the 500 - year - long Little Ice Age that started about 600 years ago .
Fortunately , we were n’t around during its fiercest periods when Finland lost one - third of its population , Iceland half , and most of Canada became uninhabitable — even the Inuit fled .
While the cold spells within the 10,000 year warm spells are n’t as brutal as a Little Ice Age , they can nevertheless make us huddle in gloom , such as the period in history from about 400 AD to 900 AD , which we know as the Dark Ages .
We ’ve lucked out twice , escaping the cold spells within the warm spells , making us inbetweeners within the inbetween periods .
How good is that ?
We are n’t alone in having been blessed by good weather .
About 2000 years ago , around the time of Caesar and Christ , temperatures were also gloriously warm , some say much warmer than those we ’ve experienced in recent decades .
That period — the centuries immediately before and after Caesar and Christ — are known as the Roman Warm Period , a time of wealth and accomplishment when the warmer weather filled granaries and extended grape and olive growing regions to lands that had previously been unarable .
Another period of unusual warmth came about 1000 years after the Roman Warm Period , during the centuries before and after the year 1000 , in what is known as the Medieval Warm Period .
In this period , again warmer than the present time , the world shucked off the insularity of the Dark Ages to allow civilization to once again blossom .
England , then positively balmy , became a grape - growing region .
In the North Atlantic , the Arctic sea ice released its grip over Greenland , making this vast island hospitable for Viking settlers .
In the Canadian Rockies , majestic forests — trees larger than those of today — thrived before their decimation by the glaciers that came in with the Little Ice Age .
Another 1000 years and we come to our time , known to climatologists as the Modern Warm Period .
What a great time of technological and cultural advancement we ’ve known , one of unprecedented prosperity , human longevity , and human comfort .
For a brief period in the 1970s it appeared to some scientists that the climate that had abetted our prosperity had turned — this was the fear of global cooling that then made headlines .
Though many now mock those fears of climate cooling , the scientists were eminent and the science was sound — after all , given Earth ’s history through the eons , and the passage of 10,000 years since the last ice age , it was hardly outlandish to believe that time of warmth was up .
It was n’t then — the decades after the 1970s have been about as good as it gets .
But it could be now .
In fact , some of the same scientists who in the 1970s warned of a new cold spell still believe it could be imminent .
Other eminent scientists with compelling new evidence have recently joined them in predicting the end of our Modern Warm Period .
They and others note that the warming of the planet stopped 11 years ago and that the planet has begun to cool .
If a new Dark Age does come , it could be rapid , marked by plunging temperatures and extreme weather events .
Such was the transition from the Roman Warm Period to the Dark Ages and from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age .
To date , we have seen no plunging temperatures , no uncharacteristically extreme weather .
If we are living on borrowed time , as the history of the world would suggest , this reprieve would be but one more blessing to count .
We should enjoy the warmth while we can , and hope that it persists so that the world our children and grandchildren inherit will be no less warm and welcoming .

La France a commencé à vendre à des pays étrangers une partie des 94 millions de doses de vaccins contre la grippe A , a déclaré dimanche la ministre de la santé , Roselyne Bachelot , confirmant une information du Parisien / Aujourd ' hui en France .
Le quotidien , qui cite des sources au ministère de la santé , précise que les doses sont revendues , par principe , au prix où elles ont été achetées auprès des laboratoires pharmaceutiques , soit de 6,25 à 10 euros selon les produits .
Cette opération , menée conjointement par les ministères de la santé et des affaires étrangères , vise à réduire la facture de la campagne de vaccination de masse décidée par le gouvernement ( pour un coût de 869 millions d'euros , selon le ministère ) .
Elle est la conséquence de l'avis rendu le 1er novembre par l'Agence européenne de la santé qui indique qu'une seule injection au lieu de deux suffit pour être protégé du virus .
" Ce jour - là , on a compris qu'avec les 94 millions de doses achetées en juillet , nous détenions trop de vaccins " , explique un responsable du ministère de la santé cité par Le Parisien .
Sanofi Pasteur , la division vaccins du groupe Sanofi - Aventis , s'est déclarée dimanche " disposée à examiner " une éventuelle demande de renégociation du contrat d'achat de doses de vaccins avec le gouvernement français .
" Pour l'instant , il n'y a pas eu de renégociation du contrat mais s'il devait y avoir des demandes du gouvernement , Sanofi Pasteur serait disposé à les examiner " , a affirmé un porte - parole du laboratoire .
" FIASCO "
Le député Jean - Marie Le Guen , spécialiste au PS des questions de santé , a réclamé dimanche une mission parlementaire pour faire le bilan de ce qu'il a qualifié d'" échec " du gouvernement dans la campagne de vaccination contre la grippe H1N1 .
" La politique vaccinale est malheureusement un fiasco " aboutissant " à ce que nous ayons le plus faible taux de personnes vaccinées des pays développés " , écrit - il sur son blog .
Depuis le début de la campagne de vaccination , lancée le 21 octobre , seules 5 millions de personnes environ ont été vaccinées .
D'après Le Parisien , des contrats ont déjà été signés avec le Qatar ( 300 000 doses ) et l'Egypte ( 2 millions ) pour un montant total 16,1 millions d'euros .
D'autres négociations sont en cours , notamment en Ukraine où une bataille commerciale oppose la France à l'Allemagne , qui essaie elle aussi de se défaire de ses excédents en vendant à Kiev 2,2 millions des 50 millions de doses commandées .
200 MORTS EN FRANCE
La France avait déjà offert en septembre 9 millions de doses à l'OMS , dans le cadre d'un effort conjoint avec les Etats - Unis , l'Australie , le Brésil , l'Italie , la Nouvelle Zélande , la Norvège , la Suisse et le Royaume Uni , pour mettre 10 % de leurs stocks au bénéfice des populations des pays les plus pauvres .
Signalé pour la première fois fin mars au Mexique , le virus H1N1 s'avère pour le moment moins meurtrier que redouté .
Fin décembre , il avait causé près de 200 décès en France et 12 200 à travers le monde , dont 10 000 aux Etats - Unis , de loin le pays le plus touché .
Le Monde avec Reuters
The news media has been reporting on something they are calling “ ClimateGate ” — some internal emails from the Climatic Research Unit in England that were hacked and leaked .
Some climate change skeptics are claiming that these emails prove that climate change is bogus .
Hardly .
I ’ve looked into the emails and the code , and there just is n’t any there there .
No smoking gun .
As a computer scientist who has worked extensively with simulations , I can say that it is common practice to play around with data to test out different scenarios , but the key point here is that none of the fudged data was ever published as real data .
None .
But what is really hypocritical is that back in 2007 , a likewise leaked internal document revealed that ExxonMobil was spending $ 16 million on an extensive PR campaign to confuse the public on global warming science .
To do this , they employed some of the same organizations and people who had spent 40 years helping the tobacco companies sow doubt about whether their product caused lung cancer .
One of the things they had done was to “ recruit and train a team of five independent scientists to participate in media outreach ” .
If they are recruited and trained by the oil company , how can they be independent ?
So on one hand , you have a large corporation spending millions of dollars to spread lies about climate change .
On the other hand , you have some internal emails from some scientists playing with their data , even though this data was never actually published .
So , which story does the mainstream media jump on ?
Guess .
UPDATE : FireDogLake has more about the hypocrisy of “ ClimateGate ” .
UPDATE 2 : An independent investigation of the “ ClimateGate ” emails has concluded that there is no evidence that data supporting global warming was faked .

Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood is quoted in this Reuters story :
" We want the drivers of big rigs and buses and those who share the roads with them to be safe , " LaHood said .
" This is an important safety step and we will be taking more to eliminate the threat of distracted driving . "
Failure to obey will come with a hefty cost , too : as high as $ 2,750 .
Those penalties -- and jail time if an accident occurs -- are more than justified by the danger these drivers are creating ; danger to their passengers , other drivers , and themselves .
If you 'd like to see a few example of the carnage being caused by inattentive bus and truck drivers , watch this MSNBC account of video footage captured on San Antonio buses .
It 's not as though this is a new issue that just popped up ; I 've been writing about it myself since early 2007 .
The data has been piling up for years , too , witness this study that says truck drivers who text from the road are 23 times more likely to have an accident .
The Department of Transportation even devotes an entire section of its Web site to distracted driving .
What took so long ?
( Update :
So right outside my fourth - floor office window I can see that a tractor - trailer truck has just torn up a big hunk of guard rail on the Massachusetts Turnpike .
Do you think maybe driver was ...?
Hey , it 's a straight stretch of road . )
The behavioralists insist that , contrary to what economists posit , people are not just irrational in a variety of ways ; they are “ predictably irrational . ”
But people are more predictably rational than the behavioralists ’ methods suggest .
Indeed , that is what I ’ve found , at least with respect to one prominent behavioralist finding ,
B ehavioral psychologists and behavioral economists have found a great deal of fault with economists ’ analytical methods .
Their criticisms follow a standard format .
Modern behavioralists first posit that , in their models , mainstream ( neoclassical ) economists assume that people are perfectly rational ( or nearly so ) as they go about their daily lives , which is to say that people make exacting estimates of the costs and benefits ( discounted precisely for risks and time ) in almost every choice situation .
The behavioralists then assert that many modern economists really do believe their own models ; that is , they really do believe that people are perfectly rational in their daily dealings .
In addition , if people were , in fact , as fully rational as economists assume , there would be no point to economics professors ’ explaining perfect rationality to their students .
Perfectly rational students would surely be able to understand , without instruction , their own perfect rationality .
Thus , all economic education would be a waste , devoted to explaining the nature and implications of rationality that perfectly rational ordinary people , not just privileged economists , would already know .
Indeed , if people were perfectly rational , all education , not just economics education , would be a waste .
Behavioralists certainly have important points .
People are not , and cannot be , as rational as economists say .
When pervasive real - world scarcity forces people to make choices , perfection in anything is not a viable option .
Perfection is simply not worth the time and mental energy required to achieve it .
Besides , as Herbert Simon recognized a half - century ago , the human brain is not sufficiently powerful , and the real world is too replete with uncertainties , for the refined calculations necessary for perfectly rational choices to be made .
Modern behavioralists have been rewarded for their detective work with widely read , sometimes best - selling books , the most prominent of which are Richard Thaler ’s and Cass Sunstein ’s Nudge ( 2008 ) and Dan Ariely ’s Predictably Irrational ( 2008 ) .
One behavioral psychologist , Daniel Kahneman , was awarded a Nobel Prize , in part for his relentless debunking of the presumption of perfect or unbounded rationality that economists perpetuate .
Behavioralists then dismiss much modern economic analysis as misleading , if not totally wrongheaded , and suggest that the better way to predict economic behavior is through surveys and experiments on how people actually make decisions .
Because they are so easily replicated , laboratory experiments are the “ fruit flies ” of social science , enabling the experimenters to conduct a frame - by - frame analysis of what people do , not what economists deduce they do .
Modern behavioralists have devised surveys and experiments that uncover a host of “ anomalies ” in people ’s decisions and behavior .
These surveys and experiments purport to show that people are beset with an array of serious decision - making biases , which means that they are not — and , by extension , cannot be — as perfectly rational as economists assume .
Indeed , behavioralists have uncovered so many decision - making biases and flaws resulting in so many documented “ irrationalities ” among their varied human subjects that one has to wonder why they believe themselves capable of writing rationally on the subject of people ’s irrationalities .
But to see the problems with this kind of thinking , consider one of the main experiments that behavioralists Kahneman and Amos Tversky use as evidence for the limitations of perfect rationality as a behavioral premise .
They offer their subjects two options : Option A is a “ sure thing , ” carrying a payoff of , say , $ 800 .
Option B is a gamble with an expected payoff of $ 850 :
The subjects have an 85 - percent chance of receiving $ 1,000 and a 15 - percent chance of getting nothing .
The behavioralists report that a “ large majority ” of subjects choose Option A , in spite of its having an expected value $ 50 lower than Option B. According to behavioralists , this majority choice demonstrates a form of “ bounded rationality . ”
In other words , the subjects ’ rational decision making is impaired by mental constraints on information processing and calculating capacity , not the least of which is risk aversion ( with risk aversion evident in people heavily favoring Option A ) .
I have repeated this exact choice experiment with my fully employed and executive ( business - seasoned ) MBA students for several years at the start of their first class — before we discuss rationality , decision making , or any microeconomic concepts and lines of analysis .
Just as Kahneman and Tversky report , a “ large majority ” — between 70 and 85 percent — of my MBA students choose Option A , the sure thing .
But would conventional economic thinking fail to predict such an outcome ?
Not really .
As Dwight Lee explained four decades ago ( and economists in earlier epochs have presumed ) , expected value is not all that matters for rational decision making .
What the behavioralists miss is that variance in outcomes is also consequential in assessing options .
Option A has no variance ; Option B has a substantial variance , with the outcome ranging from zero to $ 1,000 .
Hence , for many choosers , Option A can be more valuable than Option B. Indeed , if expected value were all that mattered , people would never buy insurance .
Is the purchase of insurance irrational ?
Economists have no particular expertise on why people value things as they do .
Indeed , the ( negative ) value of variance in choice situations can be expected to differ among choosers as much as the value of chocolate in candy bars varies across buyers of candy .
The main thing we economists can say is that people will vary the frequency of purchases with the price .
This means that economists cannot know a priori how people will choose between the two options .
They can , however , predict that if the payoff from Option A falls from $ 800 to a lower number , more people will choose Option B. Call this “ predictable rationality . ”
My MBA students appear to be predictably rational , given that the percentage choosing Option A goes down progressively as the sure thing falls to $ 750 and below .
This raises the question :
Why did the experiment set the spread between the amount of the sure - thing option and the expected value of the gamble chosen so low — only $ 50 ?
Was it to help the behavioralists demonstrate a high degree of “ irrationality ? ”
Similarly , economists can predict that if the variance of Option B declines , holding Option A constant , a higher percent of people will choose Option B . I ’ve also run an experiment in various classes by reducing the variance of Option B .
For example , I ’ve started the experiment by giving students one draw of one “ coupon ” from “ Barrel A , ” which contains only coupons with a redemption value of $ 800 .
Or they have ten draws from “ Barrel B , ” in which 85 percent of the “ coupons ” have redemption values of $ 100 and the rest have redemption values of zero .
Sure enough , the percentage of students choosing Barrel B is higher than in my first experiment described above .
When I tell them that they have 100 draws from Barrel B with 85 percent of the coupons worth $ 10 , it increases yet again .
The students are predictably rational , not predictably irrational .
Behavioralists also argue that how the options are “ framed ” influences choices .
I agree .
When I have described Options A and B as “ Business Venture A ” and “ Business Venture B , ” the percent of MBA students who choose “ Business Venture B ” plunges relative to the percent who choose “ Option B . ”
The change in wording may cause the students to think more explicitly about the financial gain for themselves ( or their bosses ) in the two ventures .
Perhaps , also , the students construe “ Business Venture B ” as having a lower variance than “ Option B ” because in business , any one venture is commonly a component of a whole portfolio of ventures , with the implied diversification in the portfolio dampening the risk involved in ventures taken separately .
In the original choice experiment between Options A and B , even if the subjects were told , after their choice , what percent chose each option , they were given no chance to act on that information .
In other words , the experiments explicitly did not allow for learning .
Moreover , the subjects had no personal incentive , or stake , in the choices they made , which could have meant that many subjects made choices carelessly ( and rationally so ) .
I partially remedied these deficiencies in runs of the experiment by telling my MBA students that 75 percent had chosen Option A , with the remainder choosing Option B . I then assigned them a team paper to address two questions :
First , given the division of the choices between A and B , were choosers of Option A or Option B leaving money on the table ?
Second , if money was being left on the table , what means could they devise to pick up a portion or all of that money ?
For the overwhelming majority of the 160 or so students in my three classes , the assignment appeared to be easy ( I ’ve infrequently assigned grades on this paper below A– ) .
They all concluded that the expected value of Option B was $ 850 , which meant that an average of $ 50 was being left on the table by all Option - B choosers .
Furthermore , virtually all of the teams readily developed a way in which all or a portion of the additional dollars could be pocketed .
Most teams proposed that students cooperate , all agreeing to choose Option B , and share equally their collective proceeds .
Not a bad solution in a relatively small class setting .
Other student teams devised a more entrepreneurial solution .
They proposed to induce Option A choosers , by offering them a sure thing of $ 801 , to switch their choice to Option B on condition that the draw would be handed over to those making the $ 801 payment .
Some students even realized that a sure - thing offer of $ 801 might not work , but only because others could be expected to come up with the same solution , which could lead to a bidding war for choosers of Option A ( the ranks of whom could be expected to swell as the sure - thing price rose and would - be Option B choosers moved progressively , or pretended to move , to Option A ) .
A handful of student teams also suggested that the reluctance of the Option A choosers to gamble on Option B could be alleviated partially by offering Option A choosers insurance against the downside risk of receiving nothing when choosing Option B .
The price of the insurance , of course , would take away some of the gain from choosing Option B .
Over the years , several of my students have taken the analysis further and recognized that if Options A and B were real - world business ventures , their market values would rise and fall with the division of the choices made between them .
If a large majority of choosers selected Option A , then surely people in real - world market settings offering Option A would have an incentive to lower its “ list price ” of $ 800 , causing a drift in the division of choices toward Option B .
Think this would n’t happen ?
It does .
Hordes of risk - averse people seeking security buy government treasury bonds , which are safer than corporate bonds .
As a result , the rate of return on government bonds relative to corporate bonds falls , with the spread causing many would - be government - bond buyers to settle for the higher return on corporate bonds .
Lessons Learned
In late November , with scant public disclosure , the Treasury Department started the Foreclosure Alternatives Program , through which it will encourage arrangements that result in distressed borrowers surrendering their homes .
The program will pay incentives to mortgage companies that allow homeowners to sell properties for less than they owe on their mortgages  short sales , in real estate parlance .
The government will also pay incentives to mortgage companies that allow delinquent borrowers to hand over their deeds in lieu of foreclosing .
Ms. Reilly , the Treasury spokeswoman , said the foreclosure alternatives program did not represent a new policy .
“ We have said from the start that modifications will not be the solution for all homeowners and will not solve the housing crisis alone , ” Ms. Reilly said by e-mail .
“ This has always been a multi- pronged effort . ”
Whatever the merits of its plans , the administration has clearly failed to reverse the foreclosure crisis .
In 2008 , more than 1.7 million homes were “ lost ” through foreclosures , short sales or deeds in lieu of foreclosure , according to Moody ’s Economy.com .
Last year , more than two million homes were lost , and Economy.com expects that this year ’s number will swell to 2.4 million .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any way for Treasury to tweak their plan , or to cajole , pressure or entice servicers to do more to address the crisis , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ For some folks , it is doing more harm than good , because ultimately , at the end of the day , they are going back into the foreclosure morass . ”
Mr. Zandi argues that the administration needs a new initiative that attacks a primary source of foreclosures : the roughly 15 million American homeowners who are underwater , meaning they owe the bank more than their home is worth .
Increasingly , such borrowers are inclined to walk away and accept foreclosure , rather than continuing to make payments on properties in which they own no equity .
A paper by researchers at the Amherst Securities Group suggests that being underwater “ is a far more important predictor of defaults than unemployment . ”
My own view is that 2009 has been an extraordinarily successful year for Obama .
Since this is currently a minority view and will prompt a chorus of " In The Tank ! " , allow me to explain .
The substantive record is clear enough .
Torture is ended , if Gitmo remains enormously difficult to close and rendition extremely hard to police .
The unitary executive , claiming vast , dictatorial powers over American citizens , has been unwound .
The legal inquiries that may well convict former Bush officials for war crimes are underway , and the trial of KSM will reveal the lawless sadism of the Cheney regime that did so much to sabotage our war on Jihadism .
Military force against al Qaeda in Pakistan has been ratcheted up considerably , even at a civilian cost that remains morally troubling .
The US has given notice that it intends to leave Afghanistan with a bang - a big surge , a shift in tactics , and a heavy batch of new troops .
Iraq remains dodgy in the extreme , but at least March elections have been finally nailed down .
Domestically , the new president has rescued the banks in a bail - out that has come in at $ 200 billion under budget ; the economy has shifted from a tailspin to stablilization and some prospect of job growth next year ; the Dow is at 10,500 a level no one would have predicted this time last year .
A stimulus package has helped undergird infrastructure and probably did more to advance non-carbon energy than anything that might have emerged from Copenhagen .
Universal health insurance ( with promised deficit reduction ! ) is imminent - a goal sought by Democrats ( and Nixon ) for decades , impossible under the centrist Clinton , but won finally by a black liberal president .
More progress has been made in unraveling the war on drugs this past year than in living memory .
The transformation of California into a state where pot is now more available than in Amsterdam is as remarkable as the fact that such new sanity has spread across the country and is at historic highs , so to speak , in the opinion polls .
On civil rights , civil marriage came to the nation 's capital city , which has a 60 percent black population .
If that does n't help reverse some of the gloom from Prop 8 and Maine , what would ?
And , yes , the unspeakable ban on HIV - positive foreigners was finally lifted , bringing the US back to the center of the global effort to fight AIDS as it should be .
1-10-10
To the government 's critics , it was a long and shocking act of official stonewalling : Agreements long hidden in Foreign Ministry files allowed nuclear - armed U.S. warships to enter Japanese ports , violating a hallowed principle of postwar Japan .
Yet their very existence was officially denied .
Now , in a clear break from the past , a new prime minister has gone where none of his predecessors dared go :
He has ordered a panel of ministry officials and academics to investigate the secret agreements .
The findings , due out this month , are part of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama 's wide - ranging campaign to wrest power from the bureaucracy and make government more open than under the conservatives , who ruled Japan for most of the past 50 years .
They also could intensify public debate about the future of Japan 's long - standing security alliance with the U.S. , which has bases here .
Hatoyama , a liberal who took office in September , has called for making the relationship more balanced , starting with efforts to evict an unpopular U.S. base from the island of Okinawa .
That Japan agreed to let nuclear - armed ships enter its ports and waters ceased to be a secret some years ago with the declassification of American documents .
Such ships had routinely docked in various Japanese ports since the 1960s , sometimes setting off protests .
But in a nation where memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki drive a fierce aversion to nuclear weapons , a formal admission of the secret agreements would be a stunning reversal , and confirm that previous governments systematically lied to the public .
" The Foreign Ministry repeatedly denied their existence , even in statements before Parliament , " lawmaker Muneo Suzuki said in an interview with The Associated Press .
Suzuki held top political posts at the Foreign Ministry , yet although he had heard about the secret documents , he said that even he could not pry them out of his officials .
" The Foreign Ministry should be held deeply accountable , " said Suzuki , who has switched sides and is now a member of Hatoyama 's coalition .
Historical accounts show that Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira , who died in office in 1980 , considered going public on the secret pacts , but was advised against it by his aides as politically too dangerous .
Only a few Foreign Ministry bureaucrats have spoken out in recent years .
One , Kazuhiko Togo , said he and other high - ranking officials kept quiet for fear that disclosure of the agreements would trigger riots and perhaps topple the prime minister .
" The political costs were too great , " Togo told the AP .
Even after American officials acknowledged the pacts in the 1990s , leaders of the long - ruling Liberal Democratic Party persistently denied them , right up to Taro Aso , the last LDP prime minister before Hatoyama 's Democrats took over .
" They did not exist , " Aso said in a nationally televised response to a reporter 's question last July .
" It all goes to show how far behind Japan is in administrative transparency , " said Koichi Nakano , professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo .
Even the name of revered Eisaku Sato , the prime minister viewed as the architect of Japan 's postwar pacifism and resistance to nuclear weapons , has been thrust into the debate .
Three weeks ago , Sato 's son revealed a document he found in Sato 's desk after his death in 1975 and which he kept hidden .
The 1969 document , signed by Sato and President Richard Nixon , showed they agreed that U.S. - occupied Okinawa would be returned to Japan , but the U.S. would retain the right to have nuclear weapons on the island if the necessity arose .
The agreements on Okinawa were a key part of the secret pacts that also covered U.S. warships entering ports throughout Japan .
Back then , it was the height of the Cold War , and the U.S. felt it needed a free hand to confront nuclear - armed China and the Soviet Union .
But the deal with Nixon was a clear violation of Sato 's pledge that Japan would not make , own or allow the entry of nuclear weapons .
Sato won the 1974 Nobel Peace Prize in large part for pushing those principles .
According to Japanese media accounts , the trade - off drove him to tears of remorse .
But the principles became policy all the same .
The previously declassified U.S. documents include State Department papers on the 1960 U.S. - Japan security pact , accounts of meetings at which the entry of warships with nuclear weapons was discussed and a memorandum on the 1969 Nixon - Sato meeting , where the Okinawa deal was discussed .
And even in the 1990s , after U.S. warships stopped carrying battle - ready nukes and the issue became moot , it remained sensitive enough for governments to go on misleading the public .
Japanese today are more shocked by the cover - up than by the deed itself , but they remain attached to the non-nuclear principle .
A survey by the Mainichi newspaper , which interviewed more than 4,500 people , found 72 percent of the 2,600 respondents want to stick with the principles , and the number rose to about 80 percent among Japanese in their 20s and 30s .
No margin of error was given .
Shoji Niihara , a scholar of U.S. - Japan relations , said Japanese are hoping their new reformist prime minister will redefine Japan 's relationship with the U.S. and work with President Barack Obama in his call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
" There 's a strong feeling that Japan was never truly treated as an independent country , " he said .
Robert A. Wampler , a senior fellow at the National Security Archive , an American group that seeks to declassify historical documents , welcomed Hatoyama 's investigation .
" The longer they denied this , the harder it was for them to come forward and say they were n't telling the truth .
They backed themselves into a corner on this one , " Wampler said in a telephone interview from Washington , D.C .
Bunroku Yoshino , a former Foreign Ministry official who oversaw relations with the U.S. , did his part on Dec. 1 .
Testifying in a lawsuit brought by a former newspaper reporter , 91 - year - old Yoshino reversed his earlier denials and acknowledged signing some of the Okinawa agreements .
" It is a major historical truth , " he said afterward .

当代GPL違反分析 著者： Bradley M. Kuhn 日本語訳： yomoyomo
以下の文章は 、Bradley M. Kuhn による The Anatomy of a Modern GPL Violation の日本語訳である 。
この数週間 、GPL 違反の展開について考えている。私が GPL の執行に携わるようになって十年経ったが、その変化について考えてみるのにちょうど良いタイミングに思える。
大雑把に言うと、典型的な GPL 違反はフリーソフトウェアの採用の広がりをほぼそのままなぞっている。私が
GPL 違反を探し始めた頃は、（衰弱が始まってまだ数年しか経っておらず）まだ高価な大型
Unix が支配していて 、GNU ツールがまさに最先端になっていた。実際、システム管理者として私はよくプロプライエタリな
Unix システムを扱ったが、 / usr / local / には GNU ツールでいっぱいだった。GNU extensions がすべて入ってるわけではない POSIX が嫌いだったからだ 。
当時、多くのベンダが、私がシステム管理者として感じていたのと同じ欲求不満を抱えていた。従って、当時の典型的な
GPL 違反は、ある程度高価な大型 Unix 上で利用するために、サードパーティベンダが製品に一部の GNU ツールを組み込むことだった。あの頃は GNU tar に関して GPL に違反するバックアップ製品をよく見たものだ 。
時代が変わり、コンピュータが本当に小さくなるにつれ、組み込み
Unix ライクなシステムが生まれた。GNU / Linux や（より一般的なのが ）BusyBox / Linux が、この領域における完璧なソリューションだった。かつて1990年代に
comp.os.linux.advocacy で言われたジョーク 「 トースター上で動く Linux が本当にもう少しで実現するぜ」が現実になり始めたのである。
BusyBox / Linux ベースの組み込み機器の第一陣は無線ルータだった。2000年代を通じて、典型的な
GPL 違反は常に一部の無線ルータだった。今でもこの種類の製品が
GPL を違反してるのをときどき見るが、2000 年代をほぼ通じて Erik Andersen、FSF、そして Harald Welte により行われた執行により、無線ルータの GPL 違反はどちらかというと例外的なものになったと思う。その執行により、OpenWRT や DD - WRT といったコミュニティ中心の開発が生まれることにもなった。すべては我々（Erik、Harald、そして（当時私が属していた）FSF）皆が2002年に一緒になって
WRT54G のソース公開を保証させたことが始まりである。
2009 年の現在、ほとんどすべての電気製品に汎用のコンピュータが載っている。8MB RAM としかるべきプロセッサを積んだコンピュータが機器に入っているのが今では一般的だ。そう、BusyBox/Linux
はいつだってその種のコンピュータに最適なオペレーティングシステムだ！
つまり、現在大手の電機メーカーの製品売り場を通り過ぎれば、目にする機器の多くに
BusyBox / Linux が入ってるということになるわけだ。
GPL とコピーレフトの要件を無視しても逃げおおせる企業もあると考える人がいる。その企業の顧客がトータル五人で、その誰もソースを求めないなら、GPL 違反は発見されないかもしれない。しかし 、BusyBox / Linux ベースで大衆市場の製品を作るなら、いずれそれなりに頭の良いソフトウェア開発者が買うことになる。彼らは好奇心が強く、それをつついてみて、中に何が入っているか気付くだろう。そして、その開発者が次の出すメールは、私宛のその機器に関するすべてを知らせるものになる。十年に及ぶ
GPL 執行の経験から言わせてもらうと、思うに企業が GPL 違反を 「 逃げおおせる」勝算は途方もなく小さい。最終的にはユーザコミュニティが警告を行っておおっぴらにその企業の面目をつぶすか（これは私が好む執行のやり方ではない）、私などの者に連絡が来て内密に執行を行い、FLOSS
コミュニティに敵対するのでなく加わるようその企業に友好的な形で促すかのいずれかになる。
これだけ多くの企業が多くの新製品のデフォルトプラットフォームに
BusyBox / Linux を採用してきたことを私はものすごく嬉しく思っている。およそ1994年にはじめて「トースターで
Linux を走らせられるか？」ジョークを見て以来、大衆市場の電気製品で
FLOSS を中に見つけられないものを買うのが不可能になるときが来るのを私は夢見てきた。自分が生きている間にそうした時代に達しつつあるのに私は満足している。
しかしながら、そうしたイノベーションは GPL によって作られたコモンズによって可能になっている。私は大人になってからの生活の大きな割合を
GPL の執行に捧げてきたが、これはそのコモンズの価値を固く信じているからこそだ。何度も何度も
GPL 違反を見つけるたび、私は彼らを友好的な形で我々のコミュニティに迎え入れるのを期待して、彼らに多くのものを与えてくれたコモンズを尊重し、コードが書き始められたコミュニティに彼らのコードをお返しするよう彼らにお願いをするわけだ。
The church bells rang all afternoon .
Archbishop Rafael Romo Muñoz was on his way to say a Mass marking the transfer of Father Raymundo Figueroa , the beloved priest at Santisimo Sacramento parish .
Hundreds of men , women and children answered the call of the bells .
But they were n’t there to greet the bishop .
FOR THE RECORD :
Mexican priest :
An article in the Dec. 21 Section A about Father Raymundo Figueroa , a controversial Roman Catholic priest in Rosarito Beach , Mexico , incorrectly reported that Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Los Angeles Archdiocese sent a letter to Tijuana diocese officials complaining that Figueroa had crossed into the United States to perform sacraments for a fee .
In fact , a regional auxiliary bishop from the Los Angeles Archdiocese , Gerald Wilkerson , had faxed a memo to parishes in parts of northern L.A. County warning of Figueroa ’s possible activities . —
They chained the gates and locked the doors .
They hung signs .
“ This church belongs to the people ; not the church , ” read one .
When Romo stepped out of his SUV , 20 robed priests from the Tijuana diocese tried to form a procession , but burly men blocked their way .
The archbishop tried to say a prayer , but the crowd drowned him out with bullhorns and bells .
Priests and parishioners traded insults through the chain - link fence .
“ Liar , ” one person yelled at Romo .
“ We hope our brother reconsiders his attitude , ” Romo said , asking people to join him in prayer .
The bells kept ringing .
The archbishop , Baja California ’s highest Roman Catholic authority , retreated .
The people applauded and bowed their heads in prayer .
More than a month after that chilly November evening , Figueroa remains the parish priest .
To parishioners , he is a brave figure who transformed a half - finished building into this seaside city ’s largest house of worship .
To the Catholic hierarchy , he ’s a rogue who has financed his church through simony , the selling of the sacraments -- one of the Roman Catholic Church ’s oldest and most serious transgressions .
Romo was on a mission to oust Figueroa because complaints had been pouring in from priests and bishops as far away as Los Angeles .
They accused the cleric of crossing into the United States and charging up to $ 180 for fast - tracked confirmations , first Communions and baptisms .
Scores of Mexican priests have been crossing the border for this purpose , but Figueroa ’s case was so serious that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles and Bishop Robert H. Brom of San Diego sent letters to Romo , according to Tijuana diocese officials .
“ These are underground celebrations , hidden from the diocese here and the diocese there , ” said Father Juan Garcia Ruvalcaba , the vicar general of the Tijuana diocese .
“ It ’s a lot of money . . . and [ Figueroa ] does n’t provide an accounting to anybody . ”
Many Catholics in Mexico are n’t fussy about bookkeeping when they see churches rising .
They view Mexican priests like Figueroa as Robin Hood figures who raid relatively wealthy parishes in the U.S. to build up their impoverished churches .
Figueroa , 41 , seems to relish his image as a populist tweaking the staid church .
He ’s been hammered on talk radio , denounced from pulpits and criticized in an expose in the diocese newspaper .
He delivers impassioned sermons greeted by loud ovations and vows of support from his congregation .
When he is pressed to address the accusations , his answers are cryptic and cloaked in irony , only deepening the intrigue .
He is clear about one thing :
The church is picking on the wrong guy .
“ I ’m portrayed as the worst priest in the world .
Never ! ” Figueroa said .
“ I ’ve never become a drunk or a priest that runs around with women .
There are priests like that , you know .
Drunks .
Pedophiles .
I ’ve only tried to serve this community as best as I can . ”
When Figueroa arrived at the parish in February 2007 , the church was little more than a wooden shell with a bare concrete floor .
Worshipers had to bundle together to ward off cold ocean breezes .
Figueroa oversaw a frenzy of construction to complete the church , a modestly appointed but expansive space that features an open - beam ceiling , a granite crypt and seating for about 300 .
The church became a source of pride .
The parish rolls have grown dramatically to about 8,000 people , and instead of five Masses on Sundays , there are 14 .
On Sundays , people occupy every cushioned pew and spill into the courtyard , where Figueroa ’s sermons are heard through loudspeakers .
Figueroa ’s success as a builder explains only part of his appeal .
Like many in the working - class hillside neighborhood of Colonia Constitucion , Figueroa grew up in a poor town in central Mexico .
People identify with his sermons , which are filled with parables about village life and peasants , and he draws laughs with his impressions of stubborn old ladies and mischievous children .
“ He talks to us , not above us , ” said Reyna Jaregui , 42 , waiting for Figueroa to baptize her grandson .
“ If you do n’t understand something , he explains and explains again . ”
Figueroa has broken ground on projects at several other chapels in his parish .
Other clergy eye the construction suspiciously .
“ Be Alert , ” reads the Nov. 1 bulletin at Our Lady of the Holy Rosary church in Los Angeles .
“ Father Raymundo Figueroa of the Diocese of Tijuana is in this area and is presiding at baptisms and first Communions for a fee of $ 180 per person .
He is here without permission of his bishop . ”
U.S. churches do n’t normally charge for the sacraments unless , as in the case of weddings , there are expenses such as musicians and flowers .
Simony was a common transgression in the Middle Ages , when simonists were condemned to hell in Dante ’s “ Inferno . ”
The modern consequences are n’t quite so dire , but in the most serious cases they can include a priest ’s suspension .
Figueroa is suspected of organizing ceremonies from Chula Vista to the San Fernando Valley .
Fifty to several hundred children at a time receive the sacraments in nonchurch settings , like parks and hotels , people ’s living rooms and backyards .
Instead of church choirs and organs , strolling mariachis provide the music .
“ They just do it in people ’s houses .
You do n’t need much .
For baptisms , a little water .
For first Communions , you just set up a table , ” said Father Richard Zanotti of the Holy Rosary parish in Los Angeles .
Church officials say that Figueroa sometimes sends deacons to step in for him or contracts with bishops and priests from the Old Catholic Church , a breakaway group from the Roman Catholic Church .
Though sacraments administered by Figueroa are valid , those officiated by deacons or non-Catholic priests probably are n’t , several priests said .
To avoid church scrutiny , the services are done on short notice , the cash - only ceremonies offering a convenient fulfillment of Catholic obligations .
While the church ’s educational requirements for first Communion can take two years , Figueroa ’s classes , taught by laypeople from his church , take a matter of months .
“ It makes it difficult for us .
We have certain policies to help people prepare , and [ Figueroa ] has circumvented all that , ” Zanotti said .
Martha Gonzalez , 47 , of Chula Vista said a fast - track first Communion for her son appealed to her .
As a working single mother , she did n’t have time to shuttle her then - 10 - year - old to catechism classes and church for two years .
The classes , held in a garage , were supposed to last six months , she said .
After a month and half she got a call from the teacher saying her son was ready for Communion .
The classes were $ 160 and it would cost $ 20 more for flowers and chairs for the ceremony .
About 60 children received first Communion in November 2007 at a park in San Ysidro , she said .
There was a canopy and a table and just enough chairs for the children .
According to Gonzalez , Figueroa said a quick Mass and the children received certificates stamped with the seal of his church in Rosarito Beach .
Gonzalez recalled someone saying that Figueroa also offered confirmations -- ceremonies that confer the holy spirit and normally require catechism classes .
The next month , hundreds of children from Southern California showed up at Figueroa ’s church for confirmations , Gonzalez said .
Those from Los Angeles paid $ 75 , San Diego residents paid $ 65 and Rosarito Beach residents paid $ 35 , she said .
Gonzalez said she is unsure whether her son ’s confirmation is valid .
Confirmations normally must be administered by a bishop , but Gonzalez said she now doubts the cleric who confirmed her son was a Roman Catholic bishop .
A spokesman for Figueroa ’s church said confirmations are done by authorized clerics and that charging for sacraments is common in Mexico so churches can cover their expenses .
Gonzalez acknowledged that she ’s partly at fault for seeking the convenient route but said the church should better police its clerics : “ What I learned from this .
It ’s not about faith .
It ’s just business . ”
The church ’s unhappiness with Figueroa became public in May when he said a Mass during the swine flu scare , disobeying Romo ’s order , issued for health reasons , not to hold public gatherings .
Figueroa said he held the ceremony only after his parishioners requested it .
But church officials said it was part of a pattern of disobedience going back several years .
Figueroa subsequently refused to switch parishes as ordered by Romo , leading to the confrontation in November .
The clash that Friday evening exposed long - simmering social and class rifts .
Parishioners viewed the bishop and his entourage as elitists trying to remove the one priest who had achieved results in their long - neglected parish .
“ Before him , there was nothing here , ” said Rudy Roldan , 21 .
“ Father Ray arrived and he delivered results .
People noticed . ”
Since then , Figueroa , who was not present at the confrontation with Romo , has engaged in an escalating war of words with other priests and the church hierarchy , which is weighing whether to suspend him .
One Tijuana priest on a radio show accused him of taking money from drug traffickers .
Figueroa suggested he might reveal the names of alcoholic and womanizing priests .
After Mass one Sunday afternoon , Figueroa made what seemed to be a startling admission about simony .
“ I wish I was the only one doing it .
There ’s too much competition out there , ” Figueroa said during an interview in his cluttered sacristy .
A clutch of aides and parishioners burst into laughter .
Moments later , he appeared to back away from his statement , saying his cross - border activity ended years ago .
He said he used to celebrate the sacraments for people he knew from his days as a seminarian at the San Fernando Mission but stopped after church officials complained .
He said he does n’t even have a U.S. visa anymore .
Figueroa kept talking while people crowded into the sacristy .
He blessed a few babies , stamped some catechism cards and shook hands with friends .
The people simply want a church that ’s responsive to their needs , he said .
He bristled at accusations of shady accounting and underground ceremonies .
His door -- and books -- are always open , he said .
“ In the eyes of God , ” Figueroa said , “ nothing is secret . ”

To be blunt : in our view the jobs data were plainly miserable and disappointing .
Like many of our readers , I listened to the debate on CNBC and read numerous analyses .
We will set aside the perennial optimists who find positive outcomes in any data set .
Simply put : a 10 % unemployment rate and a 17.3 % underemployment rate are two extremely serious numbers .
They help explain the market ’s immediate reaction , which was a Treasury bond price rally and a drop in the 2 - year note yield to an intraday low of 0.936 % .
The 2 - year note yield under 1 % is a very important figure for market watchers .
It is a key market - based pricing of expectations for the Federal Reserve ’s interest - rate policy .
This reaction essentially suggests that the Fed will maintain the policy - setting Federal Funds interest rate range of 0.0 % to 0.25 % for at least the first half of 2010 .
That has been Cumberland ’s expectation for some time .
The assumption of a very low US interest - rate policy continues to drive our investment decisions as we conduct stewardship over portfolios through these extraordinary times .
Talk about an imminent exit strategy by the Fed is just talk .
It is quite possible that the Fed will maintain the zero - bound rate for the entire year .
Maybe , they will firm the rate to 0.25 % instead of a range this summer .
Our longer - term estimate is that we will not see the Fed Funds Rate above 1 % until 2011 at the earliest .

Update July 2017 …
Too tired to do anything useful while awake between feedings with our 3 - week - old baby , I created this more - or - less direct port of the original Java - based project from almost 19 years ago .
The original project was created one evening at the ACG , with the help of Golan Levin ( who contributed the code for the ' huddle ' fug ) , and Peter Cho ( who had the idea about having a mark follow the mouse after the button was released ) .
A longer , poorly written ramble from me as grad student can be found on another page .
Microsoft closes
The Noughties by trying to keep up with competitors and to remain a top destination for developers by embracing cloud computing and open source .
It opened the decade with another massive platform shift , though : the introduction of .NET .
. NET was announced at the first TechEd of decade in Amsterdam in the year 2000 with more detail provided at the Professional Developer 's Conference in Orlando , Florida .
In the ensuing decade , did .NET deliver what Microsoft promised ?
The .NET story makes more sense if you consider what Microsoft was up against at the time .
The central place of Windows was being undermined not only by the internet , but also by Sun Microsystems ' Java language and runtime .
Java was easy to code , thanks to its modern design and automatic memory management , came with its own cross- platform runtime , and was being adopted with enthusiasm by the likes of IBM and Oracle .
Microsoft had tried to add Windows - specific features such as COM integration to Java , but the response was a billion - dollar lawsuit from Sun for breaking cross-platform compatibility .
COM is a native Windows component model for application integration .
Microsoft 's developer tools were also looking tired .
Visual Basic was quirky , underpowered , easy for beginners but difficult for experts .
Visual C++ and the Windows class library , Microsoft Foundation Classes , were difficult for everyone .
Web development with COM and Active Server Pages was messy and fragile .
The company 's answer was bold .
" We 're going to deliver a whole new platform called the Microsoft . NET Platform , " said general manager Michael Risse at TechEd 2000 .
It was comprised of three parts .
First , there was a new " common language runtime " , which supported existing languages including Visual Basic and C++ as well as a new language called C# , designed by Anders Hejlsberg of Borland Delphi fame , and which embraced many of the same concepts found in Java .
Then , there were to be building block services , " a set of services in the sky " , accessible over the Internet via XML web services .
Microsoft Passport was an early example .
Finally , all of Microsoft 's existing server products were to be re-tooled as .NET servers , with XML as the unifying protocol .
Risse talked about next - generation applications as " the universal canvas , an aggregation of different single web services that are brought together as appropriate . "
His .NET announcement was followed by a demonstration of BizTalk , the server product which Risse hoped would be orchestrating many of those services .
During the 2008 campaign , a group called Citizens United put together a documentary , Hillary : The Movie .
Remember seeing it on cable TV ?
No , you do n't , because the organization decided it could n't show the film without the risk of felony prosecution .
It had every reason to be afraid .
The problem was that the movie was not only about Clinton but made the case that she should not be president .
Worse , it was supposed to be shown during — get this — an election campaign .
That , under the federal law , made it verboten .
You might think the point of a campaign is to air facts and opinions about the people running , so that voters will have a wealth of information upon which to choose .
But in the judgment of Congress , some facts and opinions are not welcome .
Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation set up to engage in conservative advocacy — an assemblage of individuals working for a political agenda .
As individuals , they have the right to spend money to spread their opinions .
But when they form a corporation for that purpose , some people think the same activities should be illegal .
That point of view prevailed in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 , which forbade corporations from engaging in " electioneering communication " within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election .
But Citizens United claimed the rule violated its free speech rights .
And last week , the Supreme Court agreed .
The result was not in much doubt after the justices heard the case .
The government lawyer defending the statute was asked :
If movies financed by corporations may be banned because they express opinions on candidates , how about books ?
" It 's a 500 - page book , and at the end it says , ' So vote for X , ' the government could ban that ? " asked Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. Replied the Justice Department attorney , " Well , if it says ' vote for X , ' it would be express advocacy and it would be covered by the pre-existing Federal Election Campaign Act provision . "
If the corporation wanted to publish such a book , he continued , " we could prohibit the publication of the book using corporate treasury funds . "
We could prohibit the publication of the book .
If corporate advocacy may be forbidden as it was under the law in question , it 's not just Exxon Mobil and Citigroup that are rendered mute .
Nonprofit corporations set up merely to advance goals shared by citizens , such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association , also have to put a sock in it .
So much for the First Amendment goal of fostering debate about public policy .
It is often argued that corporate speech may be banned because corporations enjoy certain privileges afforded by law .
But it 's a longstanding constitutional axiom that the government may not require the surrender of constitutional rights in exchange for state - furnished benefits — say , barring criticism of Congress by residents of public housing .
Once you grant the government that sort of power , it is bound to expand .
Newspapers could be forbidden to make endorsements .
Right now , media companies are exempt from the ban .
But why should a newspaper be free to spend money urging voters to support a candidate , while other companies are not ?
Critics fear that freed from constraints , giant corporations will burn vast sums to help or hurt politicians .
In reality , most business people are not about to plunge into divisive election campaigns , for fear of antagonizing customers .
Apple and Microsoft are not going to be squaring off to see who can elect the next president .
In Illinois , corporations have always been allowed to spend money on elections .
They rarely take any noticeable role .
In the end , the right to speak does not mean the power to control the political process .
It merely means the right to convey views that citizens are free to reject — which , if they distrust corporate power , is exactly what they are likely to do .
Under this ruling , corporations will be allowed to speak about politics , just as they may speak about their products .
In both realms , though , the effort is wasted unless they offer something their audience wants .
The marketplace of ideas is not so different from the marketplace of goods .
Corporations have the freedom to communicate what they want .
But the people still have the ultimate right : the right to say no .

During a conference call with investors earlier this week , Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated that expectations for the upcoming Wii-FPS Red Steel 2 have been halved .
Though the game was initially expected to sell approximately one million units , these expectations are now lowered to 500.000 units .
In recent weeks , major third party publishers such as Sega and Capcom have stated they will shift focus away from the Wii’s ‘ core ’ segment , as games aimed at these demographics have consistently failed to achieve mainstream success despite positive critical reviews .
Ubisoft has not made a statement as to whether or not it intends to continue developing games for the ‘ core ’ segment of the Nintendo Wii userbase .
Red Steel 2 will release in March 2010 and will be bundled with the Wii Motion Plus extender for the Wii Remote .
Red Steel 2 has been specifically designed to make use of the increased accuracy of the Wii Motion Plus .

The latest big lie being spread through right wing media is that Bill Clinton not George W. Bush is to blame for 9/11 .
On FNC ’s Hannity program , Dick Morris said , “ The reason 9/11 happened was because Bill Clinton treated the ’93 bombing of the World Trade Center as a crime , not an act of war . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Morris and host Sean Hannity were talking about how Democrats are soft on terrorism , because they treat terrorism like a crime , when Morris added , “ You know the other point here is that the reason 9/11 happened was because Bill Clinton treated the ’93 bombing of the World Trade Center as a crime not as an act of war , and now Obama is going through the exact same situation . ”
Advertisements
The reason why the basis for the right wing argument that Bill Clinton should be blamed for 9/11 is such nonsense is because terrorism is a crime .
If we accept Morris ’ argument that terrorism is an act of war , than we have to ask if all terrorist acts are an act of war , or only the actions carried out by Muslims ?
I ask this because the Oklahoma City bombing was carried out by Americans .
Did Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols commit an act of war , or was it a crime ?
If every act of terrorism is an act of war , then this must apply to all terrorists , not only the foreign ones .
In order to blame Bill Clinton for 9/11 one has to ignore the fact that the Bush administration received intelligence about a potential attack prior to 9/11 and chose to ignore it .
It is also impossible to blame Bill Clinton for 9/11 because he was not the president when the attacks occurred .
Blaming Bill Clinton for 9/11 is a lot like blaming George Washington for the Civil War because he did n’t abolish slavery .
Dick Morris ’ point was nothing more than attempt to whitewash the GOP ’s responsibility for their biggest national security failure .
They can keep repeating their latest big lie , but it is unlikely to gain much traction .
The gold medallion given to recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize does n’t come with a ribbon , but the award could still end up being a weight around President Obama ’s neck .
Intended to honor Obama for altering the nation ’s diplomatic direction , the award is likely to call attention to how much of the administration ’s agenda -- including closing Guantanamo Bay and winding down the war in Iraq -- remains undone , and to the problematic nature of the American presence in Afghanistan .
The prize also poses political risks for a president routinely depicted by Republicans as more focused on seeking international approval than on defending the security interests of the United States .
That criticism could be compounded if Obama rejects the military ’s request for an additional 40,000 troops in Afghanistan .
Obama has recently struggled over how to proceed in that conflict , and just hours after learning that he had won the award , he met with senior members of his war Cabinet .

Mindful of such perils , the president sought Friday to downplay the significance of the Nobel Peace Prize , describing it as a “ means to give momentum ” to causes that others also embrace , and saying , “ To be honest , I do not feel that I deserve ” it .
The award undoubtedly carries benefits .
Winning the Nobel might strengthen Obama ’s diplomatic hand as he enters negotiations with nuclear rogues such as North Korea and Iran .
“ We think that this gives us a sense of momentum when the United [ States ] has accolades tossed its way rather than shoes , ” said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley , recalling the reception that President George W. Bush got last year in Baghdad .
But some in Obama ’s party saw dangers .
Underscoring concern that the award might fuel criticism that Obama is too accommodating , the Democratic National Committee issued a news release designed to show that the president is still reviled by America ’s foes .
It showcased comments from the Taliban condemning the award as “ unjust , ” and from Hamas calling it “ too early . ”

If Obama failed to make headway on his agenda , some Democrats said , the award could also come to be seen as the equivalent of the “ Mission Accomplished ” banner unfurled on an aircraft carrier for a speech by Bush shortly after the fall of Baghdad in 2003 .
Joe Trippi , a Democratic strategist , said that if the job market remained sour , he expected to see the Nobel medallion featured prominently in GOP attack ads with such lines as : “ He got a Nobel Prize .
What did you get ?
A pink slip . ”
“ Either the economy is going , and this wo n’t matter , or this will be another tool in the Republicans ’ arsenal to accuse the president of not doing enough , ” Trippi said .
“ Maybe if he won the Nobel Prize for economic recovery and created hundreds of thousands of new jobs , this would be a good thing for him politically , ” Trippi said .

In announcing the prize , the Nobel panel credited Obama with creating “ a new climate in international politics ” and said that , through his efforts , “ multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position ” in world affairs .
Since taking office , Obama has embarked on an ambitious diplomatic agenda .
While touching down in 16 countries , he has reached out to Muslims with a historic speech in Cairo ; pledged at the United Nations to pursue a world free of nuclear weapons ; and renewed the push for Middle East peace .
The Nobel committee cited those outreach efforts as among the reasons he deserved the peace prize .
But Republicans are citing those same initiatives as they build a dossier for the midterm elections next year that argues that Obama too often apologizes for U.S. power .
Two potential 2012 challengers -- Mitt Romney , a former Massachusetts governor , and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- have delivered multiple speeches in recent weeks focusing on Obama ’s foreign policy and criticizing him for what they view as a form of appeasement .
On Friday , Pawlenty nevertheless said of Obama ’s prize that “ under any circumstance , an appropriate response is to say , ‘ Congratulations . ’ ”

Last month , the White House scrapped a missile defense system that had been touted by Bush as key to protecting Europe from nuclear attack .
The move pleased Russia , which regarded the missiles as a threat .
But critics said it sacrificed security against the nuclear ambitions of Iran .
More significantly , Obama also opened dialogue with Tehran after decades of diplomatic stalemate , betting that talks rather than threats might persuade the regime to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
Iran appeared to make some concessions in preliminary talks in Geneva .
After being confronted by the U.S. with evidence that a hidden nuclear compound could be used for weapons production , Tehran pledged to allow inspections at the site and to export its enriched uranium .
Obama described the outcome as a “ constructive beginning . ”
But , as with most of the administration ’s foreign policy initiatives , the prospects for achieving lasting progress remain unclear .
Advertisement
In other areas , the administration has struggled to deliver on pledges that were central to the presidential campaign .
Just this week , Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. acknowledged that the administration was unlikely to meet its January deadline for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where detainees from the war on terrorism have been held for years .
More problematic at the moment is the confusion surrounding the administration ’s policy on Afghanistan , where security has deteriorated rapidly and the Taliban controls large swaths of territory .
After unveiling a “ comprehensive ” strategy for the region in March , Obama now seems to be second - guessing that decision -- caught between his handpicked general ’s request for more troops and growing opposition from Democrats to any plan that would expand the 8 - year - old war .
Advertisement
Later Friday , Obama again assembled the members of his war Cabinet to weigh Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal ’s call for 40,000 more troops .
Summing up the president ’s day , the libertarian Cato Institute issued a news release with a pointed title : “ For Obama , peace in the morning , war in the afternoon . ”

I.D. was the oldest product design ** magazine in the country , and
was the one - time employer of many noteworthy figures , including Bruce
Mau .
Its yearly design competition , the Annual Design Review , was the
oldest and biggest design competition in America , and had been
operating ever since I.D. ‘s inception .
The competition was also the magazine ’s cash cow ; F&W , I.D. ‘s publisher , plans on continuing the event and publishing the results online .
In the course of its
publication , the magazine won five National Magazine Awards : For General
Excellence in 1995 , 1997 , and 1999 ; for Special Interests in 2000 ; and
Design in 1997 .
That amounted to an astounding haul for a magazine with
only 30,000 readers per issue .
Nonetheless , according to F&W sales managers , I.D. had not turned a profit in seven years and was beset by competition from shelter magazines and mainstream glossies , which have been aggressively adding design coverage , owing to rising interest in design among mainstream audiences .
Meanwhile , I.D. ‘s sister magazine , Print–a storied design magazine in its own right –will stay open .
The news came one day after the company ’s employee appreciation day .
UPDATE : Here ’s the release from I.D. :
Statement for External Release December 15 , 2009
To Readers , Advertisers and Friends of I.D. Magazine :
Since 1954 , I.D. Magazine has served as one of America ’s leading critical magazines covering the art , business , and culture of design .
Today it is with regret that we announce its closure .
The January / February issue of I.D. will be its last ; subscribers to I.D. will receive Print magazine for the balance of their subscription .
Ceasing publication of an iconic brand like I.D. is never an easy decision , but there are several forces that have worked against its sustainability .
Certainly the downturn in print advertising has contributed to this decision , but other factors include the fragmentation and specialized information needs of I.D. ’s core readers ( product designers ) and the plethora of information resources available to them – some for free ( online and B2B ) and others that are highly specialized and targeted to specific industries served .
F+W Media will continue producing the I.D. Annual Design Review , its flagship international product design competition , in an expanded fashion online .
This new web initiative will feature not only 2010 ’s winners but will catalog thousands of notable entries from past competitions .
Going forward , in addition to the I.D. Annual Design Review , F+W Media ’s Design Group is comprised of the award - winning HOW and Print brands – magazines , books , events , and competitions serving the information needs of graphic designers in all media .
We thank the entire I.D. community , past and present – staffers , contributors , readers , and advertisers – for their support of the magazine throughout its 55 - year history .
Sincerely ,
Gary Lynch Publisher & Editorial Director F+W Media Design Community
* Full disclosure : I was until today a freelancer for I.D. ; I was also an editor there , from 2005 to 2007 .
** The article originally stated that I.D. was the oldest design magazine in the country–it ’s actually the oldest product design magazine in the country .
The oldest design magazine in the country would be Print , which has been in publication continuously since 1940 .
There 's a lot of confusion going on around the Internet about the Motorola Droid 's service plans .
Here 's the real story , straight from Verizon .
Okay .
There 's a lot of confusion going on around the Internet about the Motorola Droid 's service plans .
Some people are saying that if you want to connect to a Microsoft Exchange account , data will cost $ 45 a month instead of $ 30 .
This is wrong .
I checked with Verizon Wireless HQ and got the official response from spokeswoman Brenda Raney .
First of all , the Droid uses the exact same data plans as every Windows Mobile phone on Verizon .
There is no special Droid data plan .
Second , whether you pay $ 30 or $ 45 does n't depend on what you 're doing with the phone .
You can hit Exchange email on the $ 30 plan just fine .
It depends on what kind of Verizon Wireless account you have .
If you have a personal account or family plan , your data will cost $ 30 / month .
It does n't matter if you 're using Microsoft Exchange , Facebook , Gmail , or whatever - it 's $ 30 .
This is the same for all Verizon Windows Mobile and Android phones .
Data on business accounts - " corporate liable , " multiple lines , purchased through business sales , usually mediated by an IT department - costs $ 45 / month .
Once again , this is the same for every Windows Mobile and Android phone .
The same goes for AT&T's iPhones , by the way .
Thousands if not millions of people access Microsoft Exchange email on personal , $ 30 / month iPhone data plans , blissfully unaware that if they were a corporate - liable business account their data plan would cost $ 45 .
Once again , it 's not down to the kind of e-mail you 're accessing , it 's down to whether you are classed as an " individual " or a " business " in the carrier 's system .
So where 's the confusion been coming from ?
Carrier definitions of " business " and normal human definitions of " business " are different .
For carriers , it does n't matter if you 're doing business .
They only care if you are a business .
Are you a rogue operator , a lone wolf , using a personal credit card to activate your single line of service ?
Then plow right ahead with your Exchange email on the $ 30 plan - with your Droid or your iPhone .

If this proposal gets voted on , Democrats , who will likely once again vote it down , stand to reap the full fury of over 300 million Americans , who will realize that the Democratic party now holds banker remuneration and bonus concerns closer to its heart than those of small and medium - sized businesses ( let along Joe Sixpack ) .
And in that case , watch out come mid-term election time .

I like the Hilbert curve .
I like sorting algorithm visualisations .
I occasionally procrastinate when I should be doing more important things .
When all these factors converge , the result is a post like this .
In a previous post , I drew a picture of a Hilbert curve by projecting a Hilbert curve traversal of the RGB colour cube onto a Hilbert curve traversal of the plane ( yes , it 's a mouthful , but it 's a mouthful of awesome ) .
Since then , I 've been pondering the general utility of Hilbert curve traversals of the colour cube .
In large - scale visualisation , we often want to choose an ordered sequence of colours that have the property that colours close to each other on the sequence are also close to each other visually .
The easy way to do this is to restrict yourself to a specific hue , and to vary the intensity .
I used this idea in grayscale to generate some previous sorting algorithm visualisations :
Insertion sort
The problem with this approach is that it hugely restricts the number of distinct colours we can use .
There are only so many distinct shades of gray the human eye can perceive - I 'm already pushing it with 20 distinct colours in the image above .
We can do much , much better using the Hilbert curve .
Lets assume that human perception of RGB colours is uniform and consistent - that is , that any change along the RGB axes will result in uniformly proportional difference in perceived colour .
This assumption is incorrect , but it 's good enough as a first approximation .
By traversing the RGB colour cube in Hilbert order , we can get a set of colours that are maximally distinct from each other , with near - optimal colour locality preservation ( keeping in mind that perfect locality preservation is impossible ) .
In other words , an equidistant sequence of colours that are simultaneously as different from each other as possible , and where colours ' close ' to each other on the sequence are as similar as possible .
The result is a colour sequence that looks like this :
512 - colour Hilbert - order swatch
We do , of course , pay a price for this mathematical marvel : we can't visually compare colours and see their order in the spectrum .
When we really want a large ordered sequence of colours , this can be an acceptable tradeoff .
Below is a re-imagining of my previous sorting algorithm visualisations , at a much larger scale than I could achieve using shades of gray .
Each image shows a random list of 512 elements being sorted .
The images are at a 1 - pixel per element resolution , and each element has a distinct colour along the Hilbert RGB cube traversal .
The aspect ratios differ , because the width of the images are equal to the number of element swaps that occur during the sorting process .
I 've left out a number of algorithms that end up being too " wide " to be enjoyable - shellsort and bubblesort , I 'm looking at you .
Oh , and I make absolutely no claims that these particular visualisations are useful or informative .
I made them for the same reason Mallory climbed Everest and the chicken crossed the road : because it 's there , and to see what 's on the other side .
Come to think of it , the Mallory - Chicken Impetus explains rather a lot of what I do .

The code
As usual , I 've published the code used to draw the images in this post .
I extended scurve , where I 'm collecting algorithms and visualisation techniques related to space - filling curves , to draw colour swatches .
Then I added added a " fruitsalad " visualisation technique to sortvis , which houses my sorting algorithm visualisation code .
It has been two years , twenty - six days , six hours , twenty - four minutes and thirty seconds since my eyes caught the first glimpse of my mistress , functional reactive programming .
Her simplicity , beauty , and power has captivated me since , but she has teased me — all of us lonely fools , really — by slipping through my fingers every time , just as I thought I was getting to know her .
A year ago I swore off the cold bitch .
She was transforming my life into a single , unhealthy obsession .
I needed time to think .
Time — there she is again .
Maybe by giving myself space , I thought , I could stumble upon a packet of wisdom and finally capture her heart , without really looking for it .
But that sort of distance is a lie , my life continues to be about her .
Distance only makes the heart grow fonder .
Last week I bumped into her at work .
I am not proud of what I did .
Forgive me for I am only human , ultimately incapable of suppressing the basal instinct that has ruled my kind for millions of years .
That ’s right , I implemented her , in the back seat of my Scala convertible .
It would seem but a few hour fling on a whiteboard and an editor for the unprivy , but O how it intoxicated me !
And it has not , as yet , ended in the heartbreak I have felt over and over again — she is quietly sitting in the back of my codebase , hardly a hundred lines , even doing some good if you can believe it .
Maybe I am just fooling myself and this time will be no different .
But , at the very least , I feel like I may have learned something .

Perhaps FRP is not the sparkling Holy Grail of interactive functional programming that we have made it out to be .
Maybe we cannot find an efficient , general implementation because there is none .
Perhaps what we currently know about FRP is what there is to know — a book of heuristics , a collection of experiences and wisdom that tells us which of its features will and will not work together .
FRP is not a single feature , you know , it really is a rather large design space , and quite a lot can be done with only pieces of it .
What I did at work was remarkably effective : I sketched how our server would read in FRP language on a whiteboard , and then I implemented a framework which supported exactly the operations I needed and no more .
It took hardly two hours , and there is no spacetime leak , no GC nondeterminism .
The situation in FRP seems to be something like that of modern theoretical physics : we have a few different theories that all work remarkably well for different kinds of problems , and if only they would work with each other , we would have a unified theory .
But mysteriously , they just do n’t seem to get along .
A unified theory is more than just something to please the eyes of pure functionalists — it is important to us because it would mean the fall of the IO monad regime .
The book of heuristics I claim is FRP still needs a sin bin from which to retrieve the superglue that holds together the pieces of a complete application .
So the school of semanticists cannot give a meaning to a complete program , only pieces of it .
This makes us unable to prove things about a program , and unsure how to meaningfully compose multiple programs ( eg. what kinds of things should and should not be allowed ) .
There are the quantum field theorists , attempting to bring gravity in to the regime of quantum mechanics ; there are the string theorists , attempting to bring the rest of reality into the regime of general relativity .
But I , as a physics layman , naively believe that neither of these approaches will end up being the workhorse of the eventual unified theory .
I believe that said theory will come with a new way of looking at the world , rather than patching up the old ways .
Maybe the expert in me can learn from the layman in me and try to solve the problem instead of clinging to the solution I think I desire .
What is the meaning of an interactive program ?
Ministers from the 27 European nations ordered a coordination unit to be set up protection and surveillance operations in order to combat the attacks which has caused mayhem to maritime traffic .
In a statement ministers " deplored the upsurge in acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coasts of Somalia " and had given the green light to " a possible EU military naval operation " .
The year is 50BC and Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans .
Well , not entirely .
One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders .
The year is 2009 AD France has been entirely conquered by baseball hats , Big Macs and Hollywood movies .
Well , not entirely .
One indomitable enclave of French culture still holds out , and even thrives .
The Asterix series of cartoon books , France 's most lucrative literary export by far , will celebrate its 50th anniversary from next week with a series of exhibitions and special events and a new album of stories .
Asterix spins the unlikely adventures of a village of ancient Gauls who refuse to bow to the power of Rome .
The hero is a short , cocky , clever , hyper - energetic leader , who claims to have a magic potion to defend the Gaulish way of life from external threat .
Any accidental parallel with contemporary French politics ends there .
Asterix the Gaul has no tall , glamorous wife of Roman origin ; he has no wife at all .
Instead , he has a wholly platonic friendship with a man-mountain called Obelix and a dog called Idéfix ( or in the English language version , Dogmatix ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Their comic adventures have been translated into 107 languages and have sold 325 million copies worldwide .
The three , non-cartoon Asterix movies made in the past 10 years , with a heavily padded Gérard Depardieu playing Obelix , have become the most successful series of French films in history .
In a reversal of the plot since 50 BC , the world therefore has been entirely conquered by the Gauls .
Well , not entirely .
Some indomitable enclaves continue to hold out .
Despite excellent English translations , Asterix has never really caught on in the United States and is only a limited success in Britain .
( In Italy , on the other hand , although the series presents the Romans as a bunch of arrogant , cowardly , quarrelsome nincompoops , it has been surprisingly popular . )
Asterix is , above all , a story of two beautiful friendships , first between Asterix and Obelix and second between their creators , Albert Uderzo , who drew the cartoons , and René Goscinny , who wrote the original stories .
Although the saga is a wry tribute to Gallic pride and cussedness , neither man was of French origin .
Uderzo's parents were Italian .
Goscinny , who died in 1977 , came from a Polish - Jewish family .
In the past two years , the good natured façade of the Asterix saga has been shattered by a blistering public row between Albert Uderzo , 82 , who is still drawing and writing , and his only daughter , Sylvie .
In 2007 , Mr Uderzo fired Sylvie from her job with his publishing company .
In 2008 , he sold the company and the Asterix rights to France 's biggest publisher , Hachette .
He also agreed – reversing a previous commitment – that other writers and artists could extend the Asterix series after his death .
Sylvie accused her father , in an open letter to Le Monde , of " betraying " the spirit of Asterix by selling off a " symbol of France 's cultural heritage " to a company " driven mostly by profit " .
Mr Uderzo responded that he had fired his daughter , and her husband , because of their " filial ingratitude and obsession with money " .
The whole episode , only partially settled by a court judgment in Sylvie 's favour this year , is reminiscent of the 15th Asterix album , Asterix et la Zizanie ( literally , Asterix and the huge bust - up ) .
This book ( called Asterix and the Roman Agent , in English ) tells of a poisonous Roman , Tullius Detritus , who can divide the best of friends and families with a couple of ill - chosen words .
Like many other Asterix characters and sayings , Tullius has become part of the French language .
The French Prime Minister , François Fillon , is a great Asterix fan and a sworn enemy of the Minister of Labour , Xavier Bertrand , whom he accuses of bearing malicious tales to President Nicolas Sarkozy .
The satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchainé reported recently that that Mr Fillon always refers to Mr Bertrand in private as " Tullius Detritus " .
Much of the fun of the Asterix books comes from the punning names of the Gaulish or Roman characters , usually ending in " ix " or " us " or " a " .
Replacing the jokes in the French names has been a test of the ingenuity of translators world - wide .
Speak it not in Gaul , but the English language versions are sometimes cleverer , and funnier , than the originals .
The chief Druid , who mixes the magic potion , is " Panoramix " in French , which is rather dull .
In Britain , he is " Getafix " , which is more appropriate .
In America , he is " Readymix " or " Magicmix " .
The village chief is " Abraracoucix " in the original .
In English , he becomes , " Vitalstastix " ( UK ) and " Macroeconomix " ( US ) .
His wife is " Bonemine " in French , " Impedimenta " in Britain and " Belladonna " in the US .
The tuneless village bard , who is never allowed to sing and looks rather like the former French Prime Minister , Dominique de Villepin , is " Assurancetourix " in French .
In Britain , he is " Cacofonix " and in the US " Malacoustix " .
The fishmonger 's wife is " Ielosubmarine " ( Yellow Submarine ) in French and " Bacteria " in English ( all versions ) .
Asterix appeared for the first time in a cartoon magazine called Pilote on 29 October 1959 .
Goscinny and Uderzo thought up most of the main characters in a 30 - minute brain - storming session in a council flat in Paris .
Goscinny , also the joint parent of " Petit Nicolas " and other successful cartoon characters , set out originally to mock , rather than to glorify , French insularity .
Charles de Gaulle had just become president of the Republic .
France versus the Rest of the World rapidly became one of the themes of the 1960s .
Asterix took off .
To commemorate the half - centenary , Mr Uderzo – who now writes the stories and still does the preliminary pencil drawings – will publish next week an album of " short stories " , Asterix et Le Livre d'Or ( Asterix and the Golden Book ) , in which many of the characters of the past 50 years reappear .
There will be a series of celebratory events in Paris , including a musical show at the Théàtre des Champs - Elyseés next Thursday and an exhibition at the Musée de Cluny of Uderzo 's original drawings and Goscinny 's type - written texts .
On 29 October , there will be a series of street events with actors dressed as Asterix characters to " invade Lutece " ( the Roman name for Paris ) .
In interviews to mark the half - centenary , Mr Uderzo has again defended his decision to allow new Asterix albums to be written and drawn after his death .
He said he had decided to abandon the example set by Hergé , the creator of Tintin , who banned posthumous sequels .
" When no more adventures are added to a series , little by little it dies , " he said .
" We know that because each time we publish a new book it boosts the sales of all the others . "
How The Independent ' found ' Asterix
On April Fool 's Day 1993 , The Independent claimed a world scoop .
French and British archaeologists had unearthed the remains of Asterix's " indomitable " village on a headland near Lannion in northern Brittany .
The excavations at Le Yaudet had uncovered coins marked with images of wild boar , the favourite snack of Asterix 's outsize chum , Obelix , The Independent reported .
It was an April Fool 's spoof but was so successful that , six years later , the Collège de France – the country 's most prestigious academic institution – asked a French archaeologist to give a talk on the dig .
" It was a very convincing joke , " said Patrick Galliou , a French archaeologist mentioned in the spoof article .
" It interwove myth and reality so cleverly that I even got a call in 1999 from the Collège de France asking if I would come and give a lecture on the findings . "

The Hubris of Cultural Planning
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States on Friday denied President Hugo Chavez ’s assertion a U.S. military plane twice violated Venezuelan airspace earlier in the day .
“ We can confirm no U.S. military aircraft entered Venezuelan airspace today .
As a matter of policy we do not fly over a nation ’s airspace without prior consent or coordination , ” a spokesman for the Pentagon said in an e-mail .
Asked about Chavez ’s statement he ordered two F - 16 jets to intercept the U.S. military plane , the Pentagon spokesman said , “ I can only speak for our actions , which confirms no U.S. military aircraft entered Venezuelan airspace . ”

It has been shown that the so - called " public option " for low - premium health insurance is sure to significantly crowd out , and perhaps even eliminate , the private provision of health insurance .
Thanks to Senator Joseph Lieberman 's courageous stand , it appears that the public option will not be a part of any bill that passes the Senate .
Unfortunately , HR 3962 includes regulations that will destroy the ability of private firms to provide marketable insurance , with or without a public option .
To understand the devastation that will be wrought by this bill , one must understand how health insurance functions on a free market to transfer individuals ' financial risk to large " risk pools " with less variation across time .
Consumers who are risk averse pay " premiums " to insurers each month for the removal of that risk , and in turn insurers assign their clients to different pools according to their risk of large claims .
An Already - Regulated Industry
Insurance companies have already been strictly limited in their ability to assign individuals to different risk pools and charge them varying premiums .
By forcing high - risk and low - risk groups into the same pool , existing regulations increase premiums for low - risk consumers and decrease premiums for high - risk consumers .
This is nothing more than a coerced subsidy to the less healthy , and it drives low - risk consumers away from purchasing health insurance .
This is why the majority of the uninsured are not poor and dying , but in fact healthy young people who are at almost no risk of unanticipated healthcare costs .
To cope with their inability to partition along risk levels , profit - seeking insurance companies must cut costs by excluding the highest - risk patients from insurance .
In a free market , these individuals would be offered insurance at a higher premium aligned with their high risk of major claims .
In human terms , this leads to the exclusion of people with preexisting conditions and those with significant claims on past insurance plans .
Once again , we see how leftist economic policy harms the very class of society that its supporters desire to help .
Obamacare is a Welfare Program
Not oblivious to the exclusion of these unfortunate citizens , on page 95 of the bill , House Democrats have proposed to completely outlaw the exclusion of any customer on any of the following grounds :
health status , medical condition , claims experience , receipt of health care , medical history , genetic information , evidence of insurability , disability , or source of injury ( including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence ) or any similar factors .
Thus , it will become illegal to refuse to insure any consumer on any grounds , including evidence of insurability .
In addition to being unable to exclude future enrollees , insurers will be prevented by page 29 from legally dropping any consumers from their plans on any grounds other than " clear and convincing evidence of fraud . "
The effect on the structure of insurance is obvious ; this new law will turn health insurance into a legally - enforced entitlement program , and the new entitlement will be used by those who are too costly to be insured under the current restrictions on risk - pool partitioning .
Again , it is important to remember that these patients would have the option to buy insurance on a free market , but that their plans would carry premiums that actually reflect their personal health risk .
While risk - pool separation is considerably limited by national and state regulations , the little separation that is allowed would still be able to mitigate the heavy costs of forcing insurers to cover literally every customer who wishes to buy insurance .
While the high - risk individuals would not pay as much in premiums as they would on a free market , insurance companies would still be able to use slightly lower premiums to attract low - risk customers .
However , this inequality in premiums is offensive to politicians hell - bent on equality .
Therefore , in the very next page of the bill , House Democrats propose to outlaw all variations in premiums except according to geographical area , age group , and whether the plan in question covers an individual or a family .
" The majority of the uninsured are not poor and dying , but in fact healthy young people who are at almost no risk of unanticipated healthcare costs . "
These provisions will be catastrophic to the insurance market .
The bill only allows for premium variation across age by a ratio of two to one between the highest and lowest premiums .
In real terms , elderly patients who cost several times as much to insure can only be charged twice as much as 20 - somethings who often go entire years without claims .
That this is a subsidy for the elderly hardly needs to be explicitly stated .
The bill leaves the determination of the maximum difference between individual and family plans at the discretion of the " health choices " commissioner , who is likely to find himself bombarded with visits and letters from family - centered lobbying organizations seeking subsidized health insurance paid for by singles and nonparents .
This rent seeking will inevitably end up in subsidies handed out according to political objectives , whether the goal is to attract more young , single voters or more parents of children .
Turning any transaction into a subsidy both induces the subsidized class to enter the transaction and induces the subsidizing class to attempt to avoid it .
In this case , it means that an even greater number of young and healthy individuals ( and , most likely , nonparents ) will drop their increasingly expensive insurance plans and attempt to prepare for healthcare risks on their own .
This terrible result of coercive price - fixing decreases the benefit of the subsidy to high - risk consumers and decreases the ability of the insurance companies to control and reduce average payouts .
Democrats are aware of this effect of their policy , and have legislated accordingly .
Pages 296–300 amend federal tax law to create a new tax on all citizens who fail to purchase health insurance .
Depriving these individuals of the ability to opt out of the new , undifferentiated insurance pool is an atrocious affront to individual choice , and requires the threat of imprisonment .
This new tax will help achieve the statistical goal of universal coverage , but it will do so at an incredible cost to the income and liberty of the relatively young and healthy , most of whom , ironically , voted for Obama and Democratic congressional candidates .
Soaring Costs
Not only will high - risk individuals who are now forced out of the market by regulation be legally entitled to purchase the bill 's minimum standard of coverage , but both these excluded consumers and those who are now in high - risk pools will have financial incentives to buy higher levels of insurance .
Facing new , subsidized prices , high - risk individuals will purchase plans with lower deductibles .
Paying for a higher percentage of the price of more claims will massively increase the cost of insuring the new general pool of clients .
One of the only remaining ways for insurers to cut their costs , then , is to limit the amount that individuals are able to receive in claims .
Indeed , insurance companies already use lifetime claims limits to cope with risk - partition laws and deliver lower - price packages to low - risk consumers .
Predictably , page 50 of the House bill prohibits insurance companies from imposing any such limits on lifetime benefits .
Outlawing lifetime limits guarantees that all consumers will have the incentive to undergo drastically more treatments in their lifetimes , because the bill ensures that they will not be moved into a higher premium group until they enter a different age group or move to a different area .
For the already - subsidized elderly , this creates incentives to undergo many more life - extending treatments in the final year of their lives .
Such treatments are several times more expensive than general care for other elderly patients .
Astute readers will correctly object that while the Democrats ' healthcare proposal will drastically increase the costs facing every insurance provider , the bill also requires all individuals to buy the minimum package of insurance , or to enroll in the public option .
Especially because in the current discussion we are ignoring the effects of the public option , it is possible to argue that if there were no public option this bill would actually be a boon to private insurers , who are virtually guaranteed that every American will buy their plans .
To survive this bill , then , insurance companies will simply increase the premiums of the packages that are forced onto every citizen .
This would indeed be true , were it not for further regulations effectively barring premium increases .
Page 31 of the bill would require insurance companies to " submit a justification " for any projected future increase in premiums for any group to the secretary of Health and Human Services as well as state - level authorities .
The secretary of HHS and the state " health czars " would then annually review and approve or deny any increase in premiums .
In various sections of the bill , the health choices commissioner is given power to determine the cost - accounting and other ratings methods that will determine whether a price increase is " justified " in the eyes of the DHHS Secretary .
Public officials operating under a Congressional mandate to achieve universal coverage are hardly likely to approve price increases , even though that means slowly bankrupting private insurers .
Even if they are not made to " compete with " and be strangled by a public option that consumers have already funded with their tax dollars , private insurers will be absolutely ruined by restrictions on their ability to control and separate costs and to increase prices to account for their ever - rising costs .
Conclusion
While a public option would certainly hasten the death of the private - insurance market in America , it is not a necessary means to that end .
By destroying the economic structure of insurance , House Resolution 3962 would convert an already - overregulated industry into a pseudo - private welfare program .
Even without a public option , insurance companies would be kept from controlling costs or adjusting their prices .
The inevitable result will be the complete dissolution of the private health - insurance market .
How Phusion Built A More Efficient Ruby 1.8 Interpreter
By Peter Cooper
Phusion Passenger and Ruby Enterprise Edition developers Ninh " Hernandez " Bui and Hongli Lai travelled to San Francisco last week and gave a 35 minute Google Tech Talk called Building A More Efficient Ruby Interpreter .
The talk focused on how the guys ( with some help from other sources , including Joe Damato and Aman Gupta ) have dug into MRI Ruby 1.8's internals to get some significant memory usage and thread performance improvements for their Ruby Enterprise Edition branch ( they 're not calling it a fork ) of Ruby 1.8 .
The video is presented in HD so the slides are easy to see and the audio is solid .
If taking a small trip through Ruby 's garbage collection , memory allocation , and threading system sounds good to you ( or you just want to know what Ruby Enterprise Edition is all about ) , it 's a must watch .
If you want some practical Ruby stuff and do n't care about what the interpreter 's doing , give it a miss .

Metallic ions in basalt and certain other rocks lock CO2 into stable mineral forms .
( Image credit : Peter McGrail , Pacific Northwest National Laboratory )
( PhysOrg.com ) --
While politicians debate the best ways to cut global carbon dioxide emissions , researchers at Idaho National Laboratory 's Center for Advanced Energy Studies are charging ahead on a strategy to defuse the CO2 the world already produces .
They want to inject the greenhouse gas deep underground , where it would react with rocks and remain , entombed , for thousands of years .
CAES scientists have been studying this novel approach — called mineral sequestration — for years .
They have characterized promising injection sites and run many computer simulations to understand how the process works .
But they will soon ramp up their efforts dramatically , thanks to collaborations with international research groups , newly installed lab equipment and a recently awarded $ 750,000 grant .
The CAES team will play a key role in determining if mineral sequestration is a viable strategy for mitigating the impact of climate change — or just a pipe dream .
" The next year ought to be pretty exciting for us , " says geochemist Travis McLing , INL 's technical lead for carbon capture and sequestration .
" The rubber should really hit the road . "
What to do with all that CO2 ?
Over the past 150 years , atmospheric levels of heat - trapping CO2 have increased by 35 percent , chiefly as a result of intense fossil - fuel use .
During this same period , average global temperatures have risen by 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius .
Many climate scientists have long argued that the world risks a climate catastrophe if it continues to pump out so much CO2 , and politicians have begun to agree that something needs to be done .
The ultimate goal is to switch the global energy economy over to cleaner , greener sources .
But this fix is years down the road and fraught with economic and technological hurdles .
In the short term , burning fossil fuels is far cheaper than developing renewable energy resources ( such as solar and wind ) or building more nuclear power plants .
Petroleum , coal and natural gas still generate 84 percent of the energy consumed in the United States , according to the Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration .
And the EIA estimates that global CO2 emissions will grow by 1.4 percent every year through 2030 .
But not all CO2 we produce has to end up in the atmosphere .
Carbon dioxide generated by " point sources " such as power plants — as opposed to more dispersed emitters like cars and planes — can be captured before it leaves the smokestack .
This CO2 can then be injected hundreds or thousands of meters underground , sealed safely away for many years .
Some scientists believe this strategy , termed carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) , could help the world buy some time while it figures out a long - term energy solution .
And CCS has moved beyond the realm of the purely theoretical .
StatoilHydro , a Norway - based energy company , has been injecting 1 million tons of CO2 underground annually since 1996 .
A more permanent solution
StatoilHydro injects CO2 into porous sandstone 800 meters ( about 2,600 feet ) beneath the North Sea floor .
The overlying rock is gas - tight , the company says .
But some researchers , such as McLing and fellow INL scientist Rob Podgorney , would prefer to remove any possibility that CO2 could escape back into the atmosphere .
That 's why they 're working on the mineral sequestration side of CCS .
Their goals are both fundamental and ambitious .
" We want to know what exactly is going on underground when you inject CO2 , " Podgorney says .
The basic theory is well understood .
Certain types of rock , such as basalt , are rich in metallic ions like calcium , magnesium and iron .
When CO2 is injected deep into basalt formations , it dissolves in water and reacts with these ions to produce carbonate minerals ( such as calcium carbonate ) .
CO2 is thus locked into solid , stable rock .
The potential of this process is huge — basalt makes up about 65 percent of the Earth 's crust .
According to a recent paper in the journal Energy Procedia , the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate off the United States ' northwest coast could suck up 700 billion tons of CO2 by itself — far more than the 33 billion tons produced by humans every year .
McLing , Podgorney and their colleagues — researchers at the University of Idaho and Idaho State University , all working together under the CAES umbrella — are among a few groups in the world investigating mineral sequestration in depth .
The CAES scientists have drawn up models predicting how the approach would work , filling in key details by studying the basalt fields underlying Idaho 's Snake River Plain .
Their simulations are encouraging , Podgorney says : large volumes of deeply injected CO2 should mineralize within a decade or two , long before the gas has a chance to seep out into the atmosphere or into overlying freshwater aquifers .
And the team is now set to take the crucial next step : testing its models with data from experiments around the world .
In September , McLing and Podgorney gave invited talks at a CCS conference in Iceland .
In addition to munching hors d'oeuvres at the home of Iceland 's president , they shared ideas with key members of the CarbFix project .
CarbFix — a collaborative effort led by the University of Iceland , Columbia University , Reykjavik Energy and France 's National Center for Scientific Research — will be the world 's first large - scale test study of mineral sequestration in basalt .
CarbFix will dissolve a load of CO2 in water — speeding things up , since it can take a long time for this to happen underground — then inject the seltzer solution about 600 meters ( 2,000 feet ) deep in Icelandic basalt .
CarbFix plans to sequester 2,000 tons of carbon dioxide in this manner every year to study mineralization rates and the extent of CO2 leakage .
And all of this should start happening within a month or two .
While INL 's logo does not yet appear on CarbFix brochures , that may change .
" We 'll probably formalize a collaborative relationship soon , " McLing says .
In any event , the CAES researchers will soon have access to CarbFix data and water samples , which they can use to firm up their models .
The models predict how injected CO2 would migrate through a basalt formation .
Validating the models
" It 's your classic murder mystery , " McLing says of water sample analysis .
" You find the body and try to figure out what happened . "
McLing cracks cases by determining what elements and minerals are dissolved in his samples .
Water picks up different chemical signatures as it moves from one type of rock to another .
Fleshing out these signatures can reveal where the water 's been and how quickly certain chemical reactions — such as the ones that turn CO2 into stone — have taken place .
McLing and Podgorney hope to analyze enough samples to figure out definitively how CO2 - saturated water moves through basalt .
This in turn will help them determine if their carbon mineralization models need tweaking .
By early 2010 , they should have samples from the CarbFix project in hand — bubbly seltzer from injection areas as well as normal water from control sites , giving the scientists both experimental and baseline data .
By the summer of 2010 , the team will also start collecting water samples right from INL 's backyard .
In September , a major multinational corporation granted McLing and his colleagues $ 750,000 to conduct a three - year sequestration study at Soda Springs , a small town 60 miles southeast of Idaho Falls .
At Soda Springs , naturally carbonated water flows over , under and through basalt very similar to the rock formations found at Carb Fix 's Iceland site .
" Soda Springs is a natural analogue , " McLing says .
" We 'll collect water from every window we can sample there . "
And McLing and Podgorney hope to supplement these samples with water from another site in eastern Washington , where Pacific Northwest National Laboratory plans to lead an injection study similar to CarbFix in the near future .
The CAES scientists are analyzing mineral sequestration from another angle as well .
Any day now , a set of 8 - vessel pressure systems that the team ordered months ago will be delivered to their lab .
This new equipment will allow them to recreate the temperatures and pressures found at potential sequestration depths in basalt .
So McLing and Podgorney will have another way to gather data , another tool to test their models and improve their understanding of how mineral sequestration works — and whether it could work on a large scale .
" The point is to get our arms around all of these things , to close the circle , " Podgorney says .
Not a silver bullet
Though mineral sequestration shows a great deal of promise , research into the approach is still in its early stages , and many complicating factors remain .
Chief among these is cost , a problem for all forms of CCS technology .
Scrubbing CO2 from smokestacks , processing it and transporting it to injection sites would chew up about 25 percent of a typical coal - fired plant 's energy output , McLing estimates .
So for every three new plants built with carbon capture capabilities , a fourth would be needed just to power the CCS process .
This energy cost translates to a high economic cost as well .
McLing says it is likely that no form of CCS is practical in the U.S. without a government - imposed price on CO2 , likely somewhere between $ 50 and $ 100 per ton .
StatoilHydro , for example , only began its CCS operations after Norway implemented a CO2 tax of $ 55 per ton .
The company 's CO2 injections now save it $ 55 million every year .
Also , CCS would only work at point sources such as power plants , which are responsible for about half of the world 's human - caused CO2 emissions .
Carbon dioxide from cars , trucks , boats and planes would still waft into the atmosphere in huge volumes .
For these reasons , the U.S. Geological Survey stresses that CCS is a " necessary but insufficient " measure to control atmospheric CO2 .
Alternative energy development and conservation , among other strategies , will also be required to get the climate - change problem under control .
McLing and Podgorney , however , are focusing on the positive : that capture and sequestration can be a big part of the solution .
And they 're excited about the future of mineral sequestration .
" There 's an awful lot of energy in the field right now , " McLing says .
" The doors are really beginning to open . "

Try to imagine this :
An American president visits Israel and in a speech given close to the vast " separation wall " Israel continues to build in part through Palestinian territory , says : " Mr. Netanyahu , if you seek peace , if you seek prosperity for Israel and the region , if you seek liberalization : Come here to this gate !
Mr. Netanyahu , open this gate !
Mr. Netanyahu , tear down this wall ! "
I ’m sure you recognize that set of famous lines .
With the name " Gorbachev " in place of " Netanyahu , " President Ronald Reagan intoned them on June 12 , 1987 , in front of the Berlin Wall .
Less than two - and - a - half years later , of course , that stain on Europe , that prison wall of Soviet power which , in all the years of the Cold War , was seldom long out of the U.S. news , was gone – and 20 years later we ’re still celebrating .
The Israeli wall , endlessly under construction , is far longer , approximately twice as high , no less militarized , and no less a dystopian wonder of prison architecture .
It is also a thief .
As it meanders , it steals land .
It is , as the Berlin Wall once was , a stain on the human landscape .
But no American president , including Barack Obama , is likely to make a Reaganesque journey to the Middle East , denounce the wall , and call for its dismantlement .
It plays little part in the news in this country when the Israeli - Palestinian situation is raised .
It ’s hard to imagine us celebrating its fall .
In the meantime , while that grotesque wall grows , while the talk is of shuttling diplomats and diplomatic cul - de- sacs , of paths to nowhere and missing Plan Bs for the Obama administration , as well as potential Israeli strikes against Iran , those in the shadow of the wall suffer .
Ellen Cantarow , who covered the Israeli - Palestinian conflict for the Village Voice back in the 1980s , recently spent time on Palestinian farmland in the shadow of the Great Wall of Israel and offers a portrait , from under the olive branches , not from the heights of diplomatic exchanges , on what it ’s like , and what it takes , to live near today ’s version of a mega - Berlin Wall .

Living by the Gate From Hell
A portrait of nonviolent resistance in one Palestinian village
by Ellen Cantarow
Much is heard of violence in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , but the story of the determined , long - term nonviolent resistance of many Palestinian villagers to the loss of their lands , striking as it may be , is seldom told .
Here ’s my report from just one village on the West Bank .
At no time since its 1967 West Bank occupation have Israel ’s seizures of Palestinian land and water resources seemed as shocking as the ones attending its construction of " the wall , " begun in 2002 .
Vast , complex , and shifting in form , the wall appears most dramatically as 25 - foot - high concrete slabs punctuated by militarized watch towers , supplemented by electronically monitored electrified fences stretching over vast distances .
In 2004 , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) declared the wall illegal , but Israel ignored the ruling .
Now , it undulates through the West Bank for over 170 miles , clasping Israel ’s major colonies and some minor ones in its embrace .
The completed wall will incorporate more than 85 percent of the West Bank ’s settler population , a de facto annexation by Israel of significant chunks of the territory it first occupied in 1967 .
This is the dream of Greater Israel rapidly turned into architecture .
For the Palestinians , however , the wall means theft , separating many Palestinian cities and villages from their land and water .
Jayyous , with a population of 3,500 , is one of those villages .
It lies nestled in a mountainous northern West Bank landscape with the Palestinian city of Qalqilya just to its west .
The scenery here remains one of the Mediterranean ’s loveliest , a cross , let ’s say , between Tuscany and parts of Yugoslavia .
Greek and Roman ruins mark the village ’s great age .
This was one of the West Bank ’s most fertile areas .
Farming involving a lively variety of nut , citrus , and olive trees , as well as vegetables , flourished around Jayyous , drawing life from abundant underground wells .
The aquifers beneath Jayyous and Qalqilya , in fact , constitute a West Bank treasure .
Lands belonging to both the city and the village abut Israel ’s pre-1967 border – the " Green Line . "
Before the wall ’s advent , Qalqilya ’s merchants and Israelis did regular business on either side of the border , while Jayyous ’ farmers worked their land all the way up to the Green Line .
Now , the monstrous , concrete version of the wall surrounds Qalqilya entirely , bringing to mind high - security prisons or ghettoes from other eras .
Jayyous is segregated from most of its former land by the wall in what one could call its " barrier " form – a system of steel fences , razor wire , and patrol roads manned by Israeli soldiers .
Four thousand of the village ’s olive and citrus trees were uprooted to make way for the wall .
All the village ’s wells and over 75 percent of the land are now sequestered behind the wall , isolated on its west – that is , " Israeli " – side .
A small Israeli settler colony called Zufim sits amid Jayyous ’ former wealth .
Israeli plans are on the books to build up to 1,500 new housing units on the bounty confiscated from the village .
The new units will destroy the only road over which Jayyous ’ farmers can now travel to and from their land : there used to be six of these roads .
Israel has already blocked five of them .
Sixty - five - year - old Sharif Omar Khalid , known more familiarly as Abu Azzam , has spent half his life struggling to preserve Jayyous ’ land .
In 1980 , with other farmers representing villages throughout the West Bank , he founded the Land Defense Committee , one of 18 organizations that now make up the Stop the Wall campaign .
Gifted with stubborn optimism , he counts as victory an Israeli Supreme Court decision in April 2006 , which pushed the path of the wall back from the south side of the village .
The decision returned 11 percent of Jayyous ’ former land – 750 dunams of the 8,600 blocked by the barrier .
( A dunam is a little over a quarter of an acre . )
The wall remains , as does one of its most essential parts : the " agricultural gate . "
There are two of these on Jayyous ’ land – one to the north ; another to the south .
Almost all of the village ’s farmers are forced to use the north gate .
Opened by Israeli soldiers for two 45 - minute intervals at dawn and dusk , the gate blocks a patrol road manned by the Israelis .
But to get beyond the gate , across the patrol road , and from there to their farmland , Jayyous ’ farmers need " visitors ’ permits . "
Since 2003 , Israel has decreed that the villagers are only " visitors " on land they have worked for generations .
Obtaining the permits is an excruciating obstacle course that only begins with proof of land ownership .
Abu Azzam is one of the village ’s major landowners ; his title goes back several generations to the time when Jordan occupied the West Bank .
Being a known activist , he was periodically denied his permit until the Israeli Supreme Court finally granted him a permanent permit noting that its bearer is a " security problem . "
This produces extra problems for him in his daily odyssey to his fields and back .
The Gate From Hell
The first time I saw an " agricultural gate " was in 2004 outside the northern Palestinian village of Mas ’ha .
It was terrible to behold .
Immense steel jaws painted a bright ochre - yellow creaked open , thanks to the Israeli Occupation Forces ’ finest , for about 30 minutes at dawn and again at dusk .
Between those two moments , it remained locked , leaving the local farmers with no possibility of returning home for lunch or emergencies , nor even for crop-irrigation at the appropriate time ( after sundown ) .
Each opening of the Mas ’ha gate permitted a lone farmer , Hani Amer – his home locked in on three sides by the wall and on the fourth by an Israeli settlement – to make sporadic trips to his fields .
At both sides of the gate lay coils of razor wire snarled in front of a barrier ditch which stretched into the distance as far as we could see .
Beyond this ditch , more razor wire .
Then a " military road " meant for Israeli soldiers patrolling the boundaries of an Arab world considered burdensome to the Greater Israel .
Across the military road lay yet more razor wire and another ditch before Hani Amer could finally reach his fields .
To grasp what the gate really means , though , you ’d have to stay , as I did , at least a night with a farmer in Jayyous at harvest time .
You ’d awaken with his wife and him at 5:30 a.m. , drink a cup of strong Arabic coffee , eat bread spread with jam made from fruit he grows on the land remaining to him , and then go jolting down the white , rutted , stony road on his tractor .
Finally , of course , you would wait with him in a gathering line of farmers at the gate .
Now watch , in the dawn of another day in the forty - second year of occupation , in front of this steel raptor out of some mad filmmaker ’s imagination , as they all arrive : one on his tractor , another on a donkey laden with sacks and harvest tools , until finally a long line stands waiting .
Note those ubiquitous coils of razor wire , and the ditches , and that military road , just one form of the endless wall that imprisons Palestine ’s people .
Watch as the soldiers turn languidly and unlock the gate , swinging its jaws wide to transform it , and the military road it bars , into a checkpoint for the brief morning opening .
As I waited and watched from Abu Azzam ’s tractor this past October , I imagined the hillside on the other side of the road as it must have been decades ago , when I still reported regularly from the West Bank .
The region ’s steep hills were then punctuated by lines of drywall terracing that enclosed olive trees whose leaves billowed silver in the wind , and the darker greens of fruit trees and grapevines .
The Greater Israel ’s new , California - style urban sprawl , its cities that now ooze through the West Bank , were still part of an expansionist dream , not a burgeoning reality , and of course there was no wall , nor a " military road , " nor , of course , an agricultural gate .
Watch now , as each farmer with his donkey , his tractor , his work - tools , approaches the passage between the gaping steel jaws .
Watch each as he moves into the military road , brings his donkey to a halt , dismounts , and offers his ID card to a stout , impassive Israeli soldier .
Flanked by two other soldiers , he , in turn , calls a control tower rising in the distance and in Hebrew recites each bearer ’s name and ID numbers .
Take in the stoicism , the resignation , the endurance of these farmers as they accept the indignity of all this because there is no other choice .
Think that they are trying to do one simple thing : harvest their olives .
But first each must move into the road , stand with head bowed or eyes averted as his fate is determined for this day , and then , if he ’s approved , move forward .
Beyond lie more ditches at the other side of the road , more razor wire , and – at last – something that masquerades as freedom but is n’t .
The farmer is now permitted to climb the hill in his vehicle .
Beyond its crest he may reach his fields , for whose sake he has endured this daily torment .
And now , consider the Israeli settlers and soldiers , whose absolute rule , running the gamut from control over this gate through vigilantism against villagers like those in Jayyous , make a nightmare of this simple thing , the olive harvest .
Settlers from Zufim actually uprooted olive trees in Jayyous in 2004 .
Some were carted away for sale in Israel ; sewage from the colony has destroyed others .
A week after my stay , according to the Israeli paper Ha’aretz , Jewish settlers elsewhere in the northern West Bank " clashed with Palestinians picking olives . "
The settlers called the farmers trying to bring in their crops a " security " threat because they " could gather intelligence and launch attacks from the olive groves . "
Elsewhere in the area that same week , Israeli security forces stood by as settlers entered a Palestinian village " to hold a brief rally " against the harvest .
( Israel ’s army is now dominated from top to bottom by ultra-religious - expansionist settlers , which makes a mockery of the " settler - soldier " distinction . )
Meanwhile , near an Israeli " outpost " settlement called Adi Ad , settlers " uprooted dozens of olive trees . "
As I write , similar alarums reach me by e-mail daily .
Several times since October the Israeli army has imposed curfews on Jayyous – collective punishment for the weekly anti-wall demonstrations staged by village youth here .
Most of the time the curfews have been levied after the farmers were already in their fields and have n’t interrupted the harvest .
But they have punished the rest of Jayyous .
Collective punishment – reprisals against all for the actions of a few – is illegal under the 1949 Fourth Geneva convention .
Keeping Going
" A state gone mad , " observed Palestinian lawyer and writer Raja Shehadeh when , a day after visiting Jayyous , I described the scene at the gate .
This particular barrier of steel , these particular patient farmers , those particular soldiers enforcing Israel ’s banality of evil – they offer but a taste of the insane ingenuity that is the still - developing Greater Israel .
A Dutch filmmaker who had interviewed some West Bank Jewish settlers , related this little exchange to Shehadeh : " What is your dream ? " she asked one of the settlers .
" My dream , " he replied , " is that my grandchildren will say someday , ‘ Here , they say that once upon a time there were Arabs . ’ "
The evening before we all arose to go to the gate , Abu Azzam took a German visitor and me to see the local olive press where he and other farmers unload each day ’s harvest .
The sight of Jayyous ’ olives moving up a conveyor belt and into the press , finally to emerge as a stream of oil bottled in large plastic containers , was joyous .
Children ran and slid about on the slick floor , laughing ; their parents dipped bread for them in the delicious , freshly pressed oil .
What human madness would inflict constant torment on such peaceful labor ?
Later , Abu Azzam told me stories about his life as an activist , his marriage , and his children .
Jailed by Jordan for belonging to the Communist Party and later by Israel for his attempts to preserve the village land , he says he can’t imagine anything but keeping going .
" I have no other choice " is the way he puts it , with a shrug and a smile .
He recalled the moment back in October 2003 as the wall was being built , when an Israeli official tried to buy off the Jayyous activists by offering them 650 permits which would have allowed that many farmers to access their land .
But the Land Defense Committee made " a team decision " not to use them .
Accepting the permits would have meant recognizing the validity of the wall and the whole system of dispossession that went with it .
Israeli soldiers closed the gate ; it was the height of the olive , guava , and clementine harvests .
Abu Azzam and other farmers cut gaps in the barrier and crept through to work their fields " without a tractor , without horses , without carriages , without anything .
Only our bodies . "
More arrests followed .
The farmers made a decision to stay on their land and not return to the village .
" My wife was very angry , " Abu Azzam recalls .
" She called me on Oct. 21 asking me , ‘ Are we divorced ?
Are we separated ? ’
I said , ‘ I ’m resisting . ’
‘ Resisting ?
Can you see one box of guavas , cucumbers , or tomatoes ? ’
‘ Enough , to be on the land is resistance , ’ I said . "
Since 2003 Abu Azzam and other Jayyous farmers have continued their obdurate odyssey to their lands .
This determination to keep farming on the 3,250 dunams – of an original 8,050 – that the villagers still have , rather than live elsewhere in the West Bank or abroad is itself resistance .
In Palestine , this " just staying " is called samid .
It means " the steadfast , " " the persevering , " and eloquently expresses the oldest form of Palestinian nonviolent resistance .
" You have so many problems , " I said to Abu Azzam .
" Would you ever leave ? "
He smiled at me indulgently .
" All our life is a problem .
I do n’t want to be a new refugee .
I am against the emigration that took place through the Israelis . "
Since 2008 , Jayyous ’ young people have staged weekly demonstrations against the wall .
One of their leaders – Mohammed Othman – was arrested by Israeli authorities this past fall when he returned from a speaking tour in Norway .
He is still in jail under indefinite administrative detention .
Jayyousi leaders have also written to high officials in Norway and Dubai imploring them to divest from companies owned by the Uzbekistan - born Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev .
In doing so , Jayyous joins growing international revulsion at , and refusal to deal with , Leviev ’s companies .
Their reach is vast and diverse , extending to Angola ’s diamond mines , New York real estate , and Israeli settlements in whose planning and building ( including Zufim ) they are heavily involved .
Last March , Ha’aretz ‘s Barak Ravid reported that the British embassy in Tel Aviv " stopped negotiations to lease a floor in Africa - Israel ’s Kirya Tower because of the [ Leviev - owned ] company ’s involvement in settlement construction . "
Oxfam has severed ties with him for the same reason .
On Sept. 9 , 2009 , a month before my arrival , the Israeli Supreme Court handed down a new ruling moving the route of the wall again and returning an additional 2,448 dunams to Jayyous .
" Because of your efforts ? " I asked Azzam .
" It is because of Jayyous , " he replied .
" It is a group struggle . "

It 's hard to know what kind of workplace behavior is acceptable at KBR these days .
On the one hand , if you believe the many lawsuits filed against the nation - builder , it 's not unheard of for the men stationed in Iraq to verbally and sexually abuse their women colleagues , even rape one on occasion .
There are alleged incidents of prostitution and human trafficking at a Thai brothel , where KBR managers encourage their workers to visit , and in some cases possibly even own the brothel .
There are even instances where KBR workers supposedly exposed military personnel to contaminated food , contaminated water and improperly incinerated human remains .
Yes , one man claims he saw a wild dog running around base one day with a man 's arm in its mouth .
So it should have hardly come as a shock to Karen Tounkara when she was fired from her contract gig at one of KBR 's Houston facilities for wearing a headscarf .
After all , a company must have its standards .
According to a lawsuit recently filed against KBR in Houston federal court , Tounkara , a Muslim , claims she was discriminated against because of her religion when she was prohibited from wearing her headscarf , or hijab , in observance of her faith while she worked .
Tounkara 's attorney , Darius Porter , tells Hair Balls that his client was contracted through a nursing agency to help prep KBR workers heading to Iraq .
When Tounkara showed up to her first day of work in December , she was told she could not wear her headscarf .
" Mind you , " says Porter , " this was December and there were other nurses there who had on hats and skull caps because of the cold weather .
They were n't required to do anything . "
Later that night , says Porter , the staffing agency told Tounkara she was not welcome back at KBR because of a KBR policy stating that no employee can wear a head - covering at work .
When Tounkara explained that she was a Muslim and asked if an accommodation could be made , says Porter , KBR countered by saying Tounkara could wear her headscarf up until entering the gates of KBR and put it back on once she had left .
" That is not necessarily a reasonable accommodation , " says Porter , " so we filed the petition . "
Hair Balls contacted KBR to ask whether the company has a no - hats - and - scarves policy , but have not yet heard back .
The lawsuit states that Tounkara should be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , which prohibits employers from discriminating against workers based on religion .

The flower of the Berlinia korupensis , the largest plant in the list of new finds Giant rainforest trees , tiny fungi and wild coffee plants are among almost 300 species that have been described by UK botanists for the first time in 2009 .
The finds were recorded by researchers from the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , who carried out surveys involving teams in 100 countries around the world .
The discoveries showed how little of the world 's plant species had been documented , the researchers said .
They warned that nearly a third of the finds were in danger of extinction .
" These new discoveries highlight the fact that there is so much of the plant world yet to be discovered and documented , " said Stephen Hopper , director of the Royal Botanical Gardens , Kew ( RBG Kew ) .
" Without knowing what 's out there and where it occurs , we have no scientific basis for effective conservation . "
Kew 's botanists have described 2009 as a " bumper year " in which they described 292 new species , compared with 200 in an average year .
Exploding pods
The largest of the new finds was a previously unknown giant of Cameroon 's rainforest , stretching more than 42 m ( 138 ft ) into the canopy of the Korup National Park .
The Berlinia korupensis pods explode , spreading seeds over a wide area
The Berlinia korupensis - a member of the pea family - has a one - metre - wide buttressed trunk , and produces white flowers that then give rise to massive seed pods , which can reach 30 cm ( 1ft ) in length .
When fully ripened , the pods explode , sending the seeds flying away from the tree , ensuring the best possible chance of survival .
" We found just 17 trees in our survey , " explained Xander van der Burgt , who led the team that found the tree .
" Even though the Korup ( National Park ) is protected , Berlinia korupensis is critically endangered due to human pressures on the park , " he added .
At the other end of the scale , the smallest finds were wood - rotting fungi , which were less than 1 mm thick and covered their hosts " like a lick of paint " .
Coffea ambongensis " bean " ( left ) and the commercial Arabica variety Seven wild coffee species also feature on the list of new species , most of which were discovered in the mountains of northern Madagascar .
Two of the plants - Coffea ambongensis and Coffea boinensis - have the largest seeds of any coffee species , whose " beans " are more than twice the size of Arabica coffee ( Coffea arabica ) , the main species used in commercial coffee production .
" Coffee is the world 's second most traded commodity , after oil , with at least 25 million farming families dependent on its production for their livelihoods , " explained RBG Kew 's coffee expert Aaron Davis .
" Yet , we still have much to learn about its wild relatives . "
Dr Davis estimated that almost three - quarters of the world 's wild coffee species were threatened , as a result of habitat loss and climate change .
" Conserving the genetic diversity within this genus has implications for the sustainability of our daily cup , particularly as coffee plantations are highly susceptible to climate change , " he added .
Professor Hopper said that , around the globe , about 2,000 species were described for the first time each year , adding that it was " vital " that these areas of botanical sciences were adequately funded and supported .
Kew Gardens has published profiles of the new species on its website , and added the information to Google Earth .

The human mind is built to think in terms of narratives , of se­quences of events with an internal logic and dynamic that appear as a unified whole .
In turn , much of human motivation comes from living through a story of our lives , a story that we tell to ourselves and that creates a framework for motivation .
Life could be just " one damn thing after another " if it were n’t for such stories .
The same is true for con­fidence in a nation , a company , or an institution .
Great leaders are first and foremost creators of stories .
Social psychologists Roger Schank and Robert Abelson have argued that stories and storytelling are fundamental to human knowledge .
People ’s memories of essential facts are , they argue , indexed in the brain around stories .
Facts that are remembered are attached to stories .
We keep in mind a story of those memories , a story that helps define who we are and what our purpose is .
Politicians are one significant source of stories , especially about the economy .
They spend much of their time talking to their public .
In do­ing so they tell stories .
And since much of their interaction with the public concerns the economy , so also do these stories .
A good example of this was the waxing and waning of economic con­fidence in Mexico , as analyzed by Wharton School doctoral student Stephanie Finnel .
She finds that eco­nomic confidence in Mexico over the past 50 years reached a peak un­der the presidency of José López Portillo , who served between 1976 and 1982 .
He made Mexico itself the subject of an " underdog " story .
López Por­tillo had published a novel in 1965 entitled Quetzalcóatl .
Quetzalcóatl was an Aztec god , who , like Christ , was expected to make a reappear­ance at a time of great transformation .
The novel was reissued in 1975 , on the eve of López Portillo ’s election campaign , and it became a story for Mexico ’s future greatness , itself regenerated from the ancient Aztec tale .
The presidential jets were named Quetzalcóatl and Quetzalcóatl II .
The story was all the more convincing because of two fortuitous events .
First was the discovery of new oil reserves throughout the 1970s just before López Portillo ’s presidency .
As a succession of wells was drilled , proven reserves steadily rose .
Expectations ran wild .
Some even claimed that Mexico would eventually be second only to Saudi Arabia , with no fewer than 200 billion barrels of proven reserves .
A second stroke of luck came with the second oil crisis , as the price of oil reached a peak in 1980 that was more than double its level compared with the early 1970s .
The idea of undreamt - of Mexican wealth took hold of people ’s imaginations .
Starting with his state of the union address in 1976 , López Portillo stressed the importance of oil : " in the current era , countries can be divided into those who do and those who do not have oil . "
And he began to act like the president of a wealthy country , offering a Global Energy Plan to the international com­munity , joining with Venezuela in the 1980 Pact of San José to sell oil at preferential rates to the nations of Central America and the Caribbean , and even offering foreign aid .
In 1979 Pope John Paul visited Mexico , and the visit was widely interpreted as a sign .
Mexico had become rich and important .
The confidence that López Portillo fostered led to economic pros­perity .
Mexican real GDP rose 55 percent over his six years as president .
Unfortunately growth faltered at the end of his term .
When López Portillo left office in 1982 Mexico had 100 percent inflation and unemploy­ment was growing .
Corruption and outright theft reached unheard - of levels .
In his effort to create the new Mexico , López Portillo had bor­rowed heavily against the oil still in the ground , driven the country deeply into debt , and brought about a severe economic crisis after oil prices fell in the mid-1980s .
Yet he lived the story while it lasted .
It is generally considered unprofessional for economists to base their analyses on stories .
On the contrary , we are supposed to stick to the quantitative facts and theory — a theory that is based on optimization , especially optimization of economic variables .
Just the facts , ma’am .
There is good reason to be careful about the use of stories .
The news media are , after all , in the business of creating stories that people would like to hear .
But what if the stories themselves move markets ?
What if they themselves are a real part of how the economy functions ?
Then economists have gone overboard .
The stories no longer merely explain the facts ; they are the facts .
To really explain Mexico in the 1970s , and indeed the ups and downs of most economies , one must look at the driving stories .
In fact , the confidence of a nation , or of any large group , tends to revolve around stories .
Of particular relevance are new era stories , those that purport to describe historic changes that will propel the economy into a brand new era .
Shiller ’s Irrational Exuberance detailed the impor­tance of the story of the invention and exploitation of the Internet ( which became available to the public in 1994 ) in producing the stock market boom that lasted from the mid-1990s to 2000 , which in turn led to an economic boom .
This new technology was especially salient be­cause of its presence in our daily lives .
The stories of young people making fortunes were a contemporary reenactment of the nineteenth - century Gold Rush .
Confidence is not just the emotional state of an individual .
It is a view of other people ’s confidence , and of other people ’s perceptions of other people ’s confidence .
It is also a view of the world — a popular model of current events , a public understanding of the mechanism of economic change as informed by the news media and by popular dis­cussions .
High confidence tends to be associated with inspirational sto­ries , stories about new business initiatives , tales of how others are get­ting rich .
New era stories have tended to accompany the major booms in stock markets around the world .
The complexity of the different new era stories through time sug­gests that differences in confidence have had many effects on the econ­omy beyond an impact on consumption and investment .
Changes in these stories will affect the expectations for personal success in business , for the success of entrepreneurial ventures , and for payoffs to human capital investments .
We might model the spread of a story in terms of an epidemic .
Stories are like viruses .
Their spread by word of mouth involves a sort of con­tagion .
Epidemiologists have developed mathematical models of epi­demics , which can be applied to the spread of stories and confidence as well .
For these models the essential parameters are the infection rate ( a measure of the ability of the disease to be communicated from one individual to another ) and the removal rate ( a measure of the speed at which people lose their contagion ) .
The essential initial conditions are the number of people who have the disease and the number of people who are susceptible to the disease .
Given these , a mathematical model of epidemics can predict the whole course of the epidemic .
But there is always uncertainty , as various factors , such as mutations of the virus , can change the contagion rate over time .
Just as diseases spread through contagion , so does confidence , or lack of confidence .
Indeed confidence , or the lack thereof , may be as contagious as any disease .
Epidemics of confidence or epidemics of pes­simism may arise mysteriously simply because there was a change in the contagion rate of certain modes of thinking .
The question of when VAT is payable on the sale of a residential property has new relevance in the current economic cycle where many people are establishing home - based businesses to make a living .
Martin Schultheiss , CEO of the Harcourts Africa real estate group , says there is some confusion about VAT obligations when selling a residential property that is also used as the premises of the owner ’s VAT - registered business .
“ Whether or not VAT is payable on the property will depend on whether or not the owner has claimed VAT input credits on any additions or alterations made to the property in order to accommodate the business .
“ Homeowners who wish to alter their homes to accommodate a VAT - registered business can avoid this issue by simply absorbing the costs themselves and not claiming any VAT credits through the business . "
Sellers need to make very sure if they are liable for VAT and be scrupulous in paying the required amount – or risk the wrath of the Receiver in the form of stiff penalties .
Sellers should seek out and heed expert advice before marketing their properties .
Schultheiss also cautions sellers who have claimed VAT inputs to take great care when determining the marketing price of the property .
“ Failure to include VAT charges may well result in diminished profits from the sale , while just adding VAT to the market value may result in overpricing , and thus little interest among buyers .
The best advice is to speak to a reputable agent , who will be able to suggest a fair compromise . ”
The annular solar eclipse that was visible earlier this month in parts of Africa , the Indian Ocean and Asia yielded some beautiful photographs of the moon obscuring the light from the sun .
But none of them provided the kind of exquisite detail that a team of astronomers watching from the Marshall Islands captured during last summer 's total solar eclipse .
By combining 31 images of the eclipse shot with a Canon EOS 5D , the composite shows the incredible structure of the sun 's corona stretching out from occluded central disc .
The moon 's surface details are also clearly visible .
The next total solar eclipse will occur on July 11 and will be visible only from the South Pacific .
So , read our how - to guide on solar eclipse tourism and start saving those frequent flyer miles .

Do you get the feeling your back yard is getting smaller ?
Or that the patch of turf you laid last year has disappeared to be replaced by a slab of concrete ?
It ’s one of Australia ’s most pressing issues , yet political leaders refuse to do anything to stop it .
I am referring to Australia ’s surging population growth .
Recent projections that Australia will have to accommodate 35 million people by 2050 – up from 22 million at present – is a worrying prospect .
In the post - World War II years , the rallying call in this country was to populate or perish – a response to the fear of military invasion from a powerful northern neighbour .
This gave us the Baby Boomer generation , which is now nearing retirement and creating imminent pressures of an aging population .
The greying of the nation has prompted Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to espouse a new call for a “ big Australia ” , propelled by a higher birth rate and increased immigration .
It ’s a short - term solution to a long - term problem .
What will happen in another 50 years ?
Will another prime minister call for an even bigger population boom to replace the generation reaching retirement then ?
The population debate has been hijacked until now by economic greed and rationalism .
The argument has been that the higher the population growth , the greater consumption will be and therefore economic prosperity and profit – at least for the wealthy few in society .
Little or no attention has been paid to the limited availability of natural resources , the dire effect on the environment and loss of quality of life as more people compete for living space in our cities .
It is good to see that questions are finally being raised about Australia ’s sustainable population .
This week enterpreneur - adventurer Dick Smith became the latest in a string of forward thinkers who criticised Government plans to encourage population growth , saying Australia did not have enough water or food to support millions more people .
He also urged slashing immigration and discouraging women from having more than two babies , thereby allowing population growth to be contained .
Just because people in many other countries have to live in cramped high - rises in concrete urban jungles does not make it a lifestyle model Australians should aspire to .
In 1798 , the Rev Robert Thomas Malthus published his Principles of Population in which he stated : “ The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man ” .
He predicted that endless population growth would block progress towards a utopian society .
As an Anglican minister , Malthus , believed that God had created an inexorable tendency to human population growth for a moral purpose , with the threat of poverty and starvation designed to teach the virtues of hard work and virtuous behaviour .
We carry a responsiblity to make the world a better place for the generations that will follow .
Australia is well placed to embark on a journey to a more sustainable future .
The future of the country may depend on it .

Spotting Online Poker Tells
What are poker tells ?
Tells are often described as a twitch of the nose , a crease on the forehead or a physical clue of some kind that alerts you to what your opponent is holding .
You 'll often hear poker greats talking about reading their opponent 's hand based solely on a tell that they picked up on .
That 's great and all when you 're playing in a real poker room , but when you 're playing poker online , it becomes a whole different story trying to spot online tells .
Debunking the Myth of Physical Tells
The first thing that I 'm going to do however , is take a little bit of the mysticism out of tells .
In reality , even though players will have physical cues or ticks when they play poker , it 's often not as straight - forward as the professionals would have you think .
For example , if a player is blinking rapidly , you might be certain that it 's a tell - but does it mean they have a strong hand or a weak hand ?
On the other hand , maybe it means their contacts are drying out as well or they 're sensitive to smoke .
Physical tells are often unreliable because of this .
That said , there are certain ' general ' physical tells that apply to a decent amount people , which will be covered later in this article .
Online Tells , the Art of Observing Unseen Opponents
If physical tells are hard enough , then you must be asking how on Earth are you supposed to spot online tells ?
The answer is actually a little surprising .
Since you can't actually see your opponent when playing internet poker , the only information that you have to go on is : the speed of their action ( check , bet or raise ) , the significance of their action ( big bet vs small bet ) and how it compares to their past patterns .
For this article , we 're going to focus on direct online tells that you can observe , which is primarily the speed of your opponents ' action and their bet size .
Pattern recognition , the biggest tell of all , is complicated enough that it will have to be addressed in it 's own article ( coming soon ) .
For now though , there 's still a lot of information you can gleam from observing your opponent through your computer screen .
General Online Tells to Look For
Here is a listing of general online poker tells that you will often see .
The concept that you should keep in mind when deciphering tells is to remember the following :
The golden rule of tells is that a strong opponent will try to act weak , while a weak opponent will try to act strong .
Long pause , followed by a raise ( very strong ) :
This has to be the cornerstone tell of most players .
The irony is that by using this strategy , they are actually giving off their own tell .
The whole logic behind this play screams strength , because people usually only do it when there is a big possible hand on the table , like a flush or straight .
You bet , your opponent pauses for about 10 - 15 seconds and then raises you .
In English , he might as well be saying : " Hmm ... there 's a flush possibility on the table and you 've bet into it .
Man , I really have to think about this because you might have a really strong hand !
Oh well , I think I 'm beat , but I * guess * I 'll raise ... " .
Do n't fall for this .
Sometimes , a player legitimately thinks you 're bluffing the river or whatever so he 's raising you back , but most of the time he 's got a big hand .
Instant automatic raise ( usually very strong ) :
By automatic raise , I mean a raise that is so fast that it can only happen when a user has checked the ' bet / raise all ' button .
While occasionally this is used by maniacs and bluffers , most of the time it 's used by a player who is so sure of his hand that he is willing to bet or raise regardless of the action .
This usually means that you want to tread carefully and consider folding or check - calling this down .
It should always raise a big warning sign at the very least .
Instant automatic check ( weak or folding hand ) :
This is a pretty straight - forward tell , as almost every player uses the auto - check button only when they are willing to fold their hand .
Sometimes players will be willing to call after auto - checking , but it 's incredibly rare to see someone check - raise with the auto - check button .
So , when you 're in a small field and it 's auto - checked to you , you can often take down the pot right then and there .
Odd number bet , such as betting $ 9.95 instead of $ 10 ( neutral hand ) :
This comes up quite often on the internet no limit games , where players are able to bet with fractions of a dollar .
When a player does this , you should n't look into it either way .
Some players do this routinely to throw off their opponents , others do this to make their bet size look bigger and scarier ( induce folds ) , while others try to get you to call when doing this .
Opponent quickly calls your bet ( moderate to semi- weak hand ) :
Usually when someone is chasing you or has a marginal hand , they 'll make a fast call to look as if they 're not scared of your bet .
With reverse psychology , you can figure out that this is an intimidation ploy , because if they did have a strong hand , they'd be raising your bet instead of flat calling .
In this situation , you can often continue to bet as normal .
That said , some players on tilt or experienced players will often make quick calls , as they really do intend on calling to the river .
Size of the Bet Often Equates Strength
Classic example of overbet at a bet at PartyPoker.com
One of the reasons that no limit hold 'em is considered the marquee game of poker , is because there 's a lot more information and risk to deal with .
One critical piece of information , is how much your opponent bets .
As such , in no limit games , you 'll often want to pay attention to not only how fast your opponent is betting , but how much they are betting .
The following are again , general tells that you might find useful .
Very small bets ( weak hand , sometimes monster ) :
An example of this tell would be a pot that is currently worth $ 10 .
There are 4 players on the flop and it's checked to the button , who bets out a measly $ 2 .
More often than not , this should indicate a weak hand , as the size of this bet does n't protect the bettor 's hand from being outdrawn .
Quite often though , you 'll see these small bets pick up the pot , as the person who bets is usually in good position to make this bet .
If you are looking to improve your game , you should sometimes consider a check - raise in this situation .
If you timed your play correctly , your opponent will have nothing and will be forced to fold , awarding you the pot .
Warning :
Many players will often do this on purpose to try and ' sucker ' other players into the pot .
I 've actually use this strategy with good success against other solid players , who notice such ' tricks ' .
So if you decide to pull this off , be sure that you 've targetted the right opponent so that you are not walking into a trap .
Massive all - in bets vs size of pot ( monster or bluff ) :
This play is usually reserved for weak players or very aggressive players .
For many weak players , they will wait until they have a monster hand , then push all - in , hoping someone will call them .
It may not matter that the pot is $ 5 and they 're betting $ 100 - they just know they have a good hand and are hoping someone is stupid enough to call .
On the other hand , the all - in is also a signal of a bluff if the bet is too large for the pot .
The reason for this logic , is that when a player has a monster hand , they are usually more interested in stringing a player along to extract the most value , rather than shoving their chips in and hoping someone calls .
This is a hard tell to decipher , because the results are on the two exact opposite ends of the spectrum - you 're either up against a monster or an outright bluff .
The only way to figure out where you 're at , is to have paid attention to your opponent up to the point where they made this bet .
Are they trying to make you fold with this bet , or are they looking to take all your chips ?
Are they the type to expect you to call your chips here , or are they the type to think you 'll fold to this bet ?
It 's a difficult question to answer , but answering it right is what makes you a strong player .
Recognizing Betting Patterns in Opponent Behavior
Pattern recognition is one of the key strengths that you 'll need in poker , although it is rarely discussed in books .
It requires a good memory and the ability to walkforward and backward through current and present hands that have played out .
The reason it 's so crucial , is that once you can identify your opponent 's poker patterns , you will be able to recognize when they are doing something out of the norm .
This means you have a much better chance of avoiding their monsters or catching them on a bluff .
This topic will require a whole new article , but for the time being , here 's a quick point to take notes on .
When a person does anything that is unnatural to them , it causes stress .
Stress is the coping mechanism for dealing with a situation that the person is not used to .
In order to deal with stress , the person usually needs to be in a more confident position than normal , in order to handl the stress .
In English , what this means in poker is that when your opponent does something that is unnatural to their regular patterns , more often than not , it means they have a strong hand .
Weak hands take much more guts and effort to bluff and seethrough , which is why most players are n't good at bluffing or rarely do it .
This leads to our second conclusion that most of the time you are raised , you 're probably against a better hand .
Not a golden rule , but just food for thought .
Example of Tell Patterns in Player Chat
There will always be people chatting it up in a poker game , even via internet poker .
From my personal observation , most solid players do n't do a lot of talking when online , as they are too busy multi-tabling .
That said , you can often hear many of the top players doing a lot of talking in real life , but that is because they are in their own league and are trying to wrestle information from you by overwhelming you with their own chitter .
Daniel Negreanu and Mike Matusow are two examples of these types of players .
Going on our previous topic of patterns , a major tell that is often correct , is when you notice an otherwise quiet player suddenly start talking .
They do n't have to say much more than " I'm bluffing " or " I guess I 'll bet " to be considered .
First , this is a change in pattern , which as you know now , usually means strength .
More so from a psychological viewpoint a player who is bluffing is scared and under stress .
In this situation , a person will find it harder to hold a conversation and talk if they were actually bluffing .
So , when a shy , quiet guy is able to talk , the psychological viewpoint is that they have suddenly become relaxed enough to talk to the table .
They would be relaxed unless they were confident and not worried .
That should spell out one thing to you , which is a big hand .
Not always , but careful observation should really help pick this one out .
How to Prevent Giving Away Tells
Lastly , poker would be easy if it were merely about spotting what other people are doing wrong , but you could be giving off all sorts of signs to your opponents at the table without knowing it .
A good idea is to always give yourself the same amount of time before making an action .
When the action is to you , make two mental counts and then select your action .
If you 're going to fold , then it 's probably ok to simply auto - fold if it 's pre-flop .
What you want to do is simply not let anyone onto your game at all .
The other way to not give out tells is to simply be unpredictable .
Never do the same thing twice and vary up your game .
This is commonly known as ' changing gears ' , which is a tactic that all solid poker players use , especially in tournaments .
Working on changing your strategy between being aggressive and conservative during a game will be the best way to throw your opponents off from picking up any tells on you .
Conclusion of Online Tells
As you can see , you do n't actually have to visually see another player in order to guess what is going on their head .
While their character on your screen might not twitch or eat Oreo cookies when they have a big hand ( that 's a reference to the movie Rounders ) , they 'll often do other things that will be big enough tells for you to pick up on .
It takes time to develop your own tells intuition to how players behave on the internet , so do n't worry if you make a lot of mistakes early on .
Once you get a good library of experience behind you , you 'll be able to figure out better than 50 % when people are lying and when they are not .
That , will make you a winner at poker .
Republicans say ‘ freedom won , ’ liberal jokes real winner is Satan
Update : Obama vows ‘ forceful response ’
The US Supreme Court on Thursday lifted a 20 - year ruling which had set limits on campaign financing by US businesses , and critics , including nonpartisan watchdogs and Congressional Democrats , are up in arms about the decision , which most had feared for a long time .
Meanwhile , aside from Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) , Republicans appear to be gleeful about their second apparent victory of the week .

The nine justices ruled that American corporations could dip freely into their general funds to finance campaign ads either in support or against a particular political candidate .
The move overturns a ruling made two decades ago which had forced companies to only use specially earmarked funds from a political action committee .
The Supreme Court also ruled that any campaign ads not financed by the candidate or their party must be clearly marked with the name of the sponsor .
Vowing “ a forceful response ” to a ruling which will help “ drown out the voices of everyday Americans , ” President Barack Obama released the following statement :
With its ruling today , the Supreme Court has given a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics .
It is a major victory for big oil , Wall Street banks , health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans .
This ruling gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington — while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates .
That ’s why I am instructing my Administration to get to work immediately with Congress on this issue .
We are going to talk with bipartisan Congressional leaders to develop a forceful response to this decision .
The public interest requires nothing less .

NPR summed the news up :
In a decision widely anticipated for its effect on campaign finance laws — if not the First Amendment itself — the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled , 5 - 4 , that corporations and independent groups may spend unlimited funds for or against candidates for president and Congress .
The ruling , in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , takes effect immediately , and could play a huge role in the 2010 midterm elections .
Both sides in the bigger debate over money and politics agree that today ’s decision is significant .
The winning side says it ’s a victory for free speech and the First Amendment .
The losing side said that the reforms placed on campaigns in the aftermath of Watergate and other scandals are in serious jeopardy .
Today ’s decision overturns a 20 - year ruling — Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce — that prohibited corporations or labor unions from paying for campaign ads .
The decision removes spending limits for independent expenditure groups .
It threatens to remove spending limits already established in 24 states .
And it struck down part of the McCain - Feingold campaign finance law that bars issue ads paid for by corporations or unions in the closing days of a campaign .
Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer declared in a scathing press release , “ Today ’s Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case is a disaster for the American people and a dark day for the Supreme Court . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The decision will unleash unprecedented amounts of corporate “ influence - seeking ” money on our elections and create unprecedented opportunities for corporate “ influence - buying ” corruption .
Today ’s decision is the most radical and destructive campaign finance decision in Supreme Court history .
In order to reach the decision , five justices abandoned longstanding judicial principles , judicial precedents and judicial restraint .
With the Citizens United opinion , Chief Justice Roberts has abandoned the illusory public commitments he made to “ judicial modesty ” and “ respect for precedent ” to cast the deciding vote for a radical decision that profoundly undermines our democracy .
In a stark choice between the right of American citizens to a government free from “ influence - buying ” corruption and the economic and political interests of American corporations , five Supreme Court Justices today came down in favor of American corporations .
With a stroke of the pen , five Justices wiped out a century of American history devoted to preventing corporate corruption of our democracy . ….
Today , five Justices issued a decision that will empower “ influence - buying ” corruption .
Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WIS ) , who with McCain has led the charge against “ soft money ” contributions , released the following statement :
ADVERTISEMENT
It is important to note that the decision does not affect McCain - Feingold ’s soft money ban , which will continue to prevent corporate contributions to the political parties from corrupting the political process .
But this decision was a terrible mistake .
Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue , the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president .
Ignoring important principles of judicial restraint and respect for precedent , the Court has given corporate money a breathtaking new role in federal campaigns .
Just six years ago , the Court said that the prohibition on corporations and unions dipping into their treasuries to influence campaigns was ‘ firmly embedded in our law . ’
Yet this Court has just upended that prohibition , and a century ’s worth of campaign finance law designed to stem corruption in government .
The American people will pay dearly for this decision when , more than ever , their voices are drowned out by corporate spending in our federal elections .
In the coming weeks , I will work with my colleagues to pass legislation restoring as many of the critical restraints on corporate control of our elections as possible .
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) called it the “ worst Supreme Court decision since the Dred Scott case . ”
The Hill quotes New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer ’s dissatisfaction , as well .

“ The bottom line is this : The Supreme Court has just pre-determined the winners of next November ’s elections , ” Schumer said .
“ It wo n’t be Republicans , it wo n’t be Democrats , it will be corporate America . ”
“ But this opinion , if gone unchallenged , will permanently taint future elections , ” he added .
“ Allowing corporations to spend at will on elections could have undue influence on elected officials … ”
Another article in The Hill notes that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) cheered the decision .
McConnell , a longtime foe of federal law establishing rules on campaign spending , welcomed the court ’s decision this morning allowing corporations and organized labor to more freely make independent expenditures in elections .
“ For too long , some in this country have been deprived of full participation in the political process .
With today ’s monumental decision , the Supreme Court took an important step in the direction of restoring the First Amendment rights of these groups by ruling that the Constitution protects their right to express themselves about political candidates and issues up until Election Day , ” McConnell said in a statement .
In a press release , U.S. Congressman Mike Pence , Chairman of the House Republican Conference , hailed the decision as a victory for “ freedom . ”

Freedom won today in the Supreme Court .
Today ’s ruling in the Citizens United case takes us one step closer to the Founding Fathers ’ vision of free speech , a vision that is cherished by all Americans and one Congress has a responsibility to protect .
If the freedom of speech means anything , it means protecting the right of private citizens to voice opposition or support for their elected representatives .
The fact that the Court overturned a 20 - year precedent speaks volumes about the importance of this issue .
In 2003 , the Supreme Court unwisely supported the oppressive restrictions on free speech that were part of the 2002 campaign finance law .
At the time , I was honored to stand with Senator Mitch McConnell and various state and national organizations in challenging this historic error in court .
Since that time , the Court has taken important steps toward restoring to the American people their First Amendment rights .
This decision is a victory on behalf of those who cherish the fundamental freedoms protected by the First Amendment .
According to a Tweet by The Hill ‘s Mike O’Brien , McCain issued a “ terse ” statement expressing disappointment with the court ’s decision .
However , another O’Brien Tweet adds , “ McCain also expresses relief ( as did Feingold ) that soft money limits were left in place by SCOTUS ruling . ”
Film critic Roger Ebert , a staunch liberal Democrat , issued an irreverent Tweet : “ Supreme Court relaxes limits on Satan ’s campaign donations . ”
( with AFP report )
A new website that would let internet users monitor CCTV cameras online has hit trouble before launch , with the data protection watchdog suggesting the idea could be illegal .
Internet Eyes , based in Stratford - upon - Avon , plans to charge businesses £ 20 per month to have their security camera feeds monitored by its members , who would text in if they spot something suspicious .
The amateur sentries would then be entered into a crime - fighting league to compete for a monthly £ 1,000 cash prize .
The firm first touted the idea in October , gaining extensive national coverage , but has made no major announcements since .
That 's because Internet Eyes is the subject of a probe by the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) , which has today voiced doubts about its legality .
Assistant Information Commissioner Jonathan Bamford told The Register : " CCTV operators should use appropriately trained staff to monitor images .
If a CCTV system is established to help prevent and detect crime , it would be appropriate to disclose images to law enforcement agencies where a crime needs to be investigated .
" However , it is not appropriate to disclose images of identifiable individuals for entertainment purposes or to place them on the internet .
" If images are to be released for identification purposes , this should not generally be done by anyone other than the law enforcement agencies where necessary when investigating a crime . "
He said the ICO held a meeting with Internet Eyes and some businesses who had signed up for their CCTV to be monitored in December to explain its concerns .
" The ICO is reviewing this response to assess whether the scheme complies with requirements of the Data Protection Act , " Bamford added .
The firm had included features it said would protect privacy and the security of premises in its plans , such as serving up random , unlabelled feeds to users .
Internet Eyes did not immediately return a call requesting comment on the ICO 's concerns .
A note on its website says : " Due to further stipulations arising with the ICO we are delaying launch until these items are dealt with and approved .
We take the ICO 's views very seriously and are keen to work within their guidelines . "
In October the firm 's founder Tony Morgan asserted the sincerity of the website , saying , " It 's not a game - we 're fighting crime and terrorism " . ®

From late 2008 until now , the automotive industry has been on a roller coaster that has seen more lows than highs .
Government bailouts , Cash for Clunkers , brands being bought or dissolved , dealers closing in batches — it has n’t been pretty , but not for a lack of trying .
There seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel for most manufacturers and dealers .
It ’s a “ need ” industry — people can only hold onto their current vehicles for so long before needing to add to or replace them .
Without action , many in the industry will see the rebound of slow sales over the last 2 years , but many are turning to a “ new ” way of reaching out to the consumers : social media .
Social media itself is not new and has been used by businesses for years , but the automotive industry has lagged behind in embracing it .
The nature of social media – being social and engaging with other people – is something that has been foreign to an industry that has relied on direct , to - the - point advertising to get their message across .
It is n’t new to everyone in the industry .
Those who have engaged earlier appear to be starting to reap the benefits .
Auto Manufacturers and Social Media Ford has been the poster child for manufacturers using social media for over a year now .
Scott Monty and his team have invested time , money , and creativity into utilizing Web 2.0 to their advantage with efforts such as the Fiesta Movement .
advertisement
Another company making a strong effort is BMW .
Their Facebook page is well maintained , takes advantage of many of the features available through fan pages such as video , images , custom pages , and contact forms , and has actively engaged with customers through it .
Many other manufacturers are way behind , but most are making an effort to get their .
Mazda ’s social media has been non-existent for a while , but a quick tour at Mazda corporate with David Harris , Group Manager for Mazda North American Operations , demonstrated that they ’re aware of the concerns and are working towards improving their automotive social media .
Still , the one thing that every manufacturer is missing is engagement at the level that bridges the corporations with their customers — the dealers themselves .
Nobody has demonstrated an understanding of how to help their customer facing , front - line stores capable and equipped to engage with customers through social media .
Auto Dealers and Social Media
It is here where the battle will be won or lost .
While social media allows people to connect with others across the country and around the world , consumers still want to buy from dealers that are within driving distance .
It ’s in local engagement that the automotive industry must embrace social media , and so far very little of that has been happening .
advertisement
In the early stages of the social media boom , many dealers , lacking direction , turned to a mix of their traditional advertising techniques applied through social media .
They would feed their inventory into Twitter streams and through Facebook updates .
They would put Digg and Delicious buttons on their vehicle details pages .
Vendors in the industry would tout their ability to help dealers reach millions of people through social media .
As a result , many came and left .
They gave social media a shot and saw no value .
They were missing something .
There was no engagement .
There was no humanity .
They promoted , and it did n’t work .

Signs of Change
While most manufacturers are still trying to get their corporate social media affairs in order , most dealers are looking for ways to get into social media properly .
They understand that they need to but lack direction from above on how to do it .
Some dealers are taking measures into their own hands .
Marlboro Nissan in Boston has built a blog , become active on Facebook , Twitter , and MySpace , and are engaging with their potential customers in a way that is driving tremendous traffic as well as increasing sales .
They are the case - study , but most dealers must still turn to the manufacturer for support .
Currently , that support is not there .
The only other place to turn is to their vendors .
A recent partnership between KPA ( an environmental and HR compliance firm ) , TK Carsites ( an automotive Internet marketing firm ) , and Hasai ( a social media strategy firm ) has many in the industry turning to them for help .
Through seminars , webinars , and services , the combination of the three will help dealers “ go social ” through the one key that they promote : engagement .
Rather than having their dealers spam through social media , they are teaching and assisting their clients to gain an understanding of what social media truly means : communication .
By fostering a community of open communication rather than a one - way marketing dialogue , their dealers are able to truly reach and be reached .

Another sign of hope is the upcoming NADA Expo in Orlando .
Much of the discussion this year will revolve around social media with panels and vendors offering ways to help .
Prior to the expo , there ’s an automotive social media boot camp being held the day before to help those looking for more in - depth training than what they can learn at the NADA convention itself .
What Dealers and Manufacturers BOTH Need in 2010
The cream of the crop at both the dealer level and the manufacturer level will have 4 major components to their social media strategy that will make or break them in 2010 .
Blog and / or Social Network :
As consumers , we want to be able to communicate about dealers and manufacturers in a public forum .
A blog or personalized social network is the easiest way to make this happen .
Without one , the other , or both , consumers will turn to sites such as RipOffReport.com to make their statement to the public .
Social Network Engagement : Having a Facebook page and Twitter account are not enough .
Both dealers and manufacturers must engage with consumers , offering news and feedback as well as entering into public conversations surrounding their brand .
In fact , it would n’t hurt to engage in ways that have nothing to do with the industry .
A Dallas car dealer should express how they feel about the Cowboys winning their division .
Honda should ( and have recently ) let people know about charities they support .
In social networking , being human is more important than being corporate .
Videos :
More time was spent watching videos in 2009 than reading emails .
This is something that people want , and it ’s not all about the advertising .
Offering helpful videos for people to reference can help dealers and manufacturers “ give back ” to their customers .
For example , many people have a hard time syncing their mobile devices to their mobile - ready new vehicles .
Having an instructional video on the website that can be found on the search engines will help with branding as well as reputation .
Search for Customers on Social Media :
We ’re here .
We ’re tweeting out when we ’re sick of our 1993 Corolla breaking down .
We ’re updating our Facebook page announcing that we ’re going car - shopping this weekend .
Yet , nobody seems to be listening other than our friends and family .
Once dealers and manufacturers figure that out , they ’ll find a gold mine ready to be tapped .
Many Will Not Get
It Just as there are dealers and brands shutting their doors today , so too will there be more in 2010 and beyond .
It is n’t just the market – things seem to be getting better .
In the end , those who embrace social media properly will have the best chance of not only surviving but flourishing in 2010 .

Born in beauty : proplyds in the Orion Nebula [ heic0917 ]
14 December 2009
Looking like a graceful watercolour painting , the Orion Nebula is one of the most photogenic objects in space and one of the Hubble Space Telescope 's favourite targets .
As newborn stars emerge from the nebula 's mixture of gas and dust , protoplanetary discs , also known as proplyds , form around them : the centre of the spinning disc heats up and becomes a new star , but remnants around the outskirts of the disc attract other bits of dust and clump together .
Proplyds are thought to be young planetary systems in the making .
In an ambitious survey of the familiar nebula using Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) , researchers have discovered 42 protoplanetary discs .
Visible to the naked eye , the Orion Nebula has been known since ancient times , but was first described in the early 17th century by the French astronomer Nicolas - Claude Fabri de Peiresc - who is given credit for discovering it .
At 1500 light - years away , the nebula , also known as Messier 42 , is the closest star - forming region to Earth with stars massive enough to heat up the surrounding gas , setting it ablaze with colour , and making the region stand out to stargazers .
Within the awe - inspiring , gaseous folds of Orion , researchers have identified two different types of discs around young and forming stars : those that lie close to the brightest star in the cluster ( Theta 1 Orionis C ) and those farther away from it .
This bright star heats up the gas in nearby discs , causing them to shine brightly .
Discs that are farther away do not receive enough energetic radiation from the star to heat up the gas and so they can only be detected as dark silhouettes against the background of the bright nebula , as the dust that surrounds these discs absorbs background visible light .
By studying these silhouetted discs , astronomers are better able to characterize the properties of the dust grains that are thought to bind together and possibly form planets like our own .
The brighter discs are indicated by a glowing cusp in the excited material and facing the bright star , but which we see at a random orientation within the nebula , so some appear edge on , and others face on , for instance .
Other interesting features enhance the look of these captivating objects , such as emerging jets of matter and shock waves .
The dramatic shock waves are formed when the stellar wind from the nearby massive star collides with the gas in the nebula , sculpting boomerang shapes or arrows or even , in the case of 181 - 825 , a space jellyfish !
It is relatively rare to see visible images of proplyds , but the high resolution and sensitivity of Hubble and the Orion Nebula 's proximity to Earth allow for precise views of these potential planetary systems .
This proplyd atlas is the first scientific outcome from the HST Treasury Program on the Orion Nebula .
Treasury Programs are carried out to allow scientists to conduct comprehensive studies over longer periods since time on the in - demand Hubble Space Telescope is strictly allocated .
High resolution imaging of protoplanetary discs is an example of a science discovery that has led to better technology and is one of the main science cases for the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) , one of the largest ground - based astronomy projects of the next decade .
ALMA will observe the dust at longer wavelengths , in emission ( instead of in absorption as we see it at optical wavelengths ) with an angular resolution up to 10 times better than that of Hubble .
The full set of individual images of the 30 proplyds can be accessed on the dedicated pages at the spacetelescope.org website .

Ron Reagan slams Ron Christie for his defense of Dick Cheney 's recent attack on President Obama accusing him of ' giving aid and comfort to the enemy ' .
Just how much self - loathing does Ron Christie have to a ) be a Republican to begin with and b ) to carry that much water for Dick Cheney ?
God what a tool .
Transcript via Lexis Nexis .
It would make a mockery of our system , to say nothing of the fact , Ron , that the president of the United States and the attorney general have said , Oh , they`ll be convicted and executed .
As a defense attorney , I can tell you those attorneys are going to say , We can`t get a good jury pool because the president and the attorney general have already condemned the well .
It `s ridiculous !
CHRISTIE :
We are giving aid and comfort to the enemy .
And to my friend , Ron Reagan , I would say , no , this has nothing to do with our justice system .
It has everything to do with our justice system .
The Bush administration didn`t condone terrorism .
I don`t understand why you would condone a system where people who are terrorists , who are captured on the battlefield , who were not given Miranda rights , would then be allowed to come into open court , be able to challenge the evidence against them .
MATTHEWS :
You don`t have any problem with that wording ?
MATTHEWS : " Aid and comfort " is a particular constitutional set of words , " aid and comfort to the enemy " in this case .
You don`t have any problem with him charging the president with doing that ?
MATTHEWS : Ron , you`re an attorney , and I respect your professionalism , but let`s take a look at the Constitution , Article 3 , Section 3 of the United States Constitution , treason against the United States .
Here`s how it`s defined .
According to the Constitution , the United States shall consist -- it shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort .
The very language of the Constitution which defines treason he has now leveled against the president of the United States .
You don`t have a problem with that ?
REAGAN : Not allowing them their day in court would make a mockery of our constitutional principles , Ron , and I think you ought to know that as a lawyer .
CHRISTIE : I do know that , Ron , but I`d say to you military commissions and tribunals have been used since the Civil War .
They did it with those who sought to assassinate Abraham Lincoln .
We established it after Congress complained about it during the Bush years .
We put this system in place .
We have those people in Guantanamo Bay .
MATTHEWS : OK ...
CHRISTIE :
This is a terrible mistake .
MATTHEWS : Let me -- the Constitution defines a traitor as someone who gives aid and comfort to the enemy .
Is he a traitor , the president of the United States ?
CHRISTIE : No .
He`s not a traitor .
MATTHEWS :
Well , the constitutional language is clear here , so the vice president has used that , employed that specific language .
You say you have no problem with it , but the language is clear .
You`re an attorney of the court here of public opinion .
You really think it`s fair to accuse the president of giving aid and comfort to the enemy , using those very words the Constitution defines as treason ?
You have no problem with that ?
CHRISTIE :
The third time is the charm , Chris .
MATTHEWS : With calling him a traitor .
CHRISTIE :
The third time is the charm .
Yes , it will give aid and comfort to al Qaeda to bring those people in the courtroom .
MATTHEWS : Well ...
CHRISTIE : And no , Dick Cheney did not say that the president`s a traitor and he did not say it`s treasonous .
MATTHEWS : But I`m asking you , is he guilty of giving aid and comfort to the enemy ?
CHRISTIE : Yes .
By bringing these folks in here , yes .
MATTHEWS : And the Constitution defines that as treason .
CHRISTIE : Chris , you`re trying to mince words here ...
MATTHEWS : I`m asking !
I`m not mincing words .
Here it is .
CHRISTIE : The Constitution of the United States is one thing .
The vice president did not say ...
MATTHEWS : OK , so he doesn`t ...
( CROSSTALK )
MATTHEWS : He`s not using constitutional language , you`re saying .
CHRISTIE : No .
The vice president said that it`s giving aid and comfort to the enemy .
He didn`t say , I`m defining that ...
MATTHEWS : OK , so in other words ...
( CROSSTALK )
MATTHEWS : OK , so he`s not using constitutional language .
CHRISTIE : The vice president ...
MATTHEWS : Just say it .
CHRISTIE : Chris , you can use words ...
MATTHEWS : I`m asking !
CHRISTIE :
You can use words strung together and say , Are they constitutional language ...
MATTHEWS : I didn`t string them together !
CHRISTIE : ... or not .
The vice president said ...
MATTHEWS : I think it`ll give aid and comfort to the enemy , the vice president ...
CHRISTIE : That`s exactly right .
MATTHEWS : You want to play it again ?
CHRISTIE : We can play it again .
MATTHEWS :
And you have no problem with that ...
( CROSSTALK )
MATTHEWS : OK , let`s go on ...
CHRISTIE : I don`t have a problem with that .
MATTHEWS : ... to some of the other language .
The president -- the vice president , again on " Hannity " last night , said -- let me get this ( INAUDIBLE )
" When you have a " -- well , let`s look at this .
This is about American exceptionalism .
Let`s listen to that bite , American exceptionalism last night .
Well , here`s what he said .
Cheney last night said , " When you have a president who goes around and bows to his host " -- he`s talking about Japan , obviously -- " and then proceeds to apologize profusely for the United States , I find that deeply disturbing .
And that says to me this is a guy who doesn`t fully understand or share that view of American exceptionalism that I think most of us believe in . "
And you don`t think he believes in America as an exceptional country ?
CHRISTIE : I wonder ...
MATTHEWS : Vice president ( INAUDIBLE )
CHRISTIE : I wonder why the president of the United States would go over bow and put himself in front of other leaders and why he would go out and say things like , America has been arrogant .
He`s the president of the United States ...
MATTHEWS : We can argue about whether ...
CHRISTIE : He speaks for all ...
MATTHEWS : ... he should have bowed or not .
I`ve gone after that .
But are you saying , A , he gives aid and comfort to the enemy , and he doesn`t believe America as an exceptional place ?
CHRISTIE : I think he ...
MATTHEWS : You think he doesn`t believe that ?
CHRISTIE : I think he`s giving aid and comfort -- this is the fourth time I`ll say it .
I believe ...
MATTHEWS : OK , do you believe he doesn`t believe in American exceptionalism , as a special place ?
CHRISTIE : I hope he does , though none of his public statements have given me reason to believe that he does .
MATTHEWS : Well , let`s take a look .
Here`s President Barack Obama .
You say he does .
CHRISTIE : I say he does what ?
MATTHEWS :
He does believe this is a special country .
CHRISTIE : I hope he does .
He`s the president of the United States .
MATTHEWS : Well , why is the vice president -- former vice president saying he doesn`t ?
Ron , you get in here .
I`ve never -- these charges are so essential .
It `s almost like the birther crowd .
It`s so essentially when you say the guy gives aid and comfort to the enemy and really he doesn`t share his love of country that we have here .
I mean , when you go after those essential things -- you`re not arguing with him whether he should bow to a Japanese emperor .
Now , I don`t think he should have bowed or not .
I have a problem with the trial in New York .
But these personal attacks on the president of the United States get to the question of his legitimacy .
To say he doesn`t -- he`s giving aid and comfort to the enemy -- well , he shouldn`t be president if he does that .
Number two ...
REAGAN : I agree .
MATTHEWS : ... if he`s an American -- if he doesn`t believe in American exceptionalism , how the hell did he ever get elected ?
Your thoughts , Ron .
REAGAN : Look , I think -- I think we`re seeing the way the right likes to and then Dick Cheney perhaps likes to have it both ways .
I mean , aid and comfort to the enemy , but I`m not calling him a traitor , I`m just using language that our Constitution defines as traitorous , " aid and comfort to the enemy . "
Exceptionalism ?
Dick Cheney`s sense of the exceptionalism of the United States seems to be that when we feel like it , we can violate our domestic laws and international laws , as well , by , for instance , torturing people , which is a war crime .
You want to call this thing a war on terror ?
Fine .
That makes Dick Cheney and many of his friends in the Bush administration war criminals because they condoned and promoted torture , which is a war crime .
So see you in The Hague , Dick Cheney .
CHRISTIE : Well , of course , you know that the United States did not condone torture .
It`s against the law ...
REAGAN : Yes , it does .
CHRISTIE : ... to torture people .
REAGAN : Well , he did it anyway , then , Ron. Ron , we did that .
CHRISTIE : We did not ...
REAGAN : We tortured people .
CHRISTIE : We did not torture people !
And I ...
REAGAN : Really ?
Would you call waterboarding torture , Ron ?
CHRISTIE : Waterboarding was defined , again , as not being torture .
But it goes ...
REAGAN : Defined by whom ?
Defined by whom , Ron ?
CHRISTIE : We`ve already gone through this with congressional hearings .
We`ve gone through the legality ...
REAGAN : Oh , Ron ...
( CROSSTALK )
REAGAN : Yes , we don`t want to talk about it anymore , do we .
CHRISTIE : Oh !
Oh , we do want to talk about it and ...
REAGAN : Oh , I`d be happy to .
CHRISTIE : ... I think the United States did the proper thing .
The thing I would say to you is ...
REAGAN : Well , I don`t .
CHRISTIE : Your father -- your father would never have gone overseas ...
MATTHEWS : OK ...
CHRISTIE : ... and he would never have bowed to foreign leaders .
He always talked about America being a great place ...
REAGAN : Oh , stop with the bowing business !
He was being polite to an elderly Japanese gentleman .
( CROSSTALK )
REAGAN : This bowing stuff ...
CHRISTIE : Ronald Reagan ...
REAGAN : ... is such nose - blowing nonsense , Ron Christie !
CHRISTIE : Ronald Reagan always ...
MATTHEWS : OK ...
CHRISTIE : Ronald Reagan always ...
MATTHEWS : Let`s get back to ...
CHRISTIE : ... spoke of America`s promise .
MATTHEWS : OK ...
CHRISTIE : Barack Obama never does that .
( CROSSTALK )
REAGAN : Ronald Reagan didn`t approve of torture and signed an international covenant preventing torture , prohibiting torture for the United States ...
CHRISTIE : And Ronald Reagan ...
REAGAN : So don`t bring up my father`s name in the realm of torture Mr. Christie !
CHRISTIE : I`m bringing up your father`s name , Mr. Reagan , in the sense that Ronald Reagan stood for America .
He knew what America`s promise was .
He protected the American people .
MATTHEWS : OK , OK ...
( CROSSTALK )
REAGAN : Thank you for the boilerplate , Mr. Christie .
Thank you for the boilerplate .
MATTHEWS : OK , let me -- let me ...
( CROSSTALK )
MATTHEWS : Let me go to something we can look at a tape of , gentlemen .
And this gets to this charge by Dick Cheney .
He`s attacked the president aiding and comforting the enemy last night on FOX .
And then he went further and said he doesn`t share his -- our love of country , which I think everybody here shares , and certainly , I think the vice president does , too .
But here he is attacking him as some sort of outsider who`s not one of us .
He says he doesn`t share our view of American exceptionalism , and I think he means something pretty deep in this shot .
And here`s the president of the United States speaking about his view of this country at the 2004 Democratic convention , when I first noticed this guy .
Here it is .
Let`s listen .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BARACK OBAMA ( D - IL ) , SENATORIAL CANDIDATE :
Through hard work and perseverance , my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place , America , that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before .
I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story , that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me , and that in no other country on earth , is my story even possible .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
CHRISTIE : That was an exceptional speech .
MATTHEWS : And what`s he talking about ?
CHRISTIE : That`s an exceptional speech .
We`re talking about a man who was elected president of the United States , who could go around the world and go around this country and talk about the greatness of this country , that our greatest days are still before us , as opposed to going abroad and saying that America is arrogant , bowing before foreign leaders and being apologetic to this country .
What happened to that Barack Obama , Chris ?
MATTHEWS : Let me just say that to accuse the man who made those words and inspired so many of us with those words -- and it was when I heard him say that , I said , This is going to be the first African - American president , because I`ve never heard anybody speak so beautifully about this country .
And to have the vice president of the United States to go on FOX television last night , to use that organ to go out and blast this guy as a man who gives aid and comfort to the enemy , which is constitutional language for treason -- whether you agree or not , it`s in the Constitution , Article 3 , Section 3 .
That is what it means .
And then to go on and say he doesn`t share our love of the exceptional nature of this country , when we have heard him say it from the time we first met this guy -- and you -- I don`t believe you`re this loyal to Dick Cheney that you can defend his language .
Aid and comfort to the enemy -- you`ve done it four times .
I won`t ask you to do it again .
And to say that you don`t think that this president shares a notion that this country is special , is exceptional in the world ?
CHRISTIE : No , I said I think he believes it , Chris , but we need to hear it from him .
MATTHEWS : Oh , OK .
CHRISTIE : We need to hear from him .
Obviously , I think he is patriotic .
Obviously , he ran to become a leader of this country ...
MATTHEWS : Well , would Dick Cheney say that ...
CHRISTIE : No , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait !
Let me -- let me finish my point here .
The point is Ronald Reagan , George Bush , Bill Clinton always talked about the greatness of this country .
We want to -- we need to ...
MATTHEWS : OK , here`s some more Cheney ...
CHRISTIE : ... this from Barack Obama .
MATTHEWS : Ron Reagan , hold on .
Here`s some more Cheney .
I think we have this bit here .
This is Cheney on Obama again last night , about him being a radical .
Let`s take a listen to this .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
CHENEY : I saw him when he got elected as a liberal Democrat but conventional in the sense of sort of falling within the parameters of the national Democratic Party .
I think he`s demonstrated pretty conclusively in his first year in office that he`s -- he`s more radical , farther outside the parameters , if you will , of what we`ve traditionally had in Democratic presidents in years past .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MATTHEWS : He`s a traitor .
He`s radical .
And he -- never mind .
I can`t ( INAUDIBLE ) that !
Your thoughts , Ron Reagan ?
REAGAN : He`s a radical traitor , I guess .
He`s such a radical traitor , in fact , that he kept on Robert Gates , George Bush`s , Dick Cheney`s secretary of Defense .
He such a radical traitor that he renominated Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve , who , of course , George Bush and Dick Cheney also wanted as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
Yes , he`s such a radical traitor , that Barack Obama .
And how much do we have to hear about him about his views about America and what a beautiful and exceptional country this is ?
We`ve heard lots from him about that .
So the idea that we haven`t is just absurd .
MATTHEWS : Ron Christie ?
CHRISTIE : Chris Matthews , I think that I agree with president -- with Vice President Cheney`s comments .
I think that it is very clear to me that this is the most left - wing radical administration that we`ve seen in American history .
They spent $ 787 billion in a stimulus bill that didn`t work .
They`re trying to ram through a health care bill that will be one sixth of the U.S. economy without recognizing the consequences .
I absolutely believe -- if you`re going to ask me , is that a radical vision , yes , it is .
MATTHEWS : Well , I`m not much of a radical and I think all this stuff`s great .
Anyway , thank you , Ron Reagan , especially Ron Reagan , and Ron Christie .
I have never met -- by the way , merry Christmas .
And if you don`t get Christmas cards and invitations from Dick Cheney to every party he`s shaving , you`ve hooked your cart to the wrong horse .
( LAUGHTER )
MATTHEWS : Coming up -- so what`s the deal -- by the way , best to your whole family , Ron .
Thank you .
CHRISTIE : Thank you .
Sans annoncer de franc répit , la France connaîtra en effet " encore du chômage en 2010 " , mais selon Christine Lagarde , l'économie devrait cesser de détruire des emplois à partir de la deuxième partie de l'année .
" On vient de subir un choc économique considérable avec des destructions de valeur , avec des fermetures d'entreprises , des destructions d'emplois , on va encore subir les contrecoups de cette crise majeure " , a déclaré mardi la ministre de l'économie et de l'emploi sur France 2 .
La ministre , qui a tablé sur " au moins 1 % " de croissance en 2010 , a cependant jugé que " la deuxième partie de 2010 devrait être le moment du reflux , le moment où le redémarrage de la croissance va permettre un étiage , c'est - à- dire que l'économie cessera de détruire des emplois " .
Convaincue que le chômage " va décroître " d'autant qu'" on a commencé à avoir une diminution du volume de chômage " , Mme Lagarde a ajouté qu'" il faut continuer " à lutter avec " toute une batterie d'outils , qu'il s'agisse du chômage partiel , des contrats de transition professionnelle , des conventions de reclassement " personnalisé , mais aussi à être " au chevet de chaque entreprise " .
L'Insee prévoit 9,8 % de chômage en France métropolitaine et 10,2 % avec les départements d'outre - mer à la mi-2010 " parce que les pertes d'emplois continueraient sur un rythme modéré et que la population active augmenterait moins fortement que sur le passé " .
Vu la faible croissance attendue , " la hausse du taux de chômage pourrait bien ne pas s'achever avant le début de 2011 " , selon l'Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques .

In marketing - speak , " Build / Design your own ... " usually means " Choose from a series of pre-configured options , " as in Build Your Own Sundae or Design Your Own Sneakers .
So it goes with a company called Trexa , except their material is n't ice cream or shoe leather ; it 's electric car parts .
Trexa 's lithium - powered , all - wheel - drive vehicle development platform is intended to " [ enable ] specialty vehicle developers to design and build custom ' vehicle apps ' " by dialing in the terrain type and ride height , and scaling the wheelbase .
Conceivably this means you could build everything from an off - road Smart Car ( not that you 'd want to ) to a stretch limousine .
Trexa 's battery systems are also scalable and modular ; presumably you 'd simply add more for more power .
They 're even working on docking systems for interchangeable bodies and remote =controlled vehicles .

Every year , at least two versions of Ubuntu are released in six - month lockstep .
This year gave us Keir Thomas ' peek at the 9.04 " Jaunty Jackalope " release , and our own screenshot tour .
That release was more about subtle changes and improvements .
Ubuntu 9.10 , Karmic Koala , brought a whole new look to the free OS , along with some major decisions on default applications and immediate improvements like faster , slicker boot - ups and a universal software store .
We are , as ever , eager to see what crops up in April .

GNOME Do and Docky Are Slick Linux Interfaces

We dig GNOME Do as a Quicksilver - like application launcher that knows your system better than you do .
When it rolled in a dock interface , it got a bit more unstable , but even more helpful — and notably more smooth and eye - pleasing than the standard GNOME interface .
The two projects have since gone their separate ways , but , installed side by side , they still make for a better Linux experience .

Well , we thought Presto looked like a pretty neat quick - boot alternative for Windows users , at least while it was free , and promising boot - ups in mere seconds .

Since you 've made it this far , let 's go ahead and put it up for vote :
A speech about Internet freedom that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to deliver early Thursday could add fuel to the simmering controversy over Google 's threat to pull out of China .
Alec Ross , Clinton 's senior adviser for innovation , said in an interview that Clinton will propose " new policies and programs " to encourage online freedom worldwide .
Clinton 's speech is set for 9:30 a.m. Eastern at the Newseum in Washington , D.C. , and will be streamed live .
She is expected to lay out the Obama Administration 's strategy for protecting basic freedoms in the Internet age .
Clinton 's proposals will address the fact that 31 % of the world 's population live in countries where there is Internet censorship , including China , says Ross .
Clinton 's speech has been scheduled for some time .
But it happens to come 10 days after Google said it " may well " leave China because of censorship and cyberattacks carried out to steal company secrets .
Google advised the State Department staff about its complaint , and Clinton last week issued a statement saying Google has raised " very serious concerns . "
Then on Monday , the Foreign Correspondents Club of China warned its members that reporters in a few bureaus in Beijing recently discovered that cyberintruders had gained control of their Gmail accounts .

The first big impact of the Supreme Courts decision lifting restrictions on certain corporation campaign spending may be at the American Civil Liberties Union , which , after years of opposing restrictions on free speech grounds , is considering whether to reverse course and endorse government limits on money in politics .
The ACLU has long opposed government limits to how much a donor can give to a political campaign or spend airing advertisements on an issue during an election .
On this point , the ACLU has been in agreement with conservative organizations that believe money contributions are a form of political speech and deserving of First Amendment protection .
It has been at odds with many liberal organizations , which have argued money in politics must be strictly limited so that rich organizations and individuals do n't wield outsize influence .
But Thursdays Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission , which would enable corporations to spend freely on political causes , is forcing the ACLU to address what one internal memo describes as a " Skokie moment , " a reference to the controversy in which the organization defended the right of American Nazis to march in the Chicago suburb of Skokie .
The moment is often seen as one of the acid tests of the ACLUs willingness to stick to its First Amendment principles .
The First Amendment , opening article of the Bill of Rights , says that Congress  shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press . . .
It was cited in Thursdays Supreme Courts decision , which was is in accord with the ACLUs traditional position that the government should keep out of regulating money in politics .
The organization had filed a brief in support of the winning side in the case .
But concern that the Supreme Court ruling will fundamentally alter American democracy has ignited within the union an intense debate that was aired on Saturday at the regular quarterly meeting of the 83 - member board of directors and in interviews with this reporter .
The board on Sunday sent the issue to its special committee on campaign finance to mull the impact of Citizens United .
 The ACLU 's version of democracy is from the ground - up ,  one civil rights lawyer , David Gans , on Saturday told the ACLU 's board , which was assembled downtown at One New York Plaza .
 Now Exxon Mobil can spend 2 % of its money and blow that all up . 
Mr. Gans was one of several attorneys invited to the board meeting to debate whether the ACLU should change its position on money in politics .
Another , Burt Neuborne , also urged the ACLU to change its policy , saying that any effort to salvage campaign finance regulation in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling would face trouble if the ACLU says its against the First Amendment . 
But a contrary view was expressed by another one of the invited attorneys , Floyd Abrams , who was one of the lawyers for the victorious side in Citizens United and who yesterday urged the ACLU not to change its position .
Mr. Abrams warned that the organization would be allowing its political sensibilities to get the best of its principles .
 The worst thing you could do  the absolutely worst thing you could do  is transform a civil liberties organization into a liberal political organization ,  Mr. Abrams , one of the most famous First Amendment laywers in the country , told the board .
Mr. Abrams pointed out that the ACLU had itself filed a brief in the Citizens United case on behalf of the side that ultimately won .
 There will be some people who think you re a little fickle for changing your policy three days after one of the greatest victories in this organization ,  Mr. Abrams said .
Debate on the question of money and politics has been percolating within the ACLU for years , long before the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Citizens United .
 It is difficult to think of an issue that has generated more internal controversy ,  an internal ACLU memo states .
In May 2009 an ACLU committee on campaign finance proposed reversing that position in favor of support for a reasonable , carefully designed system of limitations on campaign contributions ,  according to an internal memo .
Dissenters on the campaign finance committee submitted a report warning that the ACLU was about to redefine our organization .
It was that memo which stated the ACLU is facing a Skokie moment .
The decision to stick with its principles on Skokie , which led to a dramatic loss of membership within the ACLU at the time , is now a source of pride within the organization .

The blog of online pharmacy AccessRx notes that Pfizer has also been extracting more frequent price rises in addition to higher price rises :
… we ’re not sure if you ’ve been tracking price increases recently , but Pfizer began to raise the cost of Viagra twice a year instead of once a year in 2007 .
Including the last six price increases since Jan. 1 , 2007 , the price of Viagra has gone up 45.5 % .
The WAC list indicates that while Pfizer was initially content to take price increases of 3 percent per year , in 2003 it doubled that increase .
In January 2009 , Pfizer bumped it up to 11 percent .
Then in August it took another 5 percent .
It ’s an astonishing example of pricing power , given that Viagra is in direct competition with Eli Lilly ’s Cialis and Bayer ’s Levitra .
The heat from Cialis is particularly severe : Cialis sales in the U.S. were up 16 percent to $ 149.4 million in Q2 ; Pfizer ’s Viagra was up only 4 percent at $ 207 million .
( Los Angeles , January 15 , 2010 ) -
The announcement today by city leaders that new crime lab positions approved in this year 's budget will not be funded makes it impossible for the Los Angeles Police Department to eliminate its backlog of untested DNA in rape cases , Human Rights Watch said today .
The 26 new crime lab positions were approved by City Council in May 2009 , despite a near hiring freeze , at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department ( LAPD ) .
The police maintained that the positions were necessary to address a backlog of 7,000 untested sets of physical evidence in rape cases , known as rape kits , and to develop a long - term solution for efficient and effective rape kit testing .
For the first time since the positions were approved , the city acknowledged today that the positions have not been funded and will not be filled .
" This announcement undermines public trust in the city 's commitment to eliminate the rape kit backlog and bring real justice to rape victims , " said Sarah Tofte , US Program researcher at Human Rights Watch and author of a March 2009 report on the rape kit backlog in Los Angeles .
" The city , through the budget process , promised to hire the crime lab personnel needed to test in a timely way every booked rape kit and to upload the test results into the DNA database .
The city has broken its promise . "
DNA technology is one of law enforcement 's most powerful forensic tools .
It can provide a match with an unknown suspect , confirm the identity of a known suspect , affirm the details of a victim 's report , and exonerate innocent suspects .
Timely testing of rape kits can be critical to bringing justice to sexual assault victims .
Rape cases are often difficult to solve or prosecute effectively without this forensic evidence .
National studies have shown that cases in which a rape kit is collected , tested , and contains DNA evidence are more likely to move forward in the criminal justice system .
The LAPD has made substantial progress in using outside labs to test the majority of backlogged rape kits , but outsourcing alone will not solve the problem .
By federal law , public crime lab personnel must review the test results of privately outsourced kits before the test results can be entered into the public DNA database .
Outsourced rape kits wait an average of 72 days after testing before they are reviewed by crime lab personnel .
Without additional crime lab personnel the police cannot review the outsourced kits within a reasonable time , creating a growing secondary backlog of kits for which testing is not complete .
Until testing is complete , the results are uploaded to the public DNA database , and DNA matches investigated , justice will continue to elude rape victims .
Los Angeles City Council President Eric Garcetti introduced a motion today to redirect some of the funds already lost due to the delay in hiring the crime lab personnel to outsourcing testing of rape kits to private crime labs .
Human Rights
Watch urges the city to reinstate approval for the additional personnel and to allocate the remainder of those funds to the LAPD , which should in turn hire those personnel immediately .
Last spring , the City Council made a commitment to provide regular oversight over the way the new funding for elimination of the rape kit backlog was spent and the actual progress made .
The loss of funding for these crime lab positions is due in part to their failure to provide such oversight .
Human Rights
Watch urges the City Council to renew its commitment to oversight in order to regain the public 's trust .
" Merely outsourcing the rape kits does not provide justice for past , present , and future rape victims , " Tofte said .
" This is a huge blow to policymakers , advocates , rape victims , and law enforcement across the country who hoped that Los Angeles would be a national model for other jurisdictions tackling their rape kit backlogs .
Los Angeles is instead showing others what not to do . "
( Natural News ) Regular soda consumption significantly increases a person 's risk of obesity , according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of California - Los Angeles ( UCLA ) .
" We drink soda like water , " said Harold Goldstein of the Center for Public Health Advocacy , which also took part in the study .
" But unlike water , soda serves up a whopping 17 teaspoons of sugar in every 20 - ounce serving .
" Researchers interviewed 40,000 adults on their beverage consumption habits , finding that adults who drank one sugary beverage per day were 27 percent more likely to be classified as overweight than those who drank sugary beverages less frequently .
Drinking one soda per day involves the consumption of 39 pounds of sugar per year .
According to the , 15.5 percent of adults , 56 percent of teenagers , and 41 percent of children under the age of 12 in Santa Cruz County , Calif. , consume one soda per day .
The figures on children 's consumption were obtained from their parents .
An estimated 64 percent of adults in the city of Pajaro Valley are overweight or obese .
The Pajaro Valley Unified School District says that 39 percent of its seventh graders are already overweight or at risk of being overweight .
Health advocates are acting on levels from the local to national to limit the damage done by soda and other sugary beverages .
Many schools have banned sugary drinks from their campuses , but Watsonville High School Principal Murry Schekman admits that it is easy for students to get around this restriction by purchasing the beverages off campus .
"
We need to provide a steady stream of information to students and families so they can very much understand the real dangers of sugar - sweetened products , " Schekman said .
On the city , state and national levels , there are also campaigns to impose a tax on soda .
And the federal Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) food assistance program recently banned the use of its funds to purchase juice for infants .
" By feeding infants breastmilk and water only , there is less opportunity to develop an early taste for sweetened beverages , " said WIC's Santa Cruz County program director , Cathy Cavanaugh .

Mérida , December 9th 2009 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – Following the government ’s nationalisation of two banks and liquidation of two others for banking law infractions , three bank executives fled to the U.S. , and the government intervened in food companies owned by currently detained bank owner , Ricardo Fernandez .
Interior Relations Minister Tareck El Aissami announced on Tuesday that two Venezuelans implicated in the bank scandals flew to Atlanta , and one to Miami , and that a fourth person was captured while trying to board a plane to Miami .
The Public Prosecutor had already issued ten arrest warrants for banking executives and 19 prohibitions on leaving the country for involvement in organised crime and for banking law infractions .
This followed the nationalisation of two banks , Confederado and Bolivar Bank , and the liquidation of two others , Banpro and Canarias , last week .
On Monday , the Institute in Defence of People ’s Access to Goods and Services ( Indepabis ) , along with the national guard , intervened in and inspected four food companies : Pronutricos , Proarepa , Fextun , and Venarroz .
The companies are owned by Ricardo Fernandez , who also owns the four banks , and who was detained two weeks ago .
Fernandez is known as the “ Tsar of Mercal ” , as some of his companies , including Pronutricos and Proarepa , supply the government ’s subsidised food markets .
The minister for commerce , Eduardo Saman , said the government is observing Fernandez ’s companies to make sure there are no supply disruptions following the nationalisation of the banks .
“ We ca n’t allow these companies to come to a standstill ; they are companies of essential food products .
We ’re going to intervene wherever there is a risk or a company standstill , then apply measures , pay the workers , make the companies function , and we ’ll sell the product in [ the government subsidised markets ] , ” Saman said .
The general secretary of the Pronutricos workers union , Wilmer Leon , said the management of that company disappeared as soon as the government intervened in the banks , and the 800 workers have gone two weeks without pay .
On 3 December Indepabis temporarily occupied Venarroz , a rice packaging plant in Guarico state , which had been paralysed for the last four months .
According to ABN , workers have now taken over the company and made it 100 % operative .
Workers at the plant said they had n’t been paid for a month and that the owners had been taking parts of the machinery little by little to devalue the plant and impede its functioning .
“ We are committed to production going ahead , because the extent to which Venarroz thrives is the extent to which the workers will have stability , ” said the maintenance supervisor at the plant , Reinaldo Hidarza .
Indepabis coordinator in Guarico , Orlando Chacin , said the plant could now guarantee 11 million kilos of rice per quarter , which it will sell to the government subsidised food market , Mercal , and regulated - price food distributor , Pdval .
“ Today is a day of celebration for the workers because they showed that they do n’t need a capitalist manager to advance in the production of food , ” Chacin said .
On Sunday , the mayor of Guante in Anzoategui state , Jonathan Marin , took over Fernandez ’s tuna factory , Fextun .
Marin said the company had n’t been functioning for seven years , and that the act of recuperating the factory was to help dignify the population of Guante .
Marin also said the machinery would become part of a social production company , and would generate 1,200 jobs , 80 % of which would be for women .
In another measure to combat banking fraud , on Saturday , police arrested Arne Chacon , bank president and brother of the minister for science and technology , Jesse Chacon , for his alleged involvement in financial crimes .
Jesse Chacon has since resigned in order to guarantee transparency .

Retailers hoping for strong sales after a rebound in the stock market and housing are out of luck according to the latest Gallup Poll on shopping habits .
Please consider Upper - Income Spending Reverts to New Normal
In a sign that the new normal in consumer spending continues unabated , upper - income Americans ' self - reported average daily spending in stores , restaurants , gas stations , and online fell 14 % in November , reverting to its relatively tight ( $ 107 to $ 121 ) pre-October 2009 average monthly range .
Middle - and lower - income consumer discretionary spending increased by 7 % last month but remained in its tight 2009 average monthly range of $ 52 to $ 61 .
Still , consumer spending by both income groups continues to trail year - ago levels by 20 % , even as those comparables have gotten easier to match -- possibly dashing hopes that upscale retailers and big - ticket - item sales will do better this year .
Spending By Income Level
Spending vs. Year Ago
The hope was that the surge on Wall Street and the seeming stabilization of housing values had encouraged some upper - income consumers to abandon the 2009 spending new normal .
November 's results dashed these hopes , as upper - income consumers joined their middle - and lower - income counterparts in spending 20 % less than they had during the financial crisis days of 2008 and returning to the relatively tight 2009 daily spending range for this group prior to October .
Spending New Normal
The year - over - year differences have declined somewhat during recent months , but much of this closure in the 2008 - 2009 spending gap is a result of the easier spending comparables from last year 's financial crisis .
On a national level , the spending new normal suggests slower economic growth than otherwise might be expected in the years ahead .
While the spending " new normal " may not be good for the larger economy in the short - term , it may be seen as a strong positive for individual consumer households .
Consumers , like their business and banking counterparts , would be well - served to de-leverage by spending less , saving more , reducing their use of credit , and thereby strengthening their personal balance sheets .
While this may not provide the immediate - term returns to the economy of the over - leveraging of recent years , a financially stronger U.S. consumer implies only good things for the longer - term well being of both the U.S. and global economies .
Stores Face Dilemma
Who will blink first : retailers or shoppers ?
Chain - stores are holding bigger markdowns in reserve trying to gauge how long shoppers will wait for better deals to emerge .
The standoff , which experts say could be decided in favor of shoppers as soon as this weekend , could help determine whether or not this holiday season marks the second year in a row of sales declines .
Nine of 10 people waiting to finish their holiday shopping are doing so to get discounts of at least 50 % , according to a survey released Thursday by UBS and market researcher America 's Research Group Ltd .
A third of respondents said they are holding out for a 70 % discount .
" If we do n't have to do it , believe me , we 're not going to do it , " said Kay Krill , chief executive of women 's clothing chain AnnTaylor Stores Corp .
Its Ann Taylor and its
Loft outlets have discount banners " ready to go " should consumers need an incentive to shop , she said .
The first week of December , typically a lackluster time in the wake of Black Friday , was particularly slow .
Sales for the week ended Dec. 5 fell 18 % from the prior - week period , which included Black Friday , according to market researcher ShopperTrak RCT Corp .
Last year , when the recession was in full force , sales fell a lesser 14 % , according to the firm , which compiles shopping traffic at malls and uses sales statistics , as well as Commerce Department figures , for its estimate .
" After solid traffic the first couple of days , it looks like the middle of August out there , " said Stephen Baker , vice president of industry analysis for retail watcher NPD Group .

While a GPS - style " navigation system " for surgeons may not seem like the best idea to anyone that 's ever been led astray by their dash - mounted co-pilot , it apparently seemed like a good enough idea for a group of researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands .
While they do stretch the metaphor a bit , the group 's TLEMsafe system does provide surgeons with a complete 3D map of the lower body , which can actually be personalized for each individual patient , giving surgeons a reference and means to practice before any actual surgery takes place -- and , yes , even an " automated navigation system " during surgery .
Coincidentally , some researchers from the University of Colorado have also just announced that they 've developed a similar modeling system that would give surgeons 3D views of arteries and let them see any blockages up close .

Even though the U.S. financial system nearly experienced a total meltdown in late 2008 , the truth is that most Americans simply have no idea what is happening to the U.S. economy .
Most people seem to think that the nasty little recession that we have just been through is almost over and that we will be experiencing another time of economic growth and prosperity very shortly .
But this time around that is not the case .
The reality is that we are being sucked into an economic black hole from which the U.S. economy will never fully recover .
The problem is debt .
Collectively , the U.S. government , the state governments , corporate America and American consumers have accumulated the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world .
Our massive debt binge has financed our tremendous growth and prosperity over the last couple of decades , but now the day of reckoning is here .
And it is going to be painful .
The following are 20 reasons why the U.S. economy is dying and is simply not going to recover ….
#1) Do you remember that massive wave of subprime mortgages that defaulted in 2007 and 2008 and caused the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression ?
Well , the “ second wave ” of mortgage defaults in on the way and there is simply no way that we are going to be able to avoid it .
A huge mountain of mortgages is going to reset starting in 2010 , and once those mortgage payments go up there are once again going to be millons of people who simply cannot pay their mortgages .
The chart below reveals just how bad the second wave of adjustable rate mortgages is likely to be over the next several years … .
#2) The Federal Housing Administration has announced plans to increase the amount of up - front cash paid by new borrowers and to require higher down payments from those with the poorest credit .
The Federal Housing Administration currently backs about 30 percent of all new home loans and about 20 percent of all new home refinancing loans .
Tighter standards are going to mean that less people will qualify for loans .
Less qualifiers means that there will be less buyers for homes .
Less buyers means that home prices are going to drop even more .
#3) It is getting really hard to find a job in the United States .
A total of 6,130,000 U.S. workers had been unemployed for 27 weeks or more in December 2009 .
That was the most ever since the U.S. government started keeping track of this statistic in 1948 .
In fact , it is more than double the 2,612,000 U.S. workers who were unemployed for a similar length of time in December 2008 .
The reality is that once Americans lose their jobs they are increasingly finding it difficult to find new ones .
#4 ) In December , there were also 929,000 “ discouraged ” workers who are not counted as part of the labor force because they have “ given up ” looking for work .
That is the most since the U.S. government first started keeping track of discouraged workers in 1949 .
Many Americans have simply given up and are now chronically unemployed .
#5) Some areas of the U.S. are already virtually in a state of depression .
The mayor of Detroit estimates that the real unemployment rate in his city is now somewhere around 50 percent .
#6) For decades , our leaders in Washington pushed us towards “ a global economy ” and told us it would be so good for us .
But there is a flip side .
Now workers in the U.S. must compete with workers all over the world , and our greedy corporations are free to pursue the cheapest labor available anywhere on the globe .
Millions of jobs have already been shipped out of the United States , and Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder estimates that 22 % to 29 % of all current U.S. jobs will be offshorable within two decades .
The days when blue collar workers could live the American Dream are gone and they are not going to come back .
# 7 ) During the 2001 recession , the U.S. economy lost 2 % of its jobs and it took four years to get them back .
This time around the U.S. economy has lost more than 5 % of its jobs and there is no sign that the bleeding of jobs is going to stop any time soon .
#8) All of this unemployment is putting severe stress on state unemployment funds .
At this point , 25 state unemployment insurance funds have gone broke and the Department of Labor estimates that 15 more state unemployment funds will likely go broke within two years and will need massive loans from the federal government just to keep going .
# 9 ) 37 million Americans now receive food stamps , and the program is expanding at a pace of about 20,000 people a day .
The United States of America is very quickly becoming a socialist welfare state .
# 10 ) The number of Americans who are going broke is staggering .
1.41 million Americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009 – a 32 percent increase over 2008 .
# 11 ) For decades , the fact that the U.S. dollar was the reserve currency of the world gave the U.S. financial system an unusual degree of stability .
But all of that is changing .
Foreign countries are increasingly turning away from the dollar to other currencies .
For example , Russia ’s central bank announced on Wednesday that it had started buying Canadian dollars in a bid to diversify its foreign exchange reserves .
# 12 ) The recent economic downturn has left some localities totally bankrupt .
For instance , Jefferson County , Alabama is on the brink of what would be the largest government bankruptcy in the history of the United States – surpassing the 1994 filing by Southern California ’s Orange County .
# 13 ) The U.S. is facing a pension crisis of unprecedented magnitude .
Virtually all pension funds in the United States , both private and public , are massively underfunded .
With millions of Baby Boomers getting ready to retire , there is simply no way on earth that all of these obligations can be met .
Robert Novy - Marx of the University of Chicago and Joshua D. Rauh of Northwestern ’s Kellogg School of Management recently calculated the collective unfunded pension liability for all 50 U.S. states for Forbes magazine .
So what was the total ?
3.2 trillion dollars .
# 14 ) Social Security and Medicare expenses are wildly out of control .
Once again , with millions of Baby Boomers now at retirement age there is simply going to be no way to pay all of these retirees what they are owed .
# 15 ) So will the U.S. government come to the rescue ?
The U.S. has allowed the total federal debt to balloon by 50 % since 2006 to $ 12.3 trillion .
The chart below is a bit outdated , but it does show the reckless expansion of U.S. government debt over the past several decades .
To get an idea of where we are now , just add at least 3 trillion dollars on to the top of the chart … .
# 16 ) So has the U.S. government learned anything from these mistakes ?
No .
In fact , Senate Democrats on Wednesday proposed allowing the federal government to borrow an additional $ 2 trillion to pay its bills , a record increase that would allow the U.S. national debt to reach approximately $ 14.3 trillion .
# 17 ) It is going to become even harder for the U.S. government to pay the bills now that tax receipts are falling through the floor .
U.S. corporate income tax receipts were down 55 % in the year that ended on September 30th , 2009 .
# 18 ) So where will the U.S. government get the money ?
From the Federal Reserve of course .
The Federal Reserve bought approximately 80 percent of all U.S. Treasury securities issued in 2009 .
In other words , the U.S. government is now being financed by a massive Ponzi scheme .
# 19 ) The reckless expansion of the money supply by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve is going to end up destroying the U.S. dollar and the value of the remaining collective net worth of all Americans .
The more dollars there are , the less each individual dollar is worth .
In essence , inflation is like a hidden tax on each dollar that you own .
When they flood the economy with money , the value of the money you have in your bank accounts goes down .
The chart below shows the growth of the U.S. money supply .
Pay particular attention to the very end of the chart which shows what has been happening lately .
What do you think this is going to do to the value of the U.S. dollar ?….
# 20 ) When a nation practices evil , there is no way that it is going to be blessed in the long run .
The truth is that we have become a nation that is dripping with corruption and wickedness from the top to the bottom .
Unless this fundamentally changes , not even the most perfect economic policies in the world are going to do us any good .
In the end , you always reap what you sow .
The day of reckoning for the U.S. economy is here and it is not going to be pleasant .
I was born in Owerri and grew up in the east of Nigeria , in Imo state .
You could say I was a " street boy " : we grew up on the street , played on the street , did everything out on the street .
It was a difficult life altogether , but that 's how we grew up .
My dad was a civil servant before he retired and my mum worked , too .
We could not always get three meals in a day ; sometimes we 'd struggle .
But we always had soccer : something that everybody loves .
It pulls the whole country together , something that can bring peace and unity to Nigeria .
When there 's a World Cup or Africa Cup of Nations , every­ body 's into it : young and old , rich and poor .
It 's like a festival going on , everybody wanting the Super Eagles to win .
When you 're growing up , you have your heroes and you hear about people going off to other countries to play football but , when you 're so young , you 're not thinking about that .
You just play .
No referee , no rules .
And when I say we played in the street , I mean in the road , with cars going past .
We would just put things down to make goalposts and play with a rubber ball .
If you were lucky , it might be like a tennis ball ; something perfectly round .
But often the ball would n't be like that .
You would n't know where it was going to bounce .
Maybe that helped us .
Maybe it was using a ball that we could n't figure out where it would bounce next which helped us with our skills and ball control .
We had our own little stretch of street where we always played .
Tetlow Street , people called it .
Other boys knew where it was and would come there too .
You knew everybody and everybody knew you .
We would take a stretch of the street , put posts down at each end and , if a car came , someone would call out and we'd have to stop to let it pass .
Weekends were the best time , especially Sundays , when everybody goes to church so the roads are really quiet .
Sometimes we might have enough players to make three teams so whoever wins stays on for the next one .
And it was always good if you had the ball .
We all wanted to play so , if you had a ball your parents had given you , no one would say anything bad or stop you playing .
If they did , you could pick up your ball and go home !
Sometimes we would go to play on a " field " , usually at a school nearby .
That 's a pitch , but I do n't mean a pitch like at a professional club in Europe .
Those are beautiful : green and flat .
At home , it would be a hard , dry surface .
Every time you fell over , you 'd get cuts and grazes .
But we 'd run around , we 'd play just because we loved the game .
You would n't even feel those scratches .
We were full of energy and we 'd play from morning until night unless our parents shouted at us to come inside .
We 'd forget everything ; forget to eat .
Quick : get a little snack and a drink and then play again !
I did n't have any kind of coaching until I was about 11 .
When you are younger , seven or eight , you just play and whatever skill is inside you can grow .
I played at school , too .
If you have skills from an early age , people notice , they tell you how good you are .
And then , when it comes to games and selecting a team , they pick you first .
That gives you confidence and encouragement , for football and for the rest of your life , too .
It gives you status .
My dad played football – and tennis as well – and so did my brothers .
My dad was chairman of our local club , Spartans , for a while .
But back when I was a boy , people did n't think of football as a career .
Only one or two players , like Stephen Keshi [ former captain of Nigeria , now manager of Mali ] , had gone to Europe to play .
Sometimes boys would get in trouble for football : parents wanted them to read their books and study .
Most Nigerian footballers do n't come from families who have a lot of money .
The poorer families need their children to help out , to go on the street to sell stuff and do their bit to raise money to help and support the family .
So they can't just be playing football all the time .
I go back to Nigeria now and I still see boys playing football in the street just like I used to .
What 's different now is that people have seen what Nigerian players have achieved and , these days , everybody definitely wants to play football .
Kids see what football can do for them : " I want to do what Kanu has done ! "
Parents think , " Football is something my boy can do , something he can do to earn a living . "
You 'll have trials for a local team and 100 boys will be there .
I guess a person like me , now , is a role model .
Nigeria is a big country : 145 million people .
Imagine what it 's like to stand up and everybody knows you .
Kids want to speak to you , find out what makes you tick , how it has happened to you .
It is important that I give something back .
That 's why I wanted to work with Unicef , why I set up my heart foundation .
I have also set up a little academy back in my home state , Imo , so boys can have what they need to be able to play .
At the end of every season in Europe , I gather up all the kit I can and take it home for the boys .
There 's a lot of talent in Nigeria .
Some of it is hidden away , out in villages nobody knows about .
Their families do n't have the money to bring them into the city to be spotted .
My idea is to give kids the chance to train and play and allow their talent to shine through .
I want them to have the chance to show how good they are .
I can still remember the boys I played with when I was little .
There was one , a boy named Uchenna : we called him " Lefty " .
We used to hang out a lot , playing football all the time .
When I go home to Owerri , I still see some of those guys .
And we still play .
Some of them have moved away , some are still there .
But you do n't forget your roots and we get together , eat , drink , hang out .
And , at the weekend , we play football together , for fun .
We go and find a school field and have a game .
And we remember the old days because loving football starts when you are young .
Look at the boys when they play : clothes dirty ; then they 're washed at night before they put them on next day , and get them dirty all over again .
All they 're thinking of is to play football .
They do n't even think about eating .
Football is their food .
MAHAMADOU DIARRA
Real Madrid midfielder
and captain of Mali
My first memory of football is playing in the street when I was eight or nine in Bamako [ Mali 's capital city ] .
There were 18 or 20 of us .
Quite a lot of them have gone on to become professional players .
We set out our own pitch , put stones down a metre apart to make a goal , and played two hours without a break .
The best !
We 'd get an old ball – one that had burst – from an older brother , cut a hole in it and stuff it full with old clothes so we could keep using it .
Those balls were hard , no bounce at all , but playing in the street was easier for us then .
Now there are more children , and the streets are full of cars .
I love being around youngsters .
I go on holiday to Mali , back to the street I grew up on .
The kids there want to laugh with me , play football with me .
And so we play , for five or 10 minutes , but sometimes they do n't want me to go and I find myself in the middle of a game .
I know I have to play with the ball in the air .
If I play on the ground they 'll run between my legs , or kick me in the shins !
I play against five or six of them : it 's funny .
The street 's where I started out and that 's where my heart will be , always .
The friends I first played with will be the same guys I finish with , too , I hope .
We speak all the time , and when I 'm back in Mali we meet up to play .
Nine against nine , 30 minutes each way .
I 'm the captain of Mali but , with my friends , they wo n't let me be captain .
We grew up together and they know better !
We play for a side of beef which I put up instead of a cup .
The winner takes the beef but , whoever wins , we all eat it together .
It 's a party .
How can I ever forget my friends ?

LOS ANGELES 
By now , everyone knows the airport drill , its inconveniences offset by its clarity : take off your shoes , pop your laptop in a tray , have your driver ’s license at the ready .
But in the three days since the attempted terrorist attack on a Detroit - bound airliner , the beleaguered traveler has once again been beset by a confusing and inconsistent set of rules .
Could you keep your blanket , as on Continental , or would it be snatched at the end of the flight , as it was on Lufthansa ?
Would security measures be visibly unchanged , as they were at the Houston airport , or would passengers be surprised by a careful swabbing of their hands and purses , like those in South Carolina ?
Would this week resemble Sunday , when JetBlue ’s entertainment system was shut down on international flights , or Monday , when the movies began flowing on that airline once more ?
“ I just wish they ’d have something , a list of rules , and stick to it , ” said Sherri Hemmer , who made a point of using the bathroom early on her Monday flight from Phoenix to Pittsburgh and was then annoyed to learn that a prohibition against moving around the cabin in the last hour of flight did not seem to apply to her flight .
On radio , I said , " Because it 's hockey . "
Flippant , quick , good for polarizing people either way .
In truth , we have neglected a very good hockey team -- perhaps a Stanley - Cup winning hockey team in five months -- in this town .
Tomorrow on the Mike Wise Show , it 's all Ovie , all the time .
Promise .
Okay , for at least an hour .
- Mike Wise
On Monday afternoon , the Washington Post 's Mike Wise participated in an online chat about the Gilbert Arenas situation , fielding questions about everything from guns to contracts to shoes filled with ... stuff - and this question , from an interested reader : " [ W ] ith the most exciting hockey player in the world and the top notch Capitals in town , far too much attention is spent on the dysfunctional Gil Arenas .
Is it because only bad behavior sells ? "
Wise 's response outlined the " equal " coverage given to Arenas ' good deeds in the past , noting his off court generosity .
All well and good ... until he decided to wrap it up with a flippant but pointed bit of snark , adding " and with all due respect , it 's hockey . "
It was an offhand remark ; a blind stab at edgy humor tossed into the crowd with the simple aim of either garnering a laugh or pissing someone off .
And while it 's doubtful that such a response was planned by Wise , the inherent meaning behind it was troubling .
Over the last few years , Washington has undergone a transformation - following the lead of its exuberant new captain and a cast of equally mesmerizing cohorts , the city has embraced hockey and covered itself in red .
It 's been a rebirth , one that has been chronicled and acknowledged by everyone who comes into contact with it .
Everyone , that is , except for the media whose job it is to cover it .
I 'm not talking about those on the hockey beat .
If anything the hockey folks at the Post , and until recently the Times , have actually stepped up their coverage to meet the rising demand .
We 've been treated to huge full page spreads on the return of hockey to the District after a summer that was far too long , to blog posts on development camp and intersquad scrimmages , to lengthy pieces on lesser - known heroes , the works .
Those assigned to the task have done their job and , for the most part , done it fairly well .
No , the media I 'm referring to is your general , all - sports media , the people whose job it is to report on anything from NFL football to high school lacrosse - and everything that falls in between .
Guys like Mike Wise , Michael Wilbon , and some sportscasters on local news teams .
They break down the news of the day into digestible tidbits and report on things that matter - and yet the fact that the local hockey team is currently tearing it up , and doing so scandal - free , seems to have more or less eluded them somehow .
And with all due respect , it 's hockey : Last time I listen to your show buster .
I used to like you .
Mike Wise : Figures a hockey fan would take everything so personal .
There just remains a general lack of respect for the Capitals and for the sport of hockey itself that goes deep in this town , and it 's puzzling to say the least .
Gone are the days when the Capitals were a team to be mocked , when empty seats yawned up around the ice and the losses piled up at a disturbing pace .
This is now a first rate team , led by a first rate player and providing a first rate piece of entertainment to all who wish to watch - an option 18,277 people elect to take every time the boys are in town .
So why is it that this team is still a punchline to some so - called sports journalists ?
Why is it that names of players on our team are butchered nightly by the people who supposedly cover them ?
Why are comments like " with all due respect , it 's hockey " allowed to be used by people who cover DC sports - and when they 're called out on it , why does it then become an excuse to bash both Caps fans and the sport of hockey ?
" My job is n't to build up the Capitals fan base . " - Mike Wise , The Mike Wise Show
No one 's saying that the Caps should get equal coverage alongside the Redskins .
That 's a losing battle right there , and it's a battle that Mike Wise and friends seem to think we 're fighting .
We 're not .
And no one 's insisting these reporters memorize Dave Steckel 's faceoff percentage this season or know what Varlamov 's GAA was in last year 's playoffs or even particularly like hockey , for that matter .
But in a time when the only bright spot in DC sports is a bunch of guys on skates - you know , the ones who actually win games - to ignore hockey is to turn a blind eye to what 's really newsworthy ; to disrespect and mock it , an affront to legitimate journalism .
Right now there is only one major sport in DC whose local representatives are legitimate contenders .
Right now there is only one major sport whose DC affiliate can claim to be just about scandal - free , save for the occasional goaltending controversy .
Right now there is only one major sport in DC whose season will likely extend well beyond the regular slate of games .
With all due respect , Mike , that sport is hockey .
And as " warped " fans , you 're damn right we take it personally .

A recent report by US magazine Vanity Fair has upset politicians from Chancellor Angela Merkel 's conservative Christian Democrats as well as the opposition left - leaning Social Democrats and Greens .
Politicians are demanding answers and a state prosecutor may investigate .

Even some industry veterans warn that such paydays could further tarnish the financial industry ’s sullied reputation .
John S. Reed , a founder of Citigroup , said Wall Street would not fully regain the public ’s trust until banks scaled back bonuses for good  something that , to many , seems a distant prospect .
“ There is nothing I ’ve seen that gives me the slightest feeling that these people have learned anything from the crisis , ” Mr. Reed said .
“ They just do n’t get it .
They are off in a different world . ”
The power that the federal government once had over banker pay has waned in recent months as most big banks have started repaying the billions of dollars in federal aid that propped them up during the crisis .
All have benefited from an array of federal programs and low interest rate policies that enabled the industry to roar back in profitability in 2009 .
This year , compensation will again eat up much of Wall Street ’s revenue .
During the first nine months of 2009 , five of the largest banks that received federal aid  Citigroup , Bank of America , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley  together set aside about $ 90 billion for compensation .
That figure includes salaries , benefits and bonuses , but at several companies , bonuses make up more than half of compensation .
Goldman broke with its peers in December and announced that its top 30 executives would be paid only in stock .
Nearly everyone on Wall Street is waiting to see how much stock is awarded to Lloyd C. Blankfein , Goldman ’s chairman and chief executive , who is a lightning rod for criticism over executive pay .
In 2007 , Mr. Blankfein was paid $ 68 million , a Wall Street record .
He did not receive a bonus in 2008 .
Goldman put aside $ 16.7 billion for compensation during the first nine months of 2009 .
Responding to criticism over its pay practices , Goldman has already begun decreasing the percentage of revenue that it pays to employees .
The bank set aside 50 percent in the first quarter , but that figure fell to 48 percent and then to 43 percent in the next two quarters .
JPMorgan executives and board members have also been wrestling with how much pay is appropriate .
“ There are legitimate conflicts between the firm feeling like it is performing well and the public ’s prevailing view that the Street was bailed out , ” said one senior JPMorgan executive who was not authorized to speak for the company .

The recession is forcing most people to stay at home on New Year 's Eve after a year of cutting back on spending , new research revealed today .
A survey of 2,000 adults by the Post Office showed more than two thirds were planning a night in tomorrow , with most blaming a lack of money for not going out .
Some of those questioned said they would prefer to be at home with their family , with only 7 per cent definitely going to a pub or club to see in the New Year .

Richard Pennant - Jones , head of general insurance at the Post Office , said : " With most clubs and bars charging over the odds for drinks and door entrance on New Year 's Eve , it is not surprising that so many of us prefer to stay in .
" Not only does this make for a cheaper night , but you also avoid the stress of finding a taxi home . "
Meanwhile , revellers were urged to wrap up for a freezing New Year as the cold snap continued today with parts of the country blanketed in snow .
Wales was the worst hit area with up to 10 cm expected on high ground with drifts on top of that .
There was also snow on the Pennines and several centimetres settling in the Midlands with further snow showers expected in eastern Scotland and north - east England .
The Met Office issued severe weather warnings of widespread icy roads across much of Scotland , north - east England , Yorkshire , the Midlands and Wales .
Yesterday , most roads in Wales managed to stay open , with gritters working around the clock .
It was reported that sales of salt had soared by up to 400 per cent in supermarkets as customers stocked up to clear slippery paths and roads .
Poor conditions on the roads and disruption to rail services meant a miserable post - Christmas return to work yesterday with heavy snow in places and persistent rain elsewhere .

And there was little in the way of festive cheer from forecasters who predicted temperatures , which had edged higher in southern England , would plunge everywhere as the week wore on .
Rachel Vince , a forecaster with MeteoGroup , the Press Association 's weather division , said revellers celebrating the turn of the year should be prepared for freezing conditions and snow showers in places .
" When people are out seeing in the new year it will be sub - zero across the UK , " she said .
As Big Ben chimes midnight to signal the start of the new year , those celebrating Hogmanay in Edinburgh can expect temperatures of minus 2C , while revellers in Glasgow will have to contend with a bracing minus 3 and party - goers in the Highlands a finger - numbing minus 6C .
Elsewhere at new year , temperatures of minus 2C are predicted for Manchester and Newcastle , minus 1C for Birmingham and Cardiff and zero in London .
New Year 's
Day will be chilly , with temperatures in the northern half of the country unlikely to get above freezing .
Ms Vince said : " A lot of the country will have a freezing start to the new year .
We are expecting snow showers for northern and eastern Scotland and north - east England .
" It will be largely clear and dry for the rest of the UK which will be good for watching fireworks . "
" On New Year 's Day temperatures will be unlikely to rise above zero from Birmingham northwards . "
Mom mentioned on the phone about a week ago that she wanted me to make her a 10 ” square cutting board for vegetables .
She just meant a 10 ” square plank section , but I decided to make something end grain and more artistic .
With less than a week until my flight , I sprang into action .
I had some scrap rips of walnut from a free pile I got from a sign maker earlier this year .
They were just sticks , and I had to joint off a layer of varnish on two sides , but they were just big enough to get little cubes from .
I made a bunch more from some really cool - looking maple I had laying around , which had brown stripes all over it like those in the rails and stiles in these doors , but much more pronounced and numerous .
It had been 3 ’ too long for my wood shed , so it was standing in the garage .
I cut it to 8 ’ – so I can store that at last – and ripped the 3 ’ section into strips from which I cut more blocks .
I made 132 blocks total , some 60 + of each into a heart pattern with a walnut heart and frame ( designing as I cut them :)
Because my precision skills in the shop are a bit rusty , I decided to use my mini mill with its flycutter to plane the 4 long grain sides to get them all exactly square and parallel .
This worked amazingly well :
A closeup :
The mill is accurate to 0.001 ” ( a thousandth of an inch ) , so these are close to that , with probably a few thousandths of variance due to wood movement and fibers and such .
Still , ~3/1000ths is a sheet of copy paper , so these were super precise .
I was happy .
Then began the long journey into gluing .
I did n’t feel I could accurately glue these all together in one go , nor even a whole strip in one go , so I watched movies all night while gluing up first 2 , then 2 2s for 4 , then strips , then all the strips together 2 at a time , etc. , waiting 30 minutes or more between unclampings …
Here are some steps along the way , wherein you ’ll see that the 4 boxes of 12 small C - clamps I ordered early this year by mistake really came in handy finally ( I knew they would , and will ! ) :
Note I numbered them all at the start , because I spent awhile getting colors , orientations , and grain patterns spread around artistically :)
You ’ll note in the second row up from the bottom the numbers are n’t in order .
The middle set of 4 is made of 2 sets of 2 that are flipped .
The 2s were right , but the middle 4 I made out of them was reversed .
Thankfully it was all a run of maple and unnoticeable , but seeing that soon after the glue had set put me on my guard for all future glue - ups to remain even more diligent about my efforts :
Clever use of dining room chairs :
You can see how uneven they are along their lengths , which stick up at different heights on the flat surfaces of the boards .
I ’ll plane that down later :
Final glue - up , hooray !
It ’s lumpy and glue - covered , so it ’s time to plane it down :
I ’d like to make an aside here for a moment to mention that I ’ve been rather diligently cleaning up the garage , which is one of the more monumental tasks of my life so far .
My only real work surface ( i.e. not my router table or saw table ) is a 2 ’ x8 ’ table in the back of the garage , which for the last year or more – sadly – has looked like this ( and the rest of the garage has been no better , perhaps even worse ) :
With much effort expended , including a lot of careful scraping to remove a lot of dried - on wax , and a final wipe - down , I got it looking like this :
With all that beautiful reclaimed space , I spent a few hours building this router flattening system ( do they have a proper name ? ) using my old , completely neglected Ryobi router and some nice red oak I ’ve had lying around forever .
This is a 36 ” wide , and very flat carriage joined with counter - sunk drywall screws :
I built some 28 ” red oak rails for it , shimmed them with paper strips until they were level and level with each other , which took a little while , and then I had this nice router - based planer ready to go .
I ’ve seen some of you make them , and I ’ve wanted one all year .
I can finally make so many other things now , including something I already started for a friend ( and a second one for mom ) – more on that later :)
Here it is with the part under it , raised up on some plywood .
I did n’t need to use any hold - downs , surprisingly .
It ’s own weight , and the tiny 1/8 ” bit let me carefully plane it in about 15 minutes ( which is a lot of time for this , but for a one - off , I did n’t mind ) :
Here ’s a boring time - lapse of the router - planer in action .
I ’m sitting on a step - stool with a facemask on so I can watch the bit as it engages the surface .
You ’ll see the board slide over to the right on some push moves .
Just after the 1:30 mark ( though this is 1FPS recording , so it was actually much longer into my work than that )
I realized I could just push a block of wood between the right rail and the board and it would stay still for the rest of the effort :
A few of my blocks had drill - holes in them , but if they were in the edges that would be hidden when glued - up , I did n’t worry .
That was a mistake , and something to learn from for the future .
When I planed the side I had been planning to use as the front , I revealed the side of a screw hole .
Later I rubbed in some of the walnut dust , packed it in hard , dripped in some thin CA glue , packed more dust on top of that , sprayed on the activator , and then after it cooled , sanded it flush again with the ROS .
It ’s quite visible , however .
It has a kind of cool wood - burned edge to it that I may employ in the future .
I ’m considering using the mill to engrave things , then pack them with dust , CA glue , then sand it away to leave a weird , grainy inlay look behind :
Anyway , to wrap - up , we opened gifts this morning , and mom loved it !
She absolutely will not cut on it , though , saying she ’s happy to buy a cheap board to actually use .
This one is going on a plate stand :)
My stepdad , who ’s not usually into this kind of thing and a bit of a gruff old man said we should run a wire through the feet and hang it on the wall .
That means it was a success :)
I had originally been planning to use the butcher block oil mom claimed to have ( still have n’t checked ) and follow whatever prescribed treatments were .
I ’ve heard of the once - an - hour - for - a - day , then day per week , week per month , and month per year idea , which seemed possible , if a little bit of a pain .
I read up on walnut oil and allergens , mineral oil and continual wetness , and vegetable oils and odor / decay , but I think we ’ll forgo all of it if it ’s just going to be a decoration .
Honestly , I ’m kind of glad .
It was my first cutting board , and the maple is soft , which is n’t a good idea for cutting boards anyway .
I did n’t realize that at first , but finished the project anyway once I learned .
Mom had asked for a 10 ” square .
This is about 9×11 .
Hope everyone else had a great holiday !

Israel restricts the freedom of movement of Palestinians through the imposition of an ID system .
( Anne Paq / ActiveStills.org )
My dad was born in the Gaza Strip in 1962 , the son of refugees , and left to the United Kingdom along with his wife and first son ( myself ) in 1990 to pursue his PhD at the University of Bradford .
By 2004 , I had a brother and two sisters , and our entire family moved back to Palestine , this time to the town of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank .
My father was working as a foreign journalist licensed by the Israeli Government Press Office and we were living in our country on yearly renewable Israeli work visas .
In 2005 , I was turned back by Israeli border agents at the Sheikh Hussein Bridge as I attempted to cross into Jordan to visit my aunt .
The agents told me that since I was born in the Gaza Strip in 1988 I had been issued a Gaza ID by the Israeli occupation authority and was therefore not allowed to legally reside in the West Bank .
Additionally , I was informed that from then on , Israel would not recognize my British passport .
I was able to return to Ramallah that day , but for the next four years I risked daily arrest by Israeli troops on the way to Birzeit University , where I was studying , and for a year after that while I was working in Ramallah .
This summer , I left the West Bank to find work abroad , and was told by the Israelis that I would not be allowed to return home .
Despite this reprehensible situation , the rest of the family was thankfully spared such hardship .
My dad continued working relatively unhindered as he moved across what is now Israel , the occupied West Bank and Gaza , and my mother and siblings enjoyed freedom of movement across the West Bank and inside Israel .
This all changed very suddenly last August when , on a routine trip to Gaza where my dad had several assignments and where he wanted to visit his ailing father , he was detained by Israeli security at the Erez checkpoint , and was harassed , stripped of his press credentials and told — as I was four years earlier — that his British passport was worthless in Israel .
He was also informed that he too had an Israeli- issued Gaza ID and thus would be treated as a Gazan , deprived of the most basic freedom of choice and movement and barred from ever returning to his wife and children in Ramallah .
He was sent into Gaza , where he appealed to Israeli rights organizations , and as a British citizen to the British consulate and to former Prime Minister Tony Blair , now the Quartet ’s Middle East envoy , for the right to leave Gaza and see his wife and children , if only for a day .
The Israeli organizations were unable to help , the consulate was unable to circumvent a wall of Israeli bureaucracy , and Tony Blair chose to ignore our letter calling for assistance .
In order to save his job , my dad had to give up hope of being allowed back into the West Bank , and left Gaza through Egypt in December .
At the time that my dad was stripped of his press credentials and work visa , my mother and siblings back in Ramallah were forced to accept their own Israeli - issued ID cards .
Incredibly , my mother was given a Gaza ID despite being born abroad , raised in the West Bank and still owning a copy of her original West Bank ID !
She now lives in constant fear of arrest and deportation by Israeli troops ; if she were to leave the West Bank she would also be banned from returning to our family and home in Ramallah .
Meanwhile my brother and sister , who were both born in the UK and are now university students , have bizarrely been issued with West Bank ID cards , even though their parents and older brother were given Gaza IDs .
As a result of all of this , our family has been torn apart .
My father is finally out of Gaza , but he is unable to see his children unless they travel abroad to meet him .
My mother is in the West Bank , afraid to even leave Ramallah and risk being detained and deported at an Israeli army checkpoint .
She is unable to leave the West Bank while my father and I are unable to enter .
We do n’t know how long it will be before we can see each other again — the Israeli authorities have said that they will not change my mother ’s ID .
Israel has treated my family like criminals for being Palestinians .
We have been punished , displaced and deprived from each other ’s company .
Our extended family was torn from its land in 1948 and expelled to refugee camps .
In the 1990s , Israel ’s policy of closure solidified our separation , particularly from my father ’s side in Gaza .
Now Israel ’s racist and draconian demographic policies have separated my parents , my siblings and myself , just like they separate Jerusalemites who wish to marry other Palestinians from the West Bank , or Palestinian citizens of Israel who are legally barred from marrying Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza .
This is one of the many faces of the ongoing Nakba today , and I urge more individuals and families who have suffered like this to speak out .
The world must realize the true nature of Israeli apartheid , and the cruel separation of families is one more reason why Israel must be boycotted .
Mohammad Alsaafin is from the Palestinian village of Fallujah , ethnically cleansed by Israeli forces in 1949 .
He was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp and lived in the UK and US , before moving back to Palestine to study at Birzeit University .

Man is the rational animal
Like all living beings , man requires certain values to survive , but he is unique in that he must choose the values necessary for his life because he has no automatic means of doing so .
It is his ability to experience the world around him and comprehend it by the use of reason that gives him the capacity to understand the values his life requires , and then achieve them .
Every value we enjoy in our civilized , comfortable , existence is the product of the application of man ’s mind to reality .
There is no “ collective mind ”
All creative effort , every invention in history , was created by the mental effort of individual men and women .
When they worked together , their knowledge was increased by the work of predecessors , but each advance they made was their own .
The mind cannot be received , shared , or borrowed .
Man requires freedom to live
To live , man must achieve the values necessary to sustain his live .
To achieve his values , man must be free to think and to act on his judgment .
Restrictions on freedom force man to focus not on the absolutes of reality , but on the arbitrary ideas of others .
In a free society , a man can choose to not associate with those who do not respect his judgment – by finding a new job , new friends , or a new lover .
Even if there is no one to share his ideas , every man is still free to present his own vision – by publishing his ideas or becoming an entrepreneur .
However , as soon as he faces the threat of physical force , the possibility of any such alternatives becomes irrelevant .
The initiation of force renders the mind useless as a means of survival .
Freedom requires rights
Rights are moral principles defining man ’s freedom of action in society .
The purpose of establishing individual rights is to protect man from man – to define the basic conditions necessary for social existence .
All rights derive from a man ’s right to his own life , including the rights to life , liberty , property , and the pursuit of happiness .
Whether it is by a theft , force , fraud , or government coercion , man ’s rights can be violated only by the initiation of force .
Rights are inalienable and non-conflicting
Rights are not guarantees to things or obligations placed on others , but only guarantees to freedom from violence ( the right to life ) , freedom of action ( the right to liberty ) , and the results of those actions ( the right to property ) .
In a free society , men deal with one another exclusively by trade , voluntarily exchanging value for value to their mutual benefit .
The only obligations one ’s rights impose on other men is to respect the same and equal rights of others – the freedom to be left alone .
A man may have his rights violated by a criminal or a government , but morally he remains , in the right , and the criminal in the wrong .

Heather Ellis Could Face Prison Time After Cutting the Line at Walmart Strange saga begins after Heather Ellis shifted lines at a Missouri Walmart .
Nov. 18 , 2009  --
The prospect of spending 15 years in jail was probably the last thing on a Missouri woman 's mind nearly three years ago when she switched checkout lines at a Walmart store .
But jail 's a possibility for Heather Ellis , 24 , who goes on trial today for charges stemming from a dispute at the Kennett , Mo. , Walmart .
Ellis faces charges of disturbing the peace , trespassing , resisting arrest and assaulting police officers after she became " belligerent " when she was asked to leave the store Jan. 6 , 2007 , authorities say .
The schoolteacher could face 15 years in prison , if convicted .
But Ellis , who is black , has said that the charges are racially motivated , and that she has been unfairly targeted , which authorities deny .
In a letter she sent to the Missouri chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People after the incident , Ellis said that she was trying to join her cousin in his checkout line at the time of the dispute , because his was moving faster than the one in which she was standing , according to The Associated Press .
Ellis wrote that she was " pushed by a white customer , hassled by store employees , called racial slurs and physically mistreated by Kennett police officers , " according to the AP .
" What a shame the system can destroy a young person 's future like this because of bad cops , " Ellis wrote .
Repeated calls by ABC News to the state NAACP office were not returned Tuesday .
Although Ellis declined to speak with ABC News before today 's trial , her father , the Rev. Nathaniel Ellis , called the trial a " big , racial discrimination cover - up . "
Ellis said his daughter was at the store with her mother and cousin when a " Caucasian lady pushed her and accused her of butting into line .
" In a nutshell , [ the altercation ] was due to the incompetence of the cashier , " Ellis said Monday , explaining that his daughter was trying to add six items to the conveyer belt on which her cousin 's items rested .
But members of the Kennett Police Department who responded to the scene tell a very different story , and accused Ellis of " yelling and cursing " and hurling " verbal assaults " toward them , according to the probable cause affidavit filed in Dunklin County Circuit Court and obtained by ABC News .
Walmart Defers to Law Enforcement
Witnesses told authorities that instead of standing in line behind the other waiting customers , she " walked in front of the line , to the cash register attendant , apparently because she did not want to wait in line . "
When the cashier began checking out someone in front of Ellis , and moving the individual 's items forward on the conveyer belt , Ellis " began shoving the merchandize back down the conveyer belt , " according to the court documents .
After she was asked to leave the store several times but refused to do so , officers began to arrest her .
Ellis responded by " fighting the officer " while " yelling and cursing , " according to the court documents , which referred to Ellis as " completely out of control . "
In a written statement , a Walmart spokesman said , " Incidents involving our customers are unfortunate and we take them seriously .
" In this matter , there was a disturbance and law enforcement was contacted , in accordance with our normal procedures .
The police then determined how to proceed . "
Judge Joe Satterfield , who is presiding over the case , said that while the crimes Ellis is charged with are punishable for up to 15 years in prison , it is unlikely that , if she is convicted , she will be sentenced to that much time .
Asked about the racial undertones the case has taken on in the mostly white city of about 11,000 residents , Satterfield declined to discuss the specifics of the case , other than to note that the prosecutor first assigned to try the case , Stephen Sokoloff , recused himself .
Ellis ' attorneys had filed a motion for Sokoloff to be removed from the case after a letter Sokoloff wrote in response to a local newspaper report about the trial , which was headlined , " Felony Charge for Cutting in Line While Black in Missouri , " became public , according to published reports .
In the motion , the attorneys accused Sokoloff of " making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused . "
Prosecutor Recused Himself
Satterfield denied the motion but Sokoloff later stepped down on his own , telling the newspaper that he did n't want his statements to be a distraction .
Cape Girardeau , Mo. , prosecutor Morley Swingle is now trying the case .
Messages left for Sokoloff and Swingle were not immediately returned , although Sokoloff told the AP that he would have filed the charges regardless of Ellis ' race .
Meanwhile , the New York - based Your Black World Coalition this week staged a rally that began outside the Kennett Walmart and traveled to the prosecutor 's office in support of Ellis .
The protest was peaceful , according to media reports , but an earlier rally had been met with fliers reportedly distributed by the Ku Klux Klan , some reading , " The next visit will not be social . "
As for Ellis , who is now a schoolteacher in Louisiana , her father said he still hoped that the case would be thrown out .
" This is a heartbreaking situation , " he said .

Video : Immigration Reform is an Economy Booster ( Español )
The U.S. government has attempted for more than two decades to put a stop to unauthorized immigration from and through Mexico by implementing “ enforcement - only ” measures along the U.S. - Mexico border and at work sites across the country .
These measures have failed to end unauthorized immigration and placed downward pressure on wages in a broad swath of industries .
Comprehensive immigration reform that legalizes currently unauthorized immigrants and creates flexible legal limits on future immigration in the context of full labor rights would help American workers and the U.S. economy .
Unlike the current enforcement - only strategy , comprehensive reform would raise the “ wage floor ” for the entire U.S. economy — to the benefit of both immigrant and native - born workers .
The historical experience of legalization under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act indicates that comprehensive immigration reform would raise wages , increase consumption , create jobs , and generate additional tax revenue .
Even though IRCA was implemented during an economic recession characterized by high unemployment , it still helped raise wages and spurred increases in educational , home , and small - business investments by newly legalized immigrants .
Taking the experience of IRCA as a starting point , we estimate that comprehensive immigration reform would yield at least $ 1.5 trillion in cumulative U.S. gross domestic product over 10 years .
This is a compelling economic reason to move away from the current “ vicious cycle ” where enforcement - only policies perpetuate unauthorized migration and exert downward pressure on already low wages , and toward a “ virtuous cycle ” of worker empowerment in which legal status and labor rights exert upward pressure on wages .
This report uses a computable general equilibrium model to estimate the economic ramifications of three different scenarios : 1 ) comprehensive immigration reform that creates a pathway to legal status for unauthorized immigrants in the United States and establishes flexible limits on permanent and temporary immigration that respond to changes in U.S. labor demand in the future ; 2 ) a program for temporary workers only that does not include a pathway to permanent status or more flexible legal limits on permanent immigration in the future ; and 3 ) mass deportation to expel all unauthorized immigrants and effectively seal the U.S. - Mexico border .
The model shows that comprehensive immigration reform produces the greatest economic benefits :
Comprehensive immigration reform generates an increase in U.S. GDP of at least 0.84 percent .
Summed over 10 years , this amounts to a cumulative $ 1.5 trillion in additional GDP .
It also boosts wages for both native - born and newly legalized immigrant workers .
The temporary worker program generates an increase in U.S. GDP of 0.44 percent .
This amounts to $ 792 billion of cumulative GDP over 10 years .
Moreover , wages decline for both native - born and newly legalized immigrant workers .
Mass deportation reduces U.S. GDP by 1.46 percent .
This amounts to $ 2.6 trillion in cumulative lost GDP over 10 years , not including the actual cost of deportation .
2
Wages would rise for less - skilled native - born workers , but would diminish for higher - skilled natives , and would lead to widespread job loss .
Legalizing the nation ’s unauthorized workers and putting new legal limits on immigration that rise and fall with U.S. labor demand would help lay the foundation for robust , just , and widespread economic growth .
Video : Immigration Reform is an Economy Booster ( Español )
EXCLUSIVE : The auction ended late Friday night and I ’ve been putting together what happened ever since .
Certainly you ’ll recall the big cool quotient around Machete , that famously fake trailer by Robert Rodriguez from Grindhouse .
It was considered the single best thing about that Weinstein Co double - feature flop that also included Quentin Tarantino ’s pic .
Rodriguez ’ fake trailer hinted at a good story ( Mexican day laborer is set up , double - crossed , and left for dead — then starts everyone ’s worst nightmare ) and carried an even better catchphrase ( “ They just fucked with the wrong Mexican . ” )
Machete ‘s YouTube video alone has 1.4 million views , which was n’t lost on Hollywood .
The result was 6 studios all very interested in domestic distribution rights to Rodriguez ’ latest — Sony , Lionsgate , Warner Bros , Fox , Paramount , and The Weinstein Co .
Rodriguez had made the fake trailer into a real movie outside the studio system .
With help from Rick Schwartz ’s Overnight Productions , Rodriquez indie financed Machete with $ 20 million from selling international rights to Sony and making some other global sales and another $ 5 million he borrowed .
Rodriguez not only wrote and produced the pic but he also co-directed it with Ethan Maniquis .
It stars an eclectic cast to put it mildly of Robert De Niro , Lost ‘s Michelle Rodriguez , Jessica Alba , Lindsay Lohan , and Danny Trejo .
With the picture now in the editing room , Rodriguez and his longtime agent WME ’s Robert Newman ( who ’s been there from the start of the writer - director ’s career ) decided to look for domestic distribution .
All six interested studios screened about 15 to 30 minutes of footage .
Newman ’s proposal was for $ 9 million upfront , no P&A commitment but the guarantee of a wide release , and a big backend gross participation for Rodriguez .
( I ’m told in the 10 % - 12 % neighborhood . )
Both Fox and Paramount said yes , and then , in an unusual move , Newman went back to the two studios and asked for more gross percentage and an overall production deal for Rodriguez .
Paramount balked , so did Fox .
But Fox reminded everyone that it was already very much in the Robert Rodriguez business making Predators , and Tom Rothman really wanted him to have a home there , and Rodriguez and Rothman get along well , so a deal was clinched .
Which leads me to one of the most interesting aspects of this behind - the - scenes .
Since The Weinstein Co had first - look on Machete , why did n’t it do the deal ?
After all , when Harvey and Bob started their successor company to Miramax , they did it on the back of their longtime relationships with Tarantino and Rodriguez .
And they ’re making Spy Kids 4 with Robert .
“ I really do n’t know why .
That ’s for Harvey to answer , ” one insider tells me .
Rival studios are speculating TWC couldnt come up with the $ 9 M .
Yet a Weinstein Co insider claims it could have scooped up the pic for just $ 3.5 M but did n’t because “ we saw the footage and it ’s not very good at all . ”
Sounds like sour grapes amid the indie studio ’s layoffs , pic pushbacks , money woes .
( Weinstein Co Gets “ New Lease On Life ” ? )
Well , that certainly makes it clear now more than ever that the Weinsteins wont be Rodriguez ’ filmmaking base anymore .
And that his new home of Fox just fucked with the right Mexican .
A new , comprehensive analysis of mountaintop removal mining , which is common in the Appalachian region of the United States , shows that its environmental effects extend to the hydrology of its surroundings , ruining streams and the ecosystems they support .
Technically known as " mountaintop mining with valley fills " ( MTM / VF ) , it consists of stripping away forests and topsoil from the tops of mountains and then using explosives to break through rocks that cover the coal inside the mountain .
The resulting rocks are then pushed away into valleys , where they interfere with and often bury existing streams .
It 's not all that surprising that clean water , and a lot of it , is important to ecosystems ; research shows that if these activities disrupt as little as 5 - 10 percent of a watershed 's area , they can cause irreversible changes to the ecosystem .
The reduced flow of streams that get buried by valley fills can kill off plants and trees in an area with high biodiversity .
This loss of flora also results in a landscape that is less effective at handling runoff water , leading to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of downstream flooding .
Streams that continue to flow are polluted with various chemicals and metals from the mountaintop rocks .
Increases in sulfate cause stream microbes to create more hydrogen sulfide , which is toxic to many aquatic plants and organisms .
Selenium accumulation causes deformities and lethality in fish , which in turn poison the birds that eat them .
Humans in the area are also affected by the dirty streams and the elevated levels of airborne , hazardous dust that results from mining .
Studies have found elevated levels of hospitalization for pulmonary disorders and hypertension , as well as increased mortality in the region .
Reclamation of the areas appears to be ineffective , with soils still having low organic and nutrient content and little to no regrowth of woody vegetation afterward .
Reclamation often involves rebuilding streams , but the new ones carry chemicals released by the rock debris , and do n't integrate into the radically altered environment .
The sum of these problems add significantly to the externalized costs of coal use for power generation .
Because of the huge impact , the scientists behind the report are recommending that the government stops issuing MTV / VF permits until new methods to address these problems can be developed and subjected to rigorous review .

The reference to " registry@caldera.com " in binutils does not refer to
a GPLed contribution by Caldera but rather the fact that the ELF specification
allows for extensions that are specific to a particular operating system or
hardware architecture .
Each architecture is assigned a specific number , and the
purpose of the registry is to make sure that these numbers are unique .
So where can you find the current list of assigned numbers ?

Hmmm .
Even by the figures given by the proponents of this disconnection scheme ,
£ 500,000,000 administration costs per year will increase music / film sales by
£ 1,700,000,000 over ten years .
So the admin costs are three times the projected
benefits to the copyright holders .
How about this for an idea : you collect the £ 500,000,000 each year from all with
a broadband connection in exchange for an explicit license to download anything
from anywhere ?
This type of thing has worked well for decades for television
and radio licenses .

First the obvious , binutils is a FSF package , it uses the GPL licence .
Any contributions must be public , and are reviewed by the team of maintainers .
Anyone can make a suggestion , or offer a patch ; but the code must be GPL .
Caldera were just one of the many users of FSF packages .
Most , if not all their packages released on Linux distributions were GPL , but their collection of these belonged to them .
You can copyright a collection without ownership of the constituents .
When Caldera claim copyright it is to their particular collection or distribution , their name , their art work ; but not to the contents .
Caldera can own the " Caldera Network Desktop " but not own the constituents .
The compiler on that distribution is gcc , the FSF compiler collection , When you compile gcc you can have lots of options to choose host , build and target machine , cpu type and others .
When porting gcc onto another machine range you can choose if gcc should emit ELF or COFF .
The output of a compiler , called object code , must be to standards ; otherwise it would not link with libraries .
Often gcc is ported but the propriety linker is still used .
With c++ the situation is more complicated with overloaded operators .
There are functions with duplicated names ; that must be linked to the one with the same prototype .
This selection is sometimes referred to as mangling / demangling .
In the 1970s compilers were written at Universities , it was part of the course , and there was much study of compilers and parsers in general .
Hence the name yacc for a utility , ( yet another compiler compiler ) gcc was ported to avoid licence fees .
The licence of propriety compilers was expensive , and if you had multiple machines , you had to buy a licence for each ; it made good sense to port gcc and its associated debugger gdb / ddd and use these for development of systems .
By the 1990s gcc was often a better compiler than the propriety one .
ELF superseded COFF , because of improvements in specification , and the need for more functionality .
Both DEC and IBM stayed with COFF , but extended it .
But Linux took full advantage of it .
You can buy books on COFF and ELF ; you could not write a compiler without knowing what output format to use .
For Caldera / SCO to claim either is ridiculous , they were a minor bit player in the evolution of the computer industry .
Whilst they distributed their Linux distribution , they had a few technical people ; but these were inherited from the original SCO , ( became Tarantella ) the technical folk being based in Santa Cruz , California and not Utah . [ Reply to This | # ]

I am reminded of what someone was told by his father , " Keep a pebble in
your pocket . "
What he meant was , when you see your opponent buried up to his neck in pebbles ,
then is the time to throw your pebble on the heap .
I find this attitude abhorrent , but in this case I will make an exception - SCO
started to throw stones first !

Even though trial and magistrate judges eventually wisen up to the SCOG 's antics and the technical issues at hand , it ( unsurprisingly ) takes years .
Laywers know how to play the legal system , so that is what they do .
It is exactly what the SCOG 's team has been doing for the largest part ot the past decade .
( I can hardly believe I 'm wrting this ! )
And with the trustee being an ex judge , he 'll play the game as well .
And since the bankruptcy court does n't even seem to care very much about the rules , I think the SCOG will run out of money before it will run out of play .

* IF * the court will accept SCO 's position then everybody who
has ever contributed anything to Linux will be able to pull
an SCO and sue for a couple of billions .
IMO such a decision by the court was ( is ? ) the real goal of
whoever financed SCO 's attack on Linux .
Just think how much
raw material for the FUD factory such a decision can supply .
Good thing that IBM & Novell * fight * it .

Y'no , I just remembered seeing references to ELF , from back around when the 1.0
version of the kernel was being issued , seems to me like it HAS to have been
somewhere around ' 93 or so .
I wish I could remember what the name of the
distributor of this was ; it contained several different distributions , including
Yggdrasil and Slackware , among several others , and had a drawing of what I think
was supposed to be an alien .
I 'll attempt to figure out what it was , and the
relevant date .

Mountain Lion Shot in Iowa County .
Kill Has People Divided
Associated Content ^ | Dec. 15 , 09 | Sherry Tomfeld
Posted on by stillafreemind
The DNR has refuted claims that they have brought mountain lions into Iowa to help control the deer population .
But many do not believe that .
This cat was checked by the DNR for a tag .
None was found .
Why would they look for a tag if mountain lions in Iowa are rare and wild ?

I am surprised the lions were not protected already .
Wolverines were not protected in Utah several years ago until someone found one and killed it .
That brought change .

I hope they donated the meat to a few families that are struggling to keep stomachs filled .
Other than that , the animal was a menace and deserved to be shot .
An animal ’s right to live , IMHO stops as soon as it ’s claws / paws / horns / teeth / tail touches a person or a person ’s property .

If the cat were in the back country , I ’d lean toward leaving it alone and notifying a local ranger .
If it was on a large farm , I ’d probably leave it alone , if it were a long ways from the house , or a community .
If it ’s near a community , it needs to be relocated or put down .

Perhaps it broke out of it's containment on private property .
Or it strayed away from MO , MN or some other state where the state has tagged some of these animals
What I find interesting is that the story does n't say anything about the DNR officials searching for implanted ID .

Deer are unsatisfactory food for predators .
What is needed is a heard of Arctic reindeer .
They can run 50 MPH and on any given day any given reindeer can escape a pack of wolves , or any other predator .
They taste better too AND , best of all , are a good source of vitamin B12 ~ and other B vitamins , as well as elemental iron .
With a little assistance they could easily force the whitetails so beloved of bears and wildcats out of the range .

They are living in the Pennsylvania north woods .
I know this as a fact ( personal experience ) .
If you want to get a Game Commission official bent out of shape , ask one why they are covering up the existence of mountain lions in the State .
I can't figure out their denial , other than they may be complicit in placing them .

Mountain Lions can move up to 30 miles in one day .
Iowa does n’t have uninhabited wilderness areas for these critters to roam .
This cat needs to be killed .
For sure it was near homes and farms .

In the realm of reporting , a journalist distinguishes himself from his competitors through effective sourcing .
Any staffer can reap information from press releases and meeting minutes .
Rarer is the ability to establish strong and reliable lines of communication with high - value sources .
As the journalist increases his level of access , he increases his worth to his news organization , which aims to beat its competition by presenting more valuable information more quickly .
But relationships with valuable sources – even if they ’re strictly professional – can undermine a reporter ’s capacity for producing accountability journalism .
The source ( e.g. a mayor ) does not share information with a reporter out of a desire to spread the truth or help out a newspaper , he does so because he seeks favorable coverage for himself – or unfavorable coverage for a foe .
Amy Goodman , host of the independent radio show Democracy Now ! , refers to this as the “ access of evil . ”
In order to be able to get that all - important leak from a named or , better yet , unnamed “ senior official , ” reporters trade truth for access .
This is the “ access of evil , ” when reporters forgo the tough questions out of fear of being passed over .
In their seminal book on the workings of the mass media , Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman list this trade - off as one of the “ filters ” that shapes editorial content in favor of elite interests .
Its effects are well documented by Chomsky and Herman , as well as by media watchdogs such as FAIR , Media Matters and medialens .
The journalist , then , is faced with a dilemma , as he must weigh the desire to advance his career against the desire to probe the centers of power he ’s charged with covering .
It ’s difficult to fault a reporter – or , indeed , anyone – for siding with his career .
This raises a question for us , the audience .
Should we – and can we – stop consuming Media simply because it offers exclusive access to important sources ?
If the reporter must trade his integrity for his connections , then perhaps we ’d construct a clearer picture of the world by listening to the journalists who stand outside looking in .

WASHINGTON  Just the thought of Joseph I. Lieberman makes some Democrats want to spit nails these days .
But Mr. Lieberman , the Connecticut independent , is not the least troubled by his status as Capitol Hill ’s master infuriator  and on Monday he showed how powerful that role can be at a time when Democrats cannot spare a single vote .
The day before , Mr. Lieberman threatened on national television to join the Republicans in blocking the health care bill , President Obama ’s chief domestic initiative .
Within hours , he was in a meeting at the Capitol with top White House officials .
And on Monday night , Democratic senators emerged from a tense 90 - minute closed - door session and suggested that they were on the verge of bowing to Mr. Lieberman ’s main demands : that they scrap a plan to let people buy into Medicare beginning at age 55 , and scotch even a fallback version of a new government - run health insurance plan , or public option .
Mr. Lieberman said he believed that the Medicare expansion was off the table , though he did not get any guarantee .
“ Not an explicit assurance , no , ” he said .
“ But put me down tonight as encouraged at the direction in which these discussions are going . ”
Anita Ikonen and James Underdown
If there ’s one thing more frustrating than trying to get paranormal claimants to prove their abilities , it ’s getting them to admit they failed after flunking a legitimate test .
Such is the case of Anita Ikonen , a Swedish student in North Carolina who claimed to be able to see or feel her way into a person ’s body and tell if that person is missing an organ or not .
The Independent Investigations Group ( IIG ) at the Center for Inquiry - Los Angeles has been in contact with Anita for over two years trying to get a handle on what she claims to be able to do , and how she might be tested .
After much communication , Anita and the IIG agreed on a demonstration protocol where she would be presented with 3 different groups of 6 people .
In each group of six , one person would be missing a kidney and Anita would have to determine which person that was , and choose which kidney was missing .
Anita agreed that she ’d have to get all three choices correct in order to succeed and move on to try for the IIG ’s $ 50,000 Paranormal Prize .
( It should be noted that setting up this demonstration is probably one of the most elaborate efforts ever to give a claimant an opportunity to show her stuff .
We had to find , house , feed , and entertain 18 - 20 volunteers ( 4 of whom were missing kidneys – preferably right kidneys ) , secure a very expensive ultrasound machine ( and a technician to run it ) , videotape and live stream the entire proceedings – all while monitoring a claimant who may or may not be trying to burn us out of $ 50,000 .
If Anita had n’t flown herself to L.A. and sent a $ 750 deposit to cover our out - of - pocket expenses , all this would not have happened .
IIG members Jim Newman and Steve Muscarella shouldered the bulk of this effort , with big kudos to Spencer Marks and several other IIG investigators . )
Anita flew to Los Angeles , and attempted to demonstrate her ability on Saturday , November 21st , 2009 .
That afternoon , she reconfirmed that our demonstration protocol was perfect , and told us that her ability to perform was intact .
Just to make sure , we brought out a man before we began the demonstration whom we identified as missing a left kidney .
Anita quickly ( remember that ) verified that she could see that his kidney was absent .
It was time for her to show her ability .
All things being equal , the odds to accurately pick all three missing kidneys were 1728 to 1 .
The probability equation for the 3 groups of six people ( 12 possible kidneys per group to choose from ) looks like this :
( 1/12 ) x ( 1/12 ) x ( 1/12 ) = 1/1728
These odds were a lot easier than what she ’d have to beat if she were testing for the $ 50,000 .
But this was only a demonstration , so we gave her a fighting chance – something like hitting two numbers in a row on a roulette wheel – not impossible by luck alone , but not easily won either .
Anita looks for missing kidneys
So how did she do ?
She failed .
Unequivocally she failed the demonstration .
( See the whole test here : http://www.ustream.tv/channel/vision-from-feeling-demonstration )
But even though she clearly failed the test , I have a problem .
She got one right .
That ’s a problem because instead of admitting that her alleged ability is disproved , she still thinks there is something special about herself and wants to set up another test .
I ’m sure she ’ll convince others that she was at least somewhat successful too .
That ’s simply not true .
But wait .
Is getting one right special ?
How extraordinary is such a feat ?
Not a bit extraordinary !
Let ’s look at the odds .
The probability of her getting one of her 3 choices right is surprisingly high .
Without getting into the statistical minutia about the odds , she had about a 1 in 4 chance ( about 23 % ) of getting at least one choice right .
Put in perspective , would you be amazed if someone asked you to guess a number from 1 to 4 and you got it right ?
Would that suggest paranormal ability ?
Hell no .
It means nothing .
She had another advantage that helped her with the original odds .
For certain medical reasons , most of the people by far who donate kidneys donate a left kidney .
So a clear majority of the one - kidneyed people out there are missing their left kidney .
Anita knew that before the demonstration .
So which kidney do you suppose she chose every time ?
The left !
Every time .
Hmmm … sounds like someone was trying to shrink that 1728 to 1 down a bit .
A smart gambler would bet left each time under the assumption that we could only find “ lefties ” for our test subjects .
Had we been unaware of such a statistic , we might have accidentally shrunk her odds down to 216 to 1 – a far sight easier .
( 1/6 ) x ( 1/6 ) x ( 1/6 ) = 1/216
Score Sheet for Group #
1
Her consistent choosing “ left ” at least suggests that she ’s playing the numbers and not really looking into the bodies .
It looks like someone using math skills over paranormal skills .
Here ’s another bit of food for thought .
After seeing the missing kidney immediately that we told her about , she took almost a half hour studying each of the six - person groups .
These volunteers were asked to sit still and quietly in front of a small crowd under stage lights while Anita shuffled back and forth behind them making notes .
One of our IIG members who was monitoring the volunteers as they sat noticed a bit of fidgeting .
It turned out that two of the most active fidgeters were missing kidneys .
Were the one - kidneyed subjects anxious about being discovered ?
Was Anita looking for outward signs that might distinguish bi-kidneyed from uni-kidneyed volunteers ?
Makes you wonder …
Yet another complication that convinced her that she did better than she actually did was that one of the choices she made was the right person , but the wrong kidney .
Should we give her credit for getting close ?
Let ’s put it this way :
Would you give your dentist credit for pulling a tooth close to the bad tooth ?
Would you want Anita deciding which lung should be removed if one were diseased ?
Would you want your airline pilot to be close to landing the plane safely ?
Close is the distance between impressive and meaningless .
Anita Ikonen ’s degree of accuracy is completely consistent with that of a guesser .
If she really had this ability , you ’d think her results would stand apart from what probability would predict .
They do not .
Anita failed the test clear and simple .
She was and is no closer to winning the IIG $ 50,000 Paranormal Challenge or James Randi ’s $ 1 Million Challenge than anyone else .
The skeptical community should spend no more time on her .
One last thought .
We asked 9 audience members who observed the demonstration to guess which kidney they thought was missing in each group .
Someone who signed a worksheet KB scored as highly as Anita did and got one right .
Let ’s hope KB goes on with her life as if nothing happened – which is the truth .

So , I was on vacation with my dad and I got the flu .
When I came down to breakfast one morning , he said , " You have your color back , Doll !
You must be feeling better ! "
" It 's makeup , Dad , " I stated :
And it was : that magic , scientific makeup that does something to customize itself to your skin - tone and give you a realistic flush .
My father had not known such artful makeup existed .
Indeed , few men do .
But many claim to dislike makeup .
By this , of course , they mean recognizable makeup : heavy eyeshadow , bold lipsticks , various forms of sparkle ( and I recuse the men-children of Jersey Shore from this generalization ) .
It 's very annoying , because all those guys ( one in ten according to a survey quoted in the Daily Mail ) who claim to prefer a " natural look " with no makeup are probably thinking of , at least , a tinted moisturizer , a little mascara and maybe a dash of color .
The complaints against makeup have always smacked of a certain internalized puritanism , a retrograde horror of display and lily - gilding , and an unrecognized conviction that , as my great - grandmother would say , " nice girls do n't paint their faces . "
( Indeed , on the other side of the family , one great - Grandma Ida got a reputation for being " fast " in the Warsaw ghetto when she reddened her cheeks with damp crepe paper . )

I 'll just say it once : men do n't " hate " makeup .
Men do n't know what makeup looks like .
Maybe they do n't like Tammy Faye Baker maquillage , but guess what : neither do we .
It 's like my saying , " I hate hair products on men " because of DJ Pauly D's dubious coiffure .
The notion of cosmetics becomes problematic when people feel unworthy without them , when a woman feels a need to hide or disguise or change .
But by the same token , it 's a very unfair standard to demand that women be " naturally " beautiful - as beautiful as a youthful princess gifted in the cradle - without their aid .

Five months ago the Android Market had 10,000 applications .
Today , as reported by AndroidLib , Android Market has doubled in size since then and hit the 20 k app market .
Pretty astounding , but still miniscule in comparison to Apple ’s iPhone App Store .
But the key in this case is about momentum and NOT competition .
According to IDC Research ( via GigaOM ) , Android Market growth will outpace that of Apple ’s iPhone App Store in 2010 .
But that does n’t really matter … one of these operating systems is never going to “ beat ” the other .
They ’re both destined to sit on top of the mobile kingdom , each wearing a different type of crown and reigning over a different land with different rules and different values .
The important factor is that each operating system fuels growth and innovation , but also manages that growth appropriately .
With 100k + apps in the iPhone App Store it is nearly impossible for users to find what it is they are looking for or to find things they might enjoy .
Unfortunately for Android users , despite having to sift through far fewer apps , the task is even harder as no great system of browsing the possibilities as been put in place .
It is nice to note that more than 60 % of Android Applications are free .
That ’s at least 12,000 free applications or games .
And while sometimes the “ you get what you pay for ” cliche rings true , there are a LOT of great downloads that ’ll cost you absolutely nothing .
Like Google , I ’m sure many of these devs offering up free software hope that mobile advertising is the next big growth area and if they ’ve already got a large mass of users , profiting will come naturally .

||| Professor i idéhistorie Espen Schaanning ved Universitetet i Oslo sier i Dagbladet i dag at han mener kriminelle bør få velge mellom pisking og soning som straff .
Utspillet vekker sterke reaksjoner i hele det politiske Norge .
- Vi har prøvd å legge folk på torget , vi har prøvd å trekke ut tennene på dem , og vi har prøvd pisking .
Men det har ikke vært spesielt vellykket , sier justispolitisk talsmann for Høyre , André Oktay Dahl , til Dagbladet .
Tilbake i tidHan mener kreativitet er bra i justispolitikken , men at pisking er å gå for langt .
- Norge er i front med menneskerettigheter , og da kan vi ikke gå tilbake i tid på denne måten .
Jeg tror det bare er sadomasochister som vil ha glede av pisking , sier Oktay Dahl .
Heller ikke SVs justispolitiske talsmann , Akhtar Chaudhry , har mye til overs for forslaget om pisking .
- Nei , sivilisasjonen har kommet lengre enn dette , sier Chaudhry , som mener det er bevist at fysisk avstraffelse ikke gir noen gevinst .
Variert -
Det er mange andre land som driver med dette .
De får spørre dem om hvordan det går , sier Chaudhry , med klar adresse til professor Schaaning og fengselsdirektør Alnæs .
Direktør i Oslo fengsel Øyvind Alnæs sier til Dagbladet i dag at Schaanning starter en viktig debatt .

Akhtar Chaudhry mener at det norske straffesystemet gir et variert tilbud når det gjelder soning og rehabiliteringsmuligheter for de dømte .
- Jeg får rett og slett dårlige assosiasjoner av dette forslaget , sier Akhtar Chaudhry .
Leder i justiskomitéen , Per Sandberg ( Frp ) , sier til Dagbladet i dag at dette er et av de pussigste utspill han har hørt om , og at han er grundig uenig med professoren .
FordømmerThor Lillehovde , Ap - medlem av justiskomiteen , vet ikke helt om han skal ta piskeforslaget på alvor .
- Vi fordømmer slike avstraffelser i andre deler av verden .
Men avkappede lemmer og piskeslag har ingenting med den vestlige verden å gjøre ,
sier Lillehovde til Dagbladet .
- Og hvem skal ta seg av piskingen ?
Skal vi finne noen i Nav - køen som kan gjøre det ?
Jeg prøver bare å følge opp saklighetsnivået i debatten , spør Lillehovde ironisk .
As a child Ray Solomonoff developed what would become a lifelong passion for mathematical theorems , and as a teenager he became captivated with the idea of creating machines that could learn and ultimately think .
In 1952 he met Marvin Minsky , a cognitive scientist who was also exploring the idea of machine learning , and John McCarthy , a young mathematician .
And within four years , they and seven other scientists , as part of the original Dartmouth Summer Research Project , had founded a new field and given it a name : artificial intelligence .
The conference proved to be a watershed both for the field of artificial intelligence ( Dr. McCarthy , a Dartmouth College mathematician at the time , coined the term ) and for modern computing .
It laid out a proposal for a program of study , stating , “ The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it . ”
The next summer Allen Newell , J.C. Shaw and Herbert Simon , researchers at the Carnegie Institute of Technology ( now Carnegie Mellon University ) , devised a program to discover proofs of logical theorems .
Simulated by hand in 1955 , the program , called “ Logic Theorist , ” was demonstrated at the Dartmouth conference and is considered to be the first effort to create an artificial intelligence program .
With the UCI ProTour now extending from January through October , it ’s getting a little hard to keep track of the where and when surrounding various professional events .
Well , struggle no more : Cyclocosm.com proudly presents our Periodic Table of Professional Cycling — and thanks to Operation Monetize , you can buy it ( and any of our other graphics ) as a poster .
It ’s inspired some t- shirts as well .

Races are ordered from top - to - bottom in rough order of importance , with vertical series representing geographic location of events .
Stage races tend toward the left side of the table , one - days toward the right , and colors correspond with UCI ranking of individual events .
Races that have n’t been run yet , or could n’t be shoehorned in elsewhere ended up in the Lanthaniods , while recently - defunct events filled the Actinoids .
Each event tile contains the name of the event , the year in which it was first run , a rough measure of its distance in stages or kilometers , and a symbolic abbreviation .
Event abbreviations are mostly three characters because it ’s easier to parse ( and you wo n’t need to write equations with them ) .
They ’re designed to make intuitive sense , but occasionally reflect an older , alternative , or native - language name of a given event .
Obviously , there were a few concessions made to fit the design ( World Championships in the Netherlands , Tour de Suisse above the Tour of Romandie ) , and I promoted the Tour of California to ProTour status , both for aesthetics and as a matter of opinion .
Here are my sources , and if you disagree , here ’s the public domain source file so you can make your own .
Scientists trade their lab coats for pin stripes
Writing in The Daily Telegraph , David Penberthy reduced his belief in climate change to a simple proposition .
“ [ W ] hen it comes to the basic questions of science , ” he wrote , “ forgive me for sticking with the guys in the lab coats . ”
Whether or not this coincides with majority opinion , as he assumes , it reflects a quaint view of scientific practice .
Does Penberthy hold to the romantic image of scientists depicted in Hollywood classics like Madame Curie ?
Is he thinking of ascetics in white coats , toiling over test tubes in dingy laboratories , ruining their health for truth and human progress ?
If so , he needs to broaden his perspective .
For one thing , he needs to catch up with the transformed higher education landscape of recent times .
The media ’s groupthink on climate change suppresses some natural questions .
What should we make of the near - unanimity of opinion among a cohort of scientists in such a complex and dynamic field ?
Is there more to it than consistent measurements , experimental results and interpretations ?
Journalists had a field day when Senator Nick Minchin fingered the post - communist Left .
Cries of “ conspiracy theory ” have resonated since .
But there are more mundane factors to consider .
Compared to past decades , financial considerations now play a more significant role in setting academic research priorities .
This is n’t news .
Nor is the tendency of universities to shift social agendas in a leftward , and so self - promoting , direction .
These trends together with growing demands on the tertiary sector , public funding constraints and increasing resort to private sources of revenue , have politicised and commercialised the research environment .
This is n’t to say that researchers commonly falsify their data for political or financial ends .
It means that universities , faculties , research institutions and individual researchers compete for influence and dollars .
As the sector expands , competition becomes ever more intense .
For many in the system , moreover , employment conditions are less secure than academic tenure .
Some find themselves juggling the roles of researcher , IT specialist , administrator and entrepreneur .
This is far from the cloistered world of Madame Curie .
Does any of this affect the way climate research is presented to the public ?
When an academic discipline is caught up in issues of public controversy , these trends can have perverse consequences .
For the right people , climate science has all the makings of a honey - pot — diffuse panic , friendly media coverage , eager politicians with large cheque books , new legislative frameworks , a global network of collaborators and the driving force of the United Nations .
In these conditions monetary and ideological considerations are inseparable .
Are we to believe scientists are immune from such inducements ?
Consider the Climate Change Research Centres and Sustainability Institutes springing up all over the university system .
Clearly , they are about more than pure scientific research .
They are semi-commercial operations with public or private sector clients and budget imperatives comparable to those of professional service firms .
Many strident advocates of climate action are found in them , rather than conventional science faculties .
It ’s often forgotten that the term “ sustainability ” is a political concept , not a natural process ; it ’s as much about political science as natural science .
On the one hand , scientists shape public policy outcomes , on the other they exploit ensuing opportunities .
At ease presenting computer models to business meetings , climate scientists would n’t be caught dead wearing lab coats .
There ’s no need for conspiracy theories ; the incentives for collusive practices are real .
At the very least , climate researchers share potent commonalities of interests .
None of these developments are unique to Australia , of course .
So , does all of this affect the way climate research is presented to the public ?
The answer is yes , if developments at East Anglia University ‘s Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) are anything to go by .
CRU emails released by hackers expose behaviour patterns which elevate institutional interests above professional obligations .
Amongst other things , senior researchers suppressed inconvenient data , manipulated results and tried to subvert peer - review mechanisms .
All were casually accepted as features of a group culture .
Yet such malpractices were inevitable given the incentives , not to mention the fog of panic and intolerance enveloping climate science for so long .
Since government is by far the most important element in the structure of inducements influencing the research community , the CRU scandal has clear lessons for Mr Rudd .
Not just because the science of global warming may not be as settled as we ’re told .
But also because the manipulation of scientific questions for political purposes , whether to drive a wedge through opposition parties , or to hold the “ middle ground ” , or to gain status in international forums , introduces powerful distortions into the process of scientific enquiry , to the detriment of taxpayers who so generously fund it .

Beginning in 2006 , the Center for Food Safety ( CFS ) took legal action against the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s ( USDA ) illegal approval of Monsanto ’s genetically engineered ( GE ) Roundup Ready alfalfa .
The federal courts agreed and banned GE alfalfa until the USDA fully analyzed the impacts of the plant on the environment , farmers , and the public in an environmental impacts statement ( EIS ) .
USDA released its draft EIS on December 14 , 2009 .
A 60 - day comment period is now open until February 16 , 2010 .
CFS has begun analyzing the EIS and it is clear that the USDA has not taken the concerns of non-GE alfalfa farmers , or organic dairy farmers seriously , for example , having dismissed the fact that contamination will threaten export markets and domestic organic markets .
You can review the EIS here and supplemental documents here .
This is the first time the USDA has prepared an EIS for any GE crop and therefore will have broad implications for all transgenic crops , and its failure to address the environmental and related economic impacts of GE alfalfa will have far - reaching consequences .
CFS is spearheading a campaign to make sure all affected parties know and are involved in the public process and have the opportunity to comment .
This is a call to action to all who have concerns about the environmental and economic consequences of uncontrolled nation - wide growth of GE alfalfa , to all who believe in the public ’s right to choose to eat non-GE food and the farmer ’s right to sow the crop of his or her choice , and to those who care about the impacts of pesticides and invasive weeds on biodiversity and endangered species .
Get the latest articles in your inbox .
Farmers , dairy producers , scientists , public interest organizations , and all concerned citizenry must make sure their voices are heard in this important process .
At this stage , the most critical thing anyone can do is provide public comments indicating their concerns with GE Roundup Ready Alfalfa .
In particular , the EIS dismisses the significance that GE alfalfa will broadly contaminate non-GE alfalfa .
Opinions , studies ( published or unpublished ) , anecdotal stories , and testing data about how contamination will occur and / or demonstrating that contamination has in fact occurred are critical .
The EIS also dismisses the significant adverse economic effects that GE contamination will have on non-GE conventional alfalfa seed or hay growers ( e.g. , export markets ) , or dairy production that rely on non-GE and organic alfalfa hay for forage .
Studies ( published or unpublished ) , anecdotal stories , and economic analysis showing harm through contamination is essential , especially markets that are GE sensitive or reject GE outright .
Submit your comments to USDA APHIS No Later Than February 16 , 2009 .
You can also sign up for the CFS True Food Network and receive alerts on the process .

Specialist Marc Hall , aka hip hop artist Marc Watercus , was looking forward to the end of his U.S. Army service in February and never going back to Iraq , when commanders decided to “ stop - loss ” him — the policy that allows military officials to keep soldiers longer than their service contracts state .
Frustrated by the Army ’s decision , Hall recorded — and mailed to his superiors — a song protesting the stop - loss policy , which has forced thousands of troops to serve extra time in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Army threw Hall in jail on December 11 , 2009 , in Liberty County Jail , Georgia .
He is charged under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice , which covers “ all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline ” and “ all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces . ”
Army officials considered the song a warning sign and threat .
In the song Hall raps :
Like Obama says somebody be held responsible
But some of you all gonna be held in the hospitals , whenever possible …
I ’m gonna round up all eventually , easily , walk right up peacefully
And surprise them all
Yes , yes y’all , up against the wall , turn around
I got a motherfuckin ’ magazine with 30 rounds , on a three round burst
Ready to fire down … spray and watch the bodies all hit the floor
I bet you do n’t stop - loss nobody no more , in your next lifetime of course …
Hall ’s civilian lawyer claims that the lyrics to the song should not be taken literally .
Hall ’s court - martial trial is expected to take place sometime in the coming months .

How to sync your cellphone data in Linux
Updated : December 5 , 2009
We rely heavily on our cellphones .
We keep critical data stored on them .
This data must be backed up often .
In Windows , people use all sorts of synchronization suites to backup their cellphone data to hard disk .
Most often , these suites are slow , bloated , poorly coded and work only with specific cellphone models .
Oh , and they only work in Windows .
What about Linux users ?
How can Linux users back their cellphone data ?
In this tutorial , I will show you how you can backup your mobile devices to hard disk , simply and easily .
You will learn how to sync your data , so that if your device gets damaged , you will not lose important information .
Let 's do it .
Right tools for the right task
There are many tools that offer the same functionality .
My experience is focused on Wammu , a powerful , friendly phone manager utility , which is , btw , also available for Windows .
Wammu is the graphical interface for gammu , the tool that does the actual work .
Wammu works with a broad range of devices , including many Nokia , Siemens , Sony , Motorola , Symbian phones , and AT - compatible phones .
The manager offers full support for contacts , to - do lists , calendar , and can also backup SMS messages .
It 's exactly what we want !
Wammu is included in most repositories of popular Linux distributions , so you wo n't have any trouble installing it .
Using Wammu
Now , we need to start using Wammu .
The first time you launch it , it will complain about no configuration file being found and suggest launching a setup wizard .
The wizard will guide you through all aspects of the configuration .
It 's very simple to follow .
Of course , you need to follow the instructions .
Connect your phone
The first think you need to do is connect you device , using either a serial or USB cable , Infrared or Bluetooth .
I will use the last option .
Now , you may be wondering how to setup Bluetooth on your Linux .
Well , it 's rather simple and I have written about it in detail in a number of articles , including my Ubuntu and Fedora articles , as well as the Bluetooth security tutorial .
Nevertheless , we 'll do a short rehearsal here .
Fire up the Bluetooth wizard - right - click on the icon in the system area , choose Setup new device .
Later on , after you are connected , you may also use Send files and Browse files for simple copy of data on the cellphone , but this will not work with the information stored in the phone memory .
Anyhow , a wizard will launch .
It will scan for any existing Bluetooth - capable devices in the proximity and display them for you .
Input the PIN code into your cellphone and there you go !
Job done !
Now , we can go back to working with Wammu .
Connection type
Choose the connection type .
How is your phone connected .
We have just paired using Bluetooth .
Phone type
Choose your phone type ( manufacturer , if you will ) :
Connection type
This one can be tricky , but the best choice is to go with the default .
You can always go back and change the protocol .
Which driver to use
Again , this can be tricky .
Personally , I had no idea what to select , so I chose the first option .
Later on , I tried several other options .
They all worked well , by the way .
Wammu is rather forgiving when it comes to using the right drivers for your device .
Phone port
This is the most difficult part of the task .
What the hell is phone port .
And how do you get the Bluetooth address of your phone ?
Luckily for you , you have me .
What we need to do here is find the Bluetooth would - be IP address .
Just like IP - based communication over Ethernet , Bluetooth uses its own syntax for marking devices , very similar to MAC addresses .
You do not need to fully understand how the various radio protocols work .
You just need to grab the right value and input it into the phone port field in the Wammu wizard .
Obtaining the Bluetooth address is not a simple thing .
You will have to invoke a command line utility , called hcitool , which will scan the visible , connected Bluetooth devices and return their addresses .
To get the Bluetooth address for your phone ( in our case , one called Dedo ) :
hcitool scan
Copy the long string , delimited by colons into the wizard .
Connection test
If you 've configured everything correctly , the phone configuration wizard will perform a short test .
Configuration done
The last step before completing the wizard is to name your phone .
Using Wammu
Now , we can start using Wammu in earnest .
Wammu is very simple to use .
You have the side bar on the left side , where you can expand the different categories .
The Phone menu allows you to switch between different devices you 've configured .
Retrieve allows you to pull data off the phone into Wammu , including contacts , messages and other details .
Backup lets you save the data to a file on your hard disk .
You can also read all your messages , including oligophrenic snippets sent by your friends :
Backup
Once you 've retrieved the important information you need , just back it up to a safe location .
From this moment on , even if you misplace your device , your data is stored on a second device .
Mission accomplished !
Other sync tools
There are other tools you may want to consider trying , although I must admit I 've had most success with Wammu , plus it was the easiest to setup and use .
BitPim
This tool offers similar capabilities to Wammu , but I did not manage to sync it using Bluetooth .
The fault may be entirely mine , but the average user will probably not fare much better than I did .
Furthermore , BitPim did not have a separate entry for Nokia , which is a bit surprising .
There 's this mention of CDMA technology , so I guess it has something to do with that .
Xgnokii
This funny - sounding utility is a frontend for the gnokii toolbox , an open - source replacement for the Nokia Cellular Data Suite , specially designed to work with Nokia phones .
Like BitPim , Xgnokii was less cooperative than Wammu .
Like BitPim , it insisted on a wired connection via cable and would not sync using Bluetooth .
Since I have long lost my sync cable , this proved to be a major showstopper .
Conclusion
Everyone has a cellphone nowadays .
Whether you 're using an old , plain thingie capable of just storing contact information and phoning other people or one of the new shiny things with web camera , Bluetooth , Internet access , and the answer to life , the Universe and everything , you are using a mobile communication device , with lots of data stored on it .
Cellphones have become shrines of information , with tens and hundreds of contact details , messages , memos , names , addresses , media files , and tons of other data stored into the tiny chip .
It 's because the cellphones go everywhere we go ; they are the first digital gadget to be exposed to new experiences and new people we meet .
Later , at your own convenience , you may copy some of the stuff stored on your mobile device onto a desktop hard disk or something along those lines .
But that almost never happens .
What people forget is that their cellphones are in fact tiny computers , limited in what they can do , but computers nonetheless .
And every now and then , they tend to malfunction .
On top of that , they are easily stolen , people are in habit of losing them , getting them drowned in beer , dropping them from the fourth floor onto the innocent bystander below , or kicked to death at a party .
Eventually , sooner or later , your cellphone will die or vanish .
The only question that remains is : will you have an up - to - date backup of your cellphone data or will you lose everything ?
Hopefully , by having read this article , you have learned the importance and mastered the tools required for the job .
What more , we just did that on the dreaded operating system called Linux !
Today , you have the means to sync your mobile devices on Linux .
Wammu is the code name here .
The utility is very simple to use .
The configuration wizard is easy to follow , yet powerful .
Best of all , Wammu works well with cable , Infrared and Bluetooth .
Have fun and spread the word !
Cheers .
( CNN ) --
A dating site that markets itself as an elite community for beautiful people with a " strict ban on ugly people " has axed about 5,000 members for packing on the pounds during the holiday season .
The international site BeautifulPeople.com threw out members after they posted photos " revealing that they have let themselves go , " according to a company statement .
" As a business , we mourn the loss of any member , but the fact remains that our members demand the high standard of beauty be upheld , " said Robert Hintze , founder of BeautifulPeople.com .
" Letting fatties roam the site is a direct threat to our business model and the very concept for which BeautifulPeople.com was founded . "
The site describes itself as an " elite online club , where every member works the door " -- that is , users can join only after enough members vote them " beautiful " during the 48 hours after their profile is uploaded .
And apparently , enough beautiful people were angry that some members had enjoyed a bit too many treats during the holiday season .
So BeautifulPeople.com sent those flagged members e-mails , according to the company statement , telling them they could register again for the site when the extra pudge was gone .
" We responded to complaints by moving the newly chubby members back to the rating stage .
This is the same as having them re-apply , " Greg Hodge , managing director of BeautifulPeople.com , said in a statement .
The company said it " expelled " 1,520 users from the U.S. , 832 from the U.K. , 533 from Canada , 510 from Poland , 425 from Germany , 402 from Italy , 323 from France , 220 from Denmark , 176 from Turkey and 88 people from Russia .
In the e-mail , it gave users suggestions for boot camps and workout facilities to get themselves back in shape .
Some gave the site a shot again , hoping fellow users might not see them as the " fatties " others had .
" Their re-applications were reviewed by existing members , and only a few hundred were voted back in .
Over 5,000 were rejected , " Hodge added .
Hodge admits , and has admitted from the time his company started , that his site may not be fair , but people want to date someone they are attracted to .
" Is it elitist ?
Yes , it is , because our members want it to be , " Hodge said when the company started out in 2005 .
" Is it lookist ?
Yes , it is , because our members want it to be .
Is it PC ?
No , it 's not , but it 's honest . "
And on this site , beauty is certainly in the eye of the beholder ; only one in five applicants is normally accepted , a company statement said .
Maintaining those standards is what the site is about , Hodge said , and that 's why people were expelled .
" Every year we see that some of our members from Western cultures eat and drink to excess over the holidays , and clearly their looks suffer , " he said in a statement .
" The U.S.A. has been grossly over - indulging since Thanksgiving .
It 's no wonder that so many members have been expelled from the network .
We hope they will be back after shedding the festive pounds . "
Thanks to the runaway success of the iPhone , AT&T has the largest wireless network in the country — and the lousiest .
Fed - up subscribers , who pay the telco about $ 30 a month just for data ( and another $ 40 or so for voice ) , are planning an assault this Friday called Operation Chokehold .
The idea is to cripple AT&T ’s network in order to draw attention to its weakness .
To do so , participating iPhone users will run data - heavy applications over AT&T ’s 3G network on Friday from noon to 1 p.m. Pacific time .
The plan was apparently launched by the Secret Diary of Steve Jobs , a popular blog that satirically impersonates the Apple CEO , but Operation Chokehold has since gained steam with notices popping up on other tech blogs .
It should n’t take much to buckle AT&T ’s network — it has trouble functioning under normal conditions .
Whether the company will do anything in response is another matter .
Verizon has blanketed the country in ads mocking its chief rival ’s network — ads that would n’t be so effective if they did n’t ring true .
AT&T tried to sue , but gave up in the end .
The company promised to improve its network in New York and San Francisco — two known problem areas — but do n’t hold out hope .
AT&T appears as if it is looking for ways to discourage users from using its product — the network — or at least charging them more , according to wireless chief Ralph de la Vega . — PZS
KEEP AMERICA SAFE - GET NAKED
By Mary Starrett
January 20 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
Want to keep America safe ?
Get naked .
Do your patriotic duty ; after all , if you ’re not hiding anything what ’s the big deal ?
I recently read that the largest nudist group in the U.S. and Canada , the American Association for Nude Recreation fully endorsed the use of full body scanners at airports .
I tried to verify this but my web filter said “ do n’t go there ” and the site was blocked .
I got as far as Wikipedia ’s entry on AANR which says , “ Founded in 1931 , the organization advocates nudity and nude recreation in appropriate settings . ”
Personally , I think it ’s fine if people choose to play badminton in the all together at a nudist park .
That would be an “ appropriate setting ” for getting naked in public .
On the other hand , airports are not appropriate settings for Americans forced to get virtually naked in front of Gestapo - like TSA agents who ’ll do who knows what with the images .
Ron Paul ’s Campaign for Liberty released a warning on the use of xray scanners calling it :
... a peeping tom ’s dream , and a nightmare for those of us who believe in the great American principles of liberty , restrained government , and privacy .
.... TSA agents will be snooping at the undergarments of such “ threats ” as American kids , grandmothers , and grandfathers .
And if you refuse ?
You will be physically searched by TSA employees just like a criminal after being arrested .
Congressman Jason Chaffetz ( R - UT ) said , “ Nobody needs to see my wife and kids naked to secure an airplane . ”
One tenth of an inch is how far it goes .
The types of x rays emitted from machines used by the TSA penetrate one - tenth of an inch into the body .
That ’s deep enough to craft an image so detailed that even substances hidden under the skin are visible .
X rays zapping us at airports and government buildings across the country and getting under our skin by that small fraction are being touted as another small step toward a more secure America .
In truth , they represent a giant leap toward slavery .
Polls showing 74 % of Americans think airport body scans will make us more secure are either incorrect or else we have become a thoroughly brainwashed and ideologically lobotomized assemblage of slaves who are happy to chant “ Thank you sir , may I please have another ? ” with each violation against our Bill of Rights and natural law .
The fourth amendment guarantees :
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .

Full Body Scanning is unreasonable as it presupposes guilt and ignores the aspect of our law that requires a warrant for searches .
This full frontal assault on the Constitution aside , “ backscatter ” x rays could be a health risk .
So besides being dangerous to our liberty , the use of these imaging devices now deployed at 19 U.S. airports from Albuquerque to Tulsa - with more to come - can also hurt us .
Radiologists are on record warning that no amount of radiation is good .
And since radiation ’s effects are cumulative , exposure to even small amounts , over time can pose serious health risks .
The x rays from airport body scanners are especially risky for pregnant women and children .
It is morally and legally wrong to expose people to medically unnecessary radiation and it will do little to improve the security of air travel , especially since wide open borders and lax security at ports belie the federal government ’s assertion that it is working toward national security .
As if the Constitutional and health aspects were n’t enough to scare the pants off us , consider the frightening prospect for millions of law abiding citizens should President Obama ’s pick for TSA chief , former FBI agent Erroll Southers get the job .
Southers is on record as saying it ’s not Muslim terrorists who warrant closer scrutiny but “ anti-government , ” “ anti-abortion , ” “ survivalist types ” who are “ Christian identity oriented . ”
Hang onto your copies of the Constitution , your Bible and your pro-life literature .
With Southers in charge , being marched in front of a death ray box at the airport could be the least of your problems .
Yes , Southers would be top man at the TSA , an organization not exactly known for transparency .
The TSA has denied the body scanners will store and transmit pictures of passengers .
The agency ’s Privacy Impact Statement claims the x ray machines will have their image storage functions disabled by the manufacturers before they ’re placed in airports and that passengers ’ body images will be retained on the screen “ only as long as it takes to resolve any anomalies , ” asserting , “ the machine does not retain the images . ”
But then why would the TSA have required that all machines in use , which can cost as much as $ 200,000 each , have features which not only capture but store and re-route images of uncovered passengers ?
The naked truth appears to be that the TSA is trying to massage the truth , according to the findings of a public interest watchdog group which focuses on civil rights issues .
Thankfully , watchdog groups like the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( www.EPIC.org) have been seeing right through the TSA for years .
Through Freedom of Information
Act requests and several lawsuits the cover up is being exposed .
If we ignore this outrage against our bodies and our freedom , then all bets are off from here on out .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Russia will begin to block imports of U.S. poultry as of Jan 1 . because of concerns about a commonly used chlorine treatment , U.S. government officials and a Russian news agency said on Thursday .
Russia plans to proceed , over U.S. objections , with a new law prohibiting chlorine as an anti-microbial treatment in poultry production , said Katie Gorscak , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Agriculture Department .
“ Since chlorine has been used as an anti-microbial treatment for poultry in the United States for more than 25 years , this resolution effectively blocks U.S. exports of poultry to Russia , has a devastating impact on the U.S. poultry industry and trade , and raises the costs of poultry products for Russian ’s consumers , ” Gorscak said .
U.S. and Russian officials have agreed to hold further technical talks on the issue “ as soon as possible , ” but are still working to finalize dates , she said .
The United States believes Russia ’s new regulation is unjustified because of “ overwhelming scientific evidence ” showing chlorine is safe and effective disinfectant for use in poultry , Gorscak said .
Jim Sumner , president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council , said he hoped poultry already headed to Russia would be allowed to enter , even though longer - term prospects were uncertain .
“ There may be about 30,000 tonnes ( of U.S. poultry ) en route or at the port in Russia , but we are optimistic that it will be allowed to enter , based on the assurances earlier from the Russian Veterinary Service , ” Sumner said in an e-mail to Reuters .
“ Future exports are questionable , however , until this issue gets resolved , ” he said .
The issue has threatened the top market for U.S. poultry -- worth $ 801 million in 2008 -- for more than a year .
A week ago , Russian veterinary officials indicated the poultry trade would continue .
Russia also recently moved to ban pork from all but six U.S. processing plants because of a dispute over standards for antibiotic residues .
Poultry processors in the United States routinely use chlorine rinses to kill pathogens that can cause food poisoning .
There are no detectable residues left from the treatments , which have long stalled U.S. poultry exports to the European Union .
The United States has complained about the EU ban at the World Trade Organization .
The new rule will not affect Russia ’s imports of EU poultry , said Gennady Onishchenko , head of the consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor , in an interview with Russian news agency Interfax .
“ It ’s not a ban on anyone ’s quotas .
Just treat your meat the way our national legislation prescribes and no one will object to its imports , ” Onishchenko said .
Russia ’s requirements will restrict the use of chlorine in poultry plants to 0.5 parts per million , which Sumner said is 10 times lower than the standard chlorine content in U.S. municipal drinking water .
“ The U.S. industry will be unable to comply with Russia ’s requirements , ” Sumner said .
Technical and health - related barriers have become a thorn in U.S. - Russia meat trade , increasing as Russia moves to boost its domestic meat production and decrease its reliance on imports .
Russia , which does not belong to the WTO , lowered its quota for U.S. poultry this year .
But industry officials believe the chlorine issue will be worked out because Russia cannot yet produce enough to meet its needs .
“ I think they will still need us for chicken , ” Rich Nelson , analyst at the agriculture advisory firm Allendale Inc , said in response to the possible ban .
“ I think they will need our chicken for at least another year , ” Nelson said .
Hamilton and Scherzinger had been dating for almost two years
Lewis Hamilton and Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger have ended their relationship after two years .
McLaren 's 2008 Formula 1 world champion , who turned 25 last week , and the American singer , 31 , announced the split in a joint statement .
" Nicole Scherzinger and Lewis Hamilton can confirm that they have decided to go their separate ways , " it read .
" The two of them have decided to focus fully on their careers and will remain close friends . "
Hamilton and Scherzinger began dating after meeting at the MTV Europe Awards in Munich in November 2007 .
A year later , Scherzinger was at Hamilton 's side as he celebrated the Formula 1 world title at the final race of the 2008 season in Brazil .
The Hawaii - born singer , who shot to fame after joining the Pussycat Dolls in 2003 , has been a familiar face in the F1 paddock and was there to share in Hamilton 's wins in Hungary and Singapore last season .
606 : DEBATE Hamilton will prevail in 2010 in my opinion
therok01
However , there was speculation at the Italian Grand Prix in September that the high - profile couple were close to separating because of Hamilton 's reluctance to settle down .
Despite managing the challenges of a long distance relationship between his home in Switzerland and her base in Los Angeles , Hamilton insisted they were still together .
The new McLaren pairing of Hamilton and reigning world champion Jenson Button , with their respective girlfriends Sherzinger and Button 's partner , Japanese model Jessica Michibata , had been expected to be the focus of the media spotlight in 2010 .
Following his split , Hamilton is intent on focusing on winning back the drivers ' crown from his British rival .

Internet - enabled computers managed to transform the way we consume porn — as did smartphones like the iPhone a few years later .
Now , with the iPad , Apple 's released a whole new class of device : how will it effect adult entertainment ?
Well , if you ask us , it probably won't — or at least , not in the way its predecessors did .
While there 's no doubt that the iPad is a hugely transformative device that will shape the way we consume a great deal of media , when it comes to porn ... well , it just does n't quite cut it .
As we see it , there are two main problems with the device :
Content :
The iPad is set up to download media from three sources : the app store , the iTunes store , and the iBooks store .
Awesome , sure — unless you like porn .
As Apple has shown , time and time again , they 're just not to keen on letting adult entertainment into their universe .
And since there 's no DVD drive on this baby , you can forget about watching porn that way .
If you want to consume anything dirty , you have two options :
1 ) Go to a porn website using Safari ( and forget about sites using Flash - based streaming video ) .
2 ) Load a dirty movie into iTunes ( that you got from some place other than the iTunes store ) , and load it on to your iPad that way .
Not the worst options , of course — after all , those are the same ways one gets porn onto the iPhone .
But that brings us to the second issue .
It 's not discreet :
The iPad has — rightly — been described as a very big iPhone ... and that 's exactly the problem .
The main reason why the iPhone has had such a successful career in porn is because it 's tiny .
As a small , portable device , the iPhone allows you to browse porn discreetly , wherever you may be : at home , at the office , out on the town ... and do we really have to explain the benefits of being able to comfortably hold it with one hand ?
The iPad , on the other hand , though more manageable than a laptop , is hardly a discreet device .
No one 's going to believe you 're bringing it to the bathroom " to do some reading " — and can you imagine the strain you 'll get from holding it in one hand as you lie in bed ?
And do n't even get us started on what would happen if you tried to browse porn on it in public ...
Steve Jobs described the iPad as a device that fills the gap between computers and smartphones .
And it 's true .
But in occupying that central position , the iPad 's a device that 's neither here nor there .
Too limited in content to be a portable porn library , and too big and bulky for secret porn watching , it 's pretty much the worst of both worlds ... at least for the porn connoisseurs of the world .

There are further hints that Dubai World will sell off assets to help meet its debt obligations .
The director general of the emirate 's finance department told Al Jazeera that there was nothing to prevent the firm selling some of its overseas investments .
These include sea ports , US hotels and the QE2 cruise liner .
The news came as investors continued their sell off of stocks on both the Dubai and neighbouring Abu Dhabi stock markets .
Jeremy Howell reports from Dubai .
OTTAWA  The Supreme Court of Canada ruled Friday that Canadian agents violated the rights of the only Canadian citizen held at the Guantánamo Bay detention center when they interrogated him there .
But the ruling , the second concerning the man ’s politically sensitive case , does not order the government to demand his return to Canada , as he has long requested .
The man , Omar Khadr , was 15 years old and severely wounded when he was captured by American forces in Afghanistan during 2002 .
Mr. Khadr still faces an American military commission on charges that he killed a member of the United States military with a hand grenade during a battle .
As was the case with its earlier judgment , the Supreme Court was very critical of methods used at Guantánamo both by the United States and visiting Canadian officials .
It said that use of tactics like sleep deprivation before Mr. Khadr was questioned by Canadians in 2003 and 2004 were a particularly offensive violation of Canada ’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms because of his age .
“ Interrogation of a youth , to elicit statements about the most serious criminal charges while detained in these conditions and without access to counsel , and while knowing that the fruits of the interrogations would be shared with the U.S. prosecutors , offends the most basic Canadian standards about the treatment of detained youth suspects , ” the court said in its decision .
To the crowbars that helped them break into the cars of the people volunteering to help them .
Yeah , I 'm so going to get negatived for this .

No , it would n't do anything for the environment .
But two Hollywood conservatives ( yes , there are some ) have called upon the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to rescind the prestigious , profitable gold Oscar statuette that it gave ex-Vice President Al Gore et al two years ago for the environmental movie " An Inconvenient Truth . "
A Top of the Ticket post Dec. 4 about former Vice President Al Gore and the film “ An Inconvenient Truth ” incorrectly reported that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Gore an Oscar .
Although Gore appeared in the film and participated in the Academy Awards ceremony , the Oscar was given to the movie for best documentary .
The post also refers to the “ leak ” of controversial e-mails concerning research into global warming but did not explain how the documents were obtained .
The e-mails were obtained by computer hackers who then leaked their contents to the public by posting them online .
Roger L. Simon and Lionel Chetwynd , both academy members , are among a small , meandering pack of known political conservatives still believed to be on the loose in the liberal bastion of movie - making .
In 2007 , Hollywood 's academy sanctified Gore 's cinematic message of global warming with its famous statue , enriched his earnings by $ 100,000 per 85 - minute appearance and helped elevate the Tennesseean 's profile to win the Nobel Peace Prize despite losing the election battle of 2000 to a Texan and living in a large house with lots of energy - driven appliances .
Chetwynd and Simon were prompted to make their hopeless demand this week by the ...

Thanks to some seriously inappropriate words from Democratic Senator Majority Leader , Harry Reid , the GOP are up in arms while trying to spin their racist behavior on to the Democratic Party .
During the 2008 Presidential Primary , Senator Harry Reid made the mistake of saying basically that then Senator Barack Obama was electable because he was a light skinned African American who did not speak with a Negro dialect unless he chose to do so .
Now Senator Reid has expressed his embarrassment and apologized directly to the President and Obama has accepted it .
Why ?????
Because President Barack Obama knows that Reid ’s heart is in the right place and it has been demonstrated with his hard work and dedication to the President and his policies .
Advertisements
He has worked tirelessly for healthcare reform and other policies for the President while battling the GOP for hours and hours , days and days , months and months but coming through with an outcome in the end one step at a time , but all the while bringing us closer and closer to healthcare reform in his support and commitment to the President and the people of the United States .
The President says , “ The book is closed as far as he is concerned . ”
I think we as a country are lucky to have Senator Reid .
Well , the GOP are in a uproar demanding Reid ’s resignation and position of Senate Majority Leader calling the words and statements made “ foul ” and that the Dems have a double standard when it comes to racism by fellow Democrats .
And the lead attack dog is African American RNC chairman Michael Steele who in my opinion , is frequently used as what is called in the African American community , an “ Uncle Tom ” , for the GOP .
He has been accused of being jealous of President Obama and takes pride in attempting to upstage him .
He ’s a bit of a hothead and certainly no Colin Powell but he was elected to be the GOP ’s representation match for Barack Obama .
There ’s only one problem , there ’s only one Barack Obama .
The problem with this claim of racism is not really much more than the usual tactics of the GOP .
They just believe that this time they actually have some truth to stand on for a change .
Now if there were not so many other dramatic serious policies and issues to be dealt with , this would be an excellent time period to delve into race relations whole heartedly because it keeps coming up and will continue to come up as long as Barack Obama holds the highest office in the land .
Racial issues have many layers and many subtleties that most do n’t understand .
It is never merely black and white .
The GOP keep bringing up the incident with former Mississippi Senator Trent Lott , that they believe is the same example as this one with Reid .
That is not true .
Trent Lott was speaking of Strom Thurmond ’s leadership as a segregationist .
Senator Reid has a history of being pro civil rights .
He made a comment that was stupid and of his age group but it was supposedly off the record and was actually a compliment from his perspective of the then young senator Barack Obama from Illinois .
You have to be able to discern the difference in race relations and most are not experienced or knowledgeable enough to do so .
So it is all piled in to one bundle and then racism is shouted to the loudest degree .
Well , the real racism with much depth and longevity has been coming since Barack Obama was elected President and primarily coming from most of the GOP and the right wing and fringe of the party .
The disrespect to the office of the Presidency on this level has not been seen before .
It is supported by the media and the GOP , the birthers , the teabaggers , the rightwing militia , etc .
They may not actually use words that are considered racist but the mentality is totally deep rooted in racism .
The claims of “ Give Me Back My Country ” and “ Do n’t Let the Government Mess with My Medicare ” and the congressman who was out of order and called out to the President in a formal State of the Union Address , “ You lie ! ”
He should have been fired but a mere apology was sufficient .
But that was actually racism .
When the President ’s image is painted as a “ Joker ” , ” Hitler ” or worse yet “ hanging from a tree ” ; that is real racism , this president has had more death threats than any other president .
Now people want to say it is about his policies but it is actually racism !
No one wants to claim it .
Even former president Bill Clinton , as much as he is loved by the African / American community , fell into the trap of being accused of racism .
It is easy to go there .
What you have to examine and research are the person ’s deeds and commitments .
Senator Ted Kennedy was committed to Civil Rights for all and that is why he was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama for President and to carry on his commitment to healthcare reform .
This is what Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid is doing and we need him .
The GOP simply wants another excuse to kill healthcare reform and bring down the Democratic Party .
They are merely back to business as usual with another distraction .
It only takes a moment .
Again , the GOP ’s expertise is in taking the focus off real progress while they try to sneak back in to power by any means necessary
Last summer President Barack Obama told Katie Couric on the CBS Evening News that there is a “ tradition ” in Washington “ of not financing abortions as part of government funded health care . ”
This benchmark moment in the history of abortion rights in the United States was more than three decades in the making .
The ostensibly pro-choice president was referring to the principles of the Hyde Amendment passed three years after Roe vs .
Wade placed the protection of the Constitution behind a woman ’s right to choose .
Named for the conservative Catholic congressman , Rep. Henry Hyde ( R - IL ) , it proscribed federal funds from being used to provide abortions .
The main effect was to remove abortion from the list of medical services that could be paid for through the federal Medicaid program .
Many reproductive rights supporters saw it as an affront to poor women who would , in effect , be denied access to abortion care .
But a creeping Washington consensus emerged during the current debate on health care reform that took many by surprise :
The Hyde Amendment is now seen as a moderate , “ abortion - neutral ” position that neither advances nor restricts abortion .
The gradual adoption of the principles of the most significant anti-abortion legislation in history as a moderate compromise constitutes a stunning shift in American political and religious life , and raises fundamental questions about whether society views abortion care as part of health care and about its commitment to the right to choose an abortion , as it points to a significant double standard for poor women .
Public Options ?
One could call
Hyde the first volley in the strategy of “ abortion reduction ” that has guided the broad mainstream of the anti-abortion movement at least since the mid-1990s .
Prior to Hyde , about a third of all abortions performed in the United States were for poor women on Medicaid .
“ No other medical procedure was singled out for exclusion , ” the National Network of Abortion Funds ( NNAF ) reported in 2005 .
“ Today , 33 states have followed suit , prohibiting state Medicaid funding [ for abortion ] as well . ”
All but one of these states ( South Dakota ) follows the Hyde exceptions of rape , incest , or life endangerment .
The report details the disproportionate burdens placed on disadvantaged women , and observes that “ women of color disproportionately depend on such coverage , making abortion funding a matter of racial justice as well as economic justice and women ’s rights . ”
But the federal restrictions did not stop there .
Over the years , Congress has also legislated against access to abortion services for women in the military and Peace Corps , disabled women , residents of the District of Columbia , federal prisoners , and women covered by the Indian Health Service .
Indeed , it could be argued that except for the legal right to an abortion , federal policies constitute the greatest abortion reduction program of all .
“ Prior to 1996 , ” states the NNAF report , “ legal immigrants and US citizens were equally eligible for Medicaid . ”
But the 1996 welfare reform law signed by President Clinton required a five - year waiting period before most new legal immigrants could even apply .
Less than half of the states fill in the five - year gap with their own funds , and nine states permanently deny Medicaid coverage to non-citizen residents .
Defenders of abortion rights might legitimately worry that “ conscience clauses ” could also be said to have a venerable history .
The original conscience clause legislation passed in 1973 in the wake of Roe states , according to the Congressional Research Service , that public officials may not require individuals or entities who receive certain public funds to perform abortion or sterilization procedures , or to make facilities or personnel available for the performance of such procedures , if such performance “ would be contrary to [ the individual or entity ’s ] religious beliefs or moral convictions . ”
This provision has allowed even major medical facilities ( such as Roman Catholic hospitals ) to refuse to deal with abortions without jeopardizing their ability to receive public grants and contracts or affect their tax - exempt status .
A new rule promulgated late in the Bush administration expanded and particularized the exemptions , stating that health workers may even refuse to provide information or advice regarding abortion .
The Obama administration has rescinded the Bush rule , but says it plans to leave some kind “ reasonable ” exemptions in place .
Historic pro-choice religious communities see Hyde differently than the current Inside the Beltway consensus .
For example , on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Hyde , the Washington , DC - based Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice , ( a group of 40 religious organizations , including major protestant denominations and most of the major organizations of Judaism ) issued a “ call to conscience to end this discriminatory and punitive measure ” :
By singling out abortion for exclusion , government has created a two - tiered system of health care in which poor and low - income women do not have the same ability to make personal decisions about abortion as those who can afford services or have private insurance .
We believe this is fundamentally unfair .
For women , justice must include the ability to make decisions about bringing a child into the world , without coercion and with the full support of family and society .
In November , House Democrats passed a health care reform bill that would not only extend the principles of the Hyde Amendment to proposed overhaul of the health care system , but further block federal subsidies for private health insurance that covers abortion care .
This was achieved via an amendment co-sponsored by Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - MI ) and Rep. Joe Pitts , ( R - PA ) .
At this writing , the version of the Stupak - Pitts amendment submitted by Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NB ) in the Senate has been tabled , and it is possible that the Stupak - Pitts amendment may get stripped from the final bill in a conference committee to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the bill .
But Marlene Gerber Fried , Director of the Civil Liberties and Public Policy Program at Hampshire College , in Amherst , MA , nevertheless considers such an outcome a hollow victory , many years in the making .
She observes that “ Beating Stupak will mean that millions of women still wo n’t be covered .
It just wo n’t be millions more . ”
“ We are still living with the legacy of an abortion politic , ” she said in a telephone interview last week , “ that did not put the interests of poor women up front .
The idea that a Constitutional right requires access to that right is , ” she concluded , “ just not part of liberal thinking . ”
This has happened in part because the voices of pro-choice religious communities and advocates for the abortion rights of the poor have been marginalized in Washington and in the media .
So opposition to the idea that Hyde is somehow “ abortion - neutral ” went largely unchallenged .
Nevertheless , there was a flaw in the thinking of the president ’s coalition .
Just because they thought their proposal was abortion - neutral did not mean that everyone else would also see it that way .
It turned out that anti-abortion legislators in both parties were not going to go along with public funds ( no matter how small the amounts relative to the enormous health care bill ) going to private insurers who provide abortion coverage .
This issue loomed so large that a spokesman for the US Catholic Conference of Bishops ( USCCB ) told the New York Times , “ The concerns are kind of intractable . ”
Pro-choice leaders point out that without the subsidies , private insurers , which already cover abortions , might no longer do so .
Rev. Carlton Veazey , President of RCRC came out swinging in a recent “ action alert ” to supporters .
“ The House - passed Stupak - Pitts amendment , ” he declared , “ is disrespectful of women and an affront to our nation ’s promise of freedom of religion and separation of church and state .
The House of Representatives bowed to the pressure of the USCCB and agreed to impose the theology of this one religious tradition on all of us . ”
As they sought to find “ common ground ” on abortion , the president and others were taken by surprise that Hyde did not mean sufficient abortion neutrality to the USCCB and anti-abortion Democrats , many of whom have signaled their willingness to sacrifice health care reform over the possibility that any public funds might touch on abortion .
It is remarkable that the administration and pro-choice and liberal interest groups apparently did not see it coming .
As a result pro-choice members of Congress and pro-choice organizations are fighting merely to preserve the principles of Hyde in the health care bill in opposition to Nelson and Stupak - Pitts .
And what do they call it ?
“ Preserving the status quo . ”

Printer Friendly ... VinE's OCaml Programming Tricks : Explicit Continuation - Passing Style Author : RolfRolles # Views : 43113
There are many books devoted to languages like C++ or Python , and technical blogs are teeming with further information on these subjects .
Languages like OCaml have much smaller communities , with very few dedicated books and technical blogs .
As far as I 've put together , we OCaml programmers mainly learn from reading one anothers ' code .
Functional programmers must stick together .
VinE is the static analysis component of the BitBlaze binary analysis project , it is written in OCaml , and it contains some tricks that I have n't seen elsewhere .
For the sake of contributing to their dissemination throughout the community , I would like to detail some of them here .
These might be obvious to everyone already , or maybe no one cares .
Feedback is welcome .
The following discussion concerns / ocaml / wp.ml , the weakest precondition calculator .
A weakest precondition ( hereinafter WP ) is the most general condition under which execution reaches some given point with some desired post - condition ( i.e. an execution trace plus some arbitrary condition that must hold at the end of the trace , e.g. " this array write at this location goes out of bounds " ) .
WPs compare favorably to forward symbolic execution in terms of formula size , and comprise an attractive choice for enacting the primitive " cause execution to reach a particular line in a particular state " , if loop unrolling is palatable .
This entry concerns an OCaml programming technique found in VinE 's WP calculator , and does not seek to discuss WPs themselves .
For further reading , read a book on formal semantics ( the section on axiomatic semantics ) or Dijkstra 's original work in the area from the early 1970s .
One issue with functional programming is that , if recursive functions are not written in a tail - recursive style , they have the potential to overflow the stack , thereby causing the program to abort .
One learns to be judicious about writing tail - recursive functions , but alas , it is impossible to naively convert some functions into such a form ; care is needed .
For example , if the recursive function needs to call itself to produce a value , and then perform some operation on the result before returning it , then the recursive invocation is not in the tail position and cannot be optimized into a jump by the compiler .
Therefore , the function will consume stack space for each recursive invocation , leading to an upper bound on the size of the data that can be processed before a stack overflow exception is thrown .
Consider the following snippet , which is the aforementioned weakest precondition calculator written as a straightforward recursive pattern match :
let rec wp q = function
| Skip -> q
| Assume e -> exp_implies e q
| Choice ( s1 , s2 ) -> let r1 = wp q s2 in
let r2 = wp q s1 in
exp_and r1 r2
| Seq ( s1 , s2 ) -> let r1 = wp q s2 in
wp r1 s1
| Assign(t , e ) -> Let(t , e , q )
| Assert e -> exp_and e q
In the case of the Choice statement , the weakest precondition for both choices ( variables r1 and r2 ) must be calculated before they can be conjoined , and therefore these calls can not be made tail - recursive .
Seq is similar .
How do we write this function so it does not crash in the presence of large data sets ?
One answer is " explicit continuation - passing style " , as seen in the following snippet :
let calculate_wp ( simp: Gcl.exp ->Gcl.exp ) ( post : Gcl.exp ) ( stmt:Gcl.t ) =
let rec wp q s k =
match s with
| Skip -> k q
| Assume e -> k ( simp ( exp_implies e q ) )
| Choice ( s1 , s2 ) -> wp q s1 ( fun x -> wp q s2 ( fun y -> k( simp ( exp_and x y ) ) ) )
| Seq ( s1 , s2 ) -> wp q s2 ( fun x -> wp x s1 k )
| Assign(t , e ) -> k( simp ( Let(t , e , q ) ) )
| Assert e -> k ( simp ( exp_and e q ) )
in
wp post stmt ( fun x -> x )
We have introduced a new argument to wp called " k " , the " continuation " , which means " the rest of the computation " .
We can see that the calls to wp in the Choice and Seq cases are now in the tail position , and hence can be optimized directly into jumps , resulting in constant stack depth and no more crashes .
The cases other than Choice and Seq have been modified to apply the continuation to the result of their portion of the weakest precondition calculation .
But what exactly is going on here ?
The compact representation yields little insight into how the WP is actually calculated step - by - step .
Thus , let 's take a look at an example GCL statement and the computation of its WP :
wp q Seq( Skip , Seq ( Assume expr1 , Assert expr2 ) ) ( fun x -> x ) (* Initial call to wp with arbitrary post - condition q *)
wp q ( Seq ( Assume expr1 , Assert expr2 ) ) ( fun x -> wp x Skip ( fun x -> x ) ) (* Grow the continuation because of the Seq *)
wp q ( Assert expr2 ) ( fun x -> wp x ( Assume expr1 ) ( fun x -> wp x Skip ( fun x -> x ) ) ) (* Grow the continuation because of the Seq *)
( fun x -> wp x ( Assume expr1 ) ( fun x -> wp x Skip ( fun x -> x ) ) ) ( exp_and expr2 q ) (* Shrink the continuation to process the assert *)
wp ( exp_and expr2 q ) ( Assume expr1 ) ( fun x -> wp x Skip ( fun x -> x ) ) (* Process the assume *)
( fun x -> wp x Skip ( fun x ->x ) ) ( exp_implies expr1 ( exp_and expr2 q ) ) (* Shrink the continuation to because of the assume *)
wp ( exp_implies expr1 ( exp_and expr2 q ) ) Skip ( fun x -> x ) (* Process the skip *)
( fun x -> x ) ( exp_implies expr1 ( exp_and expr2 q ) ) (* Shrink the continuation because of the skip *)
( exp_implies expr1 ( exp_and expr2 q ) ) (* Final WP *)
The first three steps show the expansion of the continuation due to the Seq statements in the input ; the rest of the steps show the gradual shrinkining of the continuation by processing the statements inside of the Seq statements .
Essentially , we have traded stack space for the activation records of wp for heap space for the continuation , and in the process have produced a tail - recursive function that does not consume stack space .
From here , we pass the propositional formula ( a VinE expression ) off to a theorem prover and receive an input that causes execution to reach the specified state with the specified condition .
However , this is once again beyond the scope of this entry .

The topic of software verification is very interesting and complex , even if slightly hors subject for openrce :)
Some notes could have helped the most novice audience to comprehend this .
For example , one sentence to explain that the first code snip is actually a matching ( or " type switch " ) on the anonymous function waited in second parameter .
Also , the undefined " simpl " function is ( I assume ) just a helper function performing pre-defined formula simplication during the computation of the WP , explaining it more in depth would have been even more HS however .
Beside this , great post !
Thanks for sharing !

Hey mayhem ,
Thanks for the comments ;
I 'm glad somebody understood :-)
You are correct on the second point ; simp just simplifies the expression as it is being built ( in Binary Analysis Platform , this defaults to id , e.g. fun x -> x ) .
On the first point , actually it is impossible to pattern - match on a closure , which is opaque .
The " = function " syntax
let rec wp q = function
is equivalent to
let rec wp q s = match s with .
It 's just terser and more explicit , so I like it better .
The second argument is of type Gcl.t , like the corresponding parameter for the second version .
Sorry for my sloppy editing having caused confusion .

Thanks for the precision .
I couldnt find the meaning of the = fucntion | syntax in the manual ( but finally found it in wikipedia ) .
Actually I got confused with the " fun -> " syntax which is to make use of an anonymous function , while " function | " seems indeed only to be a syntactic sugar for a function defined as a pattern matching , with parameter names and types left implicit .

Good post .
I totally agree with the first paragraph .
There are n't many good sources out there about how to be a good functional programmer ( you ca n't just go out and buy " Functional Design Patterns for Dummies " ) .

Disregarding what simp does , for the cps version to yield the same exp_and term as the non-cps , should the match for choice be :
| Choice ( s1 , s2 ) -> wp q s2 ( fun x -> wp q s1 ( fun y -> k( simp ( exp_and x y ) ) ) )
?

Sorry for the slow response ; I 'm on a mental vacation .
If there is a mistake in the above code , it 's in the non-CPS version , which is attributable to me .
The CPS version comes straight from the VINE release and is more likely to be correct than my rendition .
Last week , the Supreme Court 's overturned established law and ruled that , since corporations are people and money is speech , corporations can run commercials for their favorde candidates .
Legal scholars worry that Roe v. Wade is next on conservatives ' agenda .
Advertisement
Pro-choice advocates are worried about two things when it comes to the Supreme Court 's ruling in this case : the court 's willingness to abandon decades of established legal precedent ( stare decisis ) ; and the court 's decision to pick a legal question not explicitly presented to them by the case to overturn a law they 'd apparently already made up their minds about .
These very things are , when it comes down to it , exactly what anti-abortion advocates are cheering .
Josh Gerstein gets them all on the record in Politico :
" Yesterday 's Roberts court decision , which exhibited a stunning disregard for settled law of decades ' standing , is terrifying to those of us who care deeply about the constitutional protections the court put in place for women 's access to abortion , " said Nancy Northup of the Center for Reproductive Rights .
" We are deeply concerned .
...
Yesterday 's decision shows the court will reach out to take an opportunity to wholesale reverse a precedent the hard right has never liked . "
" It is worrisome beyond the direct impact of yesterday 's ruling on election law , " said , Jessica Arons , the director of the Women 's Health and Rights Program at the Center for American Progress .
" It 's certainly cause for concern . "

Anti-abortion advocates used the opportunity — again — to compare abortion to slavery .
" Where they disagree with the precedent and they think it 's wrong constitutionally , they 're not afraid to say it , " said the American Center for Law and Justice 's Jay Sekulow , an attorney who has argued church - state and campaign finance issues before the justices .
" Where they think the court got it wrong , they 're trying to correct that , and from my perspective that 's a good thing . "
An unthinking embrace of precedent would have protracted the effect of widely reviled rulings like the Dred Scott decision on slavery and the Plessy v. Ferguson decision upholding separate - but - equal treatment of the races , Sekulow said .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Not that Sekulow does n't love stare decisis when it works in his politically conservative favor , by the way .
Chief Justice Roberts used to love stare decisis , too .
When he was up for confirmation , he sang its praises .
" It 's settled as a precedent of the court , entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis , " Roberts said then .
" To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the judges , they need to be bound down by rules and precedents .
... I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent .
Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability and evenhandedness . "
Advertisement
Those days are , apparently , long gone .
Court watchers agree that the Roberts court seems to be more and more willing to take an activist stance on touchy political issues long since considered decided , including abortion , LGBT rights , the separation of church and state and the death penalty .
But just because getting rid of the former three and making the latter easier for states to put into practice are part of the Republican Party platform does n't mean that the justices are politically conservative or anything .
They 're just strictly interpreting the Constitution and established precedent — as long as said document and said precedents conform to their political opinions .

10:00 p.m. : Woken up by girlfriend under the covers .
I remember , again why I love this girl so much .
It ends with an amazing , intense orgasm for both of us .
Given my afternoon activities , it ’s amazing .
DAY SIX
11:00 a.m. : Take another day off work owing to flu .
This sucks .
Thank goodness for the broad array of free Internet porn .
3:30 p.m. : I realize how boring life is without work to break up the day .
I further realize how deadly life would be without sex .
9:30 p.m. : Drift to sleep in a NyQuil - enhanced haze .
I feel vaguely guilty that I have n’t touched my girlfriend in a whole 24 hours .
Disturbing dreams commence .
DAY SEVEN
6:30 a.m. : Get into a ridiculous fight with girlfriend over toothbrushes .
Leave the apartment angry .
11:00 a.m. :
We make up over the phone , and all is well again .
Trader next to me is looking at me funny again .
6:30 p.m. :
We make dinner at home , and have a near - silent meal , stealing very naughty looks at each other across the table .
7:00 p.m. : Drag each other into the bedroom and she attacks me .
We 69 and then finish with reverse cowgirl .
Hot , however , in the mounted combat I seem to have had clumps of leg hair removed from my body leading to a painful weird , red rash .
10:00 p.m. : Sweet , sweaty , but thankfully non-feverish dreams , spooning each other .
TOTALS : Three acts of masturbation ; seven acts of intercourse with girlfriend , including one threesome ; one filmed Internet porn .
A spokesman at the British embassy in Seoul said that North Korea had given verbal notice to foreign missions in Pyongyang on Tuesday and that it was already hard to use the old notes .
" We have heard from the British embassy in Pyongyang that it has become difficult to exchange North Korean currency in shops in Pyongyang since yesterday , " he said .
Parallel Tracking and Mapping for Small AR Workspaces - Source Code
PTAM ( Parallel Tracking and Mapping ) is a camera tracking system for augmented reality .
It requires no markers , pre-made maps , known templates , or inertial sensors .
If you 're unfamiliar with PTAM have a look at some videos made with PTAM .
Here you may download a reference implementation of PTAM as described in our ISMAR 2007 paper ( with the relocaliser from the ECCV '08 paper , and a Faugeras - Lustman initialiser instead of 5 PP ) .
This implementation was developed on Linux but should also compile on OSX and Win32 ( With Visual Studio ) ; please see the included README file for requirements and compilation instructions .
Have a look at a video of typical operation
This software is aimed at AR / vision / SLAM researchers !
It does not come with pre-made AR games like ``Ewok Rampage . ''
The only visualisation included is the four - eyed AVL logo shown in the usage video above .

It seems many people are having trouble initializing the system correctly .
Please remember that the camera must be translated , not just rotated , between the first two key - frames .
See below :
Feb 3 2014 - Added refernce to GPL release of PTAM
April 30 2010 - There 's now a blog at wordpress for all things PTAM - related .
Jan 28 2010 - If you had crashes in CameraCalibrator try the newest version .
Jul 14 2009 - The switch to TooN2 introduced a failure mode by which new points would immediately be erased , so the map would start empty and exploration would be slowed .
Fixed in r112 .
May 11 2009 - Finally spotted and fixed a really ancient ( and rather embarrassing ) bug in the bundle adjuster which made 19 out of 20 iterations less efficient .
Also PTAM now uses TooN2 rather than TooN1 .
Mar 9 2009 - Some people are reporting segfaults in TooN/ linoperators.h - if you get this try compiling with - fno - tree - vectorize ( I think this is a compiler bug ? )
Oct 3 2008 - r104 adds the frame - to - frame initialiser described in the ECCV '08 paper .
This provides more resilience to rapid camera pans .

( New York , 28 January 2010 ) : The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has contributed US $ 50 million to support the United Nations humanitarian response to the earthquake in Haiti .
This makes the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia one of the main contributors to the Haiti Flash Appeal , which was launched on 15 January .
The funds from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be transferred to Haiti's Emergency Relief Response Fund ( ERRF ) , which is a pooled fund managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) on behalf of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Haiti .
The ERRF is included in the Flash Appeal 's coordination section .
" This generous donation demonstrates that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands ready and prepared to support people in need of humanitarian assistance on the basis of core humanitarian principles and regardless of nationality , race or religion , " said Abdulaziz bin Mohamed Arrukban , the United Nations Secretary - General 's Special Humanitarian Envoy .
According to the OCHA Financial Tracking Service , the largest donors to the Haiti Flash Appeal as of 27 January are the United States ( $ 106,527,907 ) ; Canada ( $ 57,080,926 ) ; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ( $ 50,000,000 ) ; Spain ( $ 40,067,583 ) ; Sweden ( $ 18,158,036 ) ; France ( $ 16,883,114 ) ; Norway ( $ 11,542,460 ) and Denmark ( $ 10,664,564 ) .

Others are Cambodia ( $ 50,000 ) ; Liberia ( $ 50,000 ) and Senegal ( $ 1 million ) .
The Haiti Flash Appeal requested $ 575 million and is 77 percent funded , having received $ 443.6 million as of 28 January .
Uncommitted pledges amount to $ 13.1 million .
The devastating earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale hit Haiti on 12 January , killing and injuring tens of thousands of people and reducing large sections of several cities , including the capital Port - au - Prince , to ruins .
The disaster has left up to 1.1 million people homeless .
Hundreds of thousands of people require food , medical care , water , shelter and other basic needs .

Ken has written an article on reverse engineering the first FPGA chip , the XC2064 :
The FPGA was invented by Ross Freeman1 who co-founded Xilinx2 in 1984 and introduced the first FPGA , the XC2064 .

This FPGA is much simpler than modern FPGAs — it contains just 64 logic blocks , compared to thousands or millions in modern FPGAs — but it led to the current multi-billion - dollar FPGA industry .
Because of its importance , the XC2064 is in the Chip Hall of Fame .
I reverse - engineered Xilinx ’s XC2064 , and in this blog post I explain its internal circuitry ( above ) and how a “ bitstream ” programs it .

Jayson Werth is coming off a career season .
Given his first true chance to play everyday he set career highs in home runs , RBI and runs .
He tied his career high in stolen bases as well as posting a usable average .
He was a 35 /20 player , just what fantasy owners thirst for .
When you look at his line , you realize how good he was , but should he be going among the first 36 players selected on draft day ( his current ADP is 34.35 ) ?
Before we answer that question , let ’s take a look at just how good he was in 2009 :
571 At Bats
. 268 Batting Average ( 153 Hits )
36 Home Runs
99 RBI
98 Runs
20 Stolen Bases
. 373 On Base Percentage
. 506 Slugging Percentage
.309 Batting Average on Balls in Play
The number that jumps out at you is his power considering he had just 33 career home runs prior to the 2008 season .
He had shown signs of being a source of power , hitting 16 HR for the Dodgers in 2004 , but he had just never gotten the chance to put it on full display .
The past two seasons he ’s been consistent .
In 2008 he posted a slugging percentage of .498 , right in line with what he did last season .
The past two seasons he ’s posted HR / FB of :
2008 – 21.1 %
2009 – 19.3 %
At this point he ’s certainly proven that his power is very much for real , though there are a few flags worth mentioning .
He took advantage of his home ballpark in 2009 , hitting 21 of his 36 home runs there in 2009 .
Can he repeat that type of rate at home ?
He also showed a drastic rise in his flyball rate , going from 38.0 % to 44.4 % .
Over his career he ’s at about 40 % , so it would n’t be surprising to see his power fall a little bit in 2010 .
I ’m not suggesting a huge falloff , but 30 HR is probably going to be the limit .
With the power has come his opportunity to drive in runs .
When you hit primarily fifth or sixth in a lineup that features Chase Utley , Ryan Howard and Raul Ibanez , the opportunity is going to be there .
Chances are , in 2010 that is going to be able to continue .
The runs scored is a little bit less of a certainty .
While they have deepened their lineup a little bit , with the addition of Placido Polanco , they are n’t going to have real firepower in the seventh and eighth slots .
Shane Victorino is going to drive in some runs , but is it realistic to anticipate Werth closing in on 100 once again ?
That seems like a dream in my book .
Very few sixth place hitters have that type of potential , just considering the types of hitters behind them .
Werth is no different .
The average is very usable , but it is n’t elite and likely is n’t going up significantly without a lot of luck .
Over the past two seasons Werth has posted strikeout rates of 28.5 % and 27.3 % , respectively .
When you are producing that many outs without putting the ball in play , you need to have significant luck in order to post an average above .280 .
He also has n’t shown the ability to cut down on his strikeouts , considering his career mark of 29.5 % .
Simply put , he ’s not going to hurt you in the average department , but he ’s not likely to help you there either .
As for his speed , it is what it is at this point .
He ’s posted back - to - back 20 stolen base seasons and that should continue .
The thing is , while he ’s extremely efficient when he does run , he does n’t do it very often .
Over the past two seasons he has gone 40 - for - 44 in stolen bases .
That alone tells you not to look for a big increase in his totals .
Unless the Phillies instruct him to run significantly more , he just is n’t likely to do so .
So , let ’s see what we are looking at for 2010 :
.264 ( 145-550 ) , 29 HR , 95 RBI , 80 R , 19 SB , .309 BABIP , .362 OBP , .495 SLG
Now , the question is do those statistics deserve to be a third round selection ?
Here ’s just a few of the position players he ’s being drafted ahead of :
Kevin Youkilis
Ryan Zimmerman
Justin Morneau
Adam Lind
Pablo Sandoval
Carlos Beltran
That ’s not to mention that he ’s being selected before any pitcher not named Lincecum , Greinke , Sabathia or Hernandez ( most notably , he ’s going before Halladay , the # 2 pitcher on my Top 45 rankings posted yesterday which you can view by clicking here ) .
In fact , he ’s being selected around the same time as Justin Upton , who is , on average , going to selection before him .
Does Werth really belong in that class ?
He ’s a good player , needless to say , but with the anticipated dropoff in power and runs to go along with a modest average , at best , I just feel like this is a bit of a stretch .
He ’s a player I ’d like to own , but not at this position in the draft .
So , I would n’t anticipate him being on any of my teams in 2010 .
What about you ?
Would you select Werth this early ?
Where would you select him ?

My cousin Maxo has died .
The house that I called home during my visits to Haiti collapsed on top of him .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Maxo was born on November 4 , 1948 , after three days of agonizing labor .
“ I felt , ” my Aunt Denise used to say , “ as though I spent all three days pushing him out of my eyes . ”
She had a long scar above her right eyebrow , where she had jabbed her nails through her skin during the most painful moments .
She never gave birth again .
Maxo often complained about his parents not celebrating his birthday .
“ Are you kidding me ? ” I ’d say , taking his mother ’s side .
“ Who would want to remember such an ordeal ? ”
All jokes aside , it pained him more than it should have , even though few children in Bel Air , the impoverished and now shattered neighborhood where we grew up , ever had a birthday with balloons and cake .
When Maxo was a teen - ager , his favorite author was Jean Genet .
He read and reread “ Les Nègres . ”
These lines from the play now haunt me : “ Your song was very beautiful , and your sadness does me honor .
I ’m going to start life in a new world .
If I ever return , I ’ll tell you what it ’s like there .
Great black country , I bid thee farewell . ”
Two days after a 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti , on January 12 , 2010 , I was still telling my brothers that one night , as we were watching CNN , Maxo would pop up behind Anderson Cooper and take over his job .
Maxo was a hustler .
He could get whatever he wanted , whether money or kind words , simply by saying , “ You know I love you .
I love you .
I love you . ”
It always worked with our family members in New York , both when he occasionally showed up to visit and when he called from Haiti to ask them to fund his various projects .
The last time I heard from him was three days before the earthquake .
He left a message on my voice mail .
He was trying to raise money to rebuild a small school in the mountains of Léogâne , where our family originated .
The time before that , someone in the neighborhood had died and money was needed for a coffin .
With a voice that blended shouting and laughter , Maxo made each request sound as though it were an investment that the giver would be making in him or herself .
When my eighty - one - year - old Uncle Joseph , a minister , left Haiti , in 2004 , after a gang threatened his life , Maxo , his son , was with him .
They travelled together to Miami , hoping to be granted political asylum .
Instead , they were detained by the Department of Homeland Security and separated while in custody .
When Maxo was finally able to see his father , it was to translate for the medical staff , who accused my uncle , as he vomited both from his mouth and from a tracheotomy hole in his neck , of faking his illness .
The next day , my uncle was dead and Maxo was released from detention .
It was his fifty - sixth birthday .
Once the pain of his father ’s death had eased , he joked , “ My parents never wanted me to have a happy birthday . ”
“ At least we agree to disagree . ” Facebook
Twitter
Email
Shopping
After unsuccessfully pursuing asylum , Maxo returned to Haiti .
He missed his five young children , who were constantly calling to ask when he was coming home .
There was also his father ’s work to continue — small schools and churches to oversee all over Haiti .
The return , though , was brutal .
During our telephone calls , he talked about the high price of food in Port - au - Prince .
“ If it ’s hard for me , imagine for the others , ” he ’d say .
His time in detention in the United States had sensitized him to prison conditions and to the lack of prisoners ’ rights in Haiti .
He often called asking for money to buy food , which he then took to the national penitentiary .
This generosity , along with the Haitian sense of kindness and community , is perhaps why , immediately after four stories collapsed on Maxo on January 12th , family , friends , and even strangers began to dig for him and his wife and their children .
They managed to free his wife and all but one of his children , ten - year - old Nozial , from the rubble two days later .
Even when there was little hope , they continued to dig for him and for those who had died along with him : some children who were being tutored after school , the tutors , a few parents who had stopped by to discuss their children ’s schoolwork .
We will never know for sure how many .
The day that Maxo ’s remains were found , the call came with some degree of excitement .
At least he would not rest permanently in the rubble .
At least he would not go into a mass grave .
Somehow , though , I sense that he would not have minded .
Everyone is being robbed of rituals , he might have said , why not me ?
By the time Maxo ’s body was uncovered , cell phones were finally working again , bringing a flurry of desperate voices .
One cousin had an open gash in her head that was still bleeding .
Another had a broken back and had gone to three field hospitals trying to get it X - rayed .
Another was sleeping outside her house and was terribly thirsty .
One child had been so traumatized that she lost her voice .
An in - law had no blood - pressure medicine .
Most had not eaten for days .
There were friends and family members whose entire towns had been destroyed , and dozens from whom we have had no word at all .
Everyone sounded eerily calm on the phone .
No one was screaming .
No one was crying .
No one said “ Why me ? ” or “ We ’re cursed . ”
Even as the aftershocks kept coming , they ’d say , “ The ground is shaking again , ” as though this had become a normal occurrence .
They inquired about family members outside Haiti : an elderly relative , a baby , my one - year - old daughter .
I cried and apologized .
“ I ’m sorry I ca n’t be with you , ” I said .
“ If not for the baby — ”
My nearly six - foot - tall twenty - two - year - old cousin — the beauty queen we nicknamed Naomi Campbell — who says that she is hungry and has been sleeping in bushes with dead bodies nearby , stops me .
“ Do n’t cry , ” she says .
“ That ’s life . ”
“ No , it ’s not life , ” I say .
“ Or it should not be . ”
“ It is , ” she insists .
“ That ’s what it is .
And life , like death , lasts only yon ti moman . ”
Only a little while . ♦

Why Does the U.S Rank 29th in Longevity ?
Yes , the U.S. healthcare system is full of inefficiencies which lead to bloated costs .
But no , that ’s not the reason that U.S. longevity ranks only 29th in the world .
That ’s the gist of a working paper ( abstract here ; pdf here ) by Samuel H. Preston , a health demographer at Penn , and Jessica Y . Ho , a health economist .
As summarized in the NBER Digest :
The authors demonstrate that mortality reductions from prostate and breast cancers have been exceptionally rapid in the United States relative to a set of peer countries .
They argue that these unusually rapid declines are attributable to wider screening and more aggressive treatment of these diseases .
Screening for other cancers also appears unusually extensive , and five - year survival rates from all of the major cancers are very favorable .
Survival rates following heart attack and stroke are also favorable ( although one - year survival rates following stroke are only average ) , and the proportion of people with elevated blood pressure or cholesterol levels who are receiving medication is well above European standards .
These performance indicators pertain primarily to what happens after a disease has developed , though .
It is possible that the U.S. health care system performs poorly in preventing disease in the first place .
Unfortunately , there are no satisfactory international comparisons of disease incidence .
Some researchers report a higher prevalence of cancer and cardiovascular disease in the United States than in Europe , and biomarkers confirm that many disease syndromes are more prevalent in the United States than in England and Wales , for example .
Higher disease prevalence is prima facie evidence of higher disease incidence , although those high incidence rates also could be produced by better identification ( for example , through screening programs ) or better survival .
The history of exceptionally heavy smoking and the more recent increase in obesity in the United States suggest that a high disease incidence cannot be laid entirely at the feet of the health care system .
Evidence that the major diseases are effectively diagnosed and treated in the United States does not mean that there may not be great inefficiencies in the U.S. health care system , according to the authors .
A list of prominent inefficiency charges levied against the system include : fragmentation , duplication , inaccessibility of records , the practice of defensive medicine , misalignment of physician and patient incentives , limitations of access for a large fraction of the population , and excessively fast adoption of unproven technologies .
Some of these inefficiencies have been identified by comparing performance across regions of the United States , but the fact that certain regions do poorly relative to others does not imply that the United States on the whole does poorly relative to other countries .
The authors also note that many of the documented inefficiencies of the U.S. health care system simply add to its costs rather than harming patients .
They conclude that the low longevity ranking of the United States is not likely a result of a poorly functioning health care system .
This does n’t come as much of a surprise to anyone who ’s dug a bit into the healthcare data ( which is vast vast vast ) , but I do n’t believe the public thinks of the issue this way .
Many politicians also probably do n’t — and their positions are further compromised by the fact that , politically , it can be very hard to blame bad health outcomes on their voters ’ overeating , smoking , and other personal choices .
While we do n’t have a dedicated healthcare chapter in SuperFreakonomics , healthcare is probably the single most prominent topic throughout the book .
A lot of the stories we tell point to failures that could be easily corrected if the existing incentives were aligned less perversely than they are .
There are huge gains to be made , for instance , in decreasing hospital - acquired infections and paying attention to the inefficacy of many types of chemotherapy .
Also , it may be that less interaction with the healthcare system in general would be a very good thing .
Pico Computing SC - Series FPGA Cluster
Pico Computing today announced that it has achieved the highest - known benchmark speeds for 56 - bit DES decryption , with reported throughput of over 280 billion keys per second achieved using a single , hardware - accelerated server .
The FPGA computing platform assembled by Pico Computing for this demonstration , based on 11 Pico EX - Series PCI Express cards , reportedly consumes less than 1000 peak watts of power and fits into a single off - the - shelf 4U server .
The 56 - bit Data Encryption Standard ( DES ) is now considered obsolete , having been replaced by newer and more secure Advanced Encryption Standard ( AES ) encryption methods .
Nonetheless DES continues to serve an important role in cryptographic research , and in the development and auditing of current and future block - based encryption algorithms .
“ This DES cracking algorithm demonstrates a practical , scalable approach to accelerated cryptography , ” said David Hulton , Pico Computing Staff Engineer and an expert in code cracking and cryptography .
“ Previous methods of acceleration using clustered CPUs show increasingly poor results due to non-linear power consumption and escalating system costs as more CPUs are added .
Using FPGAs allows us to devote exactly the amount of silicon resources needed to meet performance and cost goals , without incurring significant parallel processing overhead . ”
Hulton ’s DES cracking algorithm uses brute force methods to analyze the entire DES 56 - bit keyspace .
The massively parallel algorithm iteratively decrypts fixed - size blocks of data to find keys that decrypt into ASCII numbers .
This technique is often used for recovering the keys of encrypted files containing known types of data .
The candidate keys that are found in this way can then be more thoroughly tested to determine which candidate key is correct .
Such brute force attacks are computationally expensive and beyond the reach of software algorithms running on standard servers or PCs , even when equipped with GPU accelerators .
According to Hulton , current - generation CPU cores can process approximately 16 million DES key operations per second .
A GPU card such as the GTX - 295 can be programmed to process approximately 250 million such operations per second .
When using a Pico FPGA cluster , however , each FPGA is able to perform 1.6 billion DES operations per second .
A cluster of 176 FPGAs , installed into a single server using standard PCI Express slots , is capable of processing over 280 billion DES operations per second .
This means that a key recovery that would take years to perform on a PC , even with GPU acceleration , could be accomplished in less than three days on the FPGA cluster .
“ Our research efforts in cryptography and our real - world customer deployments have given us unique insights into parallel computing methods for other domains , including genomics and simulations , ” said Dr. Robert Trout , Pico Computing Founder and President .
“ The use of an FPGA cluster greatly reduces the number of CPUs in the system , increases computing efficiency and allows the system to be scaled up to keep pace with the data being processed . ”
Pico Computing will demonstrate the FPGA - accelerated DES decryption algorithm at the Black Hat DC 2010 digital security conference , January 31 through February 3 in Arlington , Virginia .

The legislation would require lawmakers to join a public insurance plan included in healthcare legislation .
Vitter is also considering proposing banning physician services currently available to legislators at the Capitol as well as taxpayer - funded services they are allowed at Bethesda Medical Center and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center .

“ If we have a public option in this plan — and my hope is that we will — then I think there is nothing wrong with insisting that members of Congress be included , ” Dodd said .
“ We support it in our committee , and I 'm prepared to support it again here on the floor of the United States Senate . ”
“ I want to add my name to Sen . Coburn ’s amendment , ” Brown said in a floor speech on Friday .
“ Seventeen years ago , when I first ran for Congress , I promised I ’d pay my own health insurance until Congress passed health insurance for everyone .
I ’ve paid it out of my pocket since then .
I look forward with great eagerness to join the public option as soon as it ’s available . ”
Brown sent a Tweet upon leaving the Senate floor that he has been allowed to join the Coburn - Vitter effort .
A Coburn spokesman , however , pointed out that Brown actually voted against the Coburn amendment when the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions ( HELP ) Committee debated it .
" We ’re delighted to have Sen . Brown ’s support of Dr. Coburn ’s amendment , particularly after he voted against it in HELP Committee , " said spokesman John Hart .
" We ’re glad that he shares our view that members of Congress should lead by example and enroll themselves in the public option . "
A Brown spokeswoman said Coburn offered a different amendment in the HELP Committee , one that would require members of Congress plus their staffs to enroll in a public option plan .
The current Coburn - Vitter amendment which Brown is co-sponsoring would only apply to members of Congress .
A Vitter spokesman also said Friday that Vitter , who is up for reelection next year , has no objection to any Democrats co-sponsoring the amendment .
Members of Congress have a variety of healthcare plans and providers available to them under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , although senators have been considering some type of congressional requirement as part of any bill .

Some people think that garden gnomes are totally useless .
However , a growing number of homeowners are considering the use of these quirky little statues as items to provide personal protection instead of using pepper spray or other more lethal deterrents .
If you detect a threatening character on your doorbell camera monitor you can yell out , " Stay back ! --
Do n't try anything , I have a garden gnome and I 'm not afraid to use it ! "
That proclamation should send anyone with half a bit of sense scurrying on their way .
Some time ago a grandmother in Wadebridge , England , who was alarmed by the sound of an intruder on her roof reacted instictively to protect her property .
" I grabbed the first thing that came to hand — one of my garden gnomes — and hurled it at him , and hit him , " she recalled .
The culprit was blind - sided , and as he lay there screaming in pain , the woman went into the house and armed herself with a rolling pin , since she did n't want to damage another gnome .
The police were alerted by neighbors and the offender was arrested .
As evidenced by this incident , one can see the logical sense of having garden gnomes protecting your house .
Intruders are likely to think of gnomes as mere whimsical , silly and somewhat tasteless garden decorations , rather than granny - guided missiles .
Ben W. Strowbridge , PhD , associate professor of neuroscience and physiology / biophysics , and Phillip Larimer , PhD , a MD / PhD student in the neurosciences graduate program at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine , are the first to create stimulus - specific sustained activity patterns in brain circuits maintained in vitro .
Their study will be published in the February 2010 issue of Nature Neuroscience and is currently available online .
Neuroscientists often classify human memory into three types : declarative memory , such as storing facts or remembering specific events ; procedural memory , such as learning how to play the piano or shoot basketballs ; and working memory , a type of short - term storage like remembering a phone number .
With this particular study , Strowbridge and Larimer , were interested in identifying the specific circuits that could be responsible for working memory .
Using isolated pieces of rodent brain tissue , Larimer discovered a way to recreate a type of working memory in vitro .
He was studying a particular type of brain neuron , called mossy cells , which are often damaged in people with epilepsy and are part of the hippocampus .
" Seeing the memory deficits that so many people with epilepsy suffer from led me to wonder if there might be a fundamental connection between hippocampal mossy cells and memory circuits , " said Larimer .
Mossy cells are unusual because they maintain much of their normal activity even when kept alive in thin brain slices .
The spontaneous electrical activity Larimer and Strowbridge found in mossy cells was critical to their discovery of memory traces in this brain region .

When stimulating electrodes were inserted in the hippocampal brain slice the spontaneous activity in the mossy cells remembered which electrode had been activated .
The memory in vitro lasted about 10 seconds , about as long as many types of working memories studied in people .
" This is the first time anyone has stored information in spontaneously active pieces of mammalian brain tissue .
It is probably not a coincidence that we were able to show this memory effect in the hippocampus , the brain region most associated with human memory , " said Strowbridge .
The scientists measured the frequency of synaptic inputs onto the mossy cells to determine whether or not the hippocampus had retained memory .
" Memory was not evident in one cell but it was evident in a population of cells , " said Strowbridge .
Larimer , who had just published another paper with Strowbridge on experiments recording electrical signals simultaneously inside four brain cells ( Journal of Neuroscience , November 2008 , " Nonrandom local circuits in the dentate gyrus " ) , was already familiar with recording from multiple cells / neurons .

" Like our own memories , the memories we created in isolated brain slices were stored in many different neurons or cells , that 's why we had to watch several different cells to see the stored information , " said Strowbridge .
Larimer and Strowbridge also found the brain circuit that enabled the hippocampus to remember which input pathway had been activated .
The memory effect occurred because of a rare type of brain cell called semilunar granule cells , described in 1893 by the father of neuroscience , Ramón y Cajal .
The semilunar granule cells have an unusual form of persistent activity , allowing them to maintain memory and connect to the mossy cells .
That was the foundation for this paper .
The semilunar granule cells remained an obscurity for more than a century until Strowbridge 's group rediscovered them in a paper they published in 2007 .
Semilunar granule cells are the third type of brain cell that Strowbridge 's group has uncovered .
In 2006 , Strowbridge 's group published a report in the journal Neuron about Blanes cells , which Cajal named for one of his medical students that are involved in the sense of smell .
That study opened a new approach to understanding the memory impairment in Alzheimer 's disease , a disease that often involves changes in the perception of smells .
Strowbridge 's group is now looking into how much information they can store in the hippocampus .
" It took us four years to be able to reproducibly store two bits of information for 10 seconds " says Larimer .
" Our findings should progress faster now that we know what to look for and have found the brain circuit that actually holds the memory . "
This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health .
The Senate on Wednesday easily approved a minimum 14 - week extension of unemployment insurance for millions of Americans who have exhausted their benefits .
The 98 - 0 vote concludes a four - week standoff between the majority party and GOP leaders over the size and scope of the extension , a slightly different version of which passed the House more than a month ago .

The Senate 's effort now heads to the House .
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) said the lower chamber could vote on the bill by Thursday ’s end .
“ Many of our nation ’s unemployed workers have been anxiously waiting for these benefits to come through , and I ’m happy to report that relief is on the way , " said Sen . ( D - N.H. ) at a press conference after the vote .
" Our work to stabilize the economy and create jobs does not stop here , but we took an important step today to do the right thing for American workers and their families , " she added .
The bill provides 14 weeks of unemployment insurance to Americans in every state , with an extra 6 weeks of jobless benefits for those workers in states with average , three - month unemployment rates above 8.5 percent .
That differs a bit from the proposal House lawmakers approved in September , which only offered additional weeks of unemployment benefits to states that broke the 8.5 percent jobless threshold .
Democrats in the Senate rallied against that proposal at the beginning of October , complaining that it disadvantaged jobless workers in states that were weathering the recession .
The unemployment insurance bill has so far survived a bumpy trajectory , especially in the Senate .
The bill stalled for weeks on the Senate floor because of a partisan debate over process .
The chamber 's Republicans have said they generally support extending unemployment benefits , but they initially opposed the Democrats ' proposal because the majority party refused to consider a series of GOP amendments .
The party initially proposed nine revisions , including one that targeted immigration verification rules and another that would have revised a portion of the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Also among the GOP 's amendments was one that would have required Congress to pay for its unemployment insurance extension using unspent TARP money , rather than through an extension of an unemployment tax levied on employers , the Democrats ' proposed funding mechanism .
Democratic leaders blocked most GOP amendments , seeking to limit them to only three .
Democrats argued that the Senate has already voted on similar measures as part of other legislation .
" They are only trying to delay and stall things , " Senate Majority Leader ( D - Nev. ) said on Tuesday , before Democrats called for cloture .
" We have done more legislating on voting on non-germane , non-relevant amendments this Congress I think than any time in the history that I 've been around .
And we 've done it because the Republicans said that 's what they wanted , and I wanted to be fair .
"
In the end , none of the GOP amendments received floor votes .
Democrats did , however , add to their bill two provisions that had GOP support : an extension of a first - time homebuyers ' tax credit and an expansion of the net operating loss carryover tax break , which allows struggling businesses refunds on past taxes .
" This bill , in the end , is a jobs bill , " Sen . ( R - Ga. ) said before the vote , noting the bill would help the economy " come back . "
The main arrangement of principles while applying the diversion system when you need to get young ladies .
She will then begin to appreciate you by being a tease and she will do this subliminally .
As the familiar axiom goes , you generally need what you can�t have .
Since the inner self is locked in the young lady you are after should recover prevalence with her gathering of companions .
The explanation behind this is her companions have a self - esteem that is lower than the young lady you are focusing on and by setting enthusiasm on her companions will start to move her sense of self .
When moving toward a young lady that you are occupied with you will utilize switch brain research by diverting your advantage onto the young lady�s companions .
The trouble of getting young ladies can be dealt with by utilizing a strategy called the diversion system .
She knows this since she feels it and her level of significance is raised .
In the event that she begins to play or be energetic with you her feeling of worth will diminish among her companions .
In this manner , she goes about as though she is out of your class by acting like she is too bravo .
There is a motivation behind why the young lady doesn�t appear that intrigued by you despite the fact that you are keen on her .
It doesn�t mean you are not her write ; it has nothing to do with this .
It is her brain research and social standings among her companions .
The young lady you are occupied with has her feeling of worth expanded by her sense of self when she is with her companions , only for the reason of influencing her the one you to need .
You choose to go to a bar with a few companions and a young lady grabs your attention , you take a gander at here endeavoring to make an association with her , you grin she grins and no fun loving signals are returned .
Is she playing hard to get , her companions appear to be cordial , mindful and coy .
By utilizing this sort of framework it will enable you to encounter Chennai Escorts young ladies in a way that other men could never get it .

Emphasis on the “ claims to … ”
CitizenLink reports that a new study in the Journal of Marriage and Family has found that not only are same - sex parents just as fit as heterosexual parents , and not only that , but sometimes lesbian couples even outperform straight parents .
( The data has backed this up for a while , actually . )
The headline for their piece is “ Experts Debunk Study Claiming Two Moms Better Than Mom And Dad . ”
Notably missing in the piece , however , are any experts doing any actual debunking .
There is simply a baseless assertion from Glenn Stanton :
“ They ’re just completely overreaching their hand , ” he said .
“ Are we to think that nature has really sent each one of us down a second - rate road of having to be raised by a man and a woman ? ” ( …)
“ The research is very , very clear and it backs up what God has put into process , ” Stanton said , “ that a man and a woman are the best people to raise that child to healthy adulthood . ”
Stanton says the findings appear to reveal an agenda on the part of the researchers and not scientific conclusions .
Right , Glenn .
Whatever .
Perhaps in the fundamentalist Christian world that passes for an “ expert opinion . ”
As we ’ve seen in the Prop 8 trial , when anti-gay “ experts ” are put under oath , the results are nothing short of hilarious .
But note that Glenn does n’t link to any research , does n’t cite any studies , or anything .
In short , he lazily throws out some meaningless fundamentalist catchphrases and anti-scientific BS and assumes that ( maybe because he believes it himself ) he ’s won the argument .
Maybe that flies with the average Focus on the Family wingnut , but in the real , grown - up scientific world ?
Sadly , no .
Play again next time , Glenn .
UPDATE : It seems Glenn has issued a ( slightly ) more detailed response to this study .
As it is late , I will not be dealing with it tonight , but I ’ll stomp it into the ground sometime tomorrow , I promise .

Bad news Katie Price !
Millions of men think women wear too much - make up and prefer the natural look
Millions of men think women wear too much make - up and prefer girls who adopt a more natural look .
Research revealed one in five men wish their partner would tone down the slap - on while one in ten said they liked women who wear no make - up whatsoever .
Thick layers of caked - on foundation , a favourite fashion trait of celebs like Jordan and Christina Aguilera , emerged as one of the biggest turn - offs - as did overdoing blusher .
Turn off : Celebrities who pile on the war paint , like Katie Price , left , Christina Aguilera and Amy Winehouse , right , might have trouble attracting men
Gloopy mascara and panda eyes caused by leaving make - up on overnight were also hailed as a no - no by the nation 's men .
But while around 18 per cent wish their partner would ease off on the war - paint broaching the subject was n't so easy .
Just over half said they had voiced their opinion .
But honesty is n't always the best policy as one in ten of those who did break the bad news were dumped soon afterwards .
The study also found 12 per cent of women admitted wearing too much .
Barely there : Jennifer Aniston , left , and Halle Berry rock the natural beauty look
Yesterday a spokesman for skincare experts St Ives , who carried out the research among 2,000 adults , said : ' For many guys , makeup can act as a barrier between them and their partner , and it seems they simply prefer their women to go natural .
' But it 's interesting to see that the majority of men were reluctant to admit this to their partner .
' This seems to be part of a bigger issue between the genders as many women also admitted they were n't happy with their skin condition .
' So it would appear that women are wearing makeup to hide bad skin , not simply to impress the opposite sex .
' If women felt more confident that their skin was in good condition they would n't need to wear so much make - up to cover up . '
The study also found men do n't like false eyelashes , bright lipstick , Amy Winehouse - style eyeliner ' flicks ' , dark lip - liner and pencilled - in eyebrows .
It also emerged more than four out of ten women nearly always put make - up on before leaving the house .
And 15 per cent admitted they would n't dream of walking out of the front door without war paint on .
Almost two thirds owned - up to wearing a full - face of make - up to work most days , with one in twenty claiming they had been warned by their boss about wearing too much .
Thirty - nine per cent even claimed they dreaded their husband or boyfriend seeing
them before they have applied their make - up .
But the researchers also found 23 per cent of women who cake on the make - up are using it to mask their lack of confidence , while 30 per cent think they are hiding behind it .
TOP TEN MAKE -UP TURN - OFFS ( ACCORDING TO MEN )
1. Lipstick on teeth
2 . Too much blusher
3 . Thick foundation
4. Panda eyes
5. Clumpy mascara
6. Bright lipstick
7. Foundation tide mark around the jaw - line
8. Bright blue eyeshadow
9. Penciled - in eyebrows
Doing nothing and hoping for the best is seldom the best way to meet imminent danger .
I was kicking myself : we had probably been one of the few sports or businesses that had foreseen the problems of 2008 and taken steps to prepare ourselves – but ( for all the wrong reasons ) we had not finished the job .
Now we had to finish it .
We knew that if we delayed , it would be too late for any new team to build a car for 2010 .
So we published the principles of our new rules mid-March .
Then , in the continuing absence of any dialogue with FOTA and after discussing the matter in two WMSC meetings , we published detailed rules on April 29 .
When it comes to customizing your desktop , OS X seemingly provides anything you could want — there are a number of Apple - provided images , there are connections to your user ’s Pictures folder and iPhoto library , or you can use any of 10 provided solid colors for your desktop background .
But if you ’re a fan of solid colors , you may not agree with the 10 that Apple has provided .
Thankfully , there are two relatively easy ways to get additional color choices .
One way to get more solid color choices is to actually add them to the Solid Colors section of the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preferences panel .
The 10 colors shown here ( Mac OS X 10.4 users — there ’s a ‘ hidden ’ solid white color at the end of your list ; it shows up with a drop shadow in 10.5 ) are just PNG files stored in a folder on your Mac .
To create more colors , navigate to the top - level Library -> Desktop Pictures folder in the Finder .
Select any one color in that folder , and duplicate it ( Command - D , or File -> Duplicate ) , and then rename it to reflect the color you ’d like to use .
Note that colors appear in the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preferences panel based on their name .
As a result , to make your colors show up at the top of the list , for instance , preface their names with a space .
( You ’ll need to be logged in as an administrator to change this folder . )
Now open the duplicated and renamed image file in your favorite image editor , and change its color to the one you ’d like to use .
Basically , that ’s all there is to it — the next time you load the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preferences panel and select the Solid Colors folder , you ’ll see the new color swatch you created .
Repeat this process for as many colors as you ’d like to regularly use .
The only problem — and it ’s not a big problem — with modifying files in this manner is that it leaves your modified color swatches with different ownership than those of the system - provided swatches .
If you ’d like to fix this , select your modified swatch and press Command - I ( File -> Get Info ) .
In the Sharing & Permissions section , click the lock icon and enter your password to make changes .
Highlight the Staff row and click the minus sign to delete it .
Then click the Plus sign and click on Administrators in the new window that appears ; then click Select .
Click on the pop -up next to admin in the Get Info window , and change the permissions to Read & Write .
When you ’re done , it should appear as in the image at right , though with a different username .
Keep in mind that this method also places new files in a System - owned folder , so they may get wiped out with the next major system update .
( I would n’t expect a minor update , such as OS X 10.5.3 when it ’s released , to modify the images in this folder . )
Given that we ’re at least a year or two away from OS X 10.6 , though , that ’s not much of a worry right now .
What if you ’d rather not create additional image swatches — you ’d rather have the flexibility to just pick any given color from a standard Apple color picker to use as a solid background ?
With just a bit of trickery , you can do just that .
When you use a desktop image that ’s smaller than your monitor ’s resolution , the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preferences panel gives you a few choices for handling them — they can be tiled ( repeated ) to fill the screen , fit to the screen , zoomed to fill the screen , stretched to fill the screen , or simply centered .
The secret to this trick is that when you elect to center a smaller desktop image , you also get to specify the color — using the standard Apple color picker — that you ’d like to use to fill the rest of the background .
So to use any color you like as a solid desktop background , all you need is a completely transparent desktop picture that ’s smaller than your screen .
When you “ display ” this image in centered mode , it will be invisible ( because it ’s transparent ) , leaving you with the solid color surround covering your entire desktop .
You can create a transparent image in any of the usual image editors , or I happen to have a 32 - by - 32 pixel image I created just for this hint that you ’re welcome to use .
Save this file as blankpic.png , somewhere on your system where you wo n’t erase it but it wo n’t get in your way .
Open the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preferences panel , and then drag blankpic.png into the image well area at the top of the Desktop panel .
Click on the pop -up menu next to the well and set it to Center , then click the color - filled box to the right to display the standard OS X color picker .
Select a color in the picker , and watch it change instantly on the desktop .
When you ’ve got the color just right , close the color picker and you ’re done .
Whenever you want a new color , just open the Desktop tab of the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preferences panel , click the color wheel , and choose your color .
Obviously , you can use both of these methods — add a few favorite colors as their own swatches , and then use the color picker method for those times when you ’d like a color you have n’t previously created .
The Peugeot 406 remains in the Union Canal , near Winchburgh in West Lothian
Two men have been charged with reckless conduct after a car which was being driven on a frozen canal plunged through the ice .
The men , aged 24 and 22 , are accused of driving a Peugeot 406 on the Union Canal , near Winchburgh in West Lothian , on Monday afternoon .
The ice gave way but the occupants managed to escape from the car , which was found by the emergency services .
The two men are expected to appear in court at a later date .
A police spokesman said : " While it goes without saying that the vast majority of people have the good sense not to take their vehicles on to frozen waterways , this incident serves as an example of the type of stupidity that the emergency services occasionally have to deal with . "
He added : " The ice is now starting to thin , and there is always going to be the danger that it will give way , with potentially fatal consequences . "
Recognizing faces is an important social skill , but not all of us are equally good at it .
Some people are unable to recognize even their closest friends ( a condition called prosopagnosia ) , while others have a near - photographic memory for large numbers of faces .
Now a twin study by collaborators at MIT and in Beijing shows that face recognition is heritable , and that it is inherited separately from general intelligence or IQ .
This finding plays into a long - standing debate on the nature of mind and intelligence .
The prevailing generalist theory , upon which the concept of IQ is based , holds that if people are smart in one area they tend to be smart in other areas , so if you are good in math you are also more likely to be good at literature and history .
IQ is strongly influenced by heredity , suggesting the existence of " generalist genes " for cognition .
Yet some cognitive abilities seem distinct from overall IQ , as happens when a person who is brilliant with numbers or music is tone - deaf socially or linguistically .
Also , many specialized cognitive skills , including recognizing faces , appear to be localized to specialized brain regions .
Such evidence supports a modularity hypothesis , in which the mind is like a Swiss Army knife -- a general - purpose tool with special - purpose devices .
" Our study provides the first evidence supporting the modularity hypothesis from a genetic perspective , " said lead author Jia Liu , Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at Beijing Normal University in China of the study published in the Jan. 7 issue of Current Biology .
" That is , some cognitive abilities , like face recognition , are shaped by specialist genes rather than generalist genes . "
" Our finding may help explain why we see such disparities of cognitive abilities within the same person in certain heritable disorders , " added co-author Nancy Kanwisher of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT , where Liu studied before moving to Beijing .
In dyslexia , for example , a person with normal IQ has deficits in reading , while in Williams Syndrome , people have low IQ but excellent language skills .
For the study , Liu and his colleagues recruited 102 pairs of identical twins and 71 pairs of fraternal twins aged 7 to 19 from Beijing schools .
Because identical twins have 100 percent of their genes in common while fraternal twins have just 50 percent , traits that are strongly hereditary are more similar between identical twins than between fraternal twins .
( Identical twins still show variability because of the influence of environmental factors . )
Participants were shown black - and - white images of 20 different faces on a computer screen for one second per image .
They were then shown 10 of the original faces mixed with 20 new faces and asked which ones they had seen before .
The scores were more closely matched between identical twins than fraternal twins , and Liu attributed 39 percent of the variance between individuals to genetic effects .
Further tests confirmed that these differences were specific to face recognition , and did not reflect differences in sharpness of vision , general object recognition abilities , memory or other cognitive processes .
In an independent sample of 321 students , the researchers found that face recognition ability was not correlated with IQ , indicating that the genes that affect face recognition ability are distinct from those that affect IQ .
Liu and Kanwisher are now investigating whether other cognitive abilities , such as language processing , understanding numbers , or navigation , are also heritable and independent from general intelligence and other cognitive abilities .
Researchers at the Beijing Normal University and Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences contributed to this research : Qi Zhu , Yiying Song , Siyuan Hu , Xiaobai Li , Moqian Tian , Zonglei Zhen and Qi Dong .
In addition to providing new insight into the structure of the mind , this work could shed light on the underlying causes of developmental disorders like autism and dyslexia .
" The heritability of these cognitively specific diseases suggests that some genes have specific cognitive effects , but it 's a big mystery how genes produce cognitively specific effects , " said Kanwisher .

The song is a lie .
That was the first thing that crossed my mind when I walked out of Madison Square Garden sometime near 4 a.m .
The city does in fact sleep .
Or at the very least power - naps .
Aside from a stretch of cabs lined up on Seventh Avenue , there was n't much happening in New York City in the wee hours of March 13 , 2009 .
Maybe Gotham was just worn out after hosting what goes down as one of the most unforgettable college basketball games in memory .
Syracuse 127 , Connecticut 117 .
Six overtimes , three hours , 46 minutes , beginning at 9:36 p.m. on March 12 , ending at 1:22 a.m. on March 13 .
I remember everything and nothing all at once .
I remember seeing Eric Devendorf hop on the press table just a few feet from me at the end of regulation , celebrating and gesturing at the crowd , convinced his 28 - footer at the buzzer had won the game .
I remember Kemba Walker nearly scoring from midcourt at the second OT buzzer .
I remember the usher standing sentry in front of me during game breaks , sometime around the fourth OT , muttering , " Ca n't we just go to a shootout ? "
I remember laughing the laugh of the overtired and punchy with my colleague Mark Blaudschun from The Boston Globe after Andy Rautins hit a tying 3 - pointer , erasing what had been a Connecticut six - point lead in the third overtime .
Mostly , though , I remember the crowd .
No one left the arena , and more , no one sat down .
The groans when shots failed to fall to end the game in the first , second and third overtimes gave way to cheers when the game was n't decided in the fourth and fifth extra periods , the basketball masochists among us clearly hoping the game would never end -- and no doubt recognizing this would be the ultimate " I was there " game to brag about to the poor suckers who did n't score a ticket .
Afterward we crowded into the tiny Syracuse locker room and around Jonny Flynn .
He had just played 67 minutes , scored 34 points and dished out 11 assists .
He looked like a dishrag wrung dry , with every bit of sweat and energy poured out of him .
I halfway knew how he felt -- minus , of course , the physical exertion , cramping , sweating , exhaustion and pressure .
I spent 14 hours in the Garden that day and night , arriving for the noon tipoff between Villanova - Marquette , a buzzer - beating Wildcats win that I was so sure would be the best game on the day that I quickly dashed to the computer to write it .
A few hours later West Virginia upset Pittsburgh , another great game .
And then the game that would go down in history .
When I finally opened my eyes the next morning , my father called me in my hotel room .
" Were you there ? " he asked excitedly .
" Yeah , yeah I was , " I told him .
" I saw it . "
And , I wanted to add , I saw the city , fast asleep .

In early 2008 , while federal investigators were busy looking into disgraced financier Robert Allen Stanford for his part in an alleged $ 8 billion fraudulent investment scheme , Eastern European hackers were quietly hoovering up tens of thousands of customer financial records from the Bank of Antigua , an institution formerly owned by the Stanford Group .
According to a fraud investigator with firsthand knowledge of the break - in , the hackers responsible infiltrated a component of the Stanford Group 's network by exploiting vulnerabilities in the company 's web servers and databases .
On the condition of anonymity , the investigator shared with this author files recovered from the breach , which were stored in plain text for at least several weeks on a website controlled by the attackers .
This source said he forwarded the same information on to the FBI shortly after discovering it in early 2008 .
Once inside Stanford 's network , the unidentified hackers appear to have swiped the credentials from an internal network administrator .
They soon had downloaded the user names and password hashes for more than 1,000 employees of Stanford Financial , Stanford Group , Stanford Trust and Stanford International Bank .
Among the purloined files is a listing of what appears to be ownership and balance information for tens of thousands of customer accounts at Bank of Antigua .
Each listing includes the account number , owner 's name , address , balance and accrued interest .
Mr. Stanford is set to go on trial this month for allegations that he led a $ 8 billion fraud scheme .
In addition , federal authorities reportedly have been investigating whether Stanford was involved in laundering drug money for Mexico 's notorious Gulf Cartel .
Many of those account holders listed in the inventory of accounts gave addresses in the United States , but a large portion belong to individuals in South America and Mexico .
While most of the accounts were worth between $ 10,000 and $ 50,000 USD , more than a thousand accounts had balances between $ 100,000 and $ 900,000 .
Nearly all of the accounts with balances in excess of $ 1 million apparently belong to an organization or individual named " Kadima Panamena . "
An official with the U.S. Justice Department confirmed that the agency had received a copy of the purloined files , and that the documents contained information concerning Stanford 's holdings that the government did not previously possess .
But the official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation , said it remains unclear what , if any , impact the documents may have had in the government 's case against Stanford .
It 's also unclear whether the hackers managed to steal any funds from the accounts listed in the recovered documents , or indeed whether the attackers ever had direct access to Bank of Antigua accounts .
Still , a set of documents found with the account information suggest the perpetrators did a fairly thorough job mapping the internal networks connecting Stanford offices in Austin , Baton Rouge , Boca Raton , Boston , Denver , Ft. Lauderdale , Houston , Memphis , Miami , Montreal , New York , San Francisco , Sugarland and Washington , D.C .
Also listed in the network map is a location called " Newspapers " – which may be reference to The Antigua Sun , a newspaper formerly owned by Stanford – as well as " CSTAR " and " CSUN , " which probably refers to airlines once owned by Stanford – Caribbean Star Airlines and Caribbean Sun Airlines .
According to the private investigator , the perpetrators used what the government has described as a " hacking platform , " a series of web servers that were leased out to criminal gangs for the purposes of breaking into customer databases belonging to banks and retailers through so - called SQL - injection attacks .
Indeed , the source said , the hacking platform used in this attack was the source of several other such attacks against financial institutions around that same time frame , including OmniAmerican Credit Union and Global Cash Card , a distributor of prepaid debit cards used mainly for payroll payments .
Global Cash Card and OmniAmerican were both named as breach victims in the U.S. government ’s case ( .pdf ) against Israeli hacker Ehud Tenenbaum , a 29 - year - old man who made headlines in the late '90s for breaking into Pentagon computers .
The U.S. government also cites the use of hacking platforms ( .pdf ) in its prosecution of Albert Gonzalez , the Florida computer hacker who pleaded guilty last week to conspiracy charges for intrusions into Heartland Payment Systems .

What tips can the wise editors give a working mom like me on how to keep getting a paycheck by working 40 - 50 hours a week , while making a decent home life for my two kids and husband ?
What ’s the secret ?
As it turns out , the secret is … politics .
It ’s not just about me and my family .
Nope .
It ’s about millions of families searching for the same thing .
Which means it ’s in the structure of society , and to change it leads you to politics .
Americans work longer hours than workers in Japan and most European countries , according to a new report , “ The Three Faces of Work - Family Conflict . ”
The typical middle - income family works 11 hours more per week in 2006 than it did in 1979 , the report authors Joan Williams and Heather Boushey say .
More hours at work inevitably leads to fewer hours with family .
The report puts work - family conflict at a much higher rate than elsewhere in the industrially - developed world , 90 percent of American mothers and 95 percent of American fathers say they have work - family conflict in their lives .
According to a Monster.com survey five years ago , 81 percent of the respondents said they were unhappy with their work / life balance .
In the U.S. , eighty percent of married couples are dual income earners .
That ’s a lot of unhappiness .
According to “ The Three Faces ” report Americans lack less family - support laws than the rest of the industrially - developed world .
So in France , for example , there are paid maternity - leave laws and paid sick days .
Plus , in France and other countries , child care is subsidized , thereby making it more affordable and better quality .
The report looks at families and moms across the income spectrum from professional / upper income women to middle income ( they call the missing middle , some 50 percent of the workforce , which has not been studied ) to poor women .
The authors say each category experiences the family - work conflict , but they experience it differently .
And it ’s those differences that weaken a potential political coalition that could win more family - friendly laws , the authors say .
But , the report states , each group needs “ four basic kinds of supports and protections ” :
• Short - term and extended leaves from work , including paid time off for family and medical leave and paid sick days .
• Workplace flexibility to allow families to plan their work lives and their family lives .
• High-quality and affordable childcare so that breadwinners can concentrate on work at work , and
• Freedom from discrimination based on family responsibilities .
The report , a collaboration between Center for American Progress and the Center for WorkLife Law at the UC Hastings College of the Law , urges progressives to build a coalition that can attract poor , professional and middle - income women despite the tensions and differences in needs between the groups .
Seems that high - quality and affordable childcare is key to any family - friendly policies , and perhaps economic growth .
I remember hearing the stories about the 1940s , and when the U.S. entered WWII .
Men , by the droves , entered the armed forces and women went into the factories to fill the labor shortage .
Almost overnight , I was told , the government got day care centers up and running for these working women , the “ We Can Do It ” generation .
And after the war , almost overnight , policies changed .
Except for a brief period in the 1960s and programs like Head Start , or in 1993 with the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act , childcare has not been on the political agenda of this nation .
So much for the much lauded “ family values ” rhetoric .
This report comes out at a time when a union , civil rights , community coalition is forming to demand massive job creation .
Affordable and high quality child care and attention to the needs of families could help broaden and deepen the reach of this budding movement , and possibly help unite the three faces of family work conflict .

C- SPAN Urges Televised Merger of Dems ’ Health Bill
Created : January 05 , 2010 10:41 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The news that Democrats in the House and Senate will likely marry their health reform bills in closed - door sessions — not in a formal conference committee — strays a long way from President Obama ’s campaign - trail claim that the entire process would be televised for the world to see .
And the discrepancy has n’t been lost on the folks at C - SPAN , who sent a letter to Democratic leaders last week requesting that the merger be broadcast .
“ President Obama , Senate and House leaders , many of your rank - and - file members , and the nation ’s editorial pages have all talked about the value of transparent discussions on reforming the nation ’s health care system , ” C - SPAN CEO Brian Lamb wrote .
“ Now that the process moves to the critical stage of reconciliation between the Chambers , we respectfully request that you allow the public full access , through television , to legislation that will affect the lives of every single American . ”
Some Democratic leaders are in Washington this week to begin the informal discussions over how to combine the two bills .
No word yet whether they ’ve responded to Lamb ’s request .
Update , 3:09 p.m : The Iowa Independent digs up video from a December 2007 campaign stop in Washington , Iowa , in which Obama pledged that all health care reform negotiations will be televised on C - SPAN .

We are all beset with doubts sometimes .
Even the most self - assured and successful people can be unsure of themselves .
Some people are clearly more confident than others , though .
To what extent this is ‘ nature ’ and ‘ nurture ’ is unclear , though I suspect that ‘ nurture ’ has a lot to do with it .
I ’ve seen my own confidence wax and wane over the years , and external factors have certainly played a part .
Some signs that you might be lacking somewhat in confidence are :
Thinking that other people are better than you
Expecting the worst outcome
Engaging in negative self - talk
Feeling the need to justify your behavior to others
Overreacting to criticism
Not having many friends or avoiding social situations
Body language that is defensive and closed .
If you have some of these traits , perhaps you need to consider building more confidence .
Can this be done ?
I think it ’s clear is that confidence , like most other traits , can be developed .
Like a muscle , with training and in time , it can become strong and powerful .
To put it another way : confidence is a habit – confidence begets confidence .
Here are some training ideas to develop this most important of habits .
Make friends with your failings and limitations
This is a key area .
Obviously , you are not perfect – far from it .
So long as you are challenging yourself , stepping out of your comfort zone and seeking to develop , you will be making mistakes .
The mistakes are signs of growth and nothing to be ashamed of ..
Confident people are comfortable in their own skin , happy with themselves in all their imperfection .
They have nothing to prove .
Do n’t be pushy or aggressive
Confidence can manifest itself in many different ways , and sometimes there is a visibly assertive quality to it , but there is also a quieter and more restrained confidence .
When you meet a confident person , you tend to pick up that the person is happy with himself and feels comfortable in her own skin .
Confidence does not mean aggressive , pushy , loud or superior , which is often a sign of over - compensation for some kind of inferiority complex .
Do n’t be defensive
Listening to and acting on criticism is an important part of being confident .
It is often very hard for us to be objective about ourselves , and other people can give us great insights into our strengths and weaknesses .
Of course , we have to be critical about the things that people tell us , not falling into credulity and taking everything they say at face value .
But the insights afforded by others can be very valuable .
If people laugh at you or attack you , this probably says more about them than about you .
Insecure people often try to cover up their feelings of inadequacy by falling into such behaviors .
Do what you believe to be right
Confident people tend to rely on an internal guidance system to keep them going along the right track , whereas those with less confidence can be buffeted around by other people ’s opinions and agendas .
Having an inner compass is an essential part of living assertively and confidently , and following the compass can sometimes mean having to take risks .
But without risk , there is no growth .
Set challenging goals
Confident people tend to live in a more conscious and deliberate way , setting goals for themselves .
They are secure enough to tolerate failure , and are comfortable with not getting things right first time .
If we are not growing , then we are falling back – there is always movement .
As we challenge ourselves , our comfort zone grows , and this growth often involves the pain of failure .
This pain is too much for insecure people to bear .
But to confident people , failure is only a stepping - stone , not the destination .
Success , for confident people , is inevitable .
It ’s only a matter of time .
Keep a record of your achievements
It is common for people with limited self - confidence to compare themselves unfavorably with others .
Such people may assume that others are ‘ better ’ and have achieved more , so it can be very helpful to make a list of achievements .
If you do this , you may find that the list is longer than you thought .
Imagine what you would think if this were a list of someone else ’s achievements .
Would you be impressed ?
Would you think highly of that person ?
Learn to be optimistic
People who lack self - confidence are often pessimistic about the future and tend to think the worst .
It ’s important to replace negative , self - defeating mental chatter with upbeat , positive self - talk .
All day long , thoughts are swirling around inside our head and we need to be conscious about this .
Such self awareness is n’t easy , but with some gentle persistence you can become more aware of your thoughts and , when you catch yourself thinking in a negative way , replace the thought with something more positive .
Examples of negative thinking are : exaggerating the negative aspects of things , taking things personally , feeling you are being blamed for things or feeling like a victim , to name just a few .
Simply being aware of negative thinking modalities can be a great help in overcoming them .
When you catch yourself thinking in such negative ways , try to replace the thought with something more self - affirming .
Take a balanced approach
The benefits of confidence are clear but , as with most things , too much of it can be unhealthy .
Over - confidence , which can lead to errors of judgment and under- performance , is dangerous and should be guarded against .
Confidence is about getting the balance right .
Relax
Confident people are more relaxed , happier and enjoy situations , however challenging , a lot more than those with low self - esteem , trusting that they can deal with whatever problems and challenges might arise .
If you fail , if you get it all wrong , it wo n’t be the end of the world .
If you ’re tense and worried about how you ’re being perceived , your energy is being wasted – it ’s not going into the matter at hand .
So let go , take the focus of attention off yourself , relax and enjoy the ride .
“ Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy . ” ~ Norman Vincent Peale
The benefits of being confident are clear : you ’ll be happier , more relaxed and probably healthier .
You ’ll use time more effectively because you wo n’t be worrying endlessly about other people ’s opinions , and you ’ll have a clearer sense of purpose , so you ’ll be a lot more effective .
Confidence , in a sense , is the key to happiness and fulfillment .

More turbines like these will soon be seen around the UK coast Prime Minister Gordon Brown is launching a £ 100 bn programme to build more offshore wind farms .
Bids for tenders for nine zones around territorial waters and the Continental Shelf were submitted to the Crown Estate , which owns the seabed to a distance of 22.2 km off the UK coast .
The opportunity attracted some of the big energy players : Southern Energy , E.On and Scottish Power , as well as Norway 's Statoil , Germany 's RWE and Sweden 's Vattenfall .
It will create one of the biggest infrastructure projects for wind energy in the world , with construction beginning in 2014 at the earliest .
" It 's easy not to grasp the scale of challenge , " says Benj Sykes , senior technology acceleration manager with the Carbon Trust .
Taller than the Gherkin
This is the third round of tenders for the construction of wind farm zones around the UK .
But this time the project is huge .
The turbines will be erected in water depths of up to 60 m , compared with 25 m for previous rounds .
They will be positioned up to 205 km off the coast , compared with 25 km now .
About a third of the country 's energy will be provided by these new wind farm zones by 2020 , experts hope .
The areas put up for grabs this time were the Moray Firth , Firth of Forth , Dogger Bank , Bristol Channel , Irish Sea , Hornsea in East Yorkshire , Norfolk , Hastings in East Sussex and western Isle of Wight .
The biggest site will be at the Dogger Bank zone , located about 100 km off the East coast .
In total , the successful bidders estimate the farms will generate 32 gigawatts of electricity .
Huge potential According to the British Wind Energy Association , the UK has potentially the largest offshore wind resource in the world , with relatively shallow waters and a strong wind resource extending far into the North Sea .
Offshore turbines are difficult to maintain in bad weather The UK has been estimated to have more than 33 % of the total European potential offshore wind resource , which is enough to power the country nearly three times over .
Each of the new zones will each have a range of energy - producing capacity .
According to figures released by the winning licence bidders , the smallest will be able to produce around 600 megawatts and one , based at the Dogger Bank zone , will have a capacity of 9,000 megawatts .
To put this into context , an average coal or gas powered station produces between 1,000 and 1,500 megawatts .
Offshore farms are more expensive to build .
Per megawatt of stored energy capacity , a gas powered station costs £ 1 m to build , a nuclear power station costs £ 3 m and a wind farm costs £ 3 m .
Offshore farms are weather dependent .
Whereas a nuclear power station operates all the time , a wind farm only operates when the wind is blowing .
However , there are no expensive fuel costs involved in wind farming .
If one of these turbines goes down , it could be out of action for the whole of the winter period
Andy Cox , KPMG
And offshore wind farms are arguably less of an eyesore than a power station or , indeed , an onshore wind farm .
The benefits are clear .
No -one can see the turbines out at sea , they do not make as much noise as their onshore cousins and they can be bigger , which means they can produce more energy .
But they are far trickier to look after .
" One of the biggest challenges to offshore wind farms is ongoing maintenance , " says Andy Cox , energy partner at KPMG .
" If one of these turbines goes down or experiences a technical failure in November , it could be out of action for the whole of the winter period , because they are difficult to get to . "
Job creation Overwhelmingly , wind turbines are manufactured in Europe , with very little activity in Britain .
But this could change , as many see great possibilities for developing the industry and creating thousands of jobs off the back of the zone tenders .
" It 's a massive opportunity , if you look at what 's happened with onshore manufacturing in Europe , " says Charles Anglin from the British Wind Energy Association .
Manufacturers are not going to invest millions of pounds if they think the market is risky
Charles Anglin , British Wind Energy Association .
" It 's created 20,000 jobs in Denmark , 30,000 jobs in Spain and 80,000 in Germany .
We have 6,000 .
If we build only 20 gigawatts of offshore wind farm capacity by 2020 , and two - thirds of that is built in the UK , that could create over 45,000 jobs , " he says .
Some ask why manufacturers would now be tempted to build turbines in the UK when they have been reluctant before .
" We can get the government to put together an attractive enough package for manufacturers to invest in turbine factories in the UK , but these factories need to be based in ports .
But many ports have been modified for the container industry and not manufacturing , " says Charles Anglin from the British Wind Energy Association .
But he says the government is taking this opportunity very seriously .
" It 's low - profile publicly , but there is a government taskforce talking to manufacturers .
We anticipate a couple of manufacturers making decisions in the next few months to say where they are going to make the turbines . "
So how do you go about creating an environment in which people will readily invest ?
" We need a policy of stability , so manufacturers know that this market can take place .
Manufacturers are not going to invest millions of pounds if they think the market is risky . "

Apple does have different math !
As some of you know , I 've been wrestling with programs giving different numeric output when run on the MacBookPro than they do when run other places , and not understanding why / why - not .
Damian managed to dig this up for me :
http://www.mail-archive.com/gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org/msg208162.html
Which seemed pretty familiar to my troubles , but there was n't any action on it .
Well , I 've learned some things -- much more than ever I wanted to .
I figured I 'd share this with the lot of you , especially since I can't help but wonder whether this does n't affect the Perl build and test suites , etc .
I was * sure * that MacOS did something different with floats than other x86 processors did , and it * is * so !
One need but look at the comments in < float.h > to see that this truly DELIGHTFUL tidbit is true : Note :
There are actually two physical floating point environments on x86 .
There is the one described by the x87 floating point control and status words , which applies primarily to calculations done with long double on MacOS X for Intel .
There is the MXCSR which applies primarily to calculations done with scalar float , scalar double and SSE / SSE2 / SSE3 .
The high level interface , which uses FE_ macros as int arguments
So I 'm not crazy , after all .
( Ok , so this is evidence , not proof . :-)
It 's very hard ( next to impossible ) to guarantee the same code will do the same thing somewhere else .
This is ... troubling .
Here now is proof positive that something is different on MacOS FP .
The same trivial program , compiled with identical options , when run there says : Trying compiler constants first ... f is 0.12345 , rounded to 0.1235 , expanded to 0.12345000356435775756835937500000000000000000000000000 d is 0.12345 , rounded to 0.1235 , expanded to 0.12345000000000000417443857259058859199285507202148438 ld is 0.12345 , rounded to 0.1235 , expanded to 0.12345000000000000000026020852139652106416178867220879

[ Program after sig . ]
Those are different numbers , different behaviors , and different sorts of " rounding " .
You will ( almost ) never get the floating point - number 0.12345 ( actually , there * is* no such thing : not a reciprocal power of 2 , you know ) to " round towards even " , because of the garbage data far out down the line , the way things get ( or do n't ) get put into registers or coprocessors , and much else .
You 're at the mercy of very subtle forces largely beyond your control and understanding unless you put a * lot* of time into it .
No matter what you think your rounding strategy is , stuff way out in never - never land can put you a little under or a little over what it takes to do whatever you 've defined the right thing to be , and therefore , sometimes , you just are n't going to get it .
Yes , I know : in double precision , or 8 - byte floating point , we have only 15 decimal digits in the significand .
That 's all there is , and you can't wheedle or whine , weasel or whimper any more out them .
That what is all that GUNK ?
And why are they affecting me ?
I believe the most polite and gentlemanly way to refer to those digits in excess of what the standard guarantees is to call them " garbage " .
But I can think of plenty of other words for them , and I 'm sure you can , too .
It seems like the only way to get reliable behaviour is to pay the big CPU - bucks for cycles and abandon all float ye who enter : $ perl - Mbigrat - le ' print ( 12345 / 100_000 ) ' 2469/20000 $ perl - Mbignum=p , -65 - le ' print ( 12345 / 100_000 ) '
0.12345000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Did you realize that there seem to be about 7 floating - point types out there .
* SEVEN * And I 'm not counting Vax stuff or old stuff , either .
Did you EVER have ANY idea ?
I sure did n't !
And it gets better , because * how * these map to a float , a double , and a long double varies * considerably * amongst environments .
Digits of C Type Byte Mantissa 's Precision Name Size base - 10 base - 2 short float 2 ~3 11 float 4 6 24 double 8 ~ 15 53 long double : 80 bit ext prec 12 or 16 18 64 binary 128 16 ~ 34 113
Furthermore , many sources concur that long doubles -- which could be quite a few different things , as you see -- are n't necessarily expected nor guaranteed to behave as doubles do .
Some of this is some FP reps have odd numbers of ( binary ) digits in their mantissa , and others have even numbers of bits .
This seems pretty certain to cause otherwise identical values to round differently .
For example , regarding the true quad- precision floats that IEEE 754-2008 defines , like on a PowerPC :
By default , 1/3 rounds down like double precision , because of the odd number of bits in the significand .
So the bits beyond the rounding point are 0101 ... which is less than 1 /2 of a unit in the last place .
Apple has plenty of its own quirks , ones you 'd never normally notice .
A big one seems to be what I started this message says : that MacOS on x86 uses something called x87 floating - point , while everybody else on x86 uses standard x86 FP math .
But wait !
There 's more .
On a PowerPC , a long double gets you a quad - precision " binary 128 " float , with 113 base - 2 digits of mantissa , or ~ 34 decimal digits .
But on x86 the same code gets merely the 80 - bit " extended precision " type , only 3 decimal digits better than the old 8 - byte doubles .
( Painfully , these 10 - byte floats never take up 10 - bytes .
they want 12 bytes on a 32 - bit addressable system , and 16 bytes on a 64 - bit one ! )
And sometimes these can cost you .
Here 's a comment from an #include file : fma ( ) * function call * is more costly than equivalent ( in - line ) multiply and add operations
For single and double precision , the cost is n't too bad , because we can fall back on higher precision hardware , with the necessary range to handle infinite precision products .
However , expect the long double fma to be at least an order of magnitude slower than a simple multiply and an add .
There are other things , too , like hardware registers with a lot more precision than you ask for ; eg , imagine if all FP math were done in 80 - bit FP registers , no matter what .
Usually it is , in fact .
Compare , and watch what happens when you try to get double - precision floating - point to produce a longer string of correct answers -- and notice the one and only answer of all these which is EXACTLY CORRECT : $ perl - Mbignum=p , - 65 - le ' print ( 8/3 ) '

I 'm amazed that the math tests in Perl 's regression test suite pass as well as they do .
( Or maybe they are n't so persnickety ? )
Is n't that just ... nifty ?

A priest has insisted he did nothing wrong in joining a group of people who openly supported a convicted sex offender in court prior to the man being sentenced .
Fr Sean Sheehy joined 40 to 50 local men who queued up to shake hands and embrace Danny Foley in the Circuit Criminal Court in Tralee yesterday .
Foley , of of Meen , Listowel , Co Kerry , denied the sexual assault charges against him .
CCTV footage showed the 35 - year - old carrying a young women to the skip area in the town centre car park where she was later found semi-conscious , half - naked and covered in scratches and bruises .
Foley told gardai that he “ found your wan ” in the skip area as he was going to relieve himself .
Two weeks ago a jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict .
Yesterday Foley was sentenced to seven years jail and he will be placed on the sex offenders register for life .
Presiding judge Donagh McDonagh criticised Fr Sheehy ’s character witness statement during sentencing .
Speaking to Claire Byrne on Newstalk , Fr Sheehy defended his support for the convicted man and described the sentence as “ harsh ” .
“ To hand down a seven year sentence in that kind of situation , it seems to me is a miscarriage of justice , ” Fr Sheehy said .
The Castlegregory parish priest says he backed Foley because he knew him to be an “ even tempered , placid individual . ”
“ I just wanted to support him and let him know he was n’t alone , ” Fr Sheehy said .
When asked how he felt about supporting a man found guilty of sexual assault , the priest said “ the fact is , it was an alleged attack ... but the jury convicted him . ”
He added that had he known the victim , he would have shook her hand too .
“ My Christian responsibility was to the person I know , ” he said .
Fr Sheehy denied claims that the hand - shaking and hugging of Foley by the group of men was organised .
He said he ’d been asked to say hello to the defendant by his mother .
“ I was simply responding to her invitation , she ( Foley ’s mother ) was completely broken - hearted , ” he said .
Online Editors
These are the questions that launched Russ Baker into five years of research .
The answers , based on hundreds of interviews , including with persons close to the Bush family who had never talked with reporters , proved astounding .
Not only , Baker found , had we missed the very essence of W. , but also of his father and grandfather and in fact the entire clan .
Moreover , behind the secrets of the Bushes and their circle lay larger ones that cast decades of American history in a new and revealing light .
The Bushes have been portrayed as everything from incompetents to ideologues to outright crooks .
Many of their transgressions are now well known -- from grandfather Prescott ’s involvement with Nazi-era financiers to W. ’s initiatives that weakened Americans ’ constitutional rights at every turn .
But Baker ’s research took him to far deeper levels of insight into the American power machine , as it unearthed material of the sort more commonly identified with shady foreign regimes or Hollywood thrillers than with the still - hallowed U.S. presidency .
Baker explained this in a post- publication interview : “ As I discovered , there was an entire hidden stratum of truth underlying the rise of the Bushes -- a truth that , if not reckoned with , threatens to derail the reforms we all hope are on the horizon . ”
The copious evidence Baker assembles points to one jarring conclusion : that the parade of faces in the Bush White House were in fact bit players in a long - playing “ shadow government ” establishment that continues to influence events regardless of who -- or what party -- occupies the White House .
Power cliques in this country , it turns out , function much as they do elsewhere in the world .
Here , however , they are better hidden , in part -- paradoxically -- because we think our society is so open that hidden centers of power could not exist .
There is a tendency in America to tar anyone who sees larger configurations and coalescences of interests , irrespective of the quality of their research , as " conspiracy nuts . "
Yet the revelations and lessons of Family of Secrets come at us on practically every page , and with sourcing and documentation that have stood up to scrutiny .
Moreover , they offer us a glimpse into something deeply embedded in our body politic , and profoundly dangerous to our democratic traditions .
Chapter 1 : How Did Bush Happen ?
Baker explains how he came to write this book , and the extent to which his discoveries surprised him and forced him to re-examine popular assumptions about George W. Bush , his father George H.W. Bush -- and , ultimately , about how power in America works .
He began with a sense that behind the George W. Bush presidency lay “ something more consequential and pervasive -- well beyond the missteps , overreaching , and palace intrigues one finds in all presidential administrations . ”
“ Above all , the deception at the root of the decision to invade Iraq and the disastrous occupation that followed only confirmed my feeling that the assumption of power by Bush pointed to something deeper than a callow and entitled president surrounded by enablers and Iagos with dark schemes . ”
The inquiry into W. quickly leads to W ’s father .
“ To my surprise , I began to see that understanding George H. W. Bush ( Senior , or Poppy , as his relatives and friends call him ) was really the key to understanding the son-- and not just in the simplistic , psychoanalytical terms to which some commentators have resorted . ”
Despite the conventional narrative of a father - son rivalry , the two were basically members of a single team with a deep bench and a long , if little - known , track record .
It was this team that put W. into play : “ George Bush the younger was essentially cleaned up , reconditioned , and then ‘ managed ’ into becoming his father ’s successor in the White House . ”
After recounting some of the more egregious acts of George W.’s administration , he writes : “ None of these developments looks so surprising when one considers the untold story of what came before .
This book is about that secret history , and the people and institutions that created it . ”
Baker explains the inherent paradox that defines the Bush clan : “ [ W ] hile serving forces that operate best in the shadows , the Bushes craved for themselves a place in the spotlight .
To get what they wanted and to do what they felt they must , they had to live what amounts to double lives .
Even as the Bushes gained fame and power , they managed to somehow avoid careful scrutiny …
So adept were they at this game that they are almost never mentioned in their colleagues ’ writings …
It is almost as if this clan never existed until the moment it occupied the White House . ”
Chapter 2 : Poppy ’s Secret
In the first of Family of Secrets ’ many dramatic scenes , an entertainment reporter stumbles upon an obscure declassified document that reveals George H.W. “ Poppy ” Bush ’s secret : Long before he was appointed CIA director under Gerald Ford in 1976 , and labeled as an “ intelligence virgin , ” Poppy Bush already was connected to the CIA .
More particularly , he had been working with extremist Cuban exiles at the time of the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
Poppy tried to ascribe the reference found by the reporter to “ another George Bush . ”
But other documents indicate that he had been involved in super - secret covert domestic operations some two decades before his directorship , and that his 1950s offshore drilling company was a cover operation .
Baker bolsters this discovery with evidence that Poppy Bush was engaged in intelligence work as early as World War II .
Further , he provides background on the role of banking circles around Poppy ’s father , Prescott , in creating America ’s modern intelligence establishment .
Chapter 3 : Viva Zapata
This chapter deals with the Bush family ’s ties to the origins of the American intelligence establishment .
We learn how the Bushes got into the “ family business ” of munitions , finance and intelligence work .
And we take a behind - the - scenes look at Dresser Industries , an oilfield services firm through which the Bushes got into defense contracting and the petroleum industry .
After his Naval Intelligence work in World War II , Poppy goes to Yale , where the early CIA is busy recruiting -- particularly through secret societies like the Bush family favorite , Skull and Bones .
Then we see how Poppy ’s early days as an apprentice in oil and defense contractor affiliates of his family ’s investment bank coincided with the growth of an oil - defense - intelligence hub in Texas .
This led to Poppy Bush ’s decision to leave the East Coast behind and move to the Lone Star State .
Meanwhile , US senator Prescott Bush and his former business partners are powers behind the throne during the Eisenhower presidency , a relationship sharpened by their close ties to Ike ’s new CIA director , Allen Dulles , and Prescott ’s personal role as a senator in supervising assassination activities abroad .
In this context , it becomes apparent why powerful Washington figures , including the owner of the Washington Post , enamored of the spy apparatus and transfixed by the Cold War struggles , step up and fund Poppy ’s obscure little oil company .
As the evidence builds that Poppy ’s tiny offshore drilling outfit was an intelligence cover , we see how the Bush circle began moving against Fidel Castro after he expropriated their Cuban holdings .
Chapter 4 : Where Was Poppy ?
Poppy Bush has claimed not to remember where he was on November 22 , 1963 , the day John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas .
That ’s odd , since almost every other American alive at that time can recall where he or she was .
Poppy ’s amnesia become stranger still -- or perhaps , more understandable -- when declassified documents show ( 1 ) that he was working in Dallas for the CIA at the time , and ( 2 ) that he called the FBI from a town near Dallas at the very hour Kennedy ’s death was being announced .
In that call , Bush Sr. introduced himself as a private citizen , and offered a supposed tip about a possible suspect -- a man who turned out to be innocent , and to have ties back to Bush himself .
Though the tip was a red herring , it served a clear purpose : to establish that Poppy was not in Dallas at the time of his call .
Baker exhaustively explores
Bush ’s activities that week and day , which included spending time with a top CIA expert on removing government leaders .
He also dissects a peculiar Nov. 22 letter purportedly written by Barbara Bush and published by her decades later , that explains -- too artfully by half -- the couple ’s movements at the time .
Baker reveals the deep animus toward President John Kennedy harbored by the Bushes and their friend , CIA director Allen Dulles , whom JFK had fired in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs disaster .
And he describes the dramatic , sudden changes in the lives of both Prescott Bush and his son in the wake of that firing .
Chapter 5 : Oswald ’s Friend
In 1976 , a letter arrives for CIA director George H. W. Bush .
His aides assume it is from a crackpot -- the writer claims that some kind of net is closing in on him , and attributes this to his having been indiscreet in talking about Lee Harvey Oswald .
Bush acknowledges to his perplexed staff that he actually knows the man , who is an anti-communist Russian émigré named George de Mohrenschildt .
Poppy Bush confirms in an internal memo that de Mohrenschildt did indeed have some connection to Oswald -- but says he cannot recall the details of the Oswald connection .
This is strange , stranger still for the head of the US spy agency .
Bush writes back to de Mohrenschildt that he has nothing to fear .
Yet within a year the man is dead from a shotgun blast to the head .
The official verdict is suicide .
Baker begins a lengthy exploration of de Mohrenschildt ’s ties to the Bush family , and to oil interests generally , dating back many decades .
And he details the previously unknown military - oil - intelligence pipeline that brought anti-communist Russians out of the Soviet Union and settled them in Dallas , where they were plugged into business and society at the highest level .
We learn of de Mohrenschildt ’s involvement with lucrative oil investment schemes in Cuba that were upset by Fidel Castro ’s revolution , and his ties to what is described as a “ private CIA ” serving the interests of wealthy Americans abroad .
Also revealed are De Mohrenschildt ’s links to many figures identified in one way or another with the JFK assassination story -- from Abe Zapruder , whose footage of the assassination became a crucial piece of the conventional narrative of that day , to the leader of a military intelligence unit whose members included many members of the Dallas police department , and whose associate forced himself into the pilot car of Kennedy ’s motorcade .
Chapter 6 : The Hit
In this chapter Baker identifies the large array of powerful interests who were furious at John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby , the attorney general -- and explains why these interests were glad to see an end to Camelot .
Central to this story is JFK ’s feud with the CIA and especially Allen Dulles .
Another important element is the threat posed by the Kennedys to the oil depletion allowance – the foundation of much of the oil barons ’ wealth .
The Pentagon also had reasons to want the Kennedys out of power .
In revealing how Kennedy ’s replacement , Lyndon Johnson , was tied to the same interests as the Bushes , Baker lays bare the close links between Johnson and the Bush family .
In weaving an alternative narrative of the Kennedy assassination , Baker details Allen Dulles ’s activities after he was fired by Kennedy and relates them to Oswald ’s background with intelligence and the military that suggests that his “ defection ” to the USSR was part of a US - run “ false defector program . ”
There are indications that Oswald was actually doing intelligence work at the time he took his job in the Texas School Book Depository .
Poppy Bush ’s old friend George de Mohrenschildt and his wife began to “ manage ” Lee Harvey Oswald ’s life in the year prior to the assassination .
Was this part of an elaborate attempt to focus attention on Oswald , and away from prominent Dallas figures and the CIA group ?
Baker also reports how de Mohrenschildt was moved offshore prior to November 1963 , thereby minimizing his direct connection ( and that of Bush and others ) to the events of Nov. 22nd .
Baker unpacks the evidence that Oswald was falsely implicated in the assassination to cover for the real culprits .
He reveals De Mohrenschildt ’s ties to the owner of the Texas School Book Depository , the building from which Oswald purportedly fired the fatal shots .
Baker shows how Oswald was guided into his job in the building , and reveals the military connections of the company that hired him .
Finally , we see these key figures , all tied to super - secret military and intelligence activities , converging on November 22 .
In summarizing the copious facts that place Poppy and his circle much closer to the assassination than has ever been revealed , he asks the simple question : Can all this be coincidence ?
Chapter 7 : After Camelot
Beyond the outlines of a sophisticated operation behind Kennedy ’s death , Baker ’s research turns up new indications of something more enduring and hence perhaps even more unsettling .
Namely , an ongoing effort to dissuade the public from connecting the dots and to perpetuate the increasingly untenable official story : that Oswald , operating alone , killed Kennedy .
We start with the role of Bush associates in the aftermath of the assassination and the ensuing investigation .
Particular emphasis is placed on the role of Jack Crichton , an oil industry operative with an intelligence background who was , along with Poppy Bush , part of the cadre at the top of the small Texas GOP .
Crichton was also head of a Dallas - based military intelligence unit tied to the Russian exile community .
His role included controlling Marina Oswald ’s translated comments to police , which were actually modified to implicate her husband .
This circle used Oswald ’s purported ties to the Soviets and Cubans to set off a chain of events that nearly precipitated a missile attack on Cuba .
Baker reveals how the discredited Warren Commission was practically run by Bush family friend Allen Dulles , the CIA director deposed by JFK .
It was staffed almost exclusively by figures with ties to the CIA , the military - industrial complex , and right - wing business interests arrayed against the Kennedys .
This explains the Commission ’s transparent effort to ensure that their interviews of de Mohrenschildt would not lead back to powerful figures .
De Mohrenschildt himself expressed bewilderment at the Commission ’s feeble questioning of him .
In the fall of 1963 , Poppy ’s reason for traveling around the state was a futile bid for a US Senate seat .
Having lost , he gets to Washington soon enough -- elected in 1966 to the House of Representatives .
He quickly takes advantage of his official capacity to travel to Vietnam with the ex CIA - man who helped him launch his earlier intelligence - cover offshore oil business .
Declassified documents show the man requesting that the Agency arrange cover for his trip with Bush .
I do n't know which single book I liked most in 2009 .
The DWT Bookstore has pages of my faves -- the ones Ken and I are always referring to -- fromandtoand , of course , Russ Baker 's Family of Secrets , a 600 page thriller that digs more deeply into the Bush Family than anyone has ever done .
The paperback is now in its third edition and I 've been urging Russ to work with someone on doing a synopsis that we could use to turn people on who are intimidated by books with hundreds of pages .
Yesterday he finally sent me something that can be used here at .
He starts with the questions many of us have asked over and over again : " How did the spectacularly unqualified George W. Bush come to be the President of the United States , and arguably the most powerful person in the world ?
What lay behind his improbable rise and disastrous policies ?
Was there more to his controversial reign than the pundits ’ standard bromides ?
" Below are brief summaries of the first seven chapters , hopefully enough to mkae you want to buy a copy of the whole thing .
It gets even better .
You should consider picking up a copy .

The type of drink did not appear to change the results Drinking alcohol every day cuts the risk of heart disease in men by more than a third , a major study suggests .
The Spanish research involving more than 15,500 men and 26,000 women found large quantities of alcohol could be even more beneficial for men .
Female drinkers did not benefit to the same extent , the study in Heart found .
Experts are critical , warning heavy drinking can increase the risk of other diseases , with alcohol responsible for 1.8 million deaths globally per year .
The study was conducted in Spain , a country with relatively high rates of alcohol consumption and low rates of coronary heart disease .
The research involved men and women aged between 29 and 69 , who were asked to document their lifetime drinking habits and followed for 10 years .
Crucially the research team claim to have eliminated the " sick abstainers " risk by differentiating between those who had never drunk and those whom ill - health had forced to quit .
This has been used in the past to explain fewer heart - related deaths among drinkers on the basis that those who are unhealthy to start with are less likely to drink .
Good cholesterol
The researchers , led by the Basque Public Health Department , placed the participants into six categories - from never having drunk to drinking more than 90g of alcohol each day .
This would be the equivalent of consuming about eight bottles of wine a week , or 28 pints of lager .
People should not be encouraged to drink more as a result of this research
Professor Martin McKee

Alcohol unit guide
For those drinking little - less than a shot of vodka a day for instance - the risk was reduced by 35 % .
And for those who drank anything from three shots to more than 11 shots each day , the risk worked out an average of 50 % less .
The same benefits were not seen in women , who suffer fewer heart problems than men to start with .
Researchers speculated this difference could be down to the fact that women process alcohol differently , and that female hormones protect against the disease in younger age groups .
The type of alcohol drunk did not seem to make a difference , but protection was greater for those drinking moderate to high amounts of varied drinks .
The exact mechanisms are as yet unclear , but it is known that alcohol helps to raise high - density lipoproteins , sometimes known as good cholesterol , which helps stop so - called bad cholesterol from building up in the arteries .
' Binge - drinking ' UK experts said the findings should be treated with caution because they do not take into account ill - health from a range of other diseases caused by excess drinking .
" Whilst moderate alcohol intake can lower the risk of having a heart attack , coronary heart disease is just one type of heart disease .
Cardiomyopathy , a disease of the heart muscle , is associated with high alcohol intake and can lead to a poor quality of life and premature death , " said the British Heart Foundation 's senior cardiac nurse , Cathy Ross .
" The heart is just one of many organs in the body .
While alcohol could offer limited protection to one organ , abuse of it can damage the heart and other organs such as the liver , pancreas and brain . "
The Stroke Association meanwhile noted that overall , evidence indicated that people who regularly consumed a large amount of alcohol had a three - fold increased risk of stroke .
" Six units within six hours is considered ' binge - drinking ' and anyone indulging in regular ' binge - drinking ' increases their risk of stroke greatly , " said research officer Joanne Murphy .
Public health specialists warned no - one should be encouraged to drink more as a result of this study .
" The relationship between alcohol and heart disease remains controversial , " said Professor Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
" While there is good evidence that moderate consumption is protective in people who are at substantial risk of heart disease - which excludes most people under the age of 40 - we also know that most people underestimate how much they drink .
This paper adds to the existing literature but should not be considered as definitive . "
In the UK , the recommendation is no more than two to three units of alcohol a day for women - the equivalent of one standard glass of wine - and three to four units for men .
The British Liver Trust said : " There have been several studies suggesting that small amounts of alcohol can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in men over the age of 40 .
" But these are often misinterpreted by people looking for a health reason to consume alcohol .
" If you want to look after your health , stay within the limits of no more than 3 - 4 units a day for men or 2 - 3 for women and aim to give yourself at least two days off alcohol a week . "
Professor Alan Maryon - Davis , president of the UK Faculty of Public Health , agreed that the message from this study was not clear : " At the end of the day , you 're juggling different risks and benefits , maybe helping your heart or maybe damaging your brain and liver .
" The simple message is moderation .
" Stick to the guidelines , and you wo n't go far wrong . "

Gordon Brown and other senior British politicians have angrily condemned China for executing a British man said to have had mental problems .
Akmal Shaikh , 53 , was killed early this morning by lethal injection after being convicted of drug smuggling .
Despite frantic appeals by the Foreign Office for clemency , Shaikh was executed at 10.30 am local time ( 2.30 am British time ) in Urumqi .
Campaigners believe he is the first European in 58 years put to death in China .
Shaikh , a father of three from Kentish Town , north London , was found with 4kg of heroin in his suitcase in September 2007 .
His supporters say he had suffered a breakdown , was delusional and was tricked into carrying the drugs .
Britain is not planning any retaliation beyond criticism .
The Chinese ambassador to London , Fu Ying , was summoned to the Foreign Office to hear first - hand the government 's anger .
The Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis was to protest about the execution and the Chinese government 's decision to cancel an annual meeting between the two countries , scheduled for January in Beijing , where they were due to discuss China 's human rights record .
Lewis said : " China cannot expect to receive the respect they yearn from the international community until they abide by minimum standards of human rights .
Engagement with China is non-negotiable and any alternative strategy is simply not credible .
But by being so clear in our public criticism of China 's handling of this case we are demonstrating that it is not business as usual . "
British ministers have been struck by the apparent near - universal support for the execution within China .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , writing on his blog , said : " We have said many times we welcome the economic rise of China and believe its integration into the world system is one of the great opportunities of the 21st century , not just one of the challenges .
Events like those of today will only fuel the argument of those who say this is an impossible dream and that the value systems are just too different .
" I do n't believe that .
But it is a reminder of how different can be our perspective .
We need to understand China ( and the massive public support for the execution ) .
They need to understand us . "
Shaikh learned only yesterday that he would be killed today .
He was informed by two cousins who had flown to China seeking a reprieve .
" We are deeply saddened , stunned and disappointed at the news of the execution of our beloved cousin Akmal , " said Soohail and Nasir Shaikh in a statement .
The two men said they were " astonished " that the Chinese authorities refused to investigate their cousin 's mental health on the grounds that the defendant ought to have provided evidence of his own fragile state of mind .
" We find it ludicrous that any mentally ill person should be expected to provide this , especially when this was apparently bipolar disorder , in which we understand the sufferer has a distorted view of the world , including his own condition . "
Amid an angry exchange of words between London and Beijing , the British prime minister said : " I condemn the execution of Akmal Shaikh in the strongest terms and am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted .
I am particularly concerned that no mental health assessment was undertaken .
At this time our thoughts are with Mr Shaikh 's family and friends and I send them our sincere condolences . "
Brown had raised the case on several occasions , including during a meeting with the Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , at the Copenhagen summit and in a personal message in the past few days .
While British ministers have been careful not to promise any retaliation against the Chinese government , their statements demonstrate their anger at what they regard as Beijing 's refusal to recognise Shaikh 's basic human rights .
In Beijing the Chinese government said it resisted any interference in its judicial affairs .
" We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition to the British reaction , " said Jiang Yu , a foreign ministry spokeswoman .
" We hope the British side will face this case squarely and not put new obstacles in the way of relations between Britain and China . "
Chinese judges and lawyers receive instructions from the Communist party on their handling of political cases , but Jiang claimed the country 's courts were independent .
" China judicial independence brooks no interference . "
China treated citizens of all nations as equals in dealing with drug - related crime , said Jiang .
The Chinese embassy in London insisted " Shaikh 's rights and interests were properly respected and guaranteed " and disputed British claims about his condition .
" The concerns of the British side were duly noted and taken into consideration by the Chinese judicial authorities .
" Out of humanitarian consideration visas were granted to the two cousins of Mr Shaikh on Boxing Day and they were given access to meeting Mr Shaikh in China .
As for his possible mental illness which has been much talked about , there apparently has been no previous medical record . "
China executes three times as many people as the rest of the world 's official executions put together – at least 1,718 in 2008 according to Amnesty International , although the real figure is likely to be much higher .
China has assured British officials that they have gone further than they do with other countries ' prisoners to give advance warning of the execution , around three or four days , and allow the family access .
Shaikh 's cousins were allowed to see him for an hour and a half .
One senior figure closely involved with the case said China 's reluctance to give ground was because many of those executed by the state were likely to have mental health problems and that Shaikh was " the tip of the iceberg " .
Britain believes China is keen to move on from this case quickly but senior figures say it will inevitably colour dealings between the two countries for some time .
Sally Rowen , the legal director of the human rights group Reprieve , said : " The death of Akmal Shaikh is a sad indictment of today 's world , and particularly of China 's legal system .
...
We at Reprieve are sickened by what we have seen during our work on this case . "
Lewis told Radio 4 's
Today programme this morning : " It 's a deeply depressing day for anyone with a modicum of compassion or commitment to justice in Britain and throughout the world . "
He said it was " reprehensible " and " entirely unacceptable " that the execution had gone ahead without any medical assessment .
" This execution makes me personally feel sick to the stomach but I 'm not going to make idle threats .
" This morning is not the time for a kneejerk reaction .
It 's true we must continue to engage with China but it needs to be clear as that country plays a greater role in the world they have to understand their responsibility to adhere to the most basic standards of human rights .
China will only be fully respected when and if they make the choice to join the human rights mainstream and incidents like this do not help the international community 's respect or relationship with China . "
Lewis said that there had been 27 ministerial representations to China about Shaikh 's case in the last two years .
Despite the increased international dialogue with China " all of those representations have been in vain and this is a very very different view of what constitutes universal human rights " .
" Clearly Mr Shaikh has mental health problems .
And whilst we differ with China anyway on the issue of the death penalty ... the biggest single issue here that causes us so much consternation is that they refused to even do a medical assessment knowing that there was evidence of mental health problems ; that is what is unacceptable .
" In the context of a working relationship , a constructive positive relationship ... we expect our partners to behave differently and behave better . "
Chinese media have yet to report the execution , but the state - run news agency Xinhua carried a statement by the supreme court defending its judgment .
" The evidence was certain and the facts were clear , " it said .
The court defended its decision to refuse UK requests for a mental examination .
" There is no reason to cast doubt on Akmal Shaikh 's mental status , " it said .
Legal activists disputed the assertion that the government could not intervene in the court system .
" China 's judiciary is not independent , it is totally controlled by the government , " said the civil rights lawyer Teng Biao .
" This case shows the hardline stance of the government .
China now can ignore pressure from international society and wo n't compromise even a little on the issue of human rights . "
Shaikh 's lawyer for the supreme court review , Zhang Qingsong , said he was not allowed to meet his client .
Following vocal British criticism of China 's stalling tactics at the Copenhagen climate conference this month , the rhetorical relations between the two nations have arguably hit a low not seen since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 .
But experts said the long - term impact would be small .
" The two sides are just posturing for their own citizens , " said Wu Qiang of Tsinghua University .
" Akmal Shaikh is only an isolated case .
Unless the UK raises the issue to the EU level I do n't think there will be big influence on relations . "
The execution delighted China 's nationalists .
Online comment was overwhelmingingly favourable .
" Well done !
The man deserves the death sentence .
China has finally shown it can be tough in front of foreigners , " noted a post under a TV clip about the news .
On the website ifeng.com , Chahu18 wrote : " I can't believe the British government condemned this action ...
Do they support drug smuggling ?
Britons , you think it is still 1840 when you could use opium to harm Chinese people ?
I am with Chinese government this time ! "
Reprieve said it had medical evidence that Shaikh believed he was going to China in 2007 to record a hit single that would usher in world peace .
It said he was duped into carrying a suitcase packed with heroin on a flight from Tajikistan to Urumqi .
Reprieve said the last European to be executed in China was an Italian , Antonio Riva , who was shot by a firing squad in 1951 , along with a Japanese man , Ruichi Yamaguchi , after being convicted of involvement in what China alleged was an American plot to assassinate Mao Zedong and other high - ranking Communist officials .
Shaikh 's family thanked Brown , Miliband and other British ministers for their efforts and asked the media for " space to grieve " .

The protest -- which gained a lot of support on Facebook -- was set to start at 12 PM PT , but a bunch of Conan 's brave , raincoat - clad faithful have been hanging around near the " The Tonight Show " studio for hours .

This is the way markets work .
The news that creditors of Dubai World will not be made whole by either the governments of Dubai or Abu Dhabi is still being absorbed by the markets and journalists , many of whom assumed that a bailout was in the works .
We were skeptical from the start of a talk of a bailout , not least because relieving creditors of their risk without also relieving them of profits seems to violate what we understand of Islamic finance rules .
It seemed that westerners had just become so accustomed to bailouts of government sponsored entities that we just thought those sheiks would rattle and roll like the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve .
As Mavercon Willem Buiter has explained in his FT blog , Dubai and Abu Dhabi are doing the world a huge favor .
For years , US policymakers — Barney Frank , especially — insisted there was no implicit guarantee of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
But he was wrong .
When push came to shove , the guarantee became explicit .
We ’re now all suffering with how to restore the credibility of our government when it comes to letting the creditors of systemically important financial institutions suffer when one of them goes bust .
Even our non-government sponsored entities are now backed by either implicit or explicit guarantees .
So here ’s how Dubai shows us the way forward :
Given the over - the - top reaction of creditors and the western media ( including the Financial Times ) to the possibility that the Dubai and Abu Dhabi sovereigns might not stand behind the debt of Dubai state - owned companies , it is clear that a debt deferral or a debt default by Dubai World or by Nakheel would indeed be news for a number of market participants .
They will have learnt that only sovereign debt is debt of the sovereign and that only sovereign - guaranteed debt is debt guaranteed by the sovereign .
A simple lesson but a useful one .
So in the future they will lend to Dubai World or Nakheel or to other state - owned companies in Dubai on terms that reflects the likely absence of sovereign support , should these companies get into difficulties .
Those terms are likely to be rather less favourable than terms extended earlier on the belief ( wishful thinking ) held at the time , that debt of state - owned companies is sovereign guaranteed .
The notion that companies from Dubai , state - owned or not state - owned would not have access to the international markets for an extended period of time following a debt deferral , debt restructuring or debt default by Dubai World or Nakheel is ludicrous and counterfactual to a vast range of historical experience .
Ironically , it looks like Dubai has finally become the financial center of the future — leading the world back to risk based lending rather than socialized losses .
The future of finance is n’t what it used to be .
But it may not be quite as dark as the bailouts by US and European governments had promised .
WASHINGTON  President Obama took aim at the Supreme Court on Saturday , saying the justices had “ handed a huge victory to the special interests and their lobbyists ” with last week ’s 5 - to - 4 decision to lift restrictions on campaign spending by corporations and unions .
The decision will have major political implications for this year ’s midterm elections .
After it was announced , Mr. Obama immediately instructed his advisers to work with Congress on legislation that would restore some of the limits the court lifted .
But in his weekly address on Saturday , he sharply stepped up his criticism of the high court .
“ This ruling strikes at our democracy itself , ” Mr. Obama said , adding : “ I ca n’t think of anything more devastating to the public interest .
The last thing we need to do is hand more influence to the lobbyists in Washington , or more power to the special interests to tip the outcome of elections . ”
How much the administration can do about the ruling remains unclear , although Mr. Obama said he had instructed his advisers to work with Congress on a “ forceful , bipartisan response . ”
The thing most notable every time a World Cup draw is made is how adrift most of us are as to the actual ability of all but a handful of teams .
As William Goldman famously said about Hollywood , “ nobody knows anything . ”
Few of us have watched a wide range of qualifying games in Europe , never mind South America , Africa or the other confederations , and our assessment of the capabilities of teams is based largely on the players they have playing in either the Premiership or the Champions League .
And so we have a few misdiagnoses of the groups .
Everyone agrees that Group D , which sees Germany , Australia , Ghana and Serbia square off , is the Group of Death ; these are four teams of broadly similar ability , the Germans would be reasonably considered the favourites but none of the other three will be overawed by them .
But there is also too much respect being paid to Group G , where Brazil , Portugal and the Ivory Coast will slug it out for the top two spots .
The group , however , is likely to be hellish only for the latter two ; Brazil , motoring along efficiently if inelegantly with Dunga ’s brand of pragmatic football , will probably take the group – and I fear , the tournament – comfortably .
So it ’s up to the Ivorians and the Portuguese to fight for the second spot .
Many , watching the tournament in their Premiership - refracted haze will bill it as Drogba v Ronaldo , but there 'll be more than that .
And I suspect , the Portuguese , wary of being muscled out of it by an Ivorian team unfazed following their fine performances in the Group of Death last time round , are probably the more worried .
Other highly competitive groups are likely to be Group B , with Argentina , Nigeria and Greece – all of whom met each other in USA 94 – all in the running , with South Korea possibly being the bystanding kingmaker .
It may not be dazzling football though , especially with the Greeks involved .
That may come in Group E where the Danes play their footballing mentors the Dutch , with Cameroon also capable of excitement providing excitement .
And though European Champions Spain are likely to win Group H at a canter , Honduras , Chile and Switzerland are all capable of fighting for second place .
France and England both got draws that , though favourable enough , could prove to be harder than they first appear .
Nobody fears
France these days , as Ireland showed in Paris last month , and both Mexico and Uruguay will fancy their chances , even if the Mexicans have never yet beaten France in international football .
Particularly perilous for France is the fact that their easiest match , against hosts South Africa comes last , by which time dropped points in the first two encounters could put them under pressure .
And , with the notorious benevolence often shown to host countries by referees , the karmic wheel could swing right round in an unpleasant manner for the French .
My hunch is that France ’s collective lack of backbone ( which cannot be entirely blamed on the hapless Raymond Domenech ) could see them on an early flight home .
England should be able to finish top of their group but the sort of complacency the English do best could give them a few jolts .
The US are a tough side for anyone to beat , and should provide stiffer resistance to England than in last year ’s friendly at Wembley .
Slovenia will be similarly undaunted having given England a decent game in another friendly last November .
A young Algerian team may be four years short of gelling into a formidable side but they will , like all the other African teams bar the hosts , have the advantage of playing in January ’s African Cup of Nations in Angola .
Algeria shocked the world in 1982 before being disgracefully shafted by West Germany and Austria , and now they are arguably better , with many of their players having come through the French national youth team system .
A technically gifted side who showed immense character to come through a torrid tie with Egypt , they can cause anyone trouble .
That said , I expect England to finish top , which they will want to do , presuming Germany finish top of Group D. The Germans are now back to the level of composure where they can unnerve the English and were the two to meet in the second round , England ’s World Cup would end there .
If they avoid each other , England can reach the quarter - finals and , with some extra discipline , the semi-final .
That ’s really as far as they ’ll go , with suspect goalkeeping , an occasionally febrile defence and a glaring lack of strength in depth to be their undoing when up against the big boys .
And who are the big boys ?
Spain , Brazil , Germany , Italy .
The winners will come from one of those four .
Argentina probably could do it if freed from the mania of Maradona ’s management and an African side might benefit from a tournament held on the continent .
The Ivory Coast look like the only side strong enough to put up an ultimate fight but they too will probably have to hope for semi-finals at best .
And the winners ?
My head rather than my heart , says Brazil , who these days are eschewing the jogo bonito in the same way they did in 1994 and 2002 .
And we know what happened then …
Once again the USA was the leading country in manufacturing for 2008 .
And once again China grew their manufacturing output amazingly .
In a change with recent trends Japan grew output significantly .
Of course , the 2009 data is going to show the impact of a very severe worldwide recession .
Chart showing the percentage output of top manufacturing countries from 1990 - 2008 by Curious Cat Management Blog , Chart showing the percentage output of top manufacturing countries from 1990 - 2008 by Curious Cat Management Blog , Creative Commons Attribution
The first chart shows the USA ’s share of the manufacturing output , of the countries that manufactured over $ 185 billion in 2008 , at 28.1 % in 1990 , 27.7 % in 1995 , 32 % in 2000 , 28 % in 2005 , 28 % in 2006 , 26 % in 2007 and 24 % in 2008 .
China ’s share has grown from 4 % in 1990 , 6 % in 1995 , 10 % in 2000 , 13 % in 2005 , 14 % in 2006 , 16 % in 2007 to 18 % in 2008 .
Japan ’s share has fallen from 22 % in 1990 to 14 % in 2008 .
The USA has about 4.5 % of the world population , China about 20 % .
See Curious Cat Investment blog post ” Data on the Largest Manufacturing Countries in 2008 .
Even with just this data , it is obvious the belief in a decades long steep decline in USA manufacturing is not in evidence .
And , in fact the USA ’s output has grown substantially over this period .
It has just grown more slowly than that of China ( as has every other country ) , and so while output in the USA has grown the percentage with China has shrunk .
The percentage of manufacturing output by the USA ( excluding output from China ) was 29.3 % in 1990 and 29.6 % in 2008 .
The second chart shows manufacturing output over time .

The 2008 China data is not provided for manufacturing alone ( the latest UN Data , for global manufacturing , in billions of current USA dollars ) .
The percentage of manufacturing ( to manufacturing , mining and utilities ) was 78 % for 2005 - 2007 ( I used 78 % of the manufacturing , mining and utilities figure provided in the 2008 data ) .
There is a good chance this overstates China manufacturing output in 2008 ( due to very high commodity prices in 2008 ) .
Hopefully these charts provide some evidence of what is really going on with global manufacturing and counteracts the hype , to some extent .
Global economic data is not perfect .
These figures are an attempt to capture the economic reality in the world but they are not a perfect proxy .
This data is shown in 2008 USA dollars which is good in the sense that it shows all countries in the same light and we can compare the 1995 USA figure to 2005 without worrying about inflation .
However foreign exchange fluctuations over time can show a country , for example , having a decline in manufacturing output in some year when in fact the output increased ( just the decline against the USA dollar that year results in the data showing a decrease – which is accurate when measured in terms of USA dollars ) .
If the dollar declines substantially between when the 2008 data was calculated and the 2009 data is calculated that will give result in the data showing a substantial increase in those countries that had a currency strengthen against the USA dollar .
At this time the Chinese Renminbi has not strengthened while most other currencies have – the Chinese government is retaining a peg to a specific exchange rate .
Korea ( 1.8 % in 1990 , 3 % in 2008 ) , Mexico ( 1.7 % to 2.6 % ) and India ( 1.4 % to 2.5 % ) were the only countries to increase their percentage of manufacturing output ( other than China , of course , which grew from 3.9 % to 18.5 % ) .

I was briefly expressing my disagreement with the Python 3 development decisions , so I want to elaborate on that a bit .
While I was previously addressing some of the problems I have with Python 3 , I took the time to create a list of things that were solved in a way other than I expected or hoped .
Let 's start with the biggest grief of mine ...
Unicode Support
If you look at any of the pocoo libraries , they all use unicode .
In fact , Jinja2 and Werkzeug even enforce unicode so you can't even use them with byte strings internally unless you do the encode dance .
Why that ?
Because I believe in unicode and that is not too surprising because German , the official language of Austria uses some non ASCII letters and yet tons of systems deployed force me to substitute Umlauts with latin letters just because someone had a limited horizon .
But the unicode world is complex and Python does not care about unicode too much .
And that neither in Python 2 nor Python 3 .
So what does not work about unicode in Python ?
So in German for example , there are words like " Fuß " ( which means foot ) .
The last letter there is a so - called " Scharfes Es " or " Eszett " .
The former means " sharp -s " and is usually represented as a " ſs " ligature , the other one is a " ſz " ligature and used in blackletter fonts ( The letter " ſ " is no longer in use but worked similar to a latin " s " ) .
Another common way was using an " ſs " litature .
Because this letter will never occur at the beginning of words there was never an uppercase character for it ( there was one introduced lately , but nobody uses it ) .
However , it is pretty common to use title case or uppercase for emphasis , so there is a need for that letter to exist in uppercase .
The common replacement you see is a doubled " s " or " sz " .
So " Fuß " becomes " FUSS " , " Maße " became " MASZE " etc .
There are some variations , but basically it means that one letter becomes two .
However , that does not work in Python .
The Python unicode implementation cannot do two things : neither can it replace one letter with two when changing the case , nor does it allow a locale information for character mappings .
The latter is necessary for languages like Turkish where an uppercase " I " is lowercased to " ı " and not " i " .
( And I will not complain about the shared state of the locale library which of course stayed in Python 3 ) .
Another problem is that Python uses UCS2 or UCS4 internally and that shines through .
So if you have an UCS2 build , len ( ) called on strings does not give you the number of characters in the string , but the number of UCS2 interpreted characters which might not be the same .
In fact , every letter outside the basic plane will be wrongly counted .
Because UTF - 16 ( UCS2 with support for surrogate pairs that allow you to use characters outside the basic plane ) is a variable length encoding it has the same problems as utf - 8 as an internal encoding : namely , making slicing a non trivial operation .
Another problem arises : binary extensions have to be compiled for UCS2 and UCS4 pythons separately .
And last time I checked , setuptools did not allow you to publish both builds on pypi and pull the correct one .
In fact , by default there is no such information in the filename which would make it possible to provide both extensions .
So what they did " improve " with Python 3 was making unicode strings the default .
And they did that in a very backwards incompatible and IMO problematic way : they degraded bytestrings from strings to glorified integer arrays and enforced unicode on non-unicode protocols .
Just to give you an example :
When you iterate over bytestrings in Python 2 , the iterator will yield you a bytestring of length 1 for each character with that character in .
While I was always a harsh opponent of strings being iteration , it was something everybody relied on .
In Python 3 , bytestrings are bytes objects , which are basically arrays of integers which look like strings in the repr , but yield the bytes as integers .
So if you had code that relied on the iteration returning chars , your code will break .
And yes , Python 3 breaks backwards compatibility , but this is something that 2to3 does not pick up and most likely you will not either .
At least in my situation it took me a long time to track down the problem because some other implicit conversion was happening at another place .
Now at the same time unicode strings continue to yield unicode strings on iteration with the char in .
That means suddenly bytes and unicode objects have different semantics , making it impossible to provide an interface for both bytestrings and unicode .
There were tons of places libraries accepted both unicode and bytes in Python 2 because it " made sense " .
A good example is URL handling .
URLs are encodingless .
Some schemes hint a default charset , but in reality no such thing exists .
However , applications themselves knew what encoding the URL would use , so they happily pass unicode strings to the URL encoder and that would use the application URL encoding to ensure the URL is properly quoted .
In Django / Werkzeug / and probably many more libraries , if you passed unicode to the URL encoder , it would by default encode to UTF - 8 .
However if the URL was came from another source with unknown encoding , it was possible to transparently pass the URL on .
Also the decoding of URLs from somewhere else usually happened encoding - less .
Many applications for example check the referrer of the page to check if the user came from a search engine and if yes , grab the search keywords from the referrer and highlight them on the current page .
In that situation you can keep a list of known encodings of referrers in the URL and decode the referrer URL accordingly .
In Python 3 the URL module in many situations uses an UTF - 8 default encoding , or requires the URL to be UTF - 8 encoded or provides a completely different and limited interface for byte URLs .
Sure , it might be sufficient for 98 % of all users , but there are non obvious implications : a library that wraps urllib / urlparse and whatnot cannot reuse the same code for Python 2 and 3 .
When I started supporting IRIs in Werkzeug ( basically the URL successors with proper encoding , already somewhat used by browsers )
I chose to abandon the urllib module altogether and write my own simple decoder to make it easier to later port that thing over to Python 3 without changed semantics .
There are other examples as well : filesystem access .
Python 3 assumes your filesystem has an encoding , but many linux systems do not .
In fact , not even OS X enforces an encoding .
You can happily use fopen to create a file that does not look like UTF - 8 at all .
And even there , the situation is a lot more complex because on OS X , different unicode normalization rules apply for the filesystem than for the applications themselves .
So even if you are using Python 3 , you still will have to manually normalize the filename to a different encoding when you want to compare filenames on the filesystem .
When I looked at the unicode stuff in Python 3 I did not see much value over nicely written libraries in Python 2 that enforced unicode usage .
In fact , the update makes it especially hard to convert such libraries ( that required unicode ) to Python 3 , because 2to3 assumes you are using byte strings and not unicode .
State prison authorities Monday began reducing the number of parole violators sent back behind bars and offering inmates more opportunity to shorten their sentences , as part of a plan to decrease the prison population by 6,500 inmates over the next year .
Low - risk offenders , including those convicted of nonviolent crimes , will not have regular supervision by a parole agent .
And they will no longer be returned to prison for technical violations such as alcohol use , missed drug tests or failure to notify the state of an address change .
Parole agents will reduce the number of inmates they supervise to focus on those the state deems to be at highest risk of committing more crimes , such as people who have committed sexual crimes and other violent offenses .
Each agent ’s caseload will fall from 70 parolees to 48 .
In addition , prisoners can shave time off their sentences by working on firefighting crews or by obtaining a high school diploma or trade - school certificate or by completing drug or alcohol rehabilitation programs .
Over time , prisons chief Matthew Cate said , the rules will lower the rate at which parolees are returned to state lockups , reduce crime overall and “ save , over the course of a full year , a half a billion dollars for California taxpayers . ”
The state will thus address its prison overcrowding problem while “ significantly increasing public safety , ” said Cate , who heads the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
Some law - enforcement officials , state legislators and crime - victim advocates took a different view , predicting a spike in crime in California as more people leave prison earlier with less supervision .
LAPD Lt. Brian Johnson , a director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League , said the state “ will start to release numerous dangerous felons into our community . ”
Cate said that in a state prison system with 168,000 inmates , only 15 % to 18 % of inmates will be eligible for unsupervised parole , and that the effect of the changes will be gradual .
“ No one gets out today , ” he said .
The revisions were approved by the Legislature and signed into law last year by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who defended the changes Monday .
“ It is not going to compromise public safety , ” Schwarzenegger said in a Sacramento speech .
“ Every time you have inmates go out , they come right back in again -- 70 % of them .
That costs our state . . . a tremendous amount of money . ”
The changes are occurring as the state has slashed budgets for education and rehabilitation programs in prisons .
“ These people are not rehabilitated , and yet we ’re going to open the door and let them out ? ” said Harriet Salerno , president of the group Crime Victims , speaking at a Capitol news conference that was also attended by representatives of Los Angeles police officers and Los Angeles County sheriffs ’ deputies .
Sheriff Lee Baca said he is “ very concerned ” about the changes .
He has ordered his deputies to meet with low - level offenders released from prison and tell them about community services such as mental health and drug rehabilitation programs , said Sheriff ’s Lt. Wayne Bilowit .
Assemblyman Ted Lieu ( D - Torrance ) , a former prosecutor running for state attorney general , introduced a bill Monday that would give local law enforcement officials a greater role in blocking the release of inmates they deem to be a risk to the public .

The Ubuntu development community announced today the availability of Ubuntu 10.04 alpha 2 , a new prerelease of the next major version of the Ubuntu Linux distribution .
This alpha is the first Ubuntu release to completely omit HAL , a Linux hardware abstraction layer that is being deprecated in favor of DeviceKit .
The alpha release introduces a few new applications , including the Pitivi video editing tool and the GBrainy game .
Some of the other planned changes to the default application set have not yet been made .
The GIMP , which is scheduled for removal from the default installation during this development cycle , is still included in alpha 2 .
Some other applications that are planned for inclusion in 10.04 , such as Gwibber , are n't ready yet and have been pushed back to alpha 3 .
The Pitivi video editor
The latest version of the GNOME desktop environment is included in alpha 2 , bringing some noteworthy improvements to the Nautilus file manager .
It has gained support for a dual - pane file view and the tabs have been moved to the bottom of the window .

Last month , we gave you an inside look at Canonical 's plan to overhaul the GNOME panel .
The Ubuntu developers adopted KDE 's Status Notifier specification with the goal of helping to build consensus around a compelling cross -desktop solution .
The panel overhaul is underway and some of the earliest work on that effort is visible in alpha 2 .
Rhythmbox is the first application to include a new status notifier menu .

One of the major goals for Ubuntu 10.04 is an improved startup experience , with a ten - second boot time .
Considerable progress on boot performance has been made over the past year , but the goal still has n't been reached yet in alpha 2 .
Other facets of the boot experience improvement effort have landed , such as the migration from usplash to Plymouth .
Ubuntu 10.04 is a long - term support ( LTS ) release , which means that it will be supported on the desktop for three years and on the server for five years .
The primary focus of the development cycle is stability rather than feature enhancements .
It will enter feature freeze earlier than average Ubuntu releases and will also have a longer beta test period .
The alpha release is available for download from the Ubuntu website , but it 's not yet ready for use in production environments .
For additional details about the alpha release and a complete list of known issues , you can refer to the official release notes .
The Barack Obama White House is n't the only one waging internal wars against Fox News , it seems .
National Public Radio bosses have requested that their top political correspondent , Mara Liasson , reconsider her regular appearances on Fox News , according to a report by Politico .
NPR execs reportedly expressed concerns to Liasson that Fox 's content had become more partisan recently .
They assigned her -- in what some at NPR might consider unusual punishment -- to watch and study Fox News ' programming for 30 days .
Liasson reported no significant change in Fox 's overall views , Politico writes , and that very well might be the case .
The idea of Fox 's alleged conservative leanings did n't just spring up in the last month .
The White House has sought to discourage other news organizations from acknowledging and reporting on Fox News .
But they have resisted out of professional collegiality , for instance , when Fox News was briefly barred from one pool participation .
Liasson , whose diligent reporting brings useful insights to Fox News ' popular panel discussions , noted she 's under contract with Fox News and intended to fulfill her obligations .
Though NPR is in part publicly funded , the extent of federal funding is small .
The federally fed Corporation for Public Broadcasting gives NPR some money , but the majority of its cash flow comes from on - air fundraisers , private donations , state grants and universities .
An NPR spokeswoman reportedly told Politico that the White House 's stance had no bearing on the Fox News diss .
No immediate reports of other news employers objecting to their reporters / commentators appearing on cable channels where many see political bias in , say , the other direction .

In the most recent paper , published last month , Dr. Proulx and Dr. Heine described having 20 college students read an absurd short story based on “ The Country Doctor , ” by Franz Kafka .
The doctor of the title has to make a house call on a boy with a terrible toothache .
He makes the journey and finds that the boy has no teeth at all .
The horses who have pulled his carriage begin to act up ; the boy ’s family becomes annoyed ; then the doctor discovers the boy has teeth after all .
And so on .
The story is urgent , vivid and nonsensical — Kafkaesque .
After the story , the students studied a series of 45 strings of 6 to 9 letters , like “ X , M , X , R , T , V . ”
They later took a test on the letter strings , choosing those they thought they had seen before from a list of 60 such strings .
In fact the letters were related , in a very subtle way , with some more likely to appear before or after others .
The test is a standard measure of what researchers call implicit learning : knowledge gained without awareness .
The students had no idea what patterns their brain was sensing or how well they were performing .
But perform they did .
They chose about 30 percent more of the letter strings , and were almost twice as accurate in their choices , than a comparison group of 20 students who had read a different short story , a coherent one .
“ The fact that the group who read the absurd story identified more letter strings suggests that they were more motivated to look for patterns than the others , ” Dr. Heine said .
“ And the fact that they were more accurate means , we think , that they ’re forming new patterns they would n’t be able to form otherwise . ”
Brain - imaging studies of people evaluating anomalies , or working out unsettling dilemmas , show that activity in an area called the anterior cingulate cortex spikes significantly .
The more activation is recorded , the greater the motivation or ability to seek and correct errors in the real world , a recent study suggests .
“ The idea that we may be able to increase that motivation , ” said Dr. Inzlicht , a co-author , “ is very much worth investigating . ”
Researchers familiar with the new work say it would be premature to incorporate film shorts by David Lynch , say , or compositions by John Cage into school curriculums .
For one thing , no one knows whether exposure to the absurd can help people with explicit learning , like memorizing French .
For another , studies have found that people in the grip of the uncanny tend to see patterns where none exist — becoming more prone to conspiracy theories , for example .
The urge for order satisfies itself , it seems , regardless of the quality of the evidence .
Still , the new research supports what many experimental artists , habitual travelers and other novel seekers have always insisted : at least some of the time , disorientation begets creative thinking .
Old men with creased faces watch us enter the cemetery .
A solemn air blows through the arch as the four of us walk in , cameras aimed , pen angled and stop at a woman ’s body being nibbled by flies .
Over the face , someone lifted her shirt as a makeshift veil .
She is what death has become in Port au Prince , meat rotting in the street that leaves a sickly sweet smell that forces us to cover our noses .
Death can not be wrapped in prayer or made into memory but quickly dumped or burned .
If not the festering will kill the living .
As the photographers kneel and shoot , I ask the cemetery chief , a weary calculating man what will happen to the corpse .
“ Someone will take it soon . ”
“ Do you know who she was ? ”
“ No no no .
They leave many bodies here .
I do n’t know her . ”
“ Did you lose anyone in the earthquake ? ”
“ My daughter was killed . ”
I go quiet .
As we walk the photographers trail behind us , leaning over a skull in the street or the ashy black soot left of a quick sidewalk cremation and cut the image from time with a click .
Loud yells erupt behind us .
We turn and see four men lift the corpse on to a gurney , haul it up and carry it quickly through the tombstones .
We follow them as they turn , leap and jump down the mausoleums while keeping the gurney balanced .
The cemetery chief yells and points directions and we watch them angle her above a crack and slip her in .
They leave .
Panting hard , we lower our pads and pens and cameras .
We ask him to show us the pit where the poor people are dumped .
The cemetery chief says yes but asks for a donation .
“ Maybe you can help me out ? ”
We are hot and tired .
The tall older photographer yells “ We are n’t paying for that this is a public place . ”
We stare at the cemetery chief who shrugs and says , “ You must leave now .
We have work .
If you want to see the bodies , pay me $ 10 for the time away from work . ”
We sulk back , sweaty and ignoring him .
I pull him to the side , “ Look we ’re not aid workers .
We do n’t have resources .
We are journalists .
We write the stories so that others can see what ’s happening here and keep helping . ”
He smiles a bit , “ Okay pay me $ 5 . ”
“ 200 pesos . ”
I hold it between us .
“ It ’s what I got . ”
He takes it and whistles to the others who trot back .
We follow him through the tombstones , stepping and jumping , slipping between narrow wedges to the edge of a large ditch .
The smell of rotting bodies is sweet .
It alerts you to go numb , to pull your feelings inside .
Inside the ditch are six entangled bodies .
One has an arm broken and bent like a stick of wood snapped in play .
Some are nude .
Flies crawl over the anus .
One has a black swollen face like a baby ’s pout .
Stiff and still they grip each other .
We angle around them , writing and photographing .
I wonder what more images of death will do .
I wonder how they will be read back home .
I want to know who they were , what they believed , how they doubted , how they loved and hated .
Until then we can say that they and all the corpses here in Haiti will be defined by the spectacular rarity of their death .
I worry about this because until the invisible poor are loved not as symbols but as people they will not be protected from the disaster of history .
The cemetery chief looks at me , “ Would you like me to sing ? ”
I scrunch my eyes , not understanding .
“ Sing a song for the dead ? ”
“ Sure . ”
“ Maybe a small donation . ”
I shake my head and soon we follow him out of the cemetery .
Outside people mill around aimlessly .
Some stare at the rescue team .
Some stare at us .
Faces crisscross , talking on cell phones , begging for money , yelling angrily , offering services , looking at people digging up rubble .
The feeling in the air is like gasoline jelly , thick and flammable .
Sparks fly out of everyone ’s eyes .
We get in the car and leave for downtown .
The talk in the car turns to the cemetery chief and how everyone raises the prices of everything .
We know why .
Even so , it annoys us that words are wobbly .
Nothing said will stay firm .
But what promises were made to Haitians ?
What promises were made to the people , from the Haitian Revolution to the election of Aristide , one atop the other until the earth shook and the centuries of lies collapsed on them .
Later in the evening , we hunch over laptops typing and arranging pictures .
My friend calls me over to see a photo of the dead woman we first saw .
“ Look at the tag on her toe . ”
It reads “ Roseline Dey . ”
Studying the picture is the first time I stopped moving today and just breathed .
When I do the smell of her death fills my nose , I point my nose around and follow it down to my hands .

New Jersey and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard -- perfect together ?
A torture session in Iran took a strange turn when an elite policeman told his captive , a Newsweek reporter , that he believed New Jersey must be heaven on earth .
In a television interview to air Sunday at 7 p.m. on the CBS show 60 Minutes , reporter Maziar Bahari , an Iranian - Canadian , recounts the Revolutionary Guard 's obsession with the Garden State .
The guard seemed to believe sex and alcohol can be enjoyed easily in New Jersey .
“ I think the words ‘ New Jersey ’ sounded to him like the most American place that you can be in your life , ” said Bahari , who was held captive for 118 days in an Iranian prison .
“ He hated me and he was jealous of me at the same time because I had been to New Jersey . ”
WONDERLAND : A Fairy Tale of the Soviet Monolith
( 2nd Edition , 2020 )
Winner of Best Photography Book 2008 by Pictures of the Year International
The Black Garden Trilogy is complete with the printing and publication of the 2nd edition of Wonderland : A Fairy Tale of the Soviet Monolith ( Wonderland ~ Black Garden~Departure Lounge ) .
This is a new edition , not a facsimile .
This edition is bigger than the original book to match Departure Lounge .
The edit and sequence are the same as the original version .
The story of Communism is the story of the twentieth century .
For many the Soviet Union existed , like their childhood , as a fairy tale where many of the realities of life were hidden from plain view .
When the Berlin Wall finally fell , so too did the illusion of that utopia .
Wonderland is a photographic exploration that portrays both the reality beneath the veneer of a utopian USSR and the affirmation of hope that should never be abandoned .
And like all fairy tales try to teach us : the hard lessons of self - reliance .
Energy alternatives sells microhydro accessories and turbines .
Microhydro utilizes the energy of falling water to generate electricity .
This is not to be confused with large scale hydro dam projects .
A proper install has no negative effects on the local stream , simply diverting a portion of the available water and then returning that water back to the stream .
If your site has a source of running water , you simply must investigate its potential as a source of electricity .
Our experience has demonstrated that water power will produce between 10 and 100 times more power than solar or wind for the same capital investment .
Since water flows day and night , a micro hydro system requires far less battery storage than other technologies .
Even if the stream is far away , it may still be viable .
Distances of several kilometers can be covered by utilizing high voltage generators .
Seasonal streams offer great performance when a hybrid water and solar system is designed .
When your power requirements are the highest , in the winter , the water is usually flowing the fastest .
Solar modules are most efficient when there is the most sun in the summer .
If you watch The Simpsons or South Park – cartoon serials where gangs of doodles get to demonstrate the wisdom in modern stupidity – you come to feel that the characters are really doing something quite old - fashioned .
They may be media savvy and product - articulate , these yellow - faced goons , but in essence they go in for the kind of stuff that used to have people rolling in the aisles of the music halls .
Homer Simpson is a kind of Grimaldi , an air - guitar - playing , nacho - chomping version of Dan Leno : he does songs , he falls on his arse , he has trouble with machines , with self - worth , and he goes in for disguises , catchphrases , patter and multiple personalities .
The old comics were human , of course , but the startling thing about the newer television cartoon characters is that they often appear more human than real people , more alive than anybody you ’ve ever met .
It does n’t happen so much in the cinema nowadays , though .
Modern movie actors are much like ourselves , only better - looking , with faster cars ; people like Tom Hanks or Helen Hunt derive the major part of their appeal from what we might call their apparent ordinariness , and only occasionally , as with Jim Carrey or Robin Williams , does an actor come along who seems to have the superhuman plasticity of a cartoon .
These movie actors , whatever else they happen to be , are works of animation : they can make their faces , and their emotions , do anything , and they live their on - screen lives in stark defiance of death .
Early cinema was full of people like that , people who could live a life much larger than anybody watching , so large , indeed , that the flouting of death was just a part of daily business .
At his height ( or heights ) , the building - scaling Harold Lloyd dropped to his non-death every other minute in his movies ; Buster Keaton jumped over danger , or stood deadpanning the camera while death squeezed past him .
Charlie Chaplin , a little man too big for the real world , smiled at every manner of threat , ducked it , ran from it , cheating death with a welter of small human surprises and tendernesses , and always , in the end , walking away bandy - legged from the worst the world has to offer , the screen shrinking to the size of a full - stop .
These clowns were loners : they sometimes tried to make friends with girls , kids and dogs , but essentially they went through the world on their own , and we pity them and swoon at their efforts to do the best they can .
The important thing about Laurel and Hardy is their friendship : every one of their films is really about the way their friendship works and fails to work , the way pride and civility are bent out of shape by the actions of these two child - men .
There may be less poetry in Laurel and Hardy , but there are bigger laughs ;
Stan ’s absurdity and his sleepiness , his tears and stubbornness , seem to sit so perfectly with Ollie ’s plausible rotundness , his irritation , ambition and wide - eyed panic .
I have loved the two of them all my life , and Simon Louvish ’s spirited account , itself both stubborn and plausible , wo n’t hinder the growth of that affection .
In 1890 , Stan Laurel was born in Yorkshire to a girl from the North Riding and a man who made his own greasepaints .
But Stan ’s father , Arthur Jefferson , did more than that : he was a theatrical entrepreneur and a writer of plays and sketches .
Stan grew up in the theatre , making his first stage appearance at the Glasgow Britannia Theatre in 1906 .
Jefferson later spoke about what happened :
Stan ’s number , billed as an ‘ extra turn ’ , went up .
On he came wearing a pair of baggy patched trousers ( new trousers of mine , cut down , patches added ) and also my best frock coat and silk hat . . .
He did his act , the details of which I cannot now remember , and he got a very good reception and scored a genuine success , finishing up to loud laughter and applause and even shouts of ‘ Encore ! ’
The shouts brought him back , and he beamed the now popular Laurel smile , but , in bowing his acknowledgments , he spotted me !
‘ According to A.J. ’s account , ’ Louvish tells us , ‘ Stan then rushed to escape , catching his father ’s frock coat on a steel hook and tearing it and losing the top hat to a member of the orchestra , who stepped on it , a necessary slapstick move . ’
By the time Arthur Jefferson was giving interviews about his son , the ‘ popular Laurel smile ’ he spoke of was no laughing matter .
When Laurel and Hardy visited Glasgow in 1932 , eight thousand people turned up to meet them off the train ; in Laurel and Hardy : The British Tours ( 1993 ) , one of their fans , A.J. Marriot , writes of the great surge of people that filled Central Station :
It was then that , owing to the pressure of numbers , the stone balustrade skirting the wall of the hotel collapsed onto the pavement .
The falling masonry bowled over several onlookers but , luckily , formed in a heap which then prevented others from falling into the basement below . . .
The incident created a wild stampede for safety , and in this a number of persons were hurt .
Fifteen minutes after Laurel and Hardy ’s arrival , the scene was one of devastation .
Scores of people were looking around for shoes , hats or coats which had been lost in the mad crush , ambulances and police reinforcements had been rushed to the area , and eight men suffering from leg injuries were taken to the Royal Infirmary . . .
Stan was dismayed to find his 50 - guinea wristwatch missing .
Oliver Hardy was from a Southern family of slave - owners and Confederates ; his father died when Oliver was young , and the boy grew up in the lobby of his mother ’s hotel in Madison , Georgia .
Conventional wisdom has always supported the view that Stan Laurel was the genius of the two , that Hardy was just a jobbing actor who turned up on time and spoke his lines .
( It is a view promoted by some of the facts : Laurel was the writer and often the producer of their work , more of a thinker altogether , and during the whole of their careers he was paid a lot more than Hardy . )
Louvish makes this central to our understanding of the pair , but he sometimes goes too far in presenting an Oliver Hardy who is riddled with resentments and covered in self - loathing .
We may also deduce something about Oliver ’s actual isolation – the sense he had , and that continued all his life , of being imprisoned in a body that required him to set up a mask to deal with the world around him ; the yearning for companionship beyond the family circle that could offer him only an anchor at a familiar harbour and from which he wished to sail on to new and unknown horizons .
In other words , we should never underestimate the desperation of the fat . . .
Although Oliver Hardy insisted , to the end of his life , that he adored and worshipped his mother , they rarely met again , and the maverick son of the old politician of Harlem , who had departed the scene almost as soon as his son entered it , began to construct a new life , and a new identity , both on screen and off .
In other words , we should never underestimate the desperation of the biographer .
Movie fans who write books tend to improve when they get to discussing the movies ; it is doubly right and good that this should be true in the case of Stan and Ollie , because , despite Louvish ’s best efforts , Laurel and Hardy ’s own lives were pretty unremarkable .
They had OK childhoods , they got into acting , they went to work for Hal Roach , they got put in a picture together , and all the fun and all the magic begins at this point .
The duo developed their act at great speed : you see it coming together over a few two - reeler silent shorts directed by Fred Guiol in 1927 .
In Why Girls Love Sailors , Hardy first does the ‘ tie twiddle ’ , a nervous tick that would serve him well in situations both anxious and amorous ; in Do Detectives
Think ?
they first do their routine of exchanging bowler hats accidentally , ‘ always resulting on the wrong hat on the wrong head ’ , as their filmographer William Everson puts it .
Laurel and Hardy are always at their best in the short film ; the feature films would be padded out with silly plotlines , elaborate songs and screeching flappers , but the shorts are sometimes perfect , the comedy based on situations rather than big plots , on repetition within the scene , and Laurel early got into the habit of working on his gags even after he ’d used them .
What happens to friendship when everything goes wrong all the time ?
Laurel and Hardy perpetually get in each other ’s way , they get on each other ’s nerves , and while the general battle is against humiliation , they are always busy with the effort to extricate themselves from the fine mess they bring about in one another ’s lives .
‘ Precision , as all the great clowns knew , is everything when dealing with chaos , ’ Louvish writes , and this is true in Laurel and Hardy ’s case not only in terms of the staging of physical gags , but in the choreography of affection and exasperation that describes their friendship .
In one way the wonder of Laurel and Hardy lies in their capacity for animating and increasing their friendship through disaster : even when they have a really trying time together , they seem bigger people , and better friends , in the end , as if they ’ve just offered a splendid and exhausting lesson in the gentle art of mucking about .
Disaster and hopelessness do n’t cost anything with Stan and Ollie – the fat one would never walk out on the thin one , any more than Marge would walk out on Homer .
Charlie Chaplin ’s tramp is a figment of the sentimental imagination : in those films , it ’s always the world around the tramp that seems absurd , and the brilliant , haphazard little man ’s specialness is what appears to put the crazy world to rights .
In Oliver the Eighth ( 1934 ) , Stan and Ollie are a couple of struggling barbers .
Ollie reads an advertisement in the newspaper about a rich widow who is looking for a husband .
The duo go to the woman ’s house , she is clearly weird , and so is her butler , who serves invisible drinks and an invisible supper .
Ollie is most put out with the situation , he gulps and fiddles , while Stan , for whom there is nothing in the world too absurd , lifts his spoon and starts eating his dinner as if there was no problem , even stopping at one point to sprinkle imaginary salt on his imaginary soup .
Stan has negative capability – he can become anything – and the big laugh lies in Ollie ’s exasperation and in his terrific fear of absurdity .
Stan wo n’t set out to put the world to rights ; he ’ll fit himself up to any old madness .
Ollie ’s rolling eyes tell us how he can’t believe Stan is going along with this spooky charade ; Stan is mucking about and innocent when faced with irrational stuff , and when things take a turn for the worse his best response will be to burst into tears .
When children watch Laurel and Hardy they always say how stupid the pair are , but they never say that watching Chaplin .
Chaplin ’s character is heartening in showing you how an unfortunate but intelligent man can overcome the rigours and the brutality of the world : Laurel and Hardy are heartening for different reasons – they show you how to survive your own stupidity , and how to make your friendships survive it .
Laurel and Hardy ’s best performances persuade you that humiliation is not all it ’s cracked up to be .
They often laugh at each other , and knock each other on the head , as if temporary laughter and corporal punishment were the perfect corrective to the worst humiliation .
Nothing very grave or sad ever comes out of their trials and it may be that the balance of their friendship is maintained and restored by their mutual ability to accept humiliation on their own and their partner ’s behalf and move on .
‘ We may deplore humiliation , or claim to , ’ Adam Phillips writes in his new book Equals ,
but we cannot help but enjoy what we cheerfully call making fun of people .
We are always reassured when people can , as we say , laugh at themselves .
There is a violence we do to ourselves and others that is both enlivening and strangely consoling .
There is the good mockery of everyday life that regulates our self - importance , and so relieves us of too much responsibility for the world .
And there is the bad mockery that foists something upon us that we would rather , if we could choose , protect ourselves from .
Laurel and Hardy are masters of good mockery .
In their best film , The Music Box ( 1932 ) , the pair are trying to deliver a piano to a house which sits at the top of a steep flight of steps .
The film has only one gag : every time they get the piano up to the summit it slips and goes crashing right back down to the street .
Little things happen in between their repeated attempts to deliver the piano : halfway up the steps , Ollie moves it to one side to allow a nanny to come down with a baby ’s pram .
As usual , the piano slips , and Ollie is pulled all the way down to the street again .
The nanny complains , Ollie answers back , and she carefully takes his hat off and smacks him over the head with the baby ’s bottle .
The cycle of frustration is deeply hilarious .
The Music Box is a perfect distillation of comic character , and it contains wheels within wheels of humiliation for our heroes .
There may , as I suggested , be less poetry in Laurel and Hardy than in Chaplin or Keaton , but in this situation comedy , the repeated journey up the long steps is a perfectly compacted , perfectly artful , little commentary on the absurdity of human perseverance and the power of accident .
The duo ’s terrible task with the piano seems to serve as a motif not just for their relationship but for their entire lives .
They are hopeless , and when they finally get the piano into the house , well , of course , the owner says it ’s come to the wrong house , and proceeds to smash it to bits .
But it ’s the repetition that stays in the mind : as if the endless journey with the piano is the perfect story about these two men , Stan and Ollie .
The Music Box is itself a repetition : a remake of the silent short Hats Off ( 1927 ) , in which the duo are trying to deliver a washing - machine to a house at the top of a long flight of steps .
The second and more famous movie was filmed in the same street in Los Angeles as the original .
‘ One of cinema ’s discoveries , ’ Paul Keegan writes in his introduction to a new edition of Freud ’s Psychopathology of Everyday Life , ‘ was that everyday life is repetition – as if our actions are constantly trying to remember something – and it turned this to account in the figure of the accident - prone hero .
Mayakovsky noted that Chaplin characteristically repeats a gag three times , and he called these passages “ analytical sequences ” . ’
Laurel and Hardy not only repeated within movies , they repeated from one movie to another , forever returning to the same central problems about themselves and their relationship .
All the roles they took on – escaped convicts , delivery men , waiters , musicians , sailors on leave , builders , husbands , tramps , visitors to the dentist , imaginary heirs , salesmen , business associates , Foreign Legionnaires – were repeated and copied and plagiarised by themselves , as if there was a persistent , cartoon - like need to return to the scene of their psychic crimes , trying one more time to make good and act sensible .
Take a particular strand of their comedy : a situation where they are forced to be the guardians of a stray animal or person .
We first see this in Angora Love ( 1929 ) , where they find themselves in charge of a goat , then in Come Clean ( 1931 ) , where they rescue a woman from suicide .
‘ Now you ’ve saved me , you have to take care of me ! ’ she says , and so for two reels we watch Stan and Ollie trying to smuggle the woman into their house and hide her from their wives .
They had a similar problem the following year in The Chimp , where the boys are paid off from their jobs at a circus by being given a chimp , which they must now smuggle into their rented room , where the animal of course takes the best bed , and also happens to have the same name as the landlord ’s wife .
Then there ’s Pack Up Your Troubles ( 1932 ) , in which they have temporary custody of an orphan child , and Their First Mistake ( 1932 ) , where they have to work out what to with a baby who falls into their charge .
Of that last film , Louvish quotes , with some dismay , the comments of the cultural critic Jonathan Sanders , who called it ‘ a subtle utopian fantasy of personal relationships , in which Ollie ’s desire for a male friend / lover , a wife and a child are all satisfied by one person – Stan ’ .
Louvish would prefer not to see these films in a ‘ cross - gender reversal ’ kind of way , and although he , too , looks for things in Laurel and Hardy ’s lives that would explain their interests and unmask their style , his approach is much more light - hearted .
Naturally , the duo had a great deal less fun mucking about in their own lives than they did playing Stan and Ollie , and Louvish grows excitable as he sniffs for significance .
In an age in which male friendships cannot be seen without their sexual aspect . . . sex looms everywhere .
But what remains erect , for Oliver Hardy , is not his penis , but his dignity .
The echoes of the Old Southern gentleman do not fade .
In a society in which one has lost everything , in which the old cause is – perhaps even rightly – despised , the man of refined sensibility retains not only an idea , perhaps absurd , of the proper form but , more than that , a fiery sense of loyalty .
As we have quoted him for the cut scenes in Laughing Gravy : ‘ Once a friend , always a friend .
It ’s fifty - fifty with a Hardy . ’
Initially at least , time was better to Laurel and Hardy than it was to many of the other silent cinema greats .
Their best work in any case has sound , though after the 1930s their comedy was thought coarse and unsophisticated next to the gentle social touches of Lubitsch or Wilder .
Cartoons are seldom considered subtle , and neither are folk tales : the best of Laurel and Hardy has something of both , and their greatest films address the viewer with images that last like perfect daydreams .
In the world of Laurel and Hardy , mistakes are made in order to be repeated , and humiliation endured so that it can be endured again .
No other cinema couple – not Abbott and Costello , not Bob Hope and Bing Crosby , or Tom and Jerry – is as satisfyingly co-dependent , and no other couple gives such a vivid sense of the fun to be had in failure , or , indeed , such hilarious insight into the way a human friendship can be elevated rather than consumed by its own faults .
More Americans believe in guardian angels than humans ’ role in global warming , according to recent polls .
A Pew poll released late last month found that just 36 percent of Americans believe humans are responsible for accelerating global climate change , which scientists say mushroomed after the industrial revolution due to humans ’ dependence on carbon - based fuels .

Carbon dioxide , which is produced by the combustion of oil , coal and other fuels , was ruled a “ dangerous ” threat to public health by the Environmental Protection Agency Monday .
It increases the propensity of the earth ’s atmosphere to retain heat .
But a near - consensus from scientists does n’t have Americans convinced .
The Pew poll found that while 57 percent believe that the earth ’s climate is changing , just 36 percent believe that humans are responsible .
77 percent believed that global warming existed in Pew ’s poll conducted in 2007 .
The 36 percent who believe in human - caused climate change is fewer than the number of Americans who apparently believe they ’re protected by guardian angels , some 55 percent , according to a poll published in 2008 .
“ Half of all Americans believe they are protected by guardian angels , one - fifth say they ’ve heard God speak to them , one - quarter say they have witnessed miraculous healings , 16 percent say they ’ve received one and 8 percent say they pray in tongues , according to a survey ” conducted by Baylor University published in September of 2008 .
The Baylor survey was conducted in 2007 by telephone calls to 1,648 adults , who were asked more than 300 questions about their spiritual beliefs .

That ’s not all .
A blog at the website of Foreign Policy notes that more Americans believe in UFOs and ghosts than do anthropogenic ( human - caused ) global warming .
34 percent of Americans said they believed in UFOs and ghosts in a Halloween 2007 survey conducted by Ipsos for the Associated Press .
Just 39 percent of Americans said in a February poll that they believe in evolution .
Down a road that winds through the rolling hills of western Pennsylvania , just across from a cow pasture , the bucolic scenery of Butler County is interrupted by a high chain - link fence topped with razor wire .
Cars entering the compound are channeled into gated lanes before being searched by a guard .
A short distance beyond the security point , the road disappears into a gaping hole in a cliff face .
The hole is sealed off by the thick , steel bars of a tall sliding gate controlled by guards carrying semiautomatic pistols .
They are protecting a 25 - foot - high passage that leads 22 stories down to Iron Mountain 's main archive facility , which takes up 145 acres of a 1,000 - acre abandoned limestone mine .
Behind steel doors
Among dozens of red steel doors inserted in the rock face along corridors that create an elaborate subterranean honeycomb , you 'll find Room 48 , an experiment in data center energy efficiency .
Open for just six months , the room is used by Iron Mountain to discover the best way to use geothermal conditions and engineering designs to establish the perfect environment for electronic documents .
Room 48 is also being used to devise a geothermal - based environment that can be tapped to create efficient , low - cost data centers .
( For information on more companies using geothermal conditions to improve data center efficiency , see " Riding the geothermal wave . " )
There is no raised floor in Room 48 .
Instead , networking wires are suspended above rows of server racks and cooled both by the limestone walls and vents attached to ceiling - mounted red spiral ducts 36 inches in diameter .
The HVAC system uses the cool water of an underground lake hundreds of acres in size .
Outside light is beamed into the main aisle of the room through a long ceiling tube to reduce heat .
Rows of server racks are encased in rectangular metal containers that trap electrical heat and force it up through perforated ceiling tiles , allowing the 55 - degree limestone roof to absorb heat that otherwise would build up in the 4,100 - square - foot room .
" Limestone can absorb 1.5 BTUs per square foot , " Charles Doughty , the vice president of engineering at Iron Mountain , said during a recent tour of the facility by Computerworld .
Facts on molecular chemistry and mineral properties roll off 61 - year - old Doughty 's tongue .
He has worked as a technologist and archivist in the tunnels of the one - time mine for 37 years , studying thermodynamics in an ever - evolving effort to create the perfect environment for storing paper and electronic records .
An underground office
Doughty 's underground office is adorned with dark wood furniture that 's upholstered in the type of rich leather befitting his executive status .
The furniture and carpeted floors contrast sharply with a rough - hewn wall of prehistoric rock .
The office sits just off a larger room filled with cubicles that also butt up against rock walls , which are painted white to better reflect light and suppress any limestone dust .
The Underground , as the mine is called by employees , has its own cafe and a fire department with three engines .
Like the other 2,700 workers here , Doughty traverses miles of roadways and tunnels in golf carts .
Iron Mountain employs just 155 people in The Underground , the rest work for companies renting space in the facility .
An endurance kayaker who owns a working 30 - acre farm and is training for an iron - man competition , Doughty is an idea man in a subterranean environment .
He calls it " the best job in the world .
I only get to create ideas .
Other people do the work to make it happen . "
I have this love / hate relationship with format wars .
No , it 's not reality television versus talk shows , or Top 40 radio against " the best of the ' 80 s — and more ! "
The wars I 'm thinking about pit technologies against one another , usually in a battle to the death of one or more of the contestants .
It 's
One format to rule them all every time , and the streets are littered with the remains of the losers .
These wars are loathsome because we consumers have to pick a side or else lose out on something awesome , and then the ones who picked the wrong one have to pay up again for the winning technology .
But format wars also keep the carousel of progress spinning and fan the flames of innovation .
Join me for a brief look back at the format wars of yesteryear , and a look ahead at what will replace them .
Betamax v. VHS
Let 's start with some well - known and fairly recent history .
Sony launched the home video revolution in 1975 with the Betamax tape format ; the company asked Japan 's Ministry of Trade and Industry to make Beta an official standard with government backing , but JVC refused to play ball and introduced its own VHS system a couple of years later .
The rest , as they say , is history .
But why did VHS tapes kill Betamax ?
It was n't because VHS was technically superior — Betamax tapes started out with slightly higher resolution than VHS , and less video noise as well .
Also , Sony 's more sophisticated lacing system ( the way the tape winds between guides and read / write heads in the player ) allowed Betamax to pull off a few tricks that early VHS players could n't duplicate .
You could fast - forward or rewind Beta tapes without losing the picture , for instance , and video editing on a Beta system produces cleaner cuts .
JVC 's format roared onto the market with a couple of distinct advantages , though .
Chief among them was the ability to record two hours of NTSC - encoded video versus one hour for Betamax .
Image credit : Three Betamax machinesImage credit : Wikimedia Commons
American consumers seemed to be more interested in long recordings than good - looking ones , and VHS quickly gained the upper hand in the US market .
Sony fought back with thinner Beta tapes and slower tape speeds , extending the play time at the expense of picture quality , but JVC and a host of allies had already turned their short - lived tape length advantage into economies of scale .
The rich get richer , and mass - produced video players get cheaper ; soon enough , the technical superiority of Betamax mattered not a whit and VHS scored an 85 % global market share by 1986 .
In 1988 , Sony started to make VHS players and Beta was left to die on the vine .
The Video 2000 system from Philips , which also was arguably better than VHS but also more costly , never gained traction and sunk without a trace .
At best , V2000 was about even with the already - dying Betamax at 7.5 % market share each .
The war was over by then .
So why was this war ever started ?
If JVC had n't decided to go its own way , Betamax would have won by default .
Short of a customer revolt , video tapes would then have been stuck with one hour of high - quality video signal for years .
The series of compromises from both the Betamax and VHS camps that finally produced 10 - hour recording times with very , very lossy quality might or might not have happened , and at any rate would have come about at a much slower rate .
Early adopters of both VHS and Betamax shelled out $ 1,000 or more ( in 1980 dollars — over $ 2,400 when adjusted for 30 years of inflation ) for their fancy new technology , and some of them ended up with expensive paperweights .
But the rest of us ended up with better and cheaper players , packed with features designed to outdo the opposition .
All told , the VHS - Betamax war was more good than bad for the average video watcher .
DVD , HD DVD , and Blu-ray
When DVD players started showing up in American living rooms , the VHS incumbents crawled out with nary a fight .
DVD versus VHS was less of a war than a wholesale slaughter , and the age of magnetic video tapes ended with little fanfare in 2006 when the last major studio powered down the tape machines .
That was allegedly the William Hurt vehicle " A History of Violence , " filmed in 2005 but released on DVD and VHS in March , 2006 .
Thanks for the memories , Bill .
But there was another war going on at the VHS format 's funeral .
Sony was back in the trenches to promote the Blu-ray format .
On the other side of the new battlefield stood HD DVD , championed by Toshiba and NEC .
The first HD DVD player and a handful of movies were launched in April 2006 , a month ahead of the first Blu-ray hardware .
Early reviews for either format were not overly positive .
My colleague Nate Anderson summed the situation up thusly : " The consensus seems to be : unless you need it now , you 're better off waiting a year .
Prices will be down , quality will be up , and features will be multiplied .
You 'll also have a lot more content to watch on your shiny new device . "
Nate was absolutely right , of course .
Sony launched the PlayStation 3 in time for the holidays , and that console is still the leading Blu-ray player on the market with over 24 million systems sold .
Early high - def disc players could only display 1080i video , but full - on 1080 p hardware was not far behind .
Toshiba presented a triple - layer HD DVD format that evened up the data storage capacity between the two combatants .
And of course , prices fell through the floor .
You can get a refurbished Blu-ray player today for about $ 110 , which is better than 90 % off from the debut hardware .
While the Betamax - VHS bout lasted for more than a decade , the fat lady sang for HD DVD only 18 months after the inital hardware launch .
When a lesbian or gay man ended a straight relationship in Pennsylvania , the case law regarding the award of custody of any children of the relationship had for decades been overtly hostile to the lesbian or gay man .
In Constant A. v. Paul C.A. , 496 A.2d 1 ( Pa. Super. Ct. 1985 ) , a panel of the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that , though homosexuality was not a per se basis for denying visitation or partial custody , it was always a relevant consideration in making custody and visitation decisions .
Where each of the parents was in a relationship , the heterosexual parent ’s” traditional ” ( whether marital or nonmarital ) family environment benefited from a ” presumption of regularity .
” In contrast , the lesbian or gay parent had to prove that there was no adverse effect on the child from his / her same - sex relationship , creating a presumption against custody or visitation for the lesbian or gay parent .
This standard was later applied in Pascarella v. Pascarella , 512 A.2d 715 ( Pa. Super. Ct. 1986 ) , to uphold an order granting a gay father partial custody of his children , but restricting him from visiting with his children in the presence of his same - sex partner .
But , in Blew v. Verta , 617 A.2d 31 ( Pa. Super. Ct. 1992 ) , the court held that other people ’s reactions to a mother ’s lesbian relationship could not , alone , serve as a basis for restricting her custody .
All of that has now changed for the better .
In an en banc decision , the Pennsylvania Superior Court has now overruled these earlier decisions .
In M.A.T. v. G.S.T. , 2010 Pa. Super. LEXIS 13 ( Jan. 21 , 2010 ) , the court stated in no uncertain terms :
[ W]e overrule both the holding and the reasoning in Constant and its progeny ( including Pascarella and Barron ) , and conclude that a homosexual parent bears no special evidentiary presumption in a child custody case .
. . .
[ I ] n establishing an evidentiary presumption against a parent involved in a homosexual relationship , the three - judge panel in Constant violated the basic precept that the sole focus of a child custody proceeding should be on the best interests of the child — without either parent bearing the burden of proof .
Moreover , Constant ‘s evidentiary presumption is based upon unsupported preconceptions and prejudices — including that the sexual orientation of a parent will have an adverse effect on the child , and that the traditional heterosexual household is superior to that of the household of a parent involved in a same sex relationship .
Such preconceptions and prejudices have no proper place in child custody cases , where the decision should be based exclusively upon a determination of the best interests of the child given the evidence presented to the trial court .
( Footnotes omitted . )
For some time now , the Pennsylvania courts have been relatively good at handling legal issues involving lesbian and gay families .
For example , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has interpreted state adoption law to permit second - parent adoptions , and it has applied the in loco parentis doctrine to allow a former same - sex partner with no legal connection ( e.g. , through birth or adoption ) to a child of the relationship to nonetheless obtain custody or visitation .
This has resulted in a significant dissonance between the advancing state of the law concerning the breakup of lesbian and gay families and the stagnant ( notice that Constant and Pascarella both date back to the 1980s ) state of the law concerning the breakup of a relationship between a man and a woman , one of whom happens to be lesbian or gay .
Though long overdue , the decision in M.A.T. begins to bring these two areas of family law into line by overruling antiquated cases that had placed the focus in child custody cases not on what is best for the child involved , but on expressing hostility toward lesbians and gay men .

Exploring concatenative combinators .
As I read and tried to digest Brent Kerby ’s The Theory of Concatenative Combinators , I wrote a simple tool called Concom so that I could try the examples out as I went along .
It ’s a purely symbolic program , and its syntax exactly matches what is given in the paper , with the addition of comments and definitions .
It ’s a perfect companion to experiment with .
If you want to just dive in , head over to the project page for source downloads .
For the uninitiated , a combinator is basically a function that applies some sort of transformation to the data stack .
There are no variables , all data is stored on the stack and is manipulated by the combinators .
For a good description of a concatenative language and some background information , check out the concatenative.org wiki .
Concom is a basic concatenative language interpreter , and only has 9 primitive words , including the first 8 presented in the paper .
The available words at startup are swap , dup , zap , empty , unit , cat , cons , i , and dip .
The non-combinator words are show , which shows the stack , and exit , which exits the interpreter .
All words are in lowercase , while all symbols are in uppercase .
Symbols are the pieces of data manipulated on the stack .
Comments begin with the octothorpe ( # ) .
The sections of code between the square brackets ( [ , ] ) are called quotations .
They are complete and valid Concom programs , and for all intents and purposes they are anonymous functions .
They can be pushed to and manipulated on the stack just like a symbol .
If for whatever reason you find yourself needing to define your own words , the familiar Forth / Factor syntax is available .
A word definition starts with a colon ( : ) , the name of the word , the body of the word , and a terminating semicolon ( ; )
Here ’s an example definition of the k combinator :
# [ B ] [ A ] k == A : k [ zap ] dip i ;
Concom has a REPL , so your definitions are persistent within your session .
The best ( and most fun ) way to learn is to try to implement the combinators discussed in the paper from some restricted set of words , the later sections of the paper covers that almost exclusively .
Here ’s my attempt at the s combinator with just the Concom primitives :
# [ C ] [ B ] [ A ] s == [ [ C ] B ] [ C ]
A : s [ unit ] dip [ cons ] dip swap dup i cons swap i zap [ ] cons cons dip i ;

The American Eagle Trap :
Why a weak dollar wo n’t save America
Let ’s deal with a common misunderstanding , that “ dollar devaluation is going to save the US . ”
The idea supposes that if only the US dollar were low enough , the US would become competitive .
First , take a look at the charts to the left .
The US dollar under Bush took a nosedive versus the Euro ( and most other currencies as far as that goes ) .
Note that the Yuan appreciates against the Euro , but not the dollar , during that same period .
Why is that ?
Because China spends a huge chunk of money keeping the Yuan pegged to the dollar .
In some years , as much as 10 % of their entire GDP .
During the Bush administration we had a massive experiment in devaluation .
During the Bush administration ordinary people ’s incomes went nowhere , and the era ended in a massive financial crisis .
Before that financial crisis something else interesting happened : there was a huge rise in the price of oil , up to $ 150 a barrel .
( For much of the nineties it had been below $ 20 / barrel . )
At the current time , if the dollar drops , the price of oil will rise .
An increase in the price of oil and other commodities will increases the trade deficit , because commodities need to be imported .
China is the largest source of the US trade deficit : between 2001 and 2009 , China accounted for $ 1.58 trillion of the $ 3.81 trillion trade deficit ( and the percentage increased throughout the period ) .
China will make sure that there is no devaluation of the dollar relative to the Yuan .
Given that the Chinese proportion of the US non oil deficit is 83 % , the effect of devaluing the dollar on trade deficits will be essentially zero .
The end effect of dollar devaluation , then , is an increase in the price of oil and other commodities which increases the trade deficit , but has no effect on imports from China .
Given that devaluing the dollar will also lead to an increase in the price of oil , it is entirely likely that it ’s net economic effect will be negative , rather than positive , as the US economy shakes apart under exorbitant oil prices .
In 2008 the economy shook apart at about $ 150 / barrel .
Despite the current lousy economy , the price of oil is now over $ 70 / barrel .
“ Right then , ” you say .
“ Let ’s force the Chinese to stop spending all that money keeping the Yuan overvalued relative to the dollar !
If they wo n’t , let ’s slap countervailing tariffs on them ! ”
Great idea .
Except that China ’s need to keep the Yuan overvalued against the dollar is why they buy up US treasuries and other US assets .
If they ca n’t keep the Yuan overvalued against the dollar , and therefore maintain access to the US consumer , then they have no need to inflate the value of US currency .
Or to put it another way , what happens if China says “ Ok , we ’ll stop buying US treasuries and other US assets to keep the Yuan up . ”
Question :
Who is funding the US government and agency deficit right now ?
Answer : China and Japan .
Japan ’s new government is very likely to start buying a lot less US debt , because Japan ’s trade surplus with the US has been shrinking despite massive currency intervention .
That leaves China .
The chart on the left only goes to 2007 , since then the US government deficit has rocketed to the highest level in history .
What would happen if China decided to buy a lot less American debt , including US government debt ?
US debt servicing costs would climb through the roof , massively increasing the deficit and putting even more pressure on domestic programs .
The US dollar would indeed collapse , and not just against the Yuan .
The Chinese ceasing to buy US assets ( or even decreasing significantly their purchases ) would n’t just effect Yuan / dollar rates .
The US trade deficit to China would drop , but it would still not be reversed .
( China ’s costs are legitimately lower than America ’s , although China ’s productivity is also lower . )
Inflation would increase significantly .
Cheap imported goods have been an engine of deflation for some time now ; increasing their price could lead to inflation , especially if there were also a spike in oil prices at the same time .
The corollary to increased inflation is a decline in the US standard of living , even if there is n’t an inflation spike ( because that would mean a reduction is goods being bought or an economic shock so severe it lead to a deflationary spiral ) .
If China let the Yuan appreciate to its natural value against the dollar , it would almost certainly throw the US , and the world , into another financial crisis .
It would also badly damage China ’s economy , which would lead to more riots and instability in China .
The advantage to China would be that they could buy oil for much much less than before , and that oil prices for the US would rise ( though such a rise might be choked off by a collapse in the world economy ) .
However , any real recovery in the world economy would leave the US with permanently higher oil prices and China with lower oil prices , in itself a competitive disadvantage for the US .
The results , in short , would likely be disastrous .
Maybe even catastrophic .
On a global scale .
Right now , devaluing the US dollar does nothing for the US .
A forced radical devaluation by making China end its peg would probably be disastrous for the US .
The route to prosperity does not run through a dollar devaluation .
Or rather it does n’t run directly through a dollar devaluation .
There are things which need to be done first , before the dollar is allowed to float to its natural level .
Radically reduce the US dependence on oil imports .
Radically decrease unproductive spending , including military spending and health care spending ( by which I do n’t mean cutting medicare , I mean taking back the 5 % of wasted GDP spent by the private medical industry ) .
Significantly increase progressive taxes so that the US does not need as much foreign funding .
Since all of those things are third rails in American politics , as we ’re seeing now in the health care debate , where a real restructuring of the industry is not even on the table , the US will not escape from the trap it ’s in .
In part , the lack of effective and politically viable policy options is because the US political system is broken .
( For example , most of the population is in favor of single payer health care , yet this option is n’t even on the table . )
In part , it is because America ’s citizens want the status quo to continue .
After all radically progressive tax increases , cutting the military budget in half or enforcing 55 mile an hour speed limits and putting city cores off limits to most cars are n’t just unpopular with politicians , they ’re unpopular with the population as a whole .
America , and Americans , want to live beyond their means .
They do n’t want to make hard decisions .
And the political system does n’t want to take money away from any powerful interests which benefit from the current system .
So the American eagle will remain trapped , dying by inches , because no one is willing to do what it takes to save America from itself .
Senator Evan Bayh recently responded to a constituent 's concerns about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) .
Sadly , Senator Bayh 's letter is troubling and frustrating .
He echoes the USTR 's misleading conflation of " counterfeiting " and " copyright infringement , " does n't address the draconian Internet provisions , and , worst of all , fails to acknowledge the most egregious problem altogether -- that ACTA is being negotiated in secret and being hidden from Congress and the public .
Let 's take a look at parts of Senator Bayh 's response in detail .
Senator Bayh : I support a balanced approach to international trade that ensures equal treatment for U.S. goods and services .
In other words , I believe we must pursue policies that advance the economic well - being of America 's businesses and working families while holding our trading partners accountable .
Unfortunately , ACTA does n't squarely advance those objectives .
It 's a mistake to characterize ACTA as a pure attempt to get " other countries " to do something beneficial for the US .
ACTA will also have an impact stateside .
Leaked documents indicate that ACTA may require Online Service Providers to adopt policies that undermine the level of protection they currently have in the U.S. against liability for things done by Internet users using their networks .
And since ACTA intends to set new global norms , it is likely to increase Internet intermediary liability worldwide , damaging the future growth of the digital technology industry in the US and beyond at the behest of the entertainment industry .
And as if that was n't enough to cast the benefits of ACTA in doubt , leaked documents reveal that ACTA may require Online Service Providers to adopt " three strikes " policies that kick families off the Internet after being accused of copyright infringement , which satisfies only the misguided whims of Hollywood 's anti-Internet crusade .
Senator Bayh :
In the face of expanding commerce , we cannot lose sight of our fundamental responsibility - protecting Americans from imports that pose significant health and safety risks .
Intellectual property theft and counterfeiting represents an emerging threat to the health and safety of American consumers .
Let 's be absolutely clear about this : there is a significant difference between copyright infringement ( like singing " Happy Birthday " ) , and counterfeiting ( like manufacturing a knockoff car part and attempting to sell it as an original ) .
Counterfeiting is about trademark infringement and / or patent infringement , and applies to physical goods .
The copyright infringement ( or " piracy " ) provisions in ACTA are focused on digital creative works , which do not usually carry any risks for health and safety .
Contrary to Senator Bayh ’s letter ’s central premise , ACTA is concerned with far more than just " health and safety " policy considerations from counterfeit goods .
Leaked provisions , the official summary released by the USTR , and other negotiating governments state that ACTA will deal with copyright infringement , and regulation of the global Internet .
Senator Bayh 's letter seems to be focused on issues involving trademark and patents , but does not address the reports of draconian overreach on copyright issues that were raised by our members ’ letters to him .
No one disputes that sub-standard counterfeit pharmaceutical products pose significant health and safety risks for citizens .
But there are existing international IP enforcement laws that address the health and safety dangers posed by counterfeit goods , namely the Agreement on Trade Related Aspect of IP Agreement ( TRIPS ) .
It ’s time for those who claim that we need ACTA to explain why TRIPS is not sufficient to address these issues , and how they will ensure that ACTA will not instead be used to seize life - saving drugs that are in transit to developing countries .
Senator Bayh :
For these reasons , we must protect private innovation and public safety by addressing the shortcomings in global enforcement .
US copyright law embodies a careful balance between the exclusive rights of rightsholders and the interests of information users and technology companies that rely upon exceptions and limitations for research , freedom of expression , and legitimate business .
If the goal of ACTA is to protect innovation , it should give equal consideration to all US industries – both the US entertainment industry and the US tech sector ( which dwarfs it ) .
To date , that does n’t appear to be the case .
It 's hardly believable to say that ACTA protects innovation when it seeks to amplify pressure against the Internet and technology industries in an effort to " protect " an industry that 's nearly a century old .
( And let ’s remember that with box office returns at record highs , it 's completely unclear that Hollywood is as completely damaged by online copyright infringement as it claims to be . )
It 's taken for granted that copyright encourages innovation , and so it 's easy to then infer that stronger copyright enforcement will encourage stronger innovation .
But evidence is mounting that innovation ( and particularly innovation at the edge ) is actually driven by creativity , which in turn thrives within balanced IP regimes , with appropriate copyright exceptions and limitations like fair use that serve the needs of all information stakeholders .
We remain concerned that US negotiators are — with unprecedented secrecy — negotiating an agreement that is intended to set new international standards for intellectual property enforcement .
These standards , largely being pushed by the US entertainment industry and luxury goods trademark owners , have the potential to harm citizens , stifle the spread of technology , and damage the global Internet .
Because ACTA is being negotiated as an Executive Agreement , it will not be subject to the Congressional oversight mechanisms that have applied to recent bilateral free trade agreements , even though it appears likely to have a far greater impact on the global knowledge economy than any of those .
Given that , we urge Senator Bayh and others to take the time to find out more about the contents and likely impact of ACTA , and to consult with all types of affected stakeholders , including the tech sector and those who use the Internet for education and to further social and economic development across borders , and not just those that have the best - paid lobbyists .
( For those interested in additional context , Senator Bayh 's complete response can be read here . )
GM has threatened to close Saab down Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone is part of a bid to buy struggling Swedish carmaker Saab .
Mr Ecclestone has joined forces with Luxembourg - based private investment company Genii Capital , which recently invested in Renault 's F1 team .
Loss - making Saab has been put up for sale by its current owner , US giant General Motors ( GM ) .
A second offer for Saab has also emerged from the Dutch sports carmaker Spyker .
Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri has also reported that GM has received a third bid from a Swedish consortium .
This group is said to include Haakon Samuelsson , a former executive with lorry firms MAN and Scania , and Jan Nygren , a former politician and one - time executive with the Saab aerospace company .
' Tremendous ' value Mr Ecclestone told the Bloomberg news agency : " [ Saab ] is a good brand that has probably been neglected by the current owners . "
ANALYSIS By Jorn Madslien , BBC News
There are three bids on the table , yet the future looks as uncertain as ever for Saab 's 3,400 workers .
F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone 's involvement suggests there is still value in the brand , but that is not to say any of the prospective buyers would retain the whole workforce .
There is little technology left in Trollhaettan that is owned outright by Saab itself .
Saab engine , gearbox and tooling technology was recently sold to Beijing Automotive .
Hence , any buyer would need to strike a technology - sharing deal with GM to keep the Swedish operation going .
And Saab under new ownership would almost certainly be a low - volume carmaker .
Read Jorn 's analysis in full " We do n't own it yet , so let 's see what happens , " he added .
Genii said that it would " aggressively work towards a successful closing of the transaction with all the relevant stakeholders of the company " .
It added that Saab has " tremendous brand value in a number of key automotive markets , as well as an innovative image " .
Spyker 's bid for Saab is its second , having previously made an unsuccessful approach on 20 December , two days after GM said it would close down the Swedish company if no suitable sale could be agreed .
Victor Muller , the chief executive of Spyker , said : " We believe the Saab brand has lots of potential and would be keen to close a deal as quickly as possible . "
Mr Muller , whose company has a workforce of only 133 people , added that he was continuing to have a " constructive dialogue " with GM bosses .
No details have been revealed about how much either Spyker or Genii and Mr Ecclestone are offering for Saab .
Protracted sale GM has been trying to sell Saab since January last year .
In June , GM announced that it had agreed to sell it to sports carmaker Koenigsegg , only for the Swedish company to pull out of the deal in November .
Saab , which employs 3,400 people in Sweden , lost 3 bn kronor ( £ 255 m ; $ 412 m ) in 2008 , and it has not made a profit since 2001 .
A meeting of Saab board members will take place on Friday .
The company is due to resume production on 11 January following a four - week shutdown for the Christmas and new year period .

OTTAWA — Finance Minister Jim Flaherty is calling on developed countries to forgive Haiti ’s debt so the country can concentrate on climbing out from under the rubble and not a mountain of debt .
Flaherty said Wednesday that when G7 finance ministers meet in Iqaluit on Feb. 5 and 6 , he will also be urging the ministers to provide grants , not loans , to the earthquake - ravaged counrty , where as many as 200,000 are feared dead .
“ Reconstruction assistance provided to Haiti by these institutions and international donors will need to be provided primarily in grant form to avoid mortgaging the country ’s future , ” he told reporters during a briefing on progress in Haiti .
Canada provides all of its assistance to Haiti — which is Canada ’s second - largest recipient of financial aid next to Afghanistan — through grants and not loans ,
It was also confirmed Wednesday the Canadian death toll in Haiti has reached 21 and that the second wave of Haitian orphans has arrived in Ottawa .
Flaherty said it is important to ensure that Haitian citizens do not take a back seat to prior debt obligations .
“ Our collective goal should be to ensure that Haitians not be required to make substantial debt repayments while reconstructing their nation , ” he said .
The Canadian government forgave $ 2.3 million in loans to Haiti , the poorest country in the western hemisphere , last September .
With this relief , Canada has now cancelled $ 965 million worth of debt .
Flaherty said there will be a special plea to creditors Taiwan and Venezuela to “ complete their own debt relief efforts ” with respect to Haiti .
In 2005 , Haiti ’s total external debt reached an estimated US $ 1.3 billion .
Flaherty said Haiti ’s debt obligations are n’t just with individual nations .
“ International financial institutions , such as the Inter - American Development Bank and the World Bank ’s international development association , also cancelled most of their existing loans to Haiti in July 2009 , providing a total of $ 973 million in debt relief . ”
Meanwhile , 52 more Haitian orphans arrived in Ottawa Wednesday afternoon .
They were the second group to arrive in Canada in less than a week .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said Sunday that as many as 180 Haitian orphans at different spots in the adoption queue could be coming to Canada .
Since the earthquake , 2,869 Canadians have been evacuated from Haiti and of those , 2,500 have returned on Canadian Forces aircraft .
Currently there are 1,400 members of the Canadian Forces in Haiti helping with the recovery , including providing clean water and medical care .
“ Providing medical care , of course , continues to be of high priority , ” Defence Minister Peter MacKay said , adding that a Canadian Forces field hospital in Léogâne was 99 per cent complete and expected to be fully operational soon .
Bev Oda , Minister of International Cooperation , said that according to 14 Canadian non-governmental agencies as of late Tuesday afternoon , Canadians have donated $ 82.5 million , which will be matched by Ottawa .
“ The purest black - metal artist is one who ’s unknown and inaccessible , ” said Nicola Masciandaro , a professor of medieval literature at Brooklyn College who organized the six - hour event .
In a way , black metal runs on a very old cultural motor : loss of faith , and the hysterical fear and sadness that come with it .
But it has become one of rock ’s best modes of resistance , which is why it persists , why recent books and films about it have found an audience ( like Peter Beste ’s photo essay “ True Norwegian Black Metal ” and the documentary “ Until the Light Takes Us ” ) and why it has inspired a new American wave of bands , including Nachtmystium , Krallice , Wolves in the Throne Room and Liturgy .
Even as the Americans bend black metal far away from tribalism , violence or antireligious malevolence ( some Norwegian black - metal musicians became notorious for murder and church burnings ) and toward something more Whitman - esque , it remains ingrown .
Some of its practitioners  like the Americans Xasthur and Leviathan  make records but will not perform or , in Leviathan ’s case , give interviews .
Talking about black metal in certain quarters seems deeply lame .
One commenter on the online - forum page of the metal magazine Decibel summed up a certain kind of black - metal fan ’s attitude toward the symposium .
This music , the contributor wrote , “ has nothing to do with being intellectual and everything to do with not wanting to try and break every little thing apart ” for analysis .

“ There ’s lots of resentment toward a sensible discourse around black metal , ” said Mr. Masciandaro in an interview .
“ There ’s also lots of dissent and difference around what black metal is .
Its center of gravity is an essential negativity , an idea of some remainder , something that cannot be reduced . ”
He was inspired to organize the symposium , he said , by the conference on heavy metal , held last year in Salzburg , Austria , organized by Mr. Scott .
He was there and wanted to create a more specific event .
He chose a club with a bar as the setting , rather than a university , figuring it would be more “ ludic . ”
Starting around the :30 second , Tim Geithner is asked the awkward question about why he does n't support a return to Glass - Steagall , but does , ostensibly support Volcker .
As you can see , he hems and haws , and says they 're not really the same thing , but ... obviously he has no clean answer .
Great blog posts do n’t magically engage readers .
But by applying a few good tactics , your blog can attract and retain your ideal readers .
Here are seven powerful blog posting habits :
Tip # 1 : Clear Targeting
The first rule for creating effective content for your business blog is to completely understand why you ’re blogging .
Have a thorough understanding of your ideal reader ’s ( your customer ’s ) profile and of your core message as it relates to your business .
If you have a really clear idea about who you ’re writing for , it ’s going to be easier to write .
Your blog posts will be on target and on purpose .
You wo n’t be meandering off into subjects that are irrelevant to your audience .
Tip# 2 : Know What Your Readers Want
Always write with your reader in mind .
Write as if you are answering the question “ what ’s in it for them ? ”
Your readers are asking themselves all the time whether this blog is worth their time to read .
You ’re more likely to keep them interested if you ’re “ walking in their shoes . ”
Address your readers ’ major issues and concerns .
If you do n’t know what they are , ask .
Tip # 3 : Edit Often
So many blog posts start off with , “ The other day , I was thinking about … ” or “ You know , summer ’s almost over and …. ”
A blog post is not an essay and it ’s not poetry .
Get to the point right away .
Follow the rule of KISS = Keep It Simple , Sugar ! ( or Keep It Short and Sweet ) .
That means you can actually write less .
Write short , declarative sentences and omit all unnecessary words .
This means read and reread your posts before you publish .
It does n’t matter if you have n’t been trained as a journalist or taken a lot of writing classes .
If you can write an email , you can write a blog post .
However , your blog writing will improve when you reread before publishing to be sure you have taken out all unnecessary words .
After you click the ‘ publish ’ button , read your post again .
Often this is when you will catch typos or grammatical errors you did n’t see before .
Show respect for your readers by having clean copy .
It does n’t take much for readers to abandon your blog ; some might unsubscribe simply because your spelling is sloppy .
In the online world , your words are all you ’ve got .
Tip # 4 : Create Keyword - Rich Headlines
Write compelling headlines by using strategic keywords that are relevant to your topic .
Keywords are often touted as gold by search engine optimization experts who want to charge you an arm and a leg for their services .
But let ’s make a complicated issue simple .
Put yourself in the shoes of your ideal reader .
If this reader was searching Google for information or solutions to a problem , would she find you ?
Make a list of all the words or phrases she might use to search for you , your business , and your solutions .
Those are the keywords and key phrases that you want to use frequently on your blog .
When you write a headline for your blog post , use these keywords .
This alerts the search engines as well as your reader about what ’s important in your post .

Doing keyword research from time to time will help you stay on top of what your prospects want .
You ’ll find out exactly how readers are looking for the information you ’ve got .
Use the free keyword suggestion tool at WordTracker to make this simple .
Your post headlines can also make it easy — or difficult — for people to find the information they want .
Headlines should be as descriptive as possible .
Do n’t be vague .
You can be cute ( but not too cute ) , as long as what you ’re putting in the headline clarifies what you ’re really writing about or what the reader is going to learn .
Remember , it ’s all about your readers .
It ’s about helping them find and use the content you are giving them .
Blogging is going to be a fruitless exercise if your readers ca n’t get what they want out of reading your blog .
Tip # 5 : Write Great First Sentences
Write an optimized first paragraph using the same keywords you used in your post headline .
Make your point right away rather than leading into it .
Use clear keywords in the first sentence of the first paragraph , and then summarize them again before you close your blog post .
Always close by asking readers for their comments .
Tip # 6 : Keep it Short and Spacey
When writing , keep paragraphs short .
They should be one or two sentences at most , and then break for a new paragraph .
White space is your friend .
Sometimes just one sentence can be as effective as a paragraph .
You want lots of white space between paragraphs on your blog .
Remember , most readers are in a hurry .
Text on a computer screen is also harder to read than text on paper .
You want to make it as easy as possible for your readers to grasp your message quickly .
Tip # 7 : Use Bulleted Lists
Use bullet points and lists as often as possible .
This makes your post easy :
To read
To scan
To understand
To remember
Research shows that people prefer things to be easily digestible and chunked down for them .
It ’s easier for them to remember your message if you ’ve given it to them in a list of three to five items .
Some online writing experts also recommend keeping lists to an odd number of bullet points , but the important part is to use lists whenever you can .
There are many ways to ensure you have great blog posts .
These seven tips provide a good starting point and checklist to help you stay on track and create content your readers will devour and that will move them to action .

People in the town have lined the streets for the repatriation processions
The prime minster has issued a warning to a radical Islamist group planning a protest march through a Wiltshire town famous for honouring fallen soldiers .
Islam4UK , said to have extremist links , has written to bereaved families about plans to march through Wootton Bassett .
Gordon Brown said anything which families of dead or wounded troops could find offensive would be " completely inappropriate " .
Anjem Choudary , of Islam4UK , said he chose the town to attract publicity .
The procession is not actually about the people of Wootton Bassett and it never was about them .
Anjem Choudary - Islam4UK
The town 's mayor Steve Bucknell said his council would be vigorously opposing any march .
North Wiltshire MP James
Gray echoed his call and said " Mr Choudary should go somewhere else " .
Islam4UK , said to call itself a " platform " for the extremist movement al - Muhajiroun , has not yet applied for police permission or set a date for the event .
Its leader Mr Choudary wants to carry " symbolic empty coffins " through the town 's high street , which is now famous as the place where people gather to pay tribute to troops killed in Afghanistan .
A spokesman for the prime minister said : " We do not yet know what his [ Anjem Choudary 's ] plans are .
" The only thing he seems to have said is that it is an idea he is considering .
" He would need to have the appropriate contact with the right people in Wootton Bassett to secure approval .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The prime minister 's view would be obviously that anything that is considered to be offensive to , or of concern to , families of troops wounded or killed in Afghanistan would be completely inappropriate . "
Mr Choudary , a former lawyer , has written a letter on the organisation 's website entitled " To the families of British soldiers who have fallen " , explaining reasons for the planned march .
He said the event , if permitted by police , would involve peaceful " symbolic coffins " being carried to honour Muslim victims of the conflict in Afghanistan .
' Media attention ' Mr Choudary said : " The procession is not actually about the people of Wootton Bassett and it never was about them .
" We are having a procession , it 's in Wootton Bassett but it 's not about the people there and it's not against them personally - rather it's to highlight the real cost of war in Afghanistan .
" The sad reality of the situation is that if I were to hold it somewhere else it would not have the media attention that it has now .
" If I am to balance between the sensitivity of having it in Wootton Bassett and the possibility of continuing the quagmire and cycle of death in Afghanistan , then quite honestly I 'm going to balance in favour of the latter .
" In the next couple of weeks , I 'm going to be engaging with the local community and the public at large by way of press releases and letters to explain why we 're having this march . "
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme Conservative leader David Cameron , speaking on a visit to the West Country , said he thought the march idea was " completely unacceptable " .
" Anjem Choudary is one of those people who needs to be looked at seriously in terms of the legality of what he 's saying because he strays , I think , extremely close to the line of encouraging hatred , extremism and violence , " he added .
James Gray told BBC
News that it appeared that Mr Choudary was " getting his kicks from the publicity " .
" The point about the repatriation ceremonies in Wootton Bassett High Street is that they are totally non-political .
" People are n't saying we are for the war or we 're against the war .
It is just about paying respect to those who have laid down their lives in the line of duty . "
Mr Bucknell said Wootton Bassett , which has a population of just over 11,000 , is entirely inappropriate for any march , protest or demonstration which refers to Afghanistan or Iraq .
" We are going to do our utmost to make sure that this march does n't go ahead , " he said , adding that the town 's council have had received dozens of emails and phone calls from the public , concerned with the issue .
Islam4UK said its march would not coincide with a repatriation ceremony .

Some days ago we wondered aloud at the blank check extended to Fannie and Freddie along with the suspiciously convenient timing of those announcements on Christmas Day .
Back then we wondered if we had been told the entire story .
To wit :
So .
Let us summarize :
We do not expect the GSEs to grow their portfolios at all , so we are fixing the bloated portfolio problem by easing the portfolio caps to permit a quarter trillion dollar expansion thereof .
We do not expect either of the GSEs to need more help from the Treasury , so we are responding to the underutilized $ 400 billion " lifeline " the GSEs have with the Treasury ( $ 111 of which is currently used ) by expanding it to ... infinity .
Oh , and though they have collectively lost nearly $ 200 billion , we are paying the CEOs around $ 6 million each .
Great work team !
It 's already almost 11:00 .
Let 's go to lunch .
The other shoe having now dropped , Bloomberg has joined in our skepticism :
Taxpayer losses from supporting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will top $ 400 billion , according to Peter Wallison , a former general counsel at the Treasury who is now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute .
“ The situation is they are losing gobs of money , up to $ 400 billion in mortgages , ” Wallison said in a Bloomberg Television interview .
The Treasury Department recognized last week that losses will be more than $ 400 billion when it raised its limit on federal support for the two government - sponsored enterprises , he said .
Wallison continues :
“ It was always safe to buy these notes , ” he said .
The U.S. government was always going to stand behind them .
They ’re as good as Treasury notes . ”
We are no longer sure this is the most inspiring comparison .
Wallison also chimes in via the Wall Street Journal and points to a darker vein shot through the GSE story :
New research by Edward Pinto , a former chief credit officer for Fannie Mae and a housing expert , has found that from the time Fannie and Freddie began buying risky loans as early as 1993 , they routinely misrepresented the mortgages they were acquiring , reporting them as prime when they had characteristics that made them clearly subprime or Alt - A .
In general , a subprime mortgage refers to the credit of the borrower .
A FICO score of less than 660 is the dividing line between prime and subprime , but Fannie and Freddie were reporting these mortgages as prime , according to Mr. Pinto .
Fannie has admitted this in a third - quarter 10 - Q report in 2008 .
But because of Fannie and Freddie 's mislabeling , there were millions more high - risk loans outstanding .
That meant default rates as well as the actual losses after foreclosure were going to be outside all prior experience .
When these rates began to show up early in 2007 , it was apparent something was seriously wrong with assumptions on which AAA ratings had been based .
Losses , it was now certain , would invade the AAA tranches of the mortgage - backed securities outstanding .
Investors , having lost confidence in the ratings , fled the MBS market and ultimately the market for all asset - backed securities .
They have not yet returned .
It has become conventional wisdom , perhaps even cliche , to pin the origins of the credit crisis on the big banks or , AIG or even the practice of financial modeling .
Certainly , these actors have received the most play in the media , and have now endured the focus of populist ire for more than a year .
We now think that the analysis leading commentators to focus blame on these entities is fatally flawed .
We have seen no credible data that any of the large banks or other underwriters of mortgage backed securities ( " MBSs " ) or collaterized debt obligations ( " CDOs " ) or firms like AIG selling protection on same actually misrepresented the character of underlying collateral .
This is in direct contrast to the allegations of Edward Pinto as printed by the Wall Street Journal .
If Pinto is correct such that the mis-marking of mortgages by the GSEs and the discovery thereof destroyed confidence in the accuracy of ratings in mortgage backed securities and their derivatives ( and it seems probable to suspect that he is ) then it seems almost beyond question that the policies ( or policy malfeasance ) of Fannie and Freddie , and not the actions of large banks or firms like AIG are the proximate cause of not just the credit crisis , but also the continuing multi-act , multi- bailout farce that continues to be passed off to the public as necessary " stimulus . "
It takes only a cursory examination to suspect that misdirection plays a key part in the latest act of the ongoing crisis theater of the absurd .
Misdirection to distract attention from the key complicity of GSEs in the crisis .
Misdirection to deflect scrutiny away from the political personalities from both sides of the aisle responsible .
Misdirection to conceal what could only be described as the most damaging acts of accounting and securities fraud in the history of accounting , securities or fraud .
Precious few assumptions are required to come to conclusions laying responsibility for the largest economic disaster in recent memory at the feet of the GSEs .
First , that the GSEs had substantial influence over the mortgage market .
This is a no-brainer with the GSEs either holding or guaranteeing 51 % of outstanding home mortgage debt in 2003 .
To put this in perspective , that figure was around 33 % of the GDP of the entire United States in 2003 .
Read that last line again .
Anyone wishing to play in the market had to compete with the rates set by Fannie and Freddie .
Second , that the GSEs artificially depressed rates ( read : underpriced risk ) .
This is equally trivial to find given that this precise mandate has been the express purpose of the GSEs since at least 1993 .
The GSEs were not tasked with increasing the capacity for mortgage lending .
They were tasked with making loans " affordable . "
They used a number of tools to do so , but the key elements were acting as a proxy for quasi - government guarantees and bundling mortgages into risk tiers to act as a sort of clearing house for securitization pools .
It is often said that providing a guarantee ( particularly governmental ) reduces risk .
This is , of course , a fantasy .
All that explicitly or implicitly tax dollar backed guarantees do is socialize risk .
However , they manage to do so without requiring consolidation of the resulting liabilities on the government 's balance sheet .
Convenient that , yes ?
A guarantee is a subsidy .
Period .
Failing to understand this is what permitted the political class to mislead the American public into thinking that cheap loans for everything from housing to small businesses to education ( the next fiscal disaster on the horizon ) come with no cost .
( Or that cheap debt would n't pump up the price of everything from education to housing ) .
Today 's pundits seem to enjoy blaming " moral hazard " ( by which they mean " corporate moral hazard " ) for the crisis .
Oddly , government guarantees , particularly those that everyone assumes will be costless , are not typically part of this definition .
These assumptions , on their own should be sufficient to indict the GSEs , the totally unqualified and unaccountable recipients of political payoffs who occupied the executive offices of these fiscal singularities [ fn ] Just consider Fannie Mae 's torrid leadership history : James A. Johnson ( Fannie CEO 1991 - 1998 , Democratic luminary , Obama fundraiser , John Kerry vice presidential selection committee chair , $ 21 million in Fannie compensation ) .
Franklin Raines ( Fannie CEO 1999 - 2004 , Clinton 's Director Office of Management and Budget , $ 90 million + in Fannie compensation later the subject of a civil suit ) Daniel Mudd ( Fannie CEO 2005 - 2008 , $ 80 million in Fannie compensation ) Herbert M. Allison ( Fannie CEO 2008 - 2009 , National Finance Chair , John McCain Campaign ) .
Freddie 's record is no better . [/ fn ] and their other supporters ( including the voters who continued year after year to return these jokers to public office ) on charges of gross negligence .
If , as Pinto suggests , we add purposeful misrepresentation of underlying collateral to the mix three things become apparent :
First , absent some intervening criminal act by actors farther downstream ( and we may yet find some ) , we have isolated absolutely the cause of all that followed .
Second , it becomes quite easy to construct a criminal case for literally millions of counts of accounting , securities , wire and mail fraud against the GSEs .
To the extent executives at Fannie and Freddie signed off on financial statements disclosing the portion of their balance sheets that held " AAA " securities and these had been purposefully misidentified we should be exploring prosecution for violations under e.g. , Sarbanes - Oxley .
( Given , however , Rham Emanuel 's involvement in Freddie and Fannie , we are n't holding our breath ) .
Third , given the presence of blatant government price fixing in more than a third of the entire economy , the United States has n't been anything like a " free market " since before 2003 .
It should shock you that literally a third of the U.S. economy should become a playground for the social experiments of any political group of any party affiliation .
It probably will not shock you ( since you are reading Zero Hedge ) to find what may be the largest example of securities fraud ever directly connected to elected officials of the United States and their cronies .
Taking a step back , it should shock you that power over literally a third of the U.S. economy should ever have been allowed to become concentrated in two entities with blatantly socialist aims and under the control of executives with no relevant qualifications of any note other than loose purse strings on their political contribution satchels .
What should grip readers with even more substantial alarm is the combination of blank checking for Fannie and Freddie backstops , and the shifty manner in which these disclosures were made .
Is it possible anymore to doubt that the administration simply lied through its teeth while promising us it expects no need of increased credit lines for the GSEs while simultaneously expanding same literally to infinity ?
Given that Fannie , Freddie and the FHA have now taken up the mandate of supporting housing prices at any cost ( to the taxpayer via endless bailouts and unlimited credit ) is it possible in any way to credit the current " upturn " to fundamentals ?
When we factor in similar capture of the FDIC and the like , where does this leave us , exactly ?
Permit us to ask a few questions :
1 . Why are Fannie and Freddie still operating in any way whatsoever ?
2. Given that their credibility for reliable ( or even remotely non-fiction ) financial disclosure nears complete obliteration , who is likely to buy anything from these entities in the future ?
( If you said " The Fed " you may advance to the bonus round ) .
Surely the conflict of interest implicit in government ownership does nothing to improve the situation .
Perhaps the news that the Fed plans to issue securities to shrink its balance sheet and reverse " quantitative easing " describes an attempt to securitize the tattered reputation of the GSEs ?
Will the Fed simply aggregate its balance sheet and issue tranches ?
Does that make the Fed simple the collateralized debt obligation ( " CDO " ) of last resort ?
Who will do the rating ?
Who will be writing protection on CDO Fed Tranch A - 1 ( AAA ) ?
3 . Given that neither entity is currently monitored by an Inspector General ( despite what used to be statutory language so mandating ) and both entities are completely captured by the current administration , how can it be anything other than insanity to expect any result from these entities other than the formation ( or expansion ) of a ravenous fiscal black hole ?
4. Given increasing government control beyond Fannie and Freddie that now extends far beyond 33 % of GDP , what can we expect if we continue to permit political parties of any stripe to exercise command and control influence over what is now probably a simple majority of our economy ?
There was a time when we hoped that the United States would learn its lesson with respect to permitting political control over large swaths of private markets .
Today that time seems very long ago , and somewhat naive .
Perhaps we are being too harsh on the likes of Barney Frank and other GSE proponents .
Adopting a slighty more relativistic economic morality , we might count Frank as one of the greatest legislators of all time .
Consider :
To the extent Mr. Frank and his ilk self - identify as advocates for low - cost housing for those ill - able to afford it , or beset by poor credit , the last 20 years have represented the largest single wealth transfer ( composed primarily of real estate and flat screen TVs ) to that sector known to us .
Not only that , but given the de facto nationalization of MBS portfolios ( we 'll give you three guesses who have been the largest MBS buyers over the last several quarters ) the GSEs and their supporters have managed to get taxpayers to pay for it all .
Of course , had they simply proposed such a measure in Congress it would have been laughed from the chamber .
And yet , it almost seems as if these individuals simply wrote a multi-trillion dollar check to their constituents that happened to be drawn on the United States Treasury .
It almost seems this way because it was this way .
Good news indeed .
I ’m really impressed with IE7 – it will make a huge difference when it is released .
Standards compliance , a great rendering engine and better Javascript are really exciting .
[...]
IE7 JavaScript Improvements is interesting to mention . [...]
There is still a lot to be done though .
e.g. prototypes on Object extensions on HtmlElement
While certainely true that this is very good news , do not forget that we already have browsers with all these features .
So , it ’s still a game of catch - up for IE .
Ie7 is a huge improvement , I wonder though if it will actually make programmers work easyer in th NEAR future .
Since they still will have maintain backwards compatibility .
If you rate IE7 compared to Firefox / Opera , then yes it ’s nothing special .
If you rate IE7 compared to IE6 it ’s a huge leap forward .
Really happy with the improvements they ’ve made and hope there ’s more to come .
Recently been designing a new CV site there ’s been very little in the way of specific IE7 fixes .
Still have to have an additional css for IE6 and below , but at least that will eventually become a thing of the past .
Although we should all be happy because ( a lot of us ) are web designers and developers , maybe we should n’t be happy because Microsoft is just putting bugs right that should have never existed in the first place !
While it is nice that IE 7 has performance and standards improvements in the JScript engine , it ’s catch - up arrival is late in the game .
JScript ( JavaScript ) itself is still a client - side “ convenience ” script .
Your good designers are using less and less JavaScript in favor of server - side scripting in every new design .
The future trend , mostly based on a culminating increase in data reliance and security , is to use none , or as little JavaScript as possible .
If JavaScript is turned off , your web site and your forms better still work without it .
really good support for Jscript .
but it doesnt get easy on developers they will still need to keep up with prior versions since market wont switch to IE7 quickly .
When reading some replies I am very doubtful if these are real improvements .
See for example this reply :

javascript in IE7 RC1 still does not work well for me .
Actualy , some javascript that can be executed with the IE7 beta 2 does not work in IE7 RC1 .
One of my major problems with the IE& is that I still cannot use properly an old MSDN Library for Visual Studio 6.0 since many links in it execute some javascript which ca n’t be run with IE7 .
‘ Your good designers are using less and less JavaScript in favor of server - side scripting in every new design . ’
On the contary , javascript has had a fresh lease of life , enabling a whole range of web apps that owe there snappy performance and rich featureset to ajax style scripting .
After all lower server hits can only be a good thing , unless you ’re in the ad sales game !
Lets hope that IE7 js really does banish the sluggish performance and soul destroying memory leaks that developers have had to fight with IE6 .
I have been looking at IE7 and in many ways it seems better , but I have a major problem with the way it is implementing JavaScript arrrays .
I have an old application that holds data in a large Javascript array .
This has always worked fine .
However , in IE7 it falls over .
It seems like it is just falling over when an array gets too big .
Has anyone else come across this problem or any related problem with IE7 .
I have been hunting around and cannot find any reference to an upper limit to array sizes in JavaScript .
