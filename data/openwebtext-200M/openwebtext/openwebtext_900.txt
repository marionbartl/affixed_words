It was time , the panel of experts said , to put more science in forensic science .
A report in February by a committee of the National Academy of Sciences found “ serious problems ” with much of the work performed by crime laboratories in the United States .
Recent incidents of faulty evidence analysis  including the case of an Oregon lawyer who was arrested by the F.B.I. after the 2004 Madrid terrorist bombings based on fingerprint identification that turned out to be wrong  were just high - profile examples of wider deficiencies , the committee said .
Crime labs were overworked , there were few certification programs for investigators and technicians , and the entire field suffered from a lack of oversight .
But perhaps the most damning conclusion was that many forensic disciplines  including analysis of fingerprints , bite marks and the striations and indentations left by a pry bar or a gun ’s firing mechanism  were not grounded in the kind of rigorous , peer - reviewed research that is the hallmark of classic science .
DNA analysis was an exception , the report noted , in that it had been studied extensively .
But many other investigative tests , the report said , “ have never been exposed to stringent scientific scrutiny . ”
While some forensic experts took issue with that conclusion , many welcomed it .
And some scientists are working on just the kind of research necessary to improve the field .
They are refining software and studying human decision - making to improve an important aspect of much forensic science  the ability to recognize and compare patterns .
The report was “ basically saying what many of us have been saying for a long time , ” said Lawrence Kobilinsky , chairman of the department of sciences at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York .
“ There are a lot of areas in forensics that need improvement . ”
An international court battle involving government - imposed restrictions on political expression has ensnared two right - leaning British intellectuals .
Writers Simon Sheppard and Stephen Whittle stand convicted of violating modern British laws against " stirring up racial and religious hatred " for publishing , among other things , an allegedly anti-Semitic comic book called " Tales of the Holohoax " as well as a nativist - British pamphlet called " Do n't Be Sheeple " .
As the irrepressible creators of a pugnacious web site called ' Herectical.com ' , Shepard and Whittle ( who writes under the pen name , ' Luke O'Farrell ' ) have published scores of taboo - busing manifestos , cultural critiques and satires , as well as numerous scientific papers and ' general interest ' material .
But it all came to a crashing end last year under the boot heel of a British court .
What 's worse , their prickly commentary was about to earn them a multi- year stint in an English jail .
Outraged at what they consider politically based persecution , the two dissenters chose instead to seek political asylum in America .
Then the US Dept. of Homeland Security stepped in .
The most recent chapter of their political odyssey began on July 14 , 2008 , when Sheppard and Whittle ( dubbed the ' Heretical Two ' ) delivered themselves to US authorities at Los Angeles International Airport upon their arrival from Europe .
But instead of sanctuary they received a one - way ticket to the Santa Ana jail ; this , despite the fact that they entered the US legally and the contents of their published works violate no US law .
In fact , the server headquarters of their web site , Heretical.com , is located in California .
Despite this , an American judge presiding over their asylum case has refused to grant them bail .
Sheppard and Whittle remain in police custody under the watchful eye of the US Dept. of Homeland Security .
' News Blackout ' Spells Invisibility Meanwhile , the mainstream media has shown persistent indifference to this noteworthy First Amendment brawl , even though the case 's legal implications are newsworthy , perplexing and perhaps even precedent setting , But why would the mainstream media play a passively hostile role towards these Free Speech activists ?
Why ?
Because the Heretical Two qualify as exemplars of Britain's ' far Right ' , a movement that 's antagonistic towards many modern conventions concerning race , sexuality , feminism , Third World immigration and Israel 's elevated status in the West .
The ' far right 's ' political agenda stands in direct opposition to the multi-cultural transformation of Europe and North America that 's been in progress for the past half century .
Many rightists allege that these cultural changes have been advanced by influential jurists , financiers , as well as major players in news , publishing and entertainment .
When one considers this , the mystery behind the media 's self - imposed blackout becomes a lot easier to comprehend ..
Bruce Leichty , Sheppard and Whittle 's former immigration attorney , had this to say about the bizarre British edict that prompted the Heretical Two to take flight : " Under this novel application of [ British ] law , American citizens , or indeed citizens of any nation , are rendered subject to arrest and prosecution by the British authorities if anything they post on the world wide web is deemed in breach of British laws governing the discussion of race and religion " .
These extra-national laws pose a direct challenge to America 's First Amendment rights .
Meanwhile , Sheppard and Whittle languish in an American jail , unseen and unknown .
This undermines their quest for freedom since publicity is vital to raising funds to sustain their legal battle .
But the Heretical Two are not alone .
In Europe , additional dissenters on the Right are being targeted .
Others , like Holocaust skeptics Ernst Zundel and Germar Rudolf , remain behind bars .
One recent target , a conservative Catholic Bishop named Richard Williamson has come under intense pressure for remarks he made about the official Holocaust story on Swedish TV .
This is how it 's playing out in the mainstream news : Jews Tell Vatican : Holocaust Denial is a Crime http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090209/wl_nm/us_pope_jews
By Philip Pullella ( 2/9/09 ) VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - World Jewish leaders told Vatican officials that denying the Holocaust was " not an opinion but a crime " whenthey met on Monday to discuss a bishop they accuse of being anti-Semitic .
The meetings , the first since the controversy over Bishop Richard Williamson , who denies the extent of the Holocaust , began last month , took place three days before Pope Benedict is due to address a group of American Jewish leaders .
Williamson told Swedish television in an interview broadcast in January : " I believe there were no gas chambers . "
He said no more than 300,000 Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
" Today we strongly reaffirmed that the denial of the Shoah is not an opinion , but a crime , " said Richard Prasquier , president of the French Jewish umbrella organization CRIF , using the Hebrew word for Holocaust .
The headline and narrative are fairly typical of the news - bites that frame this unique kind of dispute .
In this instance , the reader findsthe accused Bishop alone , stigmatized and denounced by numerous authoritative sources and even a court .
The Jewish perspective is given overwhelming prominence .
Nowhere in the article are there any defenders of Williamson 's position .
The vital issues of Free Speech and political liberty are altogether absent .
Case closed .
In most any other context , the attempt by government to impose criminal penalties for mere utterances would be questioned -- if not deplored -- in the article itself .
But arguments involving the Holocaust and Jewish sensitivities are treated , in the mainstream media at least , with unique partisanship .
The London Times ( Online edition , 2/9/09 ) proclaims : British Diplomat Arrested Over " Anti-Semitic ' Rant http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5693687.ece
" Allegations that a senior British diplomat launched into an anti-Semitic rant in a London gym while watching TV footage from Gaza willnot upset the " treadmill of diplomacy " , the Israeli Ambassador to London said today .
In a curiously tongue - in - cheek response to a case that has provoked concern within the Jewish community in Britain , Ron Prosor addedthat the tirade did not reflect " the health and fitness of our relations " .
The diplomat , 47 - year - old Rowan Laxton , allegedly shouted " f*** ing Israelis , f*** ing Jews " while watching television reports of the Israeli attack on Gaza last month .
He is also alleged to have said that Israeli soldiers should be " wiped off the face of the Earth " during the rant at the London Business School gym near Regents Park on January 27 .
The tirade reportedly continued even after other gym users asked him to stop .
After a complaint from a member of the public , Mr. Laxton was arrested for inciting religious hatred - which can carry a seven - year prison term - and bailed to reappear at a central London police station at the end of March . "
When the dust settles , the curious reader is left with this unanswered question :
What 's worse ?- using the F - word in the same sentenceas the word ' Jew ' ? - or a military invasion and assault upon a civilian population by an overpowering , nuclear - ready foreign power ?
TheLondon Times ' news slant would suggest that insensitive language is the more disturbing of the two .
On this matter , the various writers on the editorial pages of the same newspaper are silent .
Meanwhile , Mr. Laxton is facing real jail time for his verbal protest .
' Overrepresentation ' : So What ?
Have Big Media and Big Government joined forces to advance an ethnic agenda ?
It 's looking that way .
Writing in the LA times ( 12/19/08 ) columnist Joel Stein adds humor and realism to the stunning reality of ethnic monopoly in Big Media / Entertainment ..
He writes : http://www.latimes.com/news/columnists/la-oe-stein19-2008dec19,0,3844853.column
" How deeply Jewish is Hollywood ?
When the studio chiefs took out a full - page ad in the Los Angeles Times a few weeks ago to demandthat the Screen Actors Guild settle its contract , the open letter was signed by : News Corp.
President Peter Chernin ( Jewish ) , ParamountPictures Chairman Brad Grey ( Jewish ) , Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger ( Jewish ) , Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton ( surprise , Dutch Jew ) , Warner Bros.
Chairman Barry Meyer ( Jewish ) , CBS Corp.
Chief Executive Leslie Moonves ( so Jewish his great uncle was the first prime minister of Israel ) , MGM Chairman Harry Sloan ( Jewish ) and NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker ( mega - Jewish ) .
If either of the Weinstein brothers had signed , this group would have not only the power to shut down all film productionbut to form a minyan with enough Fiji water on hand to fill a mikvah . "
Stein clears the air .
And he 's pretty funny about it .
But the impact of ethnic activism in media and government must be assessed , and critically - without the threat of reprisal .
Stein expresses good - natured sympathy for Hollywood 's ethnic outsiders ( plain old white folks ) explaining : " The Jews are so dominant , I had to scour the trades to come up with six Gentiles in high positions at entertainment companies .
When Icalled them to talk about their incredible advancement , five of them refused to talk to me , apparently out of fear of insulting Jews .
Thesixth , AMC President Charlie Collier , turned out to be Jewish . "
But concentrated power with a global agenda can become very un-funny indeed .
Just ask the Heretical Two .
When wealth , talent , religion and government merge , there can be many , many causalities .
Whittle , in the meantime , warns about federal legislation here in the US that also poses a danger to traditional American liberties .
" [ House ] bill HR - 1955 " , he notes , " is ready to begin pushing the US down the same slope as the UK and European Union " .
Though this bill finally stalled in the Senate , it received overwhelmingly support by both parties in the House .
The bill , HR - 1955 , was named the " Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act " by its liberal ( and Jewish ) sponsor , Jane Harman ( D - CA ) .
It contained numerous provisions criminalizing , among other things , " hate speech " , which is code for selectively targeting fiery political expression .
Senator Joe Lieberman ( D - CT ) is expected to sponsor a similar bill later this year .
Other bills now under consideration in the House ( HR - 256 and HR - 262 ) also seek to broaden and enhance ' hate speech ' penalties .
But as America 's Zionized conflicts in Iraq , Afghanistan and Iran push forward , larger problems surely loom .
Nevertheless , eliminating politically incorrect speech remains high on the agenda of both political parties .
With help from advisors linked to the ADL , lawmakers in Washington are now crafting legislation aimed at circumventing Free Speech guarantees enumerated in the Bill of Rights .
Pro-Zionist Personality Syndrome ?
The pro-Zionist personality that 's been on the forefront of condemning dissent was put under the microscope recently by blogger / activist Karin Friedmann , who states : " Jews in America are socially empowered to go way beyond the learned trauma of the Jewish experience that results in typical reactionary behavior .
They actually participate in group behavior that is deliberately manipulative and abusive - aimed at punishing activists who stand up for human equality and justice .
Over the years , US Jews have become increasingly nutty not only due to currentevents but due to the internet " alerts " coming to them from Jewish lobbyists , who solidify their brains in this self - righteous fantasy world where Hamas is a terrorist organization , where Israel has some kind of right to kill and rob non-Jews .
" So we are dealing with not only dangerous reactions based on past trauma - actually learned trauma based on a glorified and fictionalized past - but American Jews are actually being trained since childhood to interact with non-Jews in a deceitful and arrogant manner , in coordination with each other , to emotionally destroy Gentiles and Israel critics , in addition to wrecking their careers and interfering with their social relationships .
This is actually deliberate , wicked , planned behavior motivated by a narcissistic self - righteousfury . "
The pro-Zionist personality is so commonplace that it's now considered normal .
But when far right dissenters ( often smeared as white supremacists ) gather publicly to legally and non-violently advance their own worldview , they are typically set upon by even larger numbers of left wing ' counter - demonstrators ' .
There 's hate speech aplenty during these rare encounters , only it usually comes from the so - called anti-fascists ..
I recall attending a rally for Pat Buchanan when he ran for President a decade or more ago .
At an otherwise peaceful assemblage of Middle Americans who came to hear Buchanan 's speech , was a raucous band of aggressive protesters with signs the read " Stop Fascism " and " No Nazis Allowed . "
Why are n't inflammatory insults like these considered a form of hate speech ?
A Left - Right confrontation of this kind happened recently in Germany .
When rightists attempted to march in commemoration of the Allied annihilation of Dresden during WWII , hundreds of self - described anti-fascists showed up in an attempt to disupt the demonstration .
Many were arrested .
Significantly , when the shoe is on the other foot , the anti-fascist crowd shows a remarkable disregard for civil liberties .
But if we step back and take a broader perspective , the case can be made that hate speech is far more common than realized .
And it does n't involve the usual suspects .
To find it , simply pick up a newspaper or turn on the TV .
Right there you 'll find intellectuals , pundits and political leaders using language like " All options are on the table " as they gently threaten mass - murder against soverign peoples who governments are either insufficiently democratic or embody some form of stategic threat .
At the very least , language utilizing the implied threat of massive State violence surely functions as diplomatic terrorism .
This mafioso - style of diplomacy is routinely used by the US against Israel 's foes .
Clearly , making the world safe for Zionism is an endless job .
This surely explains why there 's an increasing emphasis upon one tragic episode of WWII , even as we travel further and further away in time from the event itself .
Indeed , due to rising media coverage , the Holocaust has become as large - or bigger - than any political episode in modern history .
In America today , denying the existence of God is a trifle compared to expressing skepticism about the How and Why and How Many died at the hands of Nazis during WWII .
Significantly , comparable ( or greater ) crimes that occurred under Stalin during the same era are consistently ignored .
This is probably because details of that kind could detract from what 's become the dominant narrative of our time .
Indeed , the Holocaust has come to stand for the supreme expresssion of Gentile inhumanity towards an innocent , less numerous ( but greater ) people .
It also serves to reminds Jews that only their unity , determination and vigilance can possibly save them from the lurking evil found within the hearts of Gentiles .
On a more practical level , the Holocaust story is essential to the maintaining the dubious legitimacy of the Jewish State , a race - centered entity established for the world 's most international , influential and affluent ethnicity , Without the unique and supreme suffering described in Holocaust lore , Israel might be seen as little more than a chauvinistic colony on a land that deserves , at the very least , to be shared by all .
Opposing views about The Holocaust ( and Jewish history ) now define the outer limits of Free Speech in the Western World .
Without the courageous sacrifice by a handful of dissidents , this might never change .

Notes
All figures assume optimum burst height
Thermal radiation is non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation which has a significant heating effect .
Air is virtually transparent to thermal radiation .
At the destructive radius , the thermal radiation intensity is sufficient to cause lethal burns .
The first air blast is 4.6 psi overpressure , which is sufficient to collapse most residential and industrial structures .
Note that exposed humans can actually survive such a blast , about 1/3 bar above standard .
However , that much pressure exerted against the face of a building exerts very high force ( a 40 foot tall , 50 foot wide structure would be hit with more than 600 tons - force ) .
The second air blast category is 20 psi overpressure , which is sufficient to destroy virtually any large above - ground structure and cause nearly 100 % fatalities .
Ionizing radiation is electromagnetic radiation of sufficient frequency ( and hence energy ) to literally " knock off " electrons from atoms , thus ionizing them .
Ionizing radiation is extremely dangerous but it is also strongly absorbed by air , unlike thermal radiation .
At the 500rem dosage , mortality is between 50 % and 90 % , although this can be mitigated with prompt and sophisticated medical care ( which may not be available in the aftermath of a nuclear attack ) .
Fireball duration is based on emission intensity reduction to 10 % of peak .

The RIAA 's lawsuit campaign against individual file - sharers never quite seems to wrap up , and as long as the music labels continue filing their suits , stories about how the RIAA is a lying collection of lying liars ( who lie ) are n't going to die either .
Such a story came yesterday from Ray Beckerman , the lawyer who runs the Recording Industry vs. The People blog .
Beckerman noted that the music labels had filed new cases in April , despite their claim to Congress ( and Ars ) that they had stopped " initiating new lawsuits " in August 2008 .
That claim , says Beckerman , was a " total fabrication , " and the continued court filings prove it .
There are n't many of these " new " cases ; Beckerman found three in New York .
But why are they being filed at all ?
It depends on what " new " means
The answer remains ( as it has every time we 've covered this issue ) that the RIAA did not pledge to stop filing legal documents .
The group 's own definition of " new cases " does not include those that were already in process as " John Doe " cases or where settlement letters had already gone out .
This was the case in March , when the RIAA filed a case against an Omaha resident for file - swapping .
Those hypocrites !
But the case had been detected in 2007 , a John Doe lawsuit was filed months later , and once the necessary account information was subpoenaed from the ISP , the John Doe suit was replaced with a named lawsuit in March 2009 .
An RIAA spokesperson told us at the time that the issue was about fairness ( though we raised some obvious questions about just how fair it was ) .
" We 're obviously pleased to transition to a new program going forward but that does n't mean we can give a free pass to those who downloaded music illegally in the past , " we were told .
" How fair would it be to the thousands of individuals who took responsibility for their actions and settled their case while others are let off the hook ?
We 're still in the business of deterrence and it must be credible . "
We checked in with the RIAA about the cases filed in April and were told that the group is " making a diligent , good faith effort to settle existing cases ( see Santangelo , for example ) .
But in instances where the defendant flat - out refuses to accept responsibility for their actions and settle , or ignores repeated overtures , we have no choice but to move forward with the legal process .
As we have said since December , no new cases are being filed . "
The lawyers we 've spoken with do n't see any legal necessity for the labels to continue with these cases , but the labels have decided that they will press ahead with them , regardless .
The interesting questions
It does make one wonder just how many more of these lawsuits could yet be filed or converted to named suits .
The RIAA has terminated its relationship with P2P investigator MediaSentry , but it appears to be reserving the right to bring every case identified by MediaSentry to completion .
Most such cases are settled for a few thousand dollars , but we do n't know how many outstanding cases there might be .
But the truly interesting question is n't about whether the RIAA will file a couple dozen more named lawsuits in the upcoming months — nor about whether the group will be " hypocritical " when it does so .
No , the interesting questions are about whether existing lawsuits like the Joel Tenenbaum and Jammie Thomas cases will deal the legal campaign a fatal blow in court , and about just how well the RIAA is doing at lining up ISPs for its voluntary graduated response program .
This , after all , is the future as the RIAA sees it .
The lawsuits are the past , but " three strikes and you 're off the Internet " offers a way forward .
Unfortunately for the music labels , ISPs are supremely skeptical .
We give the idea a few more months before the labels basically abandon the voluntary approach and try to lean on Congress — probably the only realistic way to convince ISPs to disconnect paying customers .
But as the Time Warner Cable data caps issue showed , nothing makes the grassroots angrier than a massive corporation interfering with their Internet .
And nothing gives a Congressman or Senator more incentive to stand up to corporations than an angry mob of voters .
Imagine a United States President that was aware – aware of Peak Oil ( and all that this means for our ability to feed ourselves ) , aware of Peak Soil , aware of Peak Water , aware of the health implications of industrial agriculture , a system that locks us into a cycle of stupidity and is doomed to fail us in every way .
Imagine a President that realised that we ’re facing an economic and environmental crisis without precedent , where consumer demands will soon become far simpler than they have been – where the desire for cheap electronics and holidays is already giving way to the more pressing need to put affordable food on the table .
Such a President might be tempted to set an example to his nation ( and , indeed , the world ) with the land at his disposal , might he not ?
During WWII , First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt planted a large Victory Garden on the White House lawn , inspiring millions of Americans by her example .
If ever there was a time to inspire citizens with the potential of their lawns to solve a great many problems – now is that time !

Excerpts from Teddy Roosevelt ’s Practical Field Guide to Hunting and Killing Care Bears
T
HERE is no greater test of a man ’s mettle than the tracking and killing of the American Ursa cura — the Care Bear , an animal known for its agility and cleverness , as well as its deceptive cuddliness .
This is the only guide to the art of capturing and killing the elusive Care Bear , penned by a man who has hunted , hated , and been haunted by the fuzzy might and majesty of the Care Bear .
First thing ’s first : Keep your distance .
If you get too close , the Care Bears will try to hug you .
Either one at a time or as a group .
Avoid contact at all costs .
If you find yourself in the midst of a hugging , ride it out .
Let it run its natural course — which will be longer than you expect .
The psychological damage of a hug lasting six hours or longer is immeasurable and can require self - termination .
My schoolmate Rupert was hugged for that length , and now works in theatre .
Poor Rupert — Better to die with honor than spend the rest of your days a limp - wristed nancy .
Care Bears will try to hug you , one at a time OR AS A GROUP .
I often hear fops , dandies , and dunderheads nattering on about adverse weather conditions during Care Bear hunts .
Adverse ?
More like ideal .
Listen here : Care Bears love rainbows .
They ’ve practically run the leprechauns away from them .
And one cannot have a rainbow without a little rain .
So you get a little damp — so what ?
When you see the flash of your muzzle , and hear the explosion of bone and gristle and the soft thud of that Care Bear hitting the leafy forest floor , well , you ’ll feel like it ’s the sunniest day at the county fair .
When I ’m in the woods on a hunt , I like to remember this simple acrostic : CARE .
Stands for “ Come Armed Ready to Execute . ”
It ’s simple .
Remembering can save you from being incapacitated by the Care Bears ’ most devastating form of defense , the Care Bear Stare .
( Beams of blinding light shine from their chests but their beady shark eyes stay black as night . )
Many a dimwitted novice has mistakenly assumed that Care Bears are more difficult to track because their scat is comprised of “ rainbows and happy thoughts . ”
This is just a rumor ; a Care Bear is a bear first and foremost , and , yes , bears shit in the woods .
So find those round balls of glittery shit and you ’re well on the way to shooting a Care Bear right in the fuzzy bits .
As a side note , that kind with a cupcake on its chest does n’t taste like cake .
It just tastes like regular bear , but grind its flesh anyway .
It makes a tasty sausage , provided you have the right seasoning .
The Care Bear might try to lull you in to a false sense of security — outfox the bugger at its own game .
Smile at it , then talk softly and beat it with a big stick .
And you can feel environmentally positive as you do so .
That tree you just cut down ?
Its branch in your hand is now an instrument of cuddly ursine death .
If that ’s not conservation at its finest , by Gum , then my name ’s not Teddy Roosevelt !
Like any hunting exhibition , appropriate dress is key if you want to get the animal in your cuddle crosshairs .
The Care Bear is drawn to little girls in distress .
Use this to your advantage .
On your hunting exhibitions wear little - girl clothes .
( It ’s advised to wear bloomers around the house until you get used to them and feel natural .
I ’m wearing mine as I pen this guide in an attempt to access my inner bear hunter .
And they are remarkably comfortable ) .
When you come upon a pack of grazing Care Bears , you may feel the urge to wait for a clear shot at a particular bear — say , the one with the belly badge .
Stuff and nonsense .
Blast the first bugger you see right between its beady little eyes .
Blam -o !
A common mistake is to leave your bear stand before the very last minute of the hunting day .
Many men are eager to race home to eat the porridge their wives have made them and change out of their hunting bloomers .
These men are damned fools !
Often the best shooting is done when the last speck of light shines from the sun onto the sun-shaped belly badge of a Care Bear and the two of you lock eyes .
And then you kill him .
Kill him dead .
I ’ve heard talk by some ninnies that the best mounting of the Care Bear is that of its belly .
They say the cupcake , or the rainbow , or the smiling sun represents the proud part of the Care Bear .
This is rubbish .
Leave the rainbows to the womenfolk and their cross-stitching .
Mount the head like a man , unless you shot the Care Bear in the face .
Then do not mount it at all .
Medieval castle in Scotland ( Image : The Travel Library / Rex Features )
Europe basked in unusually warm weather in medieval times , but why has been open to debate .
Now the natural climate mechanism that caused the mild spell seems to have been pinpointed .
The finding is significant today because , according to Valerie Trouet at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest , Snow , and Landscape Research in Birmensdorf , the mechanism that caused the warm spell in Europe – and meant wine could be produced in England as it is now – cannot explain current warming .
It means the medieval warm period was mainly a regional phenomenon caused by altered heat distribution rather than a global phenomenon .
The finding scuppers one of the favourite arguments of climate - change deniers .
If Europe had temperature increases before we started emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases , their argument goes , then maybe the current global warming is n’t caused by humans , either .

To work out what the global climate was doing 1000 years ago during the so - called “ Medieval Warm Period ” , Trouet and colleagues started by looking at the annual growth rings of Moroccan Atlas cedar trees and of a stalagmite that grew in a Scottish cave beneath a peat bog .
This revealed how dry or wet it has been in those regions over the last 1000 years .
Temperature over the past 1000 years
The weather in Scotland is highly influenced by a semi- permanent pressure system called the Icelandic Low , and that in Morocco by another called the Azores High .
“ So by combining our data , which showed a very wet medieval Scotland and very dry Morocco , we could work out how big the pressure difference between those areas was during that time , ” says Trouet .
Warm blast
This pressure difference in turn revealed that the medieval period must have experienced a strongly positive North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) – the ocean current that drives winds from the Atlantic over Europe .
The more positive the NAO is , the more warm air is blown towards the continent .
The idea to use growth rings to work out past climate change is not new , but Trouet ’s team is the first to look back beyond 1400 in the European record .
They found that the strongly positive NAO lasted for about 350 years from 1050 to 1400 .
By combining their data with information from other regions of the world during medieval times and plugging it into different models , the researchers have also come up with a hypothesis of what made the warm winds so persistent .
“ It turns out that in the tropical Pacific , the El Niño system was in a negative La Niña mode , meaning it was colder than normal , ” says Trouet .
Climate loop
El Niño and the NAO are connected by a process called thermohaline circulation , which drives the “ ocean conveyor belt ” that shuttles sea water of different density around the world ’s oceans .
According to Trouet , a Pacific La Niña mode and a positive NAO mode could have reinforced each other in a positive feedback loop – and this could explain the stability of the medieval climate anomaly .
Trouet thinks external forces like abrupt changes in solar output or volcanism must have started and stopped the cycle , and hopes to pinpoint the most likely candidates in a workshop with other climatologists in May .
‘ Profound implications ’
Michael Mann at Pennsylvania State University says that based on the analyses and modelling that he has done , increased solar output and a reduction in volcanoes spouting cooling ash into the atmosphere could have not only kicked off the medieval warming , but might also have maintained it directly .
Mann is also concerned that the dominance of medieval La Niña conditions now indicated by Trouet ’s work might make it more likely that the current man-made warming could also put the El Niño system back into a La Niña mode , although most climate models so far had predicted the opposite .
“ If this happens , then the implications are profound , because regions that are already suffering from increased droughts as a result of climate warming , like western North America , will become even drier if La Niña prevails in the future ” , he says .

In his TEDTalk , blogger and statistics whiz Nate Silver explained how race may have affected the 2008 election .
In this interview with the TEDBlog he further explores the relationships between urban spaces , race and President Obama .
Here ’s an excerpt :
I see Obama as being our first urban president in a long time .
His racial heritage is mixed , he was raised by a single mother , he ’s lived in several places , from Indonesia to Hawaii to the Midwest .
For many people living in our cities , especially in their 20s and 30s , this is normal .
I think urban -ness is the real factor .

What did you think of your TEDTalk ?
Have you watched it yet ?
Actually , no .
I have n’t watched it because I just hate watching myself , but I ’ve heard the video quality is excellent .
So , thanks .
What about actually being and speaking at TED ?
What did you think of that ?
I was definitely flattered to be there .
I had friends who said , “ If you ’re lucky , you ’ll get invited . ”
It was really cool to be surrounded by bright people doing things in very different walks of life .
It ’s not often that you get to be around that many different types of people , left and right - brained , young and old , and all very bright .
I do n’t get intimidated easily , but this was a fairly intimidating caliber of people as well as the presentations themselves .
Also , I went on the last day and there were advantages and disadvantages to that .
It gave me more time to prepare , but as the time for my talk approached I began to have this impending sense of doom .
And of course , as I said , watching the other presentations was most intimidating .
Have you seen the comments on your talk , either on TED.com or on the TED facebook page ?
No , not yet .
I hope they ’re good .
What are they ?
Well , there are definitely a lot of positive comments , but there are also some strong reactions on the topic of race , in general .
Did you expect strong reactions ?
Well , I think anytime I ’m discussing politics in general , I expect strong reactions .
And , when you include race with politics — definitely .
But everything had to be discussed in a nine minute presentation , and I was trying to present these very complex issues in a way that does them justice , but also knowing that I could not dot every i and cross every t.
People sometimes assume that because I have n’t emphasized something , I have n’t thought if it .
If they want more detailed discussions , they should definitely read my blog .
In your talk , you identified two factors with strong predictive relationships to racism , education and neighborhoods , but you did n’t talk much about the role of education .
Could you speak to that now ?
In some ways , it seems self - evident that racism is in part born out of ignorance , and a sound liberal education should make you familiar with others who are different .
Even the mere act of going to college means you interact with people from different parts of the state and country .
College is the most artificially diverse environment available to us .
My experience was that interacting with my classmates was the most important part of my undergraduate experience .
With respect to the points you made about neighborhoods , some of the commenters have asked about correlation and causation , specifically whether racism is caused by living in a monoracial neighborhood , or whether more racist people move to monoracial neighborhoods .
What do you think about that ?
I think the arrows point both ways .
It ’s hard to draw causalities .
There ’s a book by Bill Bishop , called “ The Big Sort , ” that shows that people have become more likely to choose their neighborhood on ideological grounds .
If you have a preference to be surrounded by only white people , you can be .
It ’s hard to separate out the causalities .
When you collected and analyzed this data , and realized that there were substantial proportions of people whose votes were influenced by race , did you find this at all disheartening ?
Well , first of all , I think it was evident throughout the 2008 campaign that race was playing a part .
The media attempted not to make too much of it , but it was there .
But , I do n’t know how you can be too disheartened when it was only 40 years ago that everyone in the country was truly given the right to participate , under the Civil Rights Act — so that ’s within one generation .
I do n’t know how we can be disheartened when today we can elect a black President .
However , we have to be careful as some people have gone too far in the opposite direction because Obama won , and have become complacent .
Interestingly , among the states with more racially biased voting , the states where Obama campaigned were less biased .
I think this is because of familiarity — because of his visibility , Obama became a virtual neighbor .
It will be interesting to see what happens in 2012 , to see how many people are still this way .
He will be very familiar after four years as President .
I found your theory on the cul de sac design of suburbs encouraging racism very interesting .
How did you come up with this idea ?
I ’m just a big fan of urban spaces .
I lived in Chicago for years , and then just a few weeks ago I moved to Brooklyn .
Personally , I find it more interesting to interact with the people in my neighborhood .
But I ’m certainly not an urban planner or an urban designer .
One thing that I did n’t have a chance to discuss during the talk was how well Obama performed in urban areas , especially among urban white voters .
The fact that he ’s from a major city is very unusual .
I see Obama as being our first urban president in a long time .
His racial heritage is mixed , he was raised by a single mother , he ’s lived in several places , from Indonesia to Hawaii to the Midwest .
For many people living in our cities , especially in their 20s and 30s , this is normal .
I think urban -ness is the real factor .
If you had a little more time for your TEDTalk , is there something else you would have liked to say ?
In a nine - minute presentation , you ’re trying to give a tasting menu , to give somewhat of an overview instead of focusing on one specific point .
I found a curve and put it together and a lot of the numbers had to be overlooked .
I would encourage people to visit my website for more detail .
Simon Baron - Cohen has had autism research misreported in the UK press ( Image : Brian Harris / Rex )
WHEN media reports state that scientist X of Y university has discovered that A is linked to B , we ought to be able to trust them .
Sadly , as many researchers know , we can’t .
This has three serious consequences .
For starters , every time the media misreports science , it chips away at the credibility of both enterprises .
Misreporting can also engender panic , as people start to fear the adverse consequences of the supposed new link between A and B. Lastly , there can be a damaging effect on researchers ’ …

DETROIT , April 20 ( UPI ) -- U.S. automaker General Motors Corp. said Monday it would cut 1,600 white - collar jobs over the next few days to help it qualify for government assistance .
In an e-mail , GM's North American President Troy Clarke said the automaker was " reinventing every aspect of our business , including our organizational size and structure to create a lean and agile company . "

Clarke said the company was going through " very trying times … but especially for those employees directly impacted by these actions , " the Kansas City Business Journal reported Monday .
In March , GM commenced laying off 3,400 salaried employees as part of a downsizing of 47,000 positions it expects to conclude by the end of the year .
Company spokesman Tom Wilkinson said GM would be close to its 3,400 reduction goal after the 1,600 layoffs were completed .
On Friday , Chief Executive Officer Fritz Henderson said GM needed " to go deeper and go faster in our operational restructuring . "
GM is facing a May 31 deadline to trim costs or risk losing a federal line of credit that has been keeping it afloat .
The U.S. Interior Department has recently released a report entitled " Survey of Available Data on OCS Resources and Identification of Data Gaps " .
The report , commissioned by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and completed by the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) branch of the department , outlines the energy resources available in the outer continental shelf ( OCS ) of the United States .
Although the MMS is more well known for its role in auctioning off and granting permits for offshore oil and gas leases , the report is striking in that wind and wave energy potential receives top billing .
The report ( 14 MB pdf ) along with videos , podcasts , and presentation slides can be downloaded from the department 's web site .
One takeaway is that the MMS has been directed to place a larger emphasis on renewable energy .
The report table of contents has the following three main sections :
I. RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES
II .
OIL AND GAS RESOURCE EVALUATION
III .
SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL AREAS AND RESOURCES
The report is primarily a compilation of data generated previously by MMS and other agencies such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showing the energy potential ( both known and estimated ) offshore .
A smaller fraction discusses the " information gaps " , and there is obviously much work to be done before we really know how much renewable and untapped fossil energy can realistically be obtained .
While the prominence of renewable energy in the overall OCS report is evident , this is not a new activity by MMS .
Here is a press release from last summer on developing the regulatory framework .
Salazar chose the 25x25 Summit , a renewable energy conference , to announce the report 's release , and is currently taking his show on the road for four public hearings .
The first was yesterday in Atlantic City , NJ , and the next is April 8 , 2009 in New Orleans .
Salazar 's emphasis on renewables has been highlighted in many press reports :
Salazar said ocean winds along the East Coast can generate 1 million megawatts of power , roughly the equivalent of 3,000 medium - sized coal - fired power plants , or nearly five times the number of coal plants now operating in the United States , according to the Energy Department .
This elicited an expected response from the Coal Lobby :
Jason Hayes , a spokesman for the American Coal Council , said he was puzzled by Salazar 's projections .
He said wind - power plants face roadblocks including local opposition , concerns about their impact on wildlife , and problems in efficiently transmitting power from far offshore .
" It really is a stretch , " he said of Salazar 's estimate .
" How you put that many new ( wind ) plants up , especially in deep water , is confusing .
Even if you could do what he said , you still need to deal with the fact that the best wind plants generate power about 30 percent of the time .
There 's got to be something to back that up . "
Local environmental groups had their own message to deliver , that being that their coastlines should not be reopened for oil and gas drilling .
As a Senator from Colorado , Salazar had voted to end limits on offshore drilling in Florida .
Thus , many groups are trying to get a sense of what Salazar 's ( or Obama 's ) priorities will be .
The Wind Energy Association is most interested in how the permitting process will work and what the resulting regulatory framework will look like .
There has been one instance of competing claims for siting wind farms in New Jersey while waiting for the MMS to formulate its rules .
There has also been a feud between the Interior Department and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on who gets to regulate tidal energy ,
The dispute , which dates to late 2007 , pits the Interior Department against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over which entity should approve projects that use coastal waves and currents to produce power .
Offshore wind development has been entangled in the dispute because Interior 's Minerals Management Service does not want to separate wind projects from the tidal wave , or hydrokinetic power , programs — which FERC in turn has refused to surrender , according to several officials who have followed the dispute .
but this seems to have been resolved .
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gives Interior authority to regulate the transmission of electricity from offshore .
A resource for following the developing regulatory framework is the Offshore Energy Law Blog .

Now that the federal government plans to spend $ 19 billion to spur the use of computerized patient records , the challenge of adopting the technology widely and wisely is becoming increasingly apparent .
Two articles , to be published on Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine , point to the formidable obstacles to achieving the policy goal of not only installing electronic health records , but also using them to improve care and curb costs .
One article reports that only 9 percent of the nation ’s hospitals have electronic health records , based on a survey of nearly 3,000 hospitals .
The study , financed by the federal government and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , is the most definitive measure to date of the use of computerized patient records by hospitals .
The government - backed study found a far lower level of use than some earlier , less rigorous surveys .
The study , the authors said , measured only the adoption of digital patient records .
The survey did not ask whether the electronic records were used to advance the health policy goals of the federal plan , like tracking the quality of care and communicating effectively with outside specialists and clinics to coordinate a patient ’s care .
Remember Terrafugia ’s Transition Flying
Car we saw back in December ?
Well , today the company let us all in on details about a successful first test flight that took place earlier this month .
The achievement brings our dreams of a production flying car that much closer to reality , even if the $ 194,000 price tag prevents most of us from ever owning one .
The official first flight took place at Plattsburgh International Airport on March 5th 2009 and was accompanied by a more traditional chase aircraft ( image below ) .
The two - seater is able to fly 450 miles at a speed of 115MPH and runs on regular unleaded , that can be topped up at any gas station .
When on the road , the craft uses a front - wheel - drive system which can achieve and maintain highway speeds .
When in the air , the craft relies on a propeller mounted on the rear for propulsion .
The whole transformation process from car to plane , or vise versa , takes a single pilot less than 30 seconds , making it a extremely flexible machine indeed .
For those who can afford to own one of these amazing roadable aircraft , you can still place a deposit of $ 10,000 at Terrafugia ’s site .
I wonder how the Moller SkyCar is getting on ?

While watching Bob Gainey help lead the Montreal Canadiens over the Boston Bruins in the semifinal of the 1979 Stanley Cup Playoffs , famed Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov called Gainey the best hockey player in the world , the possessor of the most complete package of skills that Tikhonov had ever seen , which is saying quite a lot .
Gainey balanced offensive and defensive efforts and was a mid-range scorer .
As such , he was an unlikely candidate for any NHL awards .
Yet , he was the best player in the world , according to a respected authority .
The NHL then created another award , for best defensive forward , named it after former Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs executive Frank Selke Jr. , and then gave it to Gainey .
Gainey won the award the first four years it was awarded .
Guy Carbonneau and Jere Lehtinen , who both played in Dallas when Gainey was general manager there , have won it three times .
Mike Peca , Rod Brind ' Amour and Sergei Fedorov have won it twice .
Detroit Red Wings center Pavel Datsyuk is the reigning Selke Award winner .
Once again , Datsyuk is a finalist for the Selke Award , along with Philadelphia Flyers center Mike Richards and Vancouver Canucks center / right winger Ryan Kesler of the Vancouver Canucks .
All three have excellent credentials and define the concept " hard to play against .
" Kesler and Richards leave opponents bruised and battered , while Datsyuk leaves them feeling they 've had their pocket picked .
All three are team leaders .
Richards is captain of the Flyers , while Datsyuk and Kesler are alternate captains .
The 2009 NHL Awards will be broadcast live from the Pearl Concert Theater inside the Palms Hotel Las Vegas on June 18 on VERSUS in the United States and CBC in Canada .
Tickets to the 2009 NHL Awards are on sale at ticketmaster.com / nhlawards and at the Pearl Concert Theater Box Office .
Here is a closer look at the finalists .--
It 's one thing for a Brian Leetch Sidney Crosby or Wayne Gretzky to carry the puck the length of the rink while using head and foot fakes to shed checkers , after all , they know where they 're going .
It 's a whole ' nother thing for Datsyuk to strip those guys of the puck because he knows where they 're going .
Obviously , Datsyuk can't read minds , but his extensive preparations , based on observations and past performances , gives him the book on opponent 's tendencies .
Just as those skilled puck carriers bring the puck up ice with that " you - do n't - know - where - I 'm going or if - I'm - passing " approach , Datsyuk gives those puck carriers no indication if he 's going to poke - check , body check , or angle off his rival .
He 's extremely quick in getting in on the forecheck , excellent at filling passing lanes , and is a master at forcing the deep puck carrier to outlet pass to where Datsyuk wishes .
You have the puck and he 's controlling the game !
And , if Datsyuk is n't messing up your attack , the next line is centered by Kris Draper , a former Selke winner .
See why the Red Wings are so good ?
The Selke Award is a subjective judgment , largely based on observation and not entirely fairly judged by statistics .
But Datsyuk was second in the NHL this season with 89 takeaways to leading scorer Evgeni Malkin .
Datsyuk outscored Richards and Kesler , posting 32 goals and 65 assists for 97 points , fourth in the NHL .
Datsyuk was third in the NHL with a plus - 34 rating , an important measure of defensive responsibility .
He was ninth in winning in 56 percent of his faceoffs , important in keeping the puck out of the rival 's hands .
Datsyuk does his defensive mastery without a strong physical presence .
He had only 33 blocked shots , 116th in the NHL , and 76 hits , which ranked 174th .-- Kesler is a very physical and emotional player who often brings out the anger in opponents .
You know you 've been in a hockey game after tussling all night with Kesler .
While Richards and Datsyuk play on top scoring lines for their teams , Kesler is versatile enough to center a checking line or play the rugged forward on the right side of the second line with Pavol Demitra and either Jannik Hansen or Mats Sundin Kesler compares unfavorably on a statistical basis with Richards and Datsyuk , trailing either or both in nearly every category used in this article but , again , the Selke is a subjective award and requires observation and judgment .
He had 26 goals and 33 assists for 59 points , 63rd in the NHL this season .
Kesler was plus - 8 and had two shorthanded goals .
He won a valuable 54 percent of his faceoffs and ranked seventh among NHL forwards with 70 blocked shots .
He tied for seventh with 74 takeaways .--
Richards quickly became the leader on the Flyers ' roster .
He was named an alternate captain last season and was promoted to captain before the 2008 - 09 season .
He led the Flyers in assists , takeaways and faceoff percentage .
Richards came to the Flyers from the OHL Kitchener Rangers off an emotional loss in the Memorial Cup .
The 24th pick in the 2003 Entry Draft was widely regarded among teams as the kind of player who could drive a team to a Stanley Cup , based on his intensity , and his balanced offensive and defensive contributions .
He led his team to the Eastern Conference Final last season and the playoffs again this year .
He is one of the three best players on his team and combines with Jeff Carter as the team 's two best forwards .
Solidly built with a bulldog nature , he was an engaging young man with a quick sense of humor , but his intense approach to hockey became more evident in his second season .
He challenged media assumptions he deemed incorrect and became a vocal defender of teammates and the organization .
It was evident he was on his way to being a leader .
Richards is one of the hardest members of the NHL to play against .
He uses his 5 - foot - 11 , 195 - bound body to punish opponents throughout the game , fighting for every puck in every inch and corner of the rink .
He is extremely effective in battles along the boards for the puck and is tremendous at stripping puck carriers that result in breakaways .
Richards led the NHL with seven short - handed goals .
He had a career year with 30 goals and 50 assists and was plus - 22 .
Richards tied Chris Drury for the NHL lead among forwards with 90 blocked shots and finished 33rd with 147 hits .
He was third among NHL forwards with 83 takeaways .
Dr. Pagliaro recommended an experimental chemotherapy regimen , and Jake has shown no sign of cancer since the treatments ended in March 2008 .
“ Needless to say , we ’re very pleased with how he ’s doing , ” Dr. Pagliaro said .
But during Jake ’s check - up in December , Ms. Walker told the hospital that her son would be uninsured at the end of January .
She said a hospital official then told her that if she was not able to pay up front , she should take her son elsewhere .
Dr. Pagliaro pledged that he would do what he could to make sure that Jake would be seen .
“ To deny him the relatively inexpensive follow - up that is so crucial , ” he said in an interview , “ just makes absolutely no sense . ”
But the doctor has yet to intercede with the business office about waiving fees , saying it would be premature .
Last month , when the Walkers showed up for an appointment with Jake ’s oncologist , only a last - minute dispensation enabled him to be seen without payment in advance .
The Walkers left with the impression they would be billed $ 700 ; the hospital says it will be $ 1,507 .
In either event , they have no way to pay it .
The hospital has suggested that Jake have his next tests elsewhere and send the results to Dr. Pagliaro to review , with payment to be negotiated in advance .
The Walkers are now completing the voluminous paperwork to apply for M. D. Anderson ’s charity care program for Texas residents .
The hospital , which had $ 2.2 billion in net patient revenue last year , spent $ 209 million on such uncompensated care .
But Dr. Ron Walters , the hospital ’s vice president for medical operations , said economic pressures had made it more difficult to assist patients who were not under active treatment .
Dr. Walters said it had been “ good financial counseling ” to advise the Walkers to explore other options , and questioned whether they would qualify for charity care because they had assets .
Among the criteria , he said , is whether a patient can receive comparable treatment elsewhere .
Samhälle och politik
Samhället är under konstant utveckling , och det är lärorikt och intressant för alla att följa den utvecklingen i större eller mindre utsträckning .
Det finns ju oerhört många aspekter av ett samhälle , och samhällen i samverkan : handel , språk , kulturer , lagar , organisationer , förbund , infrastruktur , utbildning , näringsliv , skattebetalning , demokrati eller frånvaron av densamma …
Den som har ett intresse för politik och samhälle gör gott i att läsa lite om internationella relationer eftersom att det är ett sådant uppenbart nästa steg ; 1 samhälle i all ära , men vad händer när flera samhällen ska ha relationer med varandra ?
Det är väldigt viktigt att man håller sig till människorättsliga konventioner som satts upp av framför allt FN , så att det finns en enhetlig uppfattning och uppförandekod kring vad som är rimligt och rättvist .
Sedan kommer det kanske alltid vara så att det finns stora gradskillnader , men det vore väldigt värdefullt om politiken kunde anpassas så att lägstanivån för hur människor har det förblir dräglig .
Motverka korruption med modern teknik
Många arbetsplatser runt om i landet vill att sina anställda rapporterar sina arbetstimmar vilket kan tyckas vara för att övervaka huruvida de anställda arbetar de timmer de faktiskt ska arbeta , men så är inte tanken bakom .
Genom att använda smarta verktyg för tidrapportering via app kan företag medverka till att motverka korruption och saltade fakturor .
Hur då ?
Eftersom tidsrapporteringen sker via modern teknik är det svårt att manipulera datan som den tar in och i kombination med till exempel personalliggare är det enkelt för tillsynsmyndigheten ifråga att kontrollera att allt står rätt till på en arbetsplats .
Exempelvis blir det svårare att bedriva svartarbete på inom bland annat byggindustrier och liknande .
Men visst fungerar verktyget bra för även andra branscher .
När automatisk tidsrapportering finns underlättas nämligen hela det dagliga arbetet , bland annat det administrativa arbetet förenklas något enormt då den anställde inte aktivt behöver skriva logg för sina tider och företagets lönekontor får in tiderna automatiskt via appen .
Tillsynsmyndigheter i Sverige
I vårt samhälle finns en rad olika myndigheter vars uppgift är att säkerställa att samhället fungerar såsom det är tänkt , rent juridiskt .
Till exempel har vi Datainspektionen som arbetar för att hanteringen av personuppgifter hanteras korrekt , Diskrimineringsombudsmannen som verkar för ett jämställt samhälle utan diskriminering och Inspektionen för vård och omsorg som ska säkerställa att vården utför sitt uppdrag på bästa sätt .
Likaså finns även myndigheter som sträcker sig utanför vårt lands gränser och ett exempel på sådan är EU - ombudsmannen vars uppgift är att undersöka administrativa missförhållanden inom EU och dess institutioner och organ .
Andra tillsynsmyndigheter är Justitieombudsmannen , Justitiekanslern , Riksrevisionen , Fastighetsmäklarinspektionen , Konsumentverket och Skolinspektionen samt Säkerhets - och integritetsskyddsnämnden .
Davis and Dean mentally and physically abused vulnerable people
A homeless couple have been given anti-social behaviour orders to not enter Exeter after gaining access to council homes and forcing tenants out .
Jonathan Dean , 25 , and Rhonda Davis , 33 , " cuckooed " themselves into homes through mental and physical abuse of vulnerable tenants , police said .
In one case , a tenant was forced to sleep rough under bridges .
Central Devon Magistrates '
Court issued the two - year orders ( Asbos ) to keep them out of the city .
' Fantastic result '
Exeter City Council 's housing department and police applied for the Asbos after building evidence with a social housing charity .
Magistrates found that the pair had " harassed and intimidated vulnerable people in Exeter over a period of several years " .
Steve Warran , head of housing services at Exeter City Council , said : " For too long our most vulnerable tenants have suffered from being harassed and intimidated by this pair .
" This case confirms we will take firm action against those who blight our communities with their anti-social behaviour . "
Sgt Andy Nordqvist , from Exeter 's neighbourhood policing team , said it was a " fantastic result for vulnerable members of the community in Exeter " .
He said : " Both Dean and Davis were preying on vulnerable people subjecting them to intimidation and physical and mental abuse until they cuckooed them from their own homes .
" The Asbo is both proportionate and necessary to protect members of our community from future abuse . "
It was the biggest bill of the year , a giant expansion of government spending .
Top members of Congress were incensed that they were cut out of final negotiations between the House and Senate .
They complained that the legislation was the product of just one party with only a few select members of the opposition invited to play a role .
But the Medicare drug plan passed anyway in 2003 when Republicans controlled the White House and Congress .
So it was hardly novel this week when Republicans protested vigorously that their legislative rights had been violated as the Democratic - led Congress pushed through the $ 787 billion economic stimulus bill with just three Republican votes in the Senate .
Only the party labels had changed .
In truth , regular order  as following the Congressional rule book is known on Capitol Hill  has not been occurring very regularly in the House and Senate for years .
And both parties are to blame .
Intense partisanship , a reluctance to work across the aisle , procedural game - playing and thin margins in the House and Senate have led both parties to short - circuit the legislative process , skipping over committees , blocking the right to propose amendments and generally strong - arming legislation through by relying on their own majorities .
The reviews are in , and the just - released Ubuntu 9.04 , i.e. " Jaunty Jackalope , " rates as a slick , fully - formed Linux desktop .

A quick note about this compilation — it 's a little different than a list of Windows or Mac utilities .
We link to each application 's home page , but most of them ( with exceptions noted ) can be installed from Ubuntu 's repositories , the default collection of software any user can access by heading to their System menu , then Administration , then choosing Synaptic Package Manager .
Search out the app's name there to install it ( or , for terminal fans , type something like sudo apt - get install conky ) .
Many of the applications also have Windows or Mac versions that work well for dual - booting users .

If you 're fine with all the default settings on your shiny - fresh Ubuntu system , you have no need for Ubuntu Tweak .
For newcomers , or anyone who feels confined by having their Computer icon stuck with the name " Computer , " Ubuntu Tweak is an OCD multi-tool .
Besides allowing you to change all the little bits and ends of Ubuntu in a manner far easier than editing a text file or using the gconf - editor tool , Ubuntu Tweak also turns installing ( and keeping up - to - date ) third - party upgrades like the Avant Window Navigator dock or the latest Firefox beta into a simple check - the - box job .

Look , we get it — not everyone 's a fan of widgets / gadgets / whathaveyou , and we totally understand ; turning off Vista 's sidebar was one of the first things we did on a new install .
But the Screenlets application gives you access to any of the hundreds upon hundreds of Google Gadgets and other open widgets , some of them hardnessing actual productivity tools like Google Calendar or Remember the Milk .
With Ubuntu 's now built - in Compiz powers , you can even set the Screenlets to be hidden away until you press a key ( like , say , the Mac 's F9 default ) .
To do that , you 'll need to install the compizconfig - settings - manager package , where you 'll find all kinds of other goodies .

Trying out new Linux distributions is fun , even if you 're a long - term relationship with an Ubuntu desktop .
Because , hey , maybe CrunchBang would make a good quick - boot alternative , right ?
And is n't the Fedora 11 beta looking mighty nice ?
UNetbootin makes it dead simple to turn pretty much any Linux distribution into one that boots from a USB stick .
It can automatically download and install the majority of popular distributions ( Ubuntu , Fedora , openSUSE , etc. ) , or adapt any bootable ISO file you 've got .
You can even get crazy and custom - roll your own system from a chosen kernel , but UNetbootin does n't require much more than one download and one click .

Songbird 's available on all three platforms , but if you 're one of the vast many iPod or iPhone owners out there on a Windows or Mac machine , there 's a good chance you 're okay with having iTunes run your music and manage your device ( not that there are n't alternative iPod wranglers ) .
Linux has its fair share of innovative music managers , but Songbird is the most adaptable , attractive , and streamlined music app around .
It too can manage your iPod ( except for the standard iPhone / iPod touch conundrum ) , grab album art from the web , play the streaming tracks from any web site with its built - in browser , and offers a whole host of neat add - ons that mash up web data , customize how Songbird looks and feels , and basically change up anything the way that extensions can for Firefox .
It 's not perfect , but it 's very usable on almost any Linux desktop .

VMWare is better if you 're serious about running multiple , uber - efficient virtual machines in a development environment .
For the average home user who just needs access to a Windows application now and then , it 's hard to beat a trimmed - down XP running in VirtualBox .
It 's easy enough for a beginner to get into , but customizable enough to run as a seamless taskbar on your Linux desktop .
In other words , it 's a free semi-equivalent of what Mac users have been using ( Boot Camp or Parallels ) to run the necessary Windows app now and again .
( Ubuntu 's repositories carry the " Open Source Edition " of VirtualBox , which is much the same , but lacks certain features , including USB support ; head to the program site to download standard packages for 9.04 ) .

A blog for people who want to live their big vision !
NAIROBI , April 16 ( Reuters ) - Foreign navies have agreed to protect a vessel installing an undersea high - speed Internet cable from pirates off the coast of Somalia , a Kenyan minister said on Thursday .
Sea gangs from lawless Somalia have been increasingly striking the Indian Ocean shipping lanes and strategic Gulf of Aden , capturing dozens of vessels and hundreds of hostages in attacks that have driven up insurance rates .
Patrols by Western navies have done little to deter the attacks .
Kenyan Information and Communications Minister Samuel Poghisio said the 5,000 km ( 3,107 miles ) fibre optic cable was on course for completion in June .
Last month , a government official said the route for the East African Marine Cable ( TEAMS ) had been shifted an extra 200 km from the coastline for fear of pirates .
" These are concerns we have but they are being addressed .
We know it will be secure and will land in Mombasa on time , " Poghisio said in a statement on Thursday .
" The process ( of laying the cable ) has begun and will probably take two months .
It is likely that by the middle of June the ship should be anchoring in Mombasa , or rather delivering the cable to Mombasa , " he added .
The $ 130 million cable will link Kenya 's coastal town of Mombasa with Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates .
Kenya has been putting down a terrestrial cable connecting different parts of the country to prepare for the arrival of the marine cable , which could be east Africa 's first speedy but cheap telecoms link with the rest of the world .
Another undersea project known as SEACOM is also expected to be operational in the second half of 2009 and two others are due to land in 2010 -- the Eastern African Submarine Cable System ( EASSy ) and the France Telecom / Orange Sat3 - wasc - Safe cable .
East Africa has relied on expensive satellite connections for telephones and Internet .
Telecoms operators and outsourcing firms are eagerly awaiting the cable 's arrival , which is expected to slash costs and speed up connectivity .

Now they have their Joan of Arc .
Those who have long claimed that the sinister , shadowy forces of " the Israel Lobby " pull the strings of US foreign policy at last have a martyr .
Last week Charles Freeman , a former diplomat , said he would not take the job he had been offered , chairing the US National Intelligence Council : he had , he said , been the victim of a campaign of " character assassination " conducted by an " Israel Lobby [ willing to ] plumb the depths of dishonour and indecency " .
In a furious statement , he declared that the " aim of this Lobby is control of the policy process " .
Those who in 2006 lapped up the thesis argued by the US academics John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , attributing to the mighty lobby the power to divert the US from its own interests , seized on Freeman 's fall as decisive proof .
Walt himself declared : " For all of you out there who may have questioned whether there was a powerful ' Israel lobby ' , " he blogged , " think again . "
As the reception to the original Mearsheimer - Walt article showed , this is radioactive terrain .
Those who wade in carelessly can find themselves burnt .
The explanation is not complicated .
The notion that Jews wield excessive power , and do so in mysterious ways ; that they advance the interests of a foreign power ; that they function as some kind of fifth column , and that as such they have often led their country into needless wars - all these are accusations that have been hurled at Jews going back many centuries .
It should be no surprise that Jews ' ears prick up if they think they can hear these old tunes hammered out once more .
And yet , after several conversations with Israel supporters in both Washington and Tel Aviv , I have found no one who denies that Freeman was indeed the victim of advocates for Israel .
It is quite true that many on Capitol Hill disliked Freeman 's devotion to Saudi Arabia , the country where he had once served as US ambassador : he recently suggested King Abdullah be renamed " Abdullah the Great " .
True , too , that a critical blow came from Nancy Pelosi , the house speaker , reportedly outraged by Freeman 's overly indulgent attitude towards China 's rulers .
But I 'm reliably told that these lines of attack originated with the pro-Israel crowd .
Nor have Freeman 's character assassins bothered to hide their fingerprints .
On the contrary , several have bragged about their role , among them Steve Rosen , a former official of the American - Israel Public Affairs Committee , or Aipac , who launched the attack on Freeman .
Surely , then , as Walt claimed , this settles not only the Freeman whodunit but the larger question of the mighty " Lobby " .
Clearly it is every bit as vicious - and effective - as its detractors have claimed , able to derail even a new and popular administration such as Barack Obama 's simply because it had the temerity to pick a man who had , among other things , condemned the Israeli occupation as " brutal oppression " - right ?
Not quite .
The flaws in the Mearsheimer - Walt case remain as visible as when they were exposed by the Palestinian - American scholar Joseph Massad , Noam Chomsky and a clutch of other anti-Zionists .
For one thing , if Israel and its backers really did control United States foreign policy , there would never be any divergence between them : Washington would simply do " the Lobby 's " bidding .
But that is hardly the case .
One can go back to the mid-1980s , when Israel and its friends begged the Reagan administration not to sell Awacs surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia - to no avail : the Saudis got their planes .
Or spool forward to 1991 when George Bush pressured Israel to attend a peace conference against its will and withheld $ 10bn in much - needed loan guarantees unless Israel agreed to freeze settlements on occupied land .
You might mention Israel 's proposed arms sales to China : Washington compelled Israel to back down , first in 2000 and again in 2005 .
More awkwardly , Israel has long sought the release of those who spied for it against the US .
Washington has consistently refused .
Chomsky asks a useful question .
If the US has been led to behave the way it does in the Middle East by the cunning " Israel Lobby " , how come it behaves the same way elsewhere ?
" What were ' the Lobbies ' that led to pursuing very similar policies throughout the world ? "
As for the Middle East , Chomsky quotes the scholar Stephen Zunes : " There are far more powerful interests that have a stake in what happens in the Persian Gulf region than does Aipac [ or the Lobby generally ] , such as the oil companies , the arms industry and other special interests whose lobbying influence and campaign contributions far surpass that of the much - vaunted Zionist lobby ... "
The naive assumption at work here is that the American dog has no interests of its own , leaving it free to be wagged by the pro-Israel tail .
It 's a convenient view , casting the great superpower as a hapless , and essentially innocent , victim .
But guess what : the US emphatically does have its own strategic interests - oil chief among them - and it guards them fiercely .
Support for Israel as a loyal , dependable ally - ready to take on Arab and other forces that might pose a threat to those interests - has served America 's purposes well .
That 's why the US acts the way it does , not because Aipac tells it to .
Perhaps the most powerful example - if only because so many believe the reverse to be true - is the Iraq war .
Plenty of Mearsheimer - Walt followers reckon it was the " Lobby " wot done it : it was Israel that pushed for war .
But as Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Colin Powell , and others have explained , Israel 's leaders in fact repeatedly warned against an attack on Saddam , fearing it would distract from , and embolden , what it regarded as the real threat , namely Iran .
As it happened , they were right .
So the myth of an all - powerful Israel lobby , pulling the strings , is a delusion .
But it 's equally false to pretend that Aipac and its allies do n't exist or exert genuine influence .
They do and they play hardball , as the Freeman affair has vividly demonstrated .
( Indeed , the negative publicity that has resulted may make this victory a pyrrhic one . )
Viewed this way , clearly and through a lens unclouded by exaggeration and mythology , they are to be strenuously opposed .
Their attempt to limit the voices heard in Washington is not just an offence against pluralism , it also hurts the very cause Aipac purports to serve : Israel .
Aipac 's approach - not so much pro Israel as pro the Israeli right wing - ends up pushing US politicians away from the policies Israel itself needs , specifically the dialogue with enemies and territorial concessions that are necessary if Israel 's long - term future is to be secured .
The good news is that alternatives are emerging .
Founded last year , J Street styles itself as a " pro-Israel , pro-peace " advocacy organisation , thereby creating a space for those US politicians who support Israel but believe the policy of recent Israeli governments is hurting Palestinians and imperilling the future of the Jewish state .
Aipac and its allies have had the monopoly on Israel advocacy for too long .
Let 's hope the Freeman episode prompts America 's leaders to take a hard look at them , to see them as they really are : not all - powerful - and not always right either .

Rocky Earthlike planet discovered DR EMILY BALDWIN ASTRONOMY NOW
Posted : 21 April , 2009 Researchers today confirmed the existence of a rocky Earthlike planet with a mass of 1.9 Earth masses , orbiting in the Gliese 581 system .
Artist 's impression of the newly discovered planetary system Gliese 581 .
Image : ESO .
Another planet in the four planet system was also found to be lying in the star 's habitable zone , the region where liquid water oceans could exist .
The findings are the result of over four years of observations using the world 's leading low - mass exoplanet hunter , the HARPS spectrograph attached to the 3.6 metre telescope at La Silla in Chile .
The system was already known to harbour a Neptune - sized planet and two super - Earths of 16 , seven and five Earth - masses respectively .
As Michel Mayor said in this morning 's press conference : " this is a step in the right direction of finding an Earth twin . "
The new planet is orbiting far too close to its host star for it to be habitable , however , the seven Earth mass planet lies towards the far edge of the star 's habitable zone , orbiting with a period of nearly 67 days .
" Gliese 581 d is probably too massive to be a rocky planet , it 's probably an icy planet that has migrated closer to the star , " says Mayor .
" It could even be covered with a large and deep ocean . "
Gliese 581 is roughly one - third the mass of the Sun , and with a much lower luminosity .
Therefore a planet would need to be situated much closer to this star than our own Sun in order to receive a comparable amount of energy as the Earth .
The holy grail of planet hunting will be to find a true Earth twin .
" I 'm absolutely quite confident that in the next one or two years we 'll arrive at the level of Earth mass planets , " says Mayor , who was the first person to discover an extrasolar planet fifteen years ago .
And with the Kepler spacecraft currently being prepped for its three year search for Earth mass planets in the Cygnus - Lyra region of the sky , the race is well and truly on .
I drew this and a couple more after words with a nib pen , possibly a G or something .
I did n't get the hang of it and never will and that 's okay .

So , Monica Roberts , author of the blog TransGriot totally hates Queerty readers .
According to her , you ’re ” emblematic of the selfishness , privilege , racism and transphobia inherent in some elements of the GL community ” , because we ’re pretty stingy with our comment - moderation and some of you say some thoughtless stuff about transgender folks sometimes .
We ’ve invited Monica multiple times to come talk with us , but she ’d rather yell at you from the safety of her own blog , which is too bad for everyone .
But today ’s attack , in which she shows off a new , wonderfully heart - warming ad featuring a positive transgender message from an Argentinian bank , prompted her to say , “ maybe some of Queerty ’s readers need to see this . ”
And hey , it ’s a great ad , so check it out .

Advertisement First he complimented Barack Obama's " tan " , then he played hide and seek with the German leader .
He has even annoyed the Queen by being too loud .
Now Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has held up the start of a key Nato summit - by talking for too long on his mobile phone .
In his defence , Mr Berlusconi was talking to Turkey 's prime minister in a bid to resolve a row at the summit .
But Germany 's leader was kept waiting on the red carpet for several minutes .
Angela Merkel had just led Nato leaders from Germany across a bridge straddling the River Rhine to meet President Nicolas Sarkozy coming from Strasbourg on the French side .
Mr Berlusconi joined the group shortly afterwards .
Mrs Merkel looked bemused as the Italian 's call dragged on and finally opted to start the event 's opening ceremony without the Italian .
It emerged later that Mr Berlusconi had been speaking to his Turkish counterpart in Istanbul , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , in an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its opposition to Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen as Nato 's new chief .
In the event , Turkey did concede , with Mr Erdogan saying it had been swayed by US President Barack Obama 's assurances .
Playboy tactics
The Italian leader has developed a reputation for gaffes , outspoken comments and playful behaviour , even on the world stage .
The best political leader in Europe and the world
Silvio Berlusconi , on himself
Berlusconi in his own words Berlusconi in pictures
The latest incident comes just days after the Queen appeared to express mild irritation when Mr Berlusconi noisily greeted US President Barack Obama at a photo - call in London .
Last year he was filmed apparently playing " hide and seek " with Mrs Merkel in Trieste , hiding behind a large column as she walked past .
Earlier , he came under fire for describing Barack Obama as " young , handsome and tanned " .
Mr Berlusconi has palmed off the criticism those comments prompted , saying it emanated from humourless " imbeciles " .
Mr Berlusconi's previous practical jokes at formal gatherings include making the Italian horned cuckold gesture behind a Spanish minister during a group photo of EU leaders in 2002 .
The billionaire media mogul then sparked a minor diplomatic incident in 2005 by suggesting he had used " playboy tactics " to woo Finnish President Tarja Halonen in order to ensure her backing for Italy to host the European Food Safety Authority .

( Adds AT&T , consumer comments , broadcast ownership detail )
WASHINGTON , April 8 ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators fired the opening salvo on Wednesday in a debate over how to vault the United States from a trailing position among industrialized nations in offering high - speed Internet to all its citizens .
The Federal Communications Commission , taking orders from Congress , has until February 2010 to draw up a strategy to bring high - speed Internet to nearly half of the U.S. population -- many in low - income and rural areas -- that does not get it .
“ We are coming to grips with the fact that we have a long way to go to get high - speed value - laden broadband out to all citizens , ” acting FCC chief Michael Copps told a public meeting .
A report for the United Nations out this week said the U.S. has fallen to 17th from 11th in a survey of the use by advanced nations of information and communications technology , which took into account adoption , speed and literacy .
The plan will address controversial issues as Internet openness , affordability and connection speed .
The Obama Administration ’s nearly $ 800 billion stimulus legislation ordered the plan and allocated $ 7.2 billion in funds the government will dole out to promote expansion .
Copps and Obama have both heralded the technology as a means to fuel economic growth in areas , including healthcare and education .
Robert McDowell , the sole Republican on the FCC , said the plan should not include any “ counterproductive government mandates . ”
It “ must allow network operators a reasonable opportunity to pay back investors , ” he said .
Those views echo those of many in the telecommunications industry , which in general oppose mandates for openness that prevent Internet providers from discriminating as they route Internet traffic .
McDowell is among those who refute the UN and other groups ’ international data portraying the U.S. broadband picture as dismal .
AT&T Inc T.N said it hopes the agency uses the opportunity to revamp the FCC 's universal service program , which pays to fund universal telephone service .
Current policies were “ conceived for the voice - centric wonders of the black rotary phone and ( are ) not conducive to the dynamic world of broadband , ” AT&T vice president Bob Quinn said in an email .
LOWER PRICES , FASTER SPEEDS ?
Consumer groups want the FCC to use the plan to compile data they say will show the last decade of deregulatory policies under mostly Republican leadership failed to spur competition .
“ Under the last administration ’s wait - and - see approach , competition disappeared , speeds stagnated , prices went through the roof and the open Internet was placed in jeopardy , ” said Derek Turner , research director of Free Press .
Free Press and others faulted the FCC in recent years for exempting telephone and cable companies from regulations , including abandoning line - sharing , which requires big companies to share access lines with competitors .
Speeds for broadband in the United States are among the slowest compared with industrialized nations such as Japan , France and Sweden , while prices are among the steepest , according to the Paris - based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Public interest groups also want the FCC to boost speeds that can be labeled broadband speed .
The FCC now defines broadband speed at about 768 kilobits per second , slow by most standards , most experts agree .
Conventional dial - up is about 56 kilobits per second , but cable companies offer high - speed Internet at typically a minimum of 1 megabit per second and , in most cases , more than that .
Obama 's choice to lead the FCC is Julius Genachowski , a former executive at IAC / Interactive IACI.O and technology investor .
His nomination is making its way through Senate confirmation , which is expected .
In a separate proceeding , the FCC voted to increase data collection requirements to better determine the extent of women and minority ownership in broadcasting .

The Obama administration took on the powerful farming interests in America 's heartland today , making clear it does not see corn - based ethanol as part of the long - term solution to climate change .
The new proposals on the biofuel – in the face of intense pressure from agricultural companies and members of Congress from corn-growing states – were seen as the first test of Barack Obama 's promise to put science above politics in deciding America 's energy future .
Ethanol had once appeared to provide a transport fuel which did not increase carbon dioxide .
But studies have suggested that the fuel needed to process the corn meant the ethanol could be more polluting than the fossil fuel it was meant to replace .
Furthermore , the use of food crops for biofuel was blamed for a substantial part of the large price rises seen in 2008 .
Administration officials set out a $ 1.8 bn ( £ 1.19 bn ) plan to develop a new generation of more environmentally - friendly biofuels that are not made from food crops and have a lower carbon footprint , while also providing an immediate bail - out of existing corn ethanol producers , which are suffering in the global economic crisis : falling petrol prices have undercut demand for ethanol at the pump .
Lisa Jackson , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , made clear she does not see corn - based ethanol as a permanent part of America 's clean energy mix .
" Corn - based ethanol is a bridge ... to the next generation of fuels , " she said .
The EPA proposed a new standard for advanced biofuels , ensuring they are at least 50 % cleaner than petrol .
Jackson said existing bio-ethanol resulted in a 16 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions .
The agency said it would also take into account the environmental impact of turning land over to biofuel crops , a key demand of the industry 's critics .
Environmentalists saw the move as an early indication that the Obama administration would stand its ground against powerful industrial interests .
" For an administration that has already staked so much on restoring science to the process of governing , this was a really critical test , " said Nathanael Greene , a renewable energy expert at the National Resources Defence Council .
" This was the first big industry where we are starting to see some of the potential changes required by climate policy and the administration is ready to stick to the science and not get rolled by industry . "
The country 's fuel producers gave a cautious welcome to the announcement , but added that they would continue to challenge the EPA 's criteria for measuring the environmental cost of fuel crops .
The impact on the ethanol industry of the agency 's proposal , which now undergoes public review , was softened by Obama 's decision to put the agriculture secretary , Tom Vilsack , who is from the corn growing state of Iowa , in charge of a new task force that will oversee biofuel development .
The officials also said there would be considerable sums available to farmers to make the transition from using corn to make biofuels to using pulp and agricultural waste .
The programme envisages $ 1.1 bn to help ethanol producers market the fuel , and to convert their processing plants from fossil fuels to renewable energy .
" There is over $ 1.1 billion of opportunity here , " Vilsack said .
Energy secretary Steven Chu said there would be an additional $ 786 m towards the development of new biofuel refineries and the design of flex - fuel cars .
The administration 's move on ethanol comes nearly two years after Congress ordered fuel refineries to increase their use of ethanol , and by 2022 to step up the share of advanced biofuels in the country 's fuel mix .
The law ordered all ethanol produced after 2007 to meet a standard 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , and for advanced biofuels to meet a 50 % reduction target .
Existing ethanol producers will be exempt from those targets , but new plant will be required to make the grade .
That represents a big challenge for the production technology .

Noted hilarious idiot , RNC Chairman Michael Steele , just said this crazy thing Friday , so that the other crazy things he says most other days would n’t get lonely :
“ What was so outstanding about Miss California , let ’s do a little parallel …
This is what an empathetic judge looks like , ” Steele said of celeb - blogger Perez Hilton .
“ The empathetic judge in this case , the judge of the b eauty pageant , asked this woman a question and instead of taking her answer at face value , he was empathetic to a particular community and he thought her answer should be favorably disposed towards that particular community .
And as a consequence she answered a different way .
She answered honestly .
She answered based on the facts of her situation , the facts of her upbringing , the facts of this country , which by and large sides with her . ”
“ To even get off on this tangent of asking her a socially controversial question and then getting ticked off because you do n’t like her answer .
Then what the heck did you ask the question for ?
Just because she is Miss California you presume she is going to have a left - of - center answer on gay marriage ?
Come on .
This is the slippery slope this nation is putting itself on and I ’m telling you folks to stop it .
Do n’t go there . ”
First of all , you ’re supposed to ask socially controversial questions during a competition based around poise .
Asking some dumb bitch if she likes applesauce ai n’t gonna cut it .
Secondly , I hate to break it to Mr. Steele , but …ahem … you ’re empathizing with said dumb bitch .
Yes , YOU are , in fact , evincing the very quality you find so abhorrent in a judge .
Lastly , though , I need to thank Michael Steele for reminding me that we all have dreams .
I , for one , would rather be swimming naked in a sawbuck sea for the rest of my life .
But I ca n’t begrudge the man his .
Aquarists at the Blue Reef Aquarium in Newquay have discovered the identity of a mysterious killer that had been devastating their coral reef display over recent months .
Staff had been puzzled by violent attacks on their fragile living reefs – in some cases the corals had been literally cut in half .
After staking out the display for several weeks , aquarists decided as a last resort to take it apart rock by rock .
Halfway through the process the terrifying perpetrator was finally revealed - a monstrous four - foot - long giant reef worm .
Staff eventually lured it out with fish scraps – but not before it bit through 20 lb fishing line .
Curator Matt Slater said : “ As part of our tropical marine displays we have been painstakingly propagating a variety of corals .
They are extremely slow - growing and every one we have lost to these attacks was a major blow .
“ In the end it got so bad that I decided to literally take the display apart to find out who was responsible .
I could hardly believe my eyes when I finally caught sight of the culprit .
“ It really does look like something out of a horror movie !
It ’s over four feet long with these bizarre - looking jaws .
Having done some research we also discovered that it is covered with thousands of bristles which are capable of inflicting a sting resulting in permanent numbness ' . ”
Matt believes it probably arrived as a juvenile in a delivery of living rock from another aquarium .
After being carefully removed the worm – which has been nicknamed ‘ Barry ’ by staff – has been re-located into its own tank , safely away from the coral .
“ Obviously we ’re reluctant to feed it on any more of our living coral so we are currently looking at alternatives .
Some references suggest it may also feed on seaweed so we ’ll try it on that in the short term , ” added Matt .

We all have our off days , they 're particularly memorable when they coincide with the day of an interview .
One of my fondest interviewing memories is from right before I had graduated from my undergrad and was looking for something to do after graduation .
It was the only interview I 've ever done where I did n't get an offer .
I had pretty good industry experience at that point in my career .
I had experience at Princeton 's Plasma Physics Labs writing data analysis software for nucelar fusion experiments , experience working on artificial intelligence and natural language processing at Google , had worked at a defense startup , and had over 7 years at a lawfirm .
I could go on , but I 'll stop there .
I had done a little over 30 interviews , and had always gotten an offer ( usually on the spot ) .
This interview was different though .
The company had flown me out to California and I checked in to my hotel at 3:00 am the night before the interview .
I woke up at 7:00 am to hop on a train to Palo Alto for the day of interviews .
I was horribly tired and jet lagged .
The way software interviews should work is that your resume will get you the phone call , but after that your resume should n't really be referenced again .
At that point it 's up to you to prove yourself , not write about yourself .
I like it that way , I 'm usually fairly good at introducing myself and talking about my past experience ... but on this morning when my first interviewer asked me about myself I shook his hand and just said " I'm Steve Krenzel and am finishing up my degree in computer science and mathematics at Drexel University . "
I did n't mention anything about my past experiences , interests , or skillsets .
When I reflected on this at lunch , I knew that my brain was simply not awake on this particular day .
What further confirmed this was that he had asked me to write a function that permuted the elements of an array , and no matter what I did I could n't get it .
This is a function that I 've written hundreds of times and I could n't do it at the whiteboard on this morning .
I was actually embarassed .
I almost felt like I was wasting their time at this point .
I can write that function in 5 lines of code ...
I usually know it like that back of my hand , but on this particular morning I just could n't get it .
I was interviewing for a $ 100,000 a year job and could n't write a permutation function .
I could n't even get in the ballpark of something even remotely right .
Here is the code that I simply could n't remember on that day :
def permute ( xs , pre = [ ] ) : if len ( xs ) == 0 : yield pre for i , x in enumerate ( xs ) : for y in permute ( xs [ : i ] + xs [ i + 1 :] , pre + [ x ] ) : yield y
My second interviewer had checked out my previous blog before we did the interview and mentioned how impressed he was with it .
He knew my background so he immediately asked me a mapreduce question .
It was n't the simplest mapreduce problem , but one that I had dealt with before .
But again ...
I just could n't get the solution I was looking for .
I came up with a solution that involved two mapreductions , but he said it could be done in one .
I knew that it could be done in one , but my brain had simply shutdown .
Fortunately , he knew that I was smarter than the interview led him to believe and seemed favorable to me .
At lunch I drank three redbulls , hoping it'd give me the energy that I was so desperately lacking .
It had paid off and the two afternoon interviews went great .
I flew through them , answering questions faster than they could ask them , and writing code like a fiend .
I was finally having fun at the interview ( which is a sign of a good interview ) .
I knew that I had really goofed up the first one though , and kind of goofed up the second one .
I did n't expect to get the offer , and I did n't get one .
The last interviewer had walked around Palo Alto with me after the interviews though and we just shot the bull a bit .
I think he had assumed that the other interviews went as well as his ( he had n't spoken to them at this point ) , and we were talking about projects that he hoped I would help with .
It 's been about a year and half since , but I was reflecting on it the other day .
I was reflecting on how 5 lines of code cost me an amazing oppurtunity ( although I took a different job that was arguably just as good ) , but more importantly how misleading the interview was to those inteviewing me .
It got me wondering how many interviews this happens at and if there are better ways to find good talent .
I 've got some ideas , but I 'll save them for another time .
Harvard economist : Legalize all drugs to eliminate violence David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday April 13 , 2009
Print This Email This Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron believes that legalizing all drugs , not just marijuana , is the only way to eliminate drug - related violence .
Miron argued during an appearance Monday on CNN , " Prohibition ... has n't prevented kids from getting access to heroin , including very , very cheap heroin .
...
At the same time , we 're getting all the ancillary costs of drug prohibition , such as the violence in Mexico that spills over into the United States . "
" Some people will misuse drugs even if it 's legal , " Miron acknowledged , " but the magnitude of negative things would be vastly reduced . "
However , former DEA agent Bob Stutman believes that legalizing drugs would lead to a vast increase in addiction , although he agrees with Miron that " the present system certainly is broken and needs fixing . "
Stutman , who has been described as " the most famous narc in America " by New York Magazine , told CNN -- with a few false starts -- " Drugs are bad ... Drugs are not illegal ...
Drugs are not bad because they 're illegal .
Drugs are legal -- illegal , because they are bad . "
" The one change we do n't need to make is give any drug to any person at any age who wants it for any reason , " he insisted , warning that " the United States cannot afford to end up with about -- best estimate -- about fifty million drug addicts and alcoholics running around this country with us supporting them . "
Miron responded by insisting that there is " not a shred of evidence " to suggest there would be a huge increase in addiction as suggested by Stutman and that " there is aboslutely no correlation between use rates and whether these drugs are prohibited . "
" The professor may go to Harvard , but he 's dead wrong on this issue , " Stutman retorted .
" You legalize , you will at least double , some studies say 5 to 10 times as much .
You give drugs to kids , they 'll use them .
Anybody who thinks that 's not true has never met a kid -- or a drug addict . "

A company whose servers were seized in a recent FBI raid on Texas data centers applied for a temporary restraining order to force the bureau to return its servers , but was denied by a U.S. district court last week .
The company , Liquid Motors , provides inventory management and marketing services to national automobile dealers , such as AutoNation .
It was one of about 50 companies put out of business last week when the FBI seized the servers at Core IP Networks , one of two data centers and co-location facilities raided by the FBI 's Dallas office in the last month in an investigation into VoIP fraud .
Although Liquid Motors was not a target of the investigation , the FBI took all of the company 's servers and backup tapes in the raid .
" As a result , Liquid Motors , Inc. has been put out of business and is in breach of its contracts with automobile dealers throughout the country , " the company wrote in its application for the restraining order ( .pdf ) .
" Those automobile dealerships ... may hold Liquid Motors responsible for all of their lost business , and may terminate their contracts with Liquid Motors , causing permanent and irreparable harm ... for which there is no adequate remedy at law . "
The company noted that it maintained duplicate servers to prevent outages and housed those servers in a building " on a five power grid with a generator that can last for thirty days . "
Only " a bomb to the building " or , as it happens , an FBI raid , could cause the servers to go down , the company stated .
The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas denied the request ( .pdf ) , however , after holding an ex parte discussion with FBI Special Agent Allyn Lynd , who led the raid .
Lynd told the court that the owner of the co-location facility was being investigated for fraud and that even though Liquid Motors was not part of the investigation , its equipment might have been used to facilitate fraud by others .
The court found that the FBI had probable cause for seizing the equipment .
The FBI told the court it would work over the weekend to create mirror images of the data from Liquid Motors ' servers and provide it to the company by Monday of this week .
In order to do so , the FBI asked the company to provide the agency with blank hard drives for copying the data .
Mark Burack , executive vice president for Liquid Motors , said his company did get its data back after supplying the FBI with hard drives , but that the company had to buy all new servers to restore its business .
" We had to replace everything , " he said , noting that they wo n't know how much the raid cost them financially for a while .
He said the company has more than 750 customers who were affected by the raid , and that they 're working on restoring service to those customers .
When asked if his company planned to pursue legal action further he replied , " I do n't know .
There are a lot of lawyers involved .
We 're backed by some very large investors so we just defer everything to them . "
He added that he respects the job the FBI does .
" Catching bad guys is important , " he said .
" We support them and we know they have a tough job .
And sometimes innocent people get hurt . "

KHUN SAMUT JEEN , Thailand — Casualties of this sea- swallowed village abound .
Waves lap at the foundations of abandoned homes , half - sunk into a marshy pudding .
Barnacles cling to telephone poles rising from the sea .
Mudskippers squirm among the ruins at low tide .
Khun Samut Jeen is a town in retreat .
It ’s also an ominous symbol of Thailand ’s rising seas , which threaten to someday reach Bangkok just 15 miles north .
( Read why parts of Bangkok may be underwater by 2030 . )
( The Khun Samut Jeen temple once sat in its village 's center .
Now the temple - on - stilts is surrounded by rising seas .
Its outer wall is seen here at low tide .
Pailin Wedel / GlobalPost )
The community , founded centuries ago , has been thoroughly probed by researchers from the capital .
They ’ve left behind wave - breaking barriers , meant to replace the miles of destroyed coastal vegetation that once helped keep the sea at bay .
They ’ve also left behind the phrase “ lohk rorn . ”
Translation : “ hot planet ” or global warming , also accused of causing the sea to encroach on this village .
“ I do n’t know much about ‘ lohk rorn , ’ but it ’s hot as hell right now , ” said Somkuan Taengurai , 72 , mother of the village ’s elected leader .
Fanning her brow , she sat cross -legged on her home ’s elevated wood - plank floor .
Her house , like the others here , is perched on concrete stilts .
Her front walk is a creaky pier .
Somkuan and her husband , Pramern , have jacked up their living room floor so much that the windows now open at ankle - level .
“ The ocean has swallowed so much , ” she said .
“ So many people have to flee . ”
Those who stay must adapt .
Villagers reach the outside world on motorboats churning through soupy , brown - water canals .
Streetlamps light the waterways after dark .
Inside the town , a wobbly network of wooden bridges links small pockets of high ground , where clusters of wooden houses sit on pillars .
Most in Khun Samut Jeen farm shrimp or shellfish .
Elders among the 1,000 or so remaining villagers can point to the village ’s old school , visible at low tide as a distant concrete sliver in the gulf .
Further out , they say , is an old temple , now completely submerged .
As the sea floods inward , townsfolk simply retreat and rebuild .
Some families have relocated seven or eight times .
They still retain the deeds to their underwater property , which is revealed at low tide .
“ For now , there ’s no compensation if your land is taken over by water , ” said Anond Snidvongs , director of the Southeast Asia Regional Research Center .
“ The government does n’t compensate for acts of God . ”
The village ’s temple , however , is defying the sea .
Its five Buddhist monks have refused to relocate .
And the temple has become an otherworldly island , linked to the mainland by a footpath jutting out over the gulf .
( At the seaside Khun Samut Jeen temple , monks have raised the main sanctuary 's floor until the windows are at ankle - level .
Pailin Wedel / GlobalPost )
“ I never think about leaving , ” said Phra Athigarnsomnuk Adibanyo , the temple ’s head abbot .
“ We only think defensively .
‘ How can we protect ourselves ? ’
Never do we think , ‘ How can we flee ? ’ ”
At night , monks sleep on platforms as seawater sloshes underneath .
Inside the main sanctuary , stained gray with water damage , the floor has been elevated several times .
Like many in Khun Samut Jeen , monks must stoop down to open windows .
Strolling barefoot along a walkway ringing the temple , the abbot points to several man-made barriers rising from the sea .
One was built by Bangkok ’s Chulalongkorn University , he said .
A newer one was built by contractors , hired by the monks after a donation drive .
But replenishing mangrove forests , he said , is their best defense .
Deforested long ago by locals , the shrubby mangroves hold the soil taut .
Phra Athigarnsomnuk and his monks now collect fallen mangrove fruits , tend to them in small pots and later replant them at low tide in the marsh surrounding the temple .
“ The researchers told me about global warming , about the ice caps melting , how that makes the seas rise around our temple , ” the abbot said .
“ All I know is to keep planting mangroves . ”
As dusk settles over Khun Samut Jeen , tides shift and water creeps in .
The setting sun casts amber glimmers over the marsh .
Even the mudskippers , big as rats , begin to retreat before the sea level peaks around midnight .
“ We feel a bit of a loss , but we ’re not sad , ” said Somkuan , who has already bought more property further inland .
“ We ’ll just keep retreating .
We have no choice . ”

Seven reasons why Thailand is a mess
A note from Charlie :
This post was published before I developed the S.T.A.R method , which is a much more effective way to handle the volume of email we get nowadays .
2007 was a much simpler era of email management .
Email has become the primary method of communication for most people in nearly all organizations .
Unfortunately , too many of us have yet to really understand how to work with email , and the management of email correspondence has become a major source of work in and of itself .
As with most of the meaningful components of our work , there is tension from both ends : if we do n’t spend enough time filtering email , we miss deadlines and important information that is now being distributed solely through email .
However , if we spend too much time messing with email , we end up with too little time to actually get any of the work we need to get done completed .
As Aristotle keenly observed , the balance is in the middle .
Enter the R.A.F.T. method .
R.A.F.T. is a handy acronym for Read , Act , File , or Trash .
Here ’s how it works :
Read
This one ’s self - explanatory .
Briefly skim through the email and determine whether it ’s something that actually requires your attention .
You ’d be surprised how much does n’t .
If it does n’t require your attention , Trash it immediately .
If it does , move on .
Act
Does the email require you to do something ?
If it ’s a quick reply , do it , and file the message .
If it is something that requires you to do something for the future , but not now , place it on your calendar , or whatever system you use to track suspenses , and file it .
File
If the message does not require action but needs to be referenced or filed , then File it .
I still file messages in one of many different folders , but that ’s partially because I manage not only academic stuff but other careers as well .
Many productivity gurus are advocating dumping all messages in one big archive and relying on the mature search capabilities now available in most mail apps , but I have yet to make that transition .
Do some experimentation to see which is right for you , but , above all , get the stuff out of your inbox .
Trash
Be merciless on unactionable , unimportant messages and get rid of them immediately .
The goal here is to get your Inbox either empty or so that it contains messages that require some response of you .
I ’ve experimented with having @Action , @ Response , and @Waiting mail folders and noticed that either I spent too much time shifting through them or that I forgot to check them regularly enough .
I transitioned to letting actionable items sit in my Inbox , but to get the psychological release , all the stuff in there had to be stuff that required some sort of prolonged action .
Despite it being somewhat of a task parking lot , the goal is still to get it to zero .
Of course , the R.A.F.T. method is n’t anything special , and the elements of it are covered in GTD ’s processing system .
However , “ R.A.F.T. ” is a nice little mantra to help you through your Inbox .
Here are some other quick tips :
Do n’t check email first thing in the morning .
Doing so starts your day off responding to external projects and actions rather than advancing internal projects .
Do your work first and make other people wait their turn .
Turn off the auto - checker in your mail application if you use a computer - based email application .
The threat of a notification alone is enough of a psychological distraction and the reaction is much like waiting for a punch that you know is coming .
Again , rather than letting other people ’s issues distract you , check email only when you ’re ready and prepared to karate - chop your way through it .
This also allows you to reference your email without having to deal with the inclination to check and read new messages when you should be completing your more important projects .
Check email twice a day ( or as few times as possible ) .
Tim ’s insight on this is dead - on .
I check it about 30 minutes before lunch and about 30 minutes before the end of whatever time I determine I ’m done working .
Generally , this gives me enough time to respond to short messages , schedule a time to do longer messages and actions , and file messages in their appropriate folder with time left - over .
If you get one of those nervous - I - need - an - answer - right - now email messages that would give you peace of mind to answer , quickly respond with “ Hey , I ’ve got your message and am working on an answer .
I will get back to you on X day with the information / answer you ’ve requested .
” This response is generally sufficient to buy you some time while you work on the other stuff .
Complete the tasks and projects you ’ve decided you ’d work on while you ’re at your peak .
Figure out the answer to those types of email messages during an allocated time prior to the time you said you ’d respond and respond then and only then .
We can either process email effectively so that we can do our work , or we can let email be the work we do .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A New York doctor is offering flat - rate health care for the uninsured for $ 79 a month , but he has run afoul of state insurance regulations in a case that challenges the established norms of the U.S. health system .

U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged a major overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare industry , which operates on a system of private health insurance and state - funded Medicare and Medicaid programs for the elderly and poor .
The United States spends more on healthcare than any other country , but at least 46 million people have no insurance .
Dr. John Muney , president of AMG Medical Group , said he started the program in September after noticing that many of his patients were losing their jobs , and therefore , their health insurance coverage .
About 500 people have registered for Muney ’s $ 79 - a - month plan , accounting for 15 percent of patients at the practice , which has offices in each of New York ’s five boroughs .
The monthly $ 79 fee -- roughly equivalent to the price of a Starbucks coffee a day -- covers unlimited preventive visits and onsite medical services such as minor surgery , physical therapy , lab work and gynecological care .
Ilana Clay , a 28 - year - old who works in marketing for a jewelry firm , said she signed up in March because she could not afford her employer ’s health insurance , which would have cost around $ 300 a month .
“ I had n’t been to a doctor in a couple of years at that point , ” she told Reuters .
She had a scar removed in a quick onsite procedure that was covered by the plan .
Muney said another patient came in with a tumor on her finger : “ Somebody else asked $ 3,000 to remove it .
The first visit , we were able to remove it , 15 minutes it took us . ”
BILL TO CHANGE STATE LAW
So far the program has not turned a profit , but Muney said he estimates that it could be profitable with 4,000 patients .
In the meantime , he said , his motive is to give something back and provide a model of how healthcare can be more efficient .
“ Our healthcare system lends itself to abuse , fraud and waste , ” he said , adding that bypassing insurers saved on administrative costs , which he said were about 25 percent of the price of care .
“ With this model , we ’re bypassing all that . ”
Muney said he received initial complaints from state insurance authorities in November .
“ The law says you can do preventive checkups unlimited , but if they come for sick visits you have to charge your overhead costs , ” he told Reuters .
In February he received a letter instructing him that he must charge that minimum cost , which he calculates at $ 33 a visit -- a price he says will deter people from signing up .
Troy Oechsner , deputy superintendent of the state insurance department , said the rules were designed to protect consumers .
“ Our concern is ... making sure that consumers can rely on any promises made to them and that they will get the services they paid for when they need them , ” he said .
New York State Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell said on Thursday he would present a bill to exempt primary health care providers from the insurance regulations in question .
“ This is something he ’s doing to give back , as a service to the community in tough times , ” Powell said of Muney .
“ I think any common person would say this is a good thing , however , we know the health insurance companies are going to fight it . ”
Program helps kids find their carbon impact Environment
Catalina Gutierrez ( left with backpack ) and her brother Trevor ride MUNI home from school , something they do more often now that they are aware of their carbon footprint .
Two dozen students at Urban School in San Francisco , CA have been participating in a new carbon footprint study that uses GPS - enabled cell phones to track their transportation habits Monday March 30 , 2009 .

In the ranking of teenage pursuits , cell phones and social networking usually rate higher than protecting the environment .
But a new pilot project in San Francisco is incorporating GPS - equipped cell phones and Facebook to help students learn about their impact on the environment .
The Go Green Foundation of San Francisco , with support from Nokia , UCLA and AT&T , has been testing a groundbreaking project for the past month that allows 25 students at the Urban School in San Francisco to track their transportation habits using GPS - handsets from Nokia over AT&T 's network .
The cell phones act as real - time sensors , sending information every 30 seconds to servers at UCLA 's Center for Embedded Networked Sensing , which organizes the information on personal Web maps and charts for students and allows them to publish their individual and collective results to Facebook .
From the information , students can see how much carbon they 're producing in their various transportation decisions .
UCLA 's software can detect the difference between walking , biking and driving a car as opposed to riding on a bus .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The data create what UCLA researchers have dubbed a personal environmental impact report that encourages students to choose more environmentally friendly transportation options when available .
" The message is : Kids are empowered to make choices about the type of transportation they 're using and those choices have a very material impact on the environment , " said Martin Gutierrez , founder of the Go Green Foundation , a recently created environmental nonprofit .
Project organizers are planning to expand the program to 75 more students at three private high schools in San Francisco later this year .
The schools will be able to compare results and compete to lower their carbon impact through Facebook , where they will be publishing their progress .
Jeff Burke , area lead for UCLA 's Center for Embedded Network Sensing , said the social networking aspect helps put the results in a relevant context and allows participants to compete among themselves .
" In order for people to understand the numbers , it 's not enough to see just kilograms of carbon , " he said .
" When they can compare themselves to friends and others on Facebook , they can make sense of what they 're doing . "
The UCLA center has been working with Nokia 's Research Center in Palo Alto on the personal environmental impact report project , conducting a number of internal tests .
The San Francisco trial is the first real - world test for the program .
Eventually , Burke said , the goal is to make the project software available as a download for any GPS - enabled phone , so individuals can monitor their own carbon impact .
John Shen , lab director for the Nokia Research Center , said the project touches on the power of the cell phone as a real - time sensor .
Shen said for teens in particular , using a cell phone to bring home lessons about a sometimes abstract topic like the environment makes sense .
And it proves more accurate and less burdensome than self - reporting , he said .
" I have three teenagers and the cell phone is the last thing they 'll part with , " Shen said .
" This device is helping them monitor how much carbon they 're chewing up .
It 's a personal , tangible way to connect to that message . "
For students in the program , the results have been eye - opening and challenging .
Julia Evans , a 17 - year - old senior , said she started riding her bike more around her home in Burlingame when she realized how much carbon she was using for short trips .
" Instead of driving , I 'm biking more because I 'm subconsciously connecting this phone in my pocket with how much energy I 'm using , " she said .
Gutierrez 's twin 15 - year - olds Catalina and Trevor , both freshmen at Urban , helped their father create the Go Green Foundation and pursue the personal environmental impact report trial .
But even they have found that it 's not always easy to live up to their convictions .
Catalina said it 's difficult to forgo a morning ride to school from her parents and set aside the time it takes to ride a bike or take the bus .
" It 's hard to step away from the car , " she said .
" But even though it takes an extra step to walk or bike , we see it can make a difference . "
* Five new cases found in addition to two people on Tuesday
* CDC says no reason for concern yet
* Flu is unusual mixture but no deaths seen
( Updates throughout with quotes , details )
By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor
WASHINGTON , April 23 ( Reuters ) - Seven people have been diagnosed with a strange and unusual new kind of swine flu in California and Texas , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday .
All seven people have recovered but the virus itself is a never - before - seen mixture of viruses typical among pigs , birds and humans , the CDC said .
" We are likely to find more cases , " the CDC's Dr. Anne Schuchat told a telephone briefing .
" We do n't think this is time for major concern around the country . "
The CDC reported the new strain of swine flu on Tuesday in two boys from California 's two southernmost counties .
Now , five more cases have been seen -- all found via normal surveillance for seasonal influenza .
None of the patients , whose symptoms closely resembled seasonal flu , had any direct contact with pigs .
" We believe at this point that human - to - human spread is occurring , " Schuchat said .
" That 's unusual .
We do n't know yet how widely it is spreading ...
We are also working with international partners to understand what is occurring in other parts of the world . "
Two of the new cases were among 16 - year - olds at the same school in San Antonio " and there 's a father - daughter pair in California , " Schuchat said .
One of the boys whose cases was reported on Tuesday had flown to Dallas but the CDC has found no links to the other Texas cases .
STRANGE MIXTURE
Unusually , said the CDC's Nancy Cox , the viruses all appear to carry genes from swine flu , avian flu and human flu viruses from North America , Europe and Asia .
" We have n't seen this strain before , but we had n't been looking as intensively as we have , " Schuchat said .
" It 's very possible that this is something new that has n't been happening before . "
Surveillance for and scrutiny of influenza has been stepped up since 2003 , when highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza reappeared in Asia .
Experts fear this strain , or another strain , could spark a pandemic that could kill millions .
H5N1 currently only rarely infects people but has killed 257 out of 421 infected in 15 countries since 2003 , according to the World Health Organization .
The influenza strain is an H1N1 , the same family as one of the seasonal flu viruses now circulating .
Now that the normal influenza season is waning , it may be easier to spot cases of the new swine flu , Schuchat said .
Only one of the seven cases was sick enough to be hospitalized and all have recovered , Schuchat said .
" This is n't something that a person could detect at home , " she said .
The new cases appear to have somewhat more vomiting and diarrhea than is usually seen in flu , which mostly causes coughing , fever , sore throat and muscle aches .
The CDC is asking doctors to think about the possibility of swine flu when patients appear with these symptoms , to take a sample and send it to state health officials or the CDC for testing .
Cox said the CDC is already preparing a vaccine against the new strain , just in case .
" This is standard operating procedure , " Cox said .
The agency will issue daily updates
here
.
Seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people globally in an average year .
And every few decades , a completely new strain pops up and it can cause a pandemic , a global epidemic that kills many more than usual .

Update 2 : Please see the most recent post in this thread , in which I disclose that representatives of Mr. Patterson dispute the original Ambrose Evans - Pritchard article was " fabricated " and have succeeded in getting the Daily Telegraph to remove it .
Update : Daily Telegraph story now " mysteriously "
and TARP beneficiary
US ' sham ' bank bail - outs enrich speculators , says buy - out chief Mark Patterson
The US Treasury ’s effort to stabilise the banking system through the TARP programme is a hopelessly ill - conceived policy that enriches speculators at public expense , according to the buy - out firm supposed to be pioneering the joint public - private bank rescues .
taken down .
The chairman of $ 7 billion distressed Private Equity firmMatlinPatterson calls a spade a spade and in the process exposes the entire Geithner plan for the complete sham that it is .
His comments before the Qatar Global Investment Forum were captured by the Daily Telegraph 's Evans - Pritchard earlier , and Zero Hedge republishes the piece in its entirety as it presents every nuance of our predicament with masterful simplicity .***
“ The taxpayers ought to know that we are in effect receiving a subsidy .
They put in 40 pc of the money but get little of the equity upside , ” said Mark Patterson , chairman of MatlinPatterson Advisers .
The comments are likely to infuriate Tim Geithner , the US Treasury Secretary , because MatlinPatterson took advantage of the TARP ’s matching funds to buy Flagstar Bancorp in Michigan .
His confession appears to validate concerns that the bail - out strategy is geared towards Wall Street .
Under the convoluted deal agreed earlier this year , MatlinPatterson has come to own 80 pc of the shares while the US government has ended up with under 10 pc .
Mr Patterson said the US Treasury is out of its depth and seems to be trying to put off drastic action by pretending that the banking system is still viable .
“ It ’s a sham .
The banks are insolvent .
The US government is trying to sedate the public because they are down to the last $ 100 bn ( £ 66 bn ) of the $ 700 bn TARP funds .
They think they ’re doing this for the greater good of society , ” he said , speaking at the Qatar Global Investment Forum .
Mr Patterson said it would be better for the US to bite the bullet as Britain has done , accepting that crippled lenders must be nationalised .
“ At least the British are not hiding the bail - out , ” he said .
MatlinPatterson said private equity and hedge funds were deluding themselves in hoping to go back to business as usual after the trauma of the last 18 months .
“ This is not a normal recession and there will be no V - shaped recovery .
The crisis has destroyed leveraged companies .
We ’re going to see a catastrophic increase in the number of LBO ’s ( leveraged buyouts ) going into default because they ’re knee - deep in debt and no solution exists since they can’t refinance , ” he said .
“ Alfa hedge funds have been making their money by gambling with excessive leverage , so the knife that cuts off leverage is going to cut off their heads as well , ” he said .
Like many bears , Mr Patterson expects the great crunch to end in deliberate inflation , deemed a lesser evil than outright depression .
“ The US government has thrown 29 pc of GDP at this crisis compared to 8 pc in the early 1930s .
The Fed ’s balance sheet has risen from $ 900bn to $ 2.7 trillion to bail out the system .
America has to do it because the only way out is to debase the currency , but that is going to lead to some very high inflation three years down the road , ” he said .
Matlin Patterson , however , has missed the Spring rebound , the most powerful rise in equities in over 70 years .
“ We shorted the equity rally because we thought it was lunatic .
We ’ve kept adding positions seven times , and we ’re still holding , ” he said .
Ouch !
Facebook : Down
Mark Zuckerberg , the 25 - year - old chief executive of Facebook , this week spoke of his delight at securing a $ 200 m investment from Russian group DST .
He was unconcerned that the stake valued the company at $ 10bn , a third lower than 18 months ago , and said the cash injection would help investment for the future .
The social - networking site is still growing at a huge rate , but this latest cash injection fuelled concerns that the firm has n't found an effective way to make its users pay .
There are now over 200 million Facebookers , with 70 per cent of those outside the US .
It had 29.2 million users in the UK last month , up 9 per cent year on year , according to marketing communications analyst ComScore .
The drop in valuation tracks the wider market , where Google 's share price has dropped over a third in the downturn .
Yet Mr Zuckerberg 's dislike of banner advertising and a fall in the general ad market will put pressure on a company whose burn - through rate has been estimated at above $ 100 m a year .
The group 's CPM , the cost an advertiser pays for every thousand views , is in cents rather than dollars .
Dan Cryan , senior analyst at Screen Digest , said : " Facebook is pretty much a communication tool , but the ad tolerance from consumers for such sites is not particularly high . "
The group is building its self - service advertising system and eMarketer estimated ad revenues would be $ 230 m this year .

Facebook says ad revenues will be up 70 per cent this year , but as its cost base grows and click price falls it could face pressure .
The site is yet to turn a profit , but Zuckerberg did say it would be cash positive next year .
Adam Daum , research vice - president of Gartner , said : " In terms of reach and audience engagement , they 're doing a fantastic job .
In terms of making the thing pay , they have been struggling somewhat . "
MySpace : Down
Analysts have warned that MySpace profits face severe pressure over the next 12 months .
Users are falling , ad revenues are subject to the wider market decline , and the end of a lucrative ad deal looms .
The group , which was bought by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation for $ 580 m in 2005 , has marketed itself as a social portal rather than a social - networking tool , as users upload content including music and videos .
" Users are more tolerant of advertising in this context , and it should be easier to monetise , " Mr Cryan said .
He added that MySpace 's tactics has been to set up local offices , to focus on local advertising sales , which has proved successful .
Yet its advertising revenues will fall 15 per cent to $ 495 m , eMarketer said , and advertisers will be paying close attention to the slide in user numbers , which could well intensify .
Unique users were down 18 per cent in the UK last month to 6.9 million from 8.4 million the previous year .
It has also declined by a million in the US to 63.2 million .
MySpace is understood to be in profit and generated over $ 800 m in revenues last year , but this could change , especially as the company 's costs have been estimated to run at $ 500 m a year .
One expert said the site 's returns were propped up by a three - year advertising deal with Google worth $ 900 m , which comes to an end in 2010 .
" It is profitable today but could struggle to maintain its profits as Google has said it does n't intend to renew the contract , " Mr Daum of Gartner said .
He added that MySpace could look at charging for certain content such as downloading songs or videos through the site , or even allowing other retailers to set up sales links to sell goods .
Friends Reunited : Down
Friends Reunited has gone from trail - blazing social - networking site to an also - ran in only 10 years .
ComScore found that the group lost almost a quarter of its unique users in the past year , falling to a total of 1.8 million in April .
The future is uncertain for the flagging brand , as parent company ITV looks to sell it just over three years after it paid £ 175 m for the site .
While the auction has attracted some interest from buyers , the broadcaster is unlikely to recoup much more than £ 40 m .
Friends was started by husband - and - wife team Steve and Julie Pankhurst in 1999 .
The site used a subscription model and flourished before free - to - use rivals started cannibalising the business .
The group admitted defeat cutting the subscription last year , but the site has never fully recovered .

Hi5 : Up
Hi5 may be relatively unknown in the UK but it is still more popular than recognisable sites such as Linked In ; although it has found user numbers declining a fifth in the past year .
The San Francisco - based group fared better in its home market , rising a third to 3.5 million users , but its real strength comes in its appeal to its Latin American audience .
Hi5 was founded in 2003 , following a seed capital investment of $ 250 m , and was profitable in its first year .
It then raised $ 20 m from Mohr Davidow Ventures in July 2007 to boost its size .
It was the first site to tailor content according to the country of its users – 80 per cent of its audience is outside the US – with translations into over 40 languages and dialects .
It has been especially successful in Spanish - speaking markets .
The group 's revenue stream comes from partnerships in local jurisdictions and targeted advertising .
Twitter : Up
Twitter has made the most noise in the social - networking industry this year .
In April 2008 it had 62,000 unique users in the UK , which has soared almost 40 - fold to 2.4 million this April .
Tweeting has also taken off in the US , rising from 479,000 unique users to 15.7 million , as people express themselves in no more than 140 characters .
The problem for the business is the lack of a revenue stream at the moment ; and the founders have been reticent to sketch out the details of their business plans .
The firm 's co-chief executives , Biz Stone and Evan Williams , have admitted that it is not the best tool for advertising revenues , and so far have decided not to plaster the site with banner adverts .
" I think it 's probably the least interesting thing we could do , " Mr Williams said yesterday .
They think that targeting businesses is the way to generate profits .
The company is planning to launch tools aimed at corporate clients later this year but details remain at a premium .
" Twitter has been enjoying its place in the sun , although the long - term profitability is less clear , " Screen Digest 's Dan Cryan said .
The group is still in its infancy .
It has 46 employees , and said it is just getting going .
It has repeatedly said it is not for sale , after turning down an offer from Facebook last year .
The $ 35 m funding it secured this year has also given it breathing room .
Adam Daum at Gartner noted other potential business models .
" The sites could offer themselves to businesses as a research tool , relaying what users were saying about their products , and general insights , although that could raise privacy issues . "
He said that Twitter could also license its technology to businesses , should they want to develop their own internal social " intranet " .
The group has another problem beyond its lack of revenues , in that many of its new users give up on the site within a month .
Nielsen Online found that 60 per cent of new users were not using the site the following month .
Linkedin : Up
Linkedin is smaller than many of its rivals here , but it boasts one benefit the others can't : a captive audience of business professionals .
The group has private equity backing after a consortium including Bain Capital took a 5 per cent stake which valued the group at $ 1bn .
ComScore 's latest figures show that the unique users have more than doubled in the past year to 880,000 in the UK .
It has a model of charging for premium parts of the site .
Users can sign up for free , but for certain professionals , such as head - hunters who use the service , a fee is charged .
The group , which is also based in California , said it has 41 million members worldwide , and its members include executives from every single Fortune 500 company .
Adam Daum at Gartner said the model worked because the group must benefit from better advertising revenues than its rivals .
" The advertising rates should be dramatically higher than a generic network , because of the professionals who will see the adverts on the site , " he said .
LinkedIn has prospered during the credit crunch in terms of users , partly because those who have lost their jobs see it as a good way to get their CVs in front of potential employers .
It is run by Reid Hoffman , an entrepreneur who has invested in Facebook and Digg in the past .
Bebo : Down
Bebo has shrunk more than any of its major rivals in the UK over the past year .
The network 's users have fallen from 12 million in April 2008 to 9.1 million last month .
This is bad news for a site that has done well this side of the Atlantic , but struggled against the bigger players in the US .
It has more than doubled its American users in a year , but at 9 million , lags in fifth .
This is despite the prominence of parent company AOL in the US , which bought the group for $ 850 m last year .
Bebo has styled itself as a social portal similar to MySpace .
The problem , some industry experts warned , has been knocking the incumbent off its perch .
Bebo was targeted at a specific demographic , mainly 13 - to 19 - year - olds , " which does n't appeal to all advertisers , " Mr Daum said .
However , Bebo is hoping to broaden its appeal .
AOL has not released recent profit numbers for the group , but rumours have dogged the division of underperformance .
As with many of its rivals , Bebo is not expecting revenues to grow in the downturn and is banking on building up its audience .

Russia will stage the first ever ‘ Top Shaman ’ elections this year , with 188 candidates currently listed from all over the country , online shamanist magazine Shamanstvo reports .
The elections will be held in two stages , with only 12 shortlisted shamans participating in the second stage .
Each of the stages will last three months , probably to allow the most far - off regions to cast their ballots .
The list of candidates currently contains all shamans registered in the Shamans Register of Russia , but any people who consider themselves shamans are also welcome to submit their applications .
A special commission will decide whether they are qualified to run in the elections .
The Novy Region news agency cites the curious biographies of several candidates .
For instance , Oyun Batyr is a hereditary shaman from Tuva , a shamanist region in Russia ’s Siberia .
According to his biography , he has several thousand kettles , five wives and three sons .
Batyr does n’t drink and smokes dried herbs instead of tobacco .

CAMBRIDGE BAY , Nunavut -
The aviation community in the North is abuzz with praise for a flight crew who managed to land a small plane in Nunavut after a distraught passenger opened a door at 7,000 metres and jumped .
The pilot of the Adlair Aviation King Air 200 declared an on - board emergency Wednesday as the cabin of the plane quickly depressurized , filling the cockpit with a roar of frigid , Arctic air .
The plane , a twin - engine turboprop , managed to safely put down with its door wide open at Cambridge Bay .
Paul Laserich , general manager of the small family - owned airline that has operated in the North for more than 25 years , paid tribute to the two pilots .
" I am quite proud of my flight crew .
They brought the ship safely back , " Laserich said Thursday .
" Everybody is OK .
They are a little shaken up .
They are OK .
That is what is most important . "
He declined to say anything about the 20 - year - old Cambridge Bay man who jumped .
" Our condolences and thoughts and prayers are with the family . "
RCMP say the drama began when the pilots on the plane enroute from Yellowknife reported that a passenger had become unruly .
They told police they tried everything they could to prevent the man from jumping but were unsuccessful .
RCMP interviewed the flight crew and the remaining passenger , a woman , after the plane landed .
" The plane came in with the door open , " said Staff Sgt. Harold Trupish .
" Somehow they were able to control the aircraft to land .
The three other people are all OK . "
RCMP and searchers in a Twin Otter aircraft were flying over the route about 160 kilometres south of Cambridge Bay searching for the man 's body .
His name was not released .
Word quickly spread among the small aircraft charter companies that fly in the North .
A pilot from another airline said dealing with such a depressurization emergency at that altitude would have been frightening and challenging .
" The shock of it .
It would have been instantly cold , " said the man , who declined to be identified .
" You would have a hard time breathing .
Things would have been flying around the airplane .
It would have been mass confusion . "
The pilot said instructions for opening the exits are printed clearly on the inside of the door in case they have to be opened by a passenger in an emergency .
RCMP were investigating .
The Transportion Safety Board was told about what happened , but was not investigating .
The board said it was providing technical support to police .
" This is not a safety - related matter in terms of the operation of the aircraft or in terms of the mechanical adequacy of the aircraft , " said board spokesman John Cottreau from Ottawa .
" All I can tell you is that this is a matter for the RCMP and the coroner 's office . "
The incident cast a pall over the community of Cambridge Bay as people sought information about what happened and speculated on why the man jumped .
" The whole town is pretty shaken up about it , " said Max Dolling , manager of the Cambridge Bay Hotel .
" Everybody knows that a door was opened and the young man left the airplane .
That 's about it . "

BRUSSELS  European Union governments delivered a blow Monday to the biotechnology industry , allowing Austria and Hungary to maintain national bans on growing genetically modified crops from Monsanto .
The vote , taken by European environment ministers , could irritate Washington , which has complained to the World Trade Organization about obstacles to planting bioengineered crops .
The vote was also a setback for the European Commission , the union ’s executive arm .
The commission has sought to ease the restrictions in Europe on gene - altered crops , in part to keep down the cost of animal feed .
Member countries were “ firm ” and the “ commission should take a close reading of the result , ” the French environment minister , Jean - Louis Borloo , said after the announcement in Brussels , according to Bloomberg News .
Because of the growth of entropy , we have a very different epistemic access to the past than to the future .
In retrodicting the past , we have recourse to " memories " and " records , " which we can take as mostly - reliable indicators of events that actually happened .
But when it comes to the future , the best we can do is extrapolate , without nearly the reliability that we have in reconstructing the past .
However -- the human brain , as most readers of this blog probably know , was not intelligently designed .
It 's does n't have the high - level structure of a computer program , where all the processes are carefully planned to achieve some goal .
( The lower - level structures share the mechanical features of any other physical system , but that 's of little help here . )
Evolution nudges the genome in useful directions , but it can only work with the raw materials it 's given ; it does n't have the luxury of starting from scratch .
So over and over in biological organisms , we find features that were originally developed for one purpose being re-engineered for something else .
As it turns out , the way that the human brain goes about the task of " remembering the past " is actually very similar to how it goes about " imagining the future . "
Deep down , these are activities with very different functions and outcomes -- predicting the future is a lot less reliable , for one thing .
But in both cases , the brain goes through more or less the same routine .
That 's what Daniel Schacter at Harvard and his friends have discovered , by doing functional MRI studies of brains subjected to different kinds of cues .
( Science Newsreport , Naturereview article , Charlie Rose interview . )
Subjects are inserted gently into the giant magnetic field , then asked to either conjure up a memory or imagine a future scenario about some particular cue -word .
What you see is that the same sites in the brain light up in both cases .
The brain on the left in this image is remembering the past -- on the right , it 's concocting an imaginary scenario about the future .
Further confirmation comes from studies of amnesiacs , who famously can't remember the past .
But if you ask the right questions , you find that they also have significant problems imagining their own future .
We tend to assume that the brain must be like a computer -- when we want to access a memory , we simply pull up a " file " stored somewhere on the brain 's hard drive , and take a look at its contents .
But that 's not it at all .
Schacter believes that pieces of data relevant to any particular memory -- times , images , sounds -- are stored piecemeal in different parts of the brain .
When we want to " remember " something , another part of the brain assembles these pieces into a ( hopefully ) coherent picture .
It 's like running a new simulation every time you need a memory , and it 's the same thing we do when we try to imagine some event in the future .
Everyone has heard that memories can be unreliable , but many of us do n't appreciate the extent to which that is true .
It 's not the case that " real " memories are stored once and for all deep in the darkest recesses of the brain , and it 's just a matter of digging them up .
False memories -- conjured from any number of sources , from gradual embellishment to direct suggestion by others -- seem precisely as vivid and real to us as accurate memories do .
For a good reason : the brain uses the same tools to construct the memory from the available raw materials .
A novel and a history book look the same on the printed page .
Court Rules Part Of Copyright Act Unconstitutional
from the wow dept
Congress has a legitimate interest in complying with the terms of the Berne Convention .
The Berne Convention , however , affords each member nation discretion to restore the copyrights of foreign authors in a manner consistent with that member nation 's own body of copyright law .
In the United States , that body of law includes the bedrock principle that works in the public domain remain in the public domain .
Removing works from the public domain violated Plaintiffs ' vested First Amendment interests .
In light of the discretion afforded it by the Berne Convention , Congress could have complied with the Convention without interfering with Plaintiffs ' protected speech .
Accordingly -- to the extent Section 514 suppresses the right of reliance parties to use works they exploited while the works were in the public domain -- Section 514 is substantially broader than necessary to achieve the Government 's interest .

A year and a half ago , we were quite surprised when the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals actually sided with Larry Lessig , concerning how a part of copyright law that pulled foreign works out of the public domain was potentially unconstitutional .
This was in the " Golan case , " the third of three big copyright cases Lessig had championed .
The appeals court had sent the case back to the lower court , and that lower court has now decided that , indeed , a trade agreement ( URAA ) that pulled foreign content out of the public domain is unconstitutional as it violates the First Amendment .
While it may seem narrowly focused , this is the first case that has successfully challenged a part of copyright law as being unconstitutional .
The ruling will almost certainly be appealed , so it 's not over yet -- but it 's still a rare and important win for those who are fighting to keep copyright law from destroying the public domain .
The specifics may seem a bit down in the legal weeds , but they 're quite important .
In the famous Eldred case , which challenged the constitutionality of continual copyright extension , the Supreme Court held that this was within Congress ' purview , so long as it did n't muck with " the traditional contours of copyright law . "
The two later cases that Lessig was involved in both focused on this claim , trying to note that changes in the law did not , in fact , stick with the traditional contours of copyright law , and in removing content from the public domain actually violated First Amendment rights .
In this case , the plaintiffs had relied on previously public domain works , that were suddenly pulled back under copyright by this treaty .
They argued that taking content back out of the public domain went against the traditional contours of copyright law .
While the lower court initially disagreed , the appeals court reversed the decision , and sent it back to the lower court -- noting that since the traditional contours of copyright law had been changed , the new law had to be reviewed as to whether or not it violated the First Amendment .
This latest ruling said that , yes , it appears that itin fact violate the First Amendment -- pointing out that while Congress did need to comply with international treaties , it did not have to do so in the way it did here ( i.e. , it could have created an exception for those who were already making use of these works in the public domain ) :
So , yes , this is a narrowly focused issue ( and likely to be appealed right back up ) , but just the fact that a court has finally realized that copyright law can violate the First Amendment is a big win .
Where this could get more interesting is if it eventually gets appealed up to the Supreme Court , and the court recognizes ( as it hopefully will ) that there 's a discrepancy between this ruling and the ruling in another of Lessig 's cases , Kahle v. Gonzales ( which happened in the 9th circuit ) , and decides to look into whether or not certain changes in copyright law really did change the traditional contours of copyright law .

Canning Stock Route is the longest and one of the
most difficult tracks on Earth .
It leads through the
most remote and inhospitable areas of West
Australia , crosses three deserts and climbs over
nine hundred steep sand hills .
For nearly 2.000
kilometers there is no decent supply of food or
water and no safe way of escape .
CSR has been marked out nearly 100 years ago
by Alfred Canning to drive the cattle from Perth to the
opposite corner of the continent .
However , the
conditions were so harsh and casualties so high that
CSR never truly served its purpose and was forgotten .
In 1968 a group of surveyors for the first time drove
the complete length of the track with specially prepared
motor vehicles .
Despite numerous attempts , no - one
has ever cycled CSR ...
The track extends on the same distance as the complete
length of Great Britain and half - way back , or from Los Angeles
across California and Oregon to Seattle in Washington state , or across New Zealand from Cape Reinga on the north to Slope Point on the south ...
It 's a long way in anybody 's language .
To travel the full length of the CSR in a convoy of 4WD vehicles , a fuel drop is required halfway .
Unsupported crossing of CSR on the motorbike is regarded impossible since nobody is able to carry enough fuel and supplies to complete the journey .
Independent bicycle ride is believed to be out of question .
Well , we 'll see .
Low Cost Investing and Diversification with Index Funds
One of the best ways to get a diversified investment portfolio without a great deal of work is to invest in funds .
Funds offer a collection of stocks in one investment .
Invest in a fund , and you own a portion of each stock in that fund .
It can be a simple way to enjoy the combined performance of several ( or even hundreds or thousands ) of stocks without going through the time - intensive process of picking stocks .
And one of the easiest types of funds to invest in is the index fund .
An index fund is inexpensive , usually diversified and simple to get started with .
Additionally , index funds make great long - term investments for the buy and hold aficionado .
What is an index fund ?
Like a mutual fund , an index fund is a collection of the stocks of individual companies .
However , an index fund tracks a stock index , commodity index , bond index or some other investment index , rather than being composed of stocks chosen by a manager of some sort .
An index fund is composed of all of the stocks on a particular index .
The most popular index funds usually involve tracking the S&P 500 index .
Indeed , the first index fund — introduced by Vanguard — did just that .
But there are other funds that track index performances :
Wilshire 5000 , which tracks all publicly traded companies in the U.S .
Russell 2000 , which tracks the companies with the smallest market cap .
MSCI EAFE , which tracks global stocks .
MSCI Emerging Markets , which tracks stocks in countries with emerging economies .
S&P Global Clean Energy , which tracks clean energy stocks .
Bond funds that follow the performances of aspects of the bond market .
There are , of course , numerous stock index choices , from those that track oil stocks to tech stocks , and including the ability to invest in funds that follow individual European and Asian stock indexes such as the FTSE 100 , Stoxx 600 , Nikkei 225 and the Hang Seng .
It is even possible to find index tracking funds that are also exchange traded funds ( ETFs ) , allowing you to more easily trade them on the stock market .
Using index funds in your investment portfolio
Index funds offer many advantages to a number of investors .
They can provide diversity and relative stability to your investment portfolio over long periods of time .
These funds have the advantage of being exceptionally low cost .
Because they do not require the help of a manager , index funds often cost between 0.5 % and 0.8 % .
This is much better than the average 1.5 % to 2 % that you pay for many actively managed mutual funds .
When you use index tracking funds , you will find that you get to keep more of your money .
It is also worth noting that many index funds are tax efficient .
This means that they often manage to avoid realizing significant capital gains that an actively managed fund does .
When combined with a retirement account , index mutual funds or ETFs become even more tax efficient .
Index funds are ideal for long - term , buy and hold investors because of their ability to do well over long periods of time .
Since they track the stock market , they generally go up when your time frame extends out more than 10 to 15 years .
Because , historically , the stock market always gains over the long haul , you are unlikely to lose out if you keep your money in index funds that track the stock market .
There are some investors that compose their entire portfolios using index funds , adding foreign funds and commodity funds for a little more risk , and using bond funds as conservative investments .
When you properly use index funds , asset allocation can become a little easier , allowing you to easily and precisely allocate your investments in different asset classes by choosing appropriate index funds and investing in them in the ratio that you desire .
This takes away the guess work of figuring out which asset class a particular investment falls under .
Your investments in each asset class will also be diversified as an additional bonus
You should note that many index funds require high minimum investments .
This can make it somewhat difficult to get started with index fund investing .
However , it is possible to find online investment accounts and work through other brokerages ( almost everyone loves Vanguard ) that have lower limits .
In some cases , it is possible to avoid the minimum as long as you sign up to automatically invest from your checking account every month .
Index ETFs offer the opportunity for you to track an index , but without the worry of minimums .
Popular ETFs that track indexes include Spiders , Vipers and iShares .

Not only the annotations are Kmoch's !
The game itself , too .
Kmoch published often one February issue of the " Wiener Schachzeitung " as " Faschingsnummer " ( carnival issue ) , where he mocked in a funny way about the world of chess and its inhabitants .
GM Keene included Kmoch 's translation from " Chess Review " from 1951 into his book on Nimzowitsch , but I have not verified this reference .
Keene , who said about himself , that he is not good at details ( http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/...), stated that the original version appeared 1927 .
But I think 1928 is correct : http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/a....

Because 5 ... Nc6 ! 6 .Bb5 ?? allows 6 ... Qa5 + , winning .

I think that was intentional on Kmoch 's part too - he 's saying that Nimzo could get so bogged down in high fallutin ' strategy that tactical details were missed .

I associate Nimzo style with Art Déco , that arty - modernist stuff ( now it looks much more retro than modernist ) reminds me somehow those QB fianchetto - dutch - like positions .

All I know is that it 's the concept of defending an important square or piece to discourage attacks against with the hope of a long term advantage .
Am I right ?
Do correct me if needed , thanks .

With white , you might put 4 of your men on squares that control e5 , even though black only has 3 guys attacking the square .

I understand there is a new translation of < My System > out -- has anyone read it ?
Nov-11 - 17 Mazymetric : Nimzowitsch was known to be somewhat of an eccentric .
Hans Kmoch and Nimzowitsch were good pretty close friends .
Kmoch was directing a tournament in Bled .
Queen was expected to arrive at that tournament and Nimzowitsch walked into the hall wearing only a bathrobe .
Kmoch got angry for Nimzowitsch 's misbehaviour and kicked him out .
Hence this game was composed by Kmoch as a way to get back at Nimzowitsch .
Nimzowitsch thought it was pretty funny .
Jan -20 - 18 bkpov : Despite all this numzo bumbo I must state that black played very badly .
An attack was afoot on move 17 by a combination of rook and Queen , the fellow very passively moved his " a " pawn .
Was probably intimidated .

Part of the point of overprotection is that if something needs protecting and you 're using only the minimum force to protect it , none of the defenders can move , while if you add even one more defender , any of them can move .
This extra flexibility helps you prepare an attack with less risk to your defense .

An off - duty Glendale officer used a Taser on a 14 - year - old student during a fight Tuesday morning at Desert Sky Middle School in Glendale .
Officer Justin Collum of Glendale police was working an off - duty job as a school resource officer in uniform at the school on Grovers Avenue near 51st Avenue , said Detective Tara Simonson with the Glendale Police Department .
Two 14 - year - old male students were fighting near the football field and Collum told them to stop , a press release said .
When the students did not respond and continued fighting , Collum used his Taser on the �primary aggressor� to prevent injury to the other student , the release said .
The student identified as the aggressor was described in the release as 6 feet 1 inches and 145 pounds .
The other student was described as being smaller .
After Collum stopped the fight , the aggressor was taken into custody .
Neither student in the fight suffered serious injuries , the release said .
Both students were released to their parents .
Charges in the fight were being referred to the Maricopa County Attorney Juvenile Division .
Both students could face charges of assault and disorderly conduct , the release said .
According to the release , an internal investigation is being conducted on Collum for the use of force , which is normal practice when a Taser is used .
Terrible Experience :-( – I needed to hem my new brand name white jeans .
So I googled for the best tailor in the area to make sure the job is done well .
Jack got more good reviews than anybody else , so I chose him , but the service I got was not what I expected .
The first time I went there Jack talked very nicely to me , but when we got to how the jeans have to be hemmed , he told me that it would cost me $ 18 and that he wanted to save me money by not charging me for the more expensive work ( i.e. for reattaching the original jeans hem , which was $ 30 ) - exactly how other people wrote about Jack in their reviews .
I tried to ask him several times if the jeans bottom would be more durable with the original hem , but he did not care to answer my question .
Instead he brought several pairs of other jeans and started showing me how nicely he reattached the original hem to them .
And then I realized : he did not care to give me some advice or answer my questions or save my money - he only mentioned it as an excuse to advertise his more expensive service !
I ordered the usual hemming .
When I came to pick up my jeans during the office hours , Jack was not in and I ended up waiting for him for 30 minutes .
Also when he showed up he was not nice anymore : he did not even say " Hi " or " Bye " to me , and when I asked if I could try the jeans he looked at his watch as if I was going to waist his time .
But this is not it .
When I came back home , my girlfriend looked at the work and noticed that the stitch on one of the trouser leg is already broken and about 2 inches of the hem got detached .
So I had to go there the third time next day .
And this time Jack was not nice either : again neither " Hi " nor " Bye " - he just asked me " What 's wrong ? "
When I explained to him the problem , he did not redo the whole stitch - he just added an additional 2 inch stitch over the broken piece .
So I can still see the broken threads sticking out .
I do not know how long his " work " is going to last ...
I am not going there again !!!
Ms Jean said the raw seal heart was delicious
Canada 's governor general , Michaelle Jean , has helped to butcher and eat a seal in an apparent act of solidarity with hunters .
Ms Jean used a traditional Inuit knife to help gut the animal then ate a slice of raw heart .
It came weeks after the EU voted to ban Canadian seal products , but Ms Jean did not say if her actions were in response to the EU proposals .
An EU spokeswoman said the story was " too bizarre to acknowledge " .
The governor general is the representative of Canada 's head of state , Queen Elizabeth II .
Ms Jean was touring northern Canadian communities and was at a festival at Rankin Inlet on Monday attended by hundreds of Inuit when she ate the seal heart .
Asked later if her actions were a message to the EU , she said : " Take from it what you will . "
Hunting is ' crucial '
The European Parliament recently voted in favour of the ban on Canadian seal products in protest against commercial seal hunting methods .
Inuit people are exempt from the ban , but many fear that it will inevitably have a negative effect on their livelihoods as well .
The authorities say the hunt is crucial for about 6,000 North Atlantic fishermen who rely on it for much of their income .
The government has authorised the killing of more than 300,000 seals this year .
But fisheries officials say only about 65,000 seals will be killed as a fall in the price of seal pelts means there are fewer hunters this season .
Animal welfare groups have long argued that the clubbing of seal pups by hunters is barbaric .
The EU 's proposed ban still requires the agreement of EU ministers to take effect .
But correspondents say it is likely to be imposed before the 2010 hunting season starts .
In “ Looking For Eric , ” Cantona is not just actor but co-producer and part - financier .
The film is based on an incident in his career : a fan so smitten by Cantona that he committed apostasy and transferred his allegiance from Leeds United to Manchester United .
“ It is not about me and it ’s not about football , ” he said .
“ All the same , a director who knew nothing about football could not have made it .
No French director could have made it either .
I was afraid it would be coarsened , caricatured , made stupidly commercial . ”
The buzz on the film in France is positive .
But an interesting question is : could Cantona become the first footballer to win the English championship five times , the FA Cup , twice and the Cannes Palme d’Or ?
UPDATE May 19 , 2009 – REVIEW , PHOTOS , POSTER
Loach ’s “ Looking for Eric , ” tells a story about a troubled adolescent soccer fan who ’s counselled by former Manchester United star Eric Cantona .
His wife has gone , his stepsons are out of control and the house was chaotic even before a cement mixer appeared in the front garden .
Life is crazy enough , but it is Eric ’s own secret that is driving him to the brink .
How can he face up to Lily , the woman of his dreams that he once loved and walked out on many years ago ?
Despite the comical efforts and misplaced goodwill of his mates , Eric continues to sink .
In desperate times it takes a spliff and a special friend to help a lost postman find his way , so Eric turns to his hero : footballing genius , philosopher and poster boy , Eric Cantona .
At the Cannes Film Festival on Monday ( May 18 , 2009 ) , ‘s new film , “ , ” will befor the .
It starsas Eric Cantona , working as guru and life coach to a floundering Mancunian postman , who is obsessed with the former Manchester United striker .
The film is based on a story suggested to Loach by Cantona himself .
“ Seeing top - whack footballers at the Cannes film festival is becoming a bit of a tradition .
Last year it was Diego Maradona , showing up for Emir Kusturica ’s macho movie tribute , Maradona By Kusturica .
The year before it was Zinédine Zidane , the subject of Douglas Gordon and Philippe Pareno ’s Zidane : A 21st - Century Portrait .
( Zidane did n’t turn up in person , but contributed a winning video intro for the premiere . )
Now it is the turn of Eric Cantona , the gnomic philosopher - king of 90s Man U , and now hero of Ken Loach ’s boisterous new picture ; scripted by Paul Laverty , it is a lovably good - natured if erratic comedy about a depressed middle - aged postman and football fan called Eric , played by Steve Evets … .. We get a deeply enjoyable montage of Cantona goals , but when a saucer - eyed Eric asks the great man what was his best moment , Cantona replies that it was not a goal , but a pass : an inspired assist .
From this , Cantona ’s pupil begins to learn the selfless values of friendship and community , and finds the road back to happiness . ”
Guardian Cantona explained how he learnt to play the trumpet during his nine - month suspension from football for attacking a Crystal Palace fan in 1995 : “ I decided I should do something productive , so I took up the trumpet . ”
“ In 2006 , British director Ken Loach won Cannes ’ top prize with a bracing chronicle of the Irish Republican Army ’s struggles against the British in the 1920s .
Three years later , he ’s come up with a film that could n’t be more different in tone and subject matter – a lighthearted dramatic comedy about a distraught middle - aged postal worker , Eric Bishop , who gets his groove back by channeling his favorite soccer hero , Eric Cantona , the legendary French star of UK team Manchester United .
Comparisons to Woody Allen ’s “ Play it Again , Sam ” are inevitable … ” “ Looking for Eric ” belongs less to the tradition of hard - hitting British dramas that frequent Cannes and increasingly more along the lines of the sort of slight crowd - pleasing fare that does well in U.S. art - houses .
And although Cantona may be less known in America than overseas , there ’s no denying the comic fun of seeing a burly sportsman put on some rock n’ roll and cut a rug with another man . ”
IndieWire “ Ken Loach could not have painted a more perfect , bittersweet picture for Cannes .
Looking for Eric stars the French football legend Eric Cantona in a rare Loach comedy .
Cantona is basically a ghost , visible only to the delusional Bishop .
His vague advice about how to handle Lily and the boys is delivered like poetry .
Indeed , Cantona ’s quote about sardines and seagulls — after he kicked a Crystal Palace supporter in the chest , earning a nine - month suspension — is central to this barmy comedy .
But the pleasure of watching a bearded Cantona playing life coach to the astonished and grateful Bishop is rigged , deliberately and brilliantly , with uncertainty … ” TimesOnline “ A recent poll suggested that Ken Loach ’s 2006 film The Wind That Shook the Barley is the most popular Palme d’Or winner of the past few years .
Judging by audience response , Looking for Eric , screening in competition , will be even more beloved .
Unsurprisingly , perhaps : the film is an ode to the footballing genius and life - coaching skills of a Frenchman – Eric Cantona .
He is the hero of another Eric ( Steve Evets ) , a divorced postman already struggling to keep himself together and whose two teenage sons are in trouble with a local gangster … ”
Telegraph
“ No prior knowledge of either English soccer or one of its greatest stars of the ’90s , French - born Eric Cantona , is necessary to go “ Looking for Eric . ”
But helmer Ken Loach and writer Paul Laverty ’s ninth feature together is a curious hybrid :
Three movies — boilerplate , socially aware Loach ; personal fantasy ; romantic comedy — wrap around a central core of a hopeless soccer fanatic who ’s given a second chance to sort out his life .
As in many of Laverty ’s scripts , problems of overall tone and character development are n’t solved by Loach ’s easygoing direction , though when it works , “ Eric ” has many incidental pleasures … ” Variety “ This being a Loach film , neither the comedy nor the fantasy comes at the expense of passionate realism .
Eric ( Steve Evets ) is the single stepfather of two tearaway teenage boys .
The Frenchman becomes a life coach of sorts .
He encourages his namesake to to appreciate his fun and caring colleagues , a likeable bunch of posties played by an entertaining group of Manchester actors and comedians including John Henshaw …
It ’s Loach ’s most accessible film in years , although those who express surprise at his comic touch have short memories : films like ‘ Riff Raff ’ and ‘ Raining Stones ’ in the early 1990s pitched laughs alongside tragic social comment . ”
TimeOut “ It is humorous but hagiographic in its portrayal of former Manchester United star Eric Cantona ( who plays himself – or at least a spliff - smoking Manchester postman ’s idealised vision of him ) .
Funny and sharply observed , it nonetheless has a sentimentality and contrivance about it that stops it short of its director ’s best work …
… Looking For Eric is an easy film to warm to .
The Cantona conceit could have turned to whimsy – at times , it ’s as if Clarence the Angel from It ’s A Wonderful Life has stumbled into Loach ’s universe , but Cantona plays his role with such conviction that you never question why he is sitting on Eric ’s bed or jogging alongside him by the canal .
Moreover , Looking For Eric boasts the most rousing finale of any Loach film .
Loach and Laverty make a scene involving masked men terrorising their antagonists the stuff of uplifting comedy – and that ’s an achievement in itself … ” Independent “ Looking for Eric ” also starsand .
Take a look at six movie clips from “ Looking For Eric ”
What if a vocal political action group held a press conference and no one cared ?
That 's exactly what happened just before Monday 's Easter Egg Roll on the White House South Lawn , when lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender families called an “ availability ” on the Ellipse and just one lonely reporter showed up .
“ Hey , there you are , ” said Jennifer Chrisler , executive director of the Boston - based Family Equality Council , standing on an empty sidewalk by the Ellipse .
Unlike in 2006 , when dozens of journalists scribbled down every word as “ LGTB ” family advocates demanded equality from the Bush administration , just one scribe made himself available for Monday 's availability .
The real - life scene Monday was reminiscent of a joke news article by the satiric Web site “ The Onion , ” way back in April 2001 .
In the mock story , gays hold a parade and chant “ We 're here , we 're queer , get used to it ! ”
The piece included a fake quote from one “ Timothy Orosco , 51 , a local Walgreens manager , ” who said simply : “ All I can say is , I was used to it . ”
So , too , are some parents of the “ straight ” families attending the annual White House children 's event Monday .
“ No , I do n't think it 's a big deal that they 're here , ” said Kim Smith of the District , holding the hand of her little daughter .
“ I do n't think that 's a big issue . ”
“ Are n't we really over that ? ” said one man who would n't give his name .
“ There are a lot of serious problems out there , so I think people are moving on . ”
The issue exploded in President Bush 's face three years ago .
Although LGTB families slept overnight on the Ellipse to get prime - time tickets to the event , most drew slots for noon - three hours after the president milled through the crowd , kissed babies and chatted with parents and children at the egg - roll races .
The White House snubbing gave LGTB groups a major platform and drew heavy press coverage .
Some activists were outspokenly outraged , making the evening news and headlines the next morning .
Looking back , Cathy Renna , a longtime gay activist , said the Bush administration appeared fearful of their attendance .
“ I guess they thought we were going to throw blood - filled eggs or something , ” she said with a laugh .
“ And then they saw us , and we were just like other moms with their kids having fun . ”
But this year , the Obama White House allotted tickets for the event to gay and lesbian parents as part of the administration 's effort to reach out to diverse communities .
What 's more , the White House Office of Public Liaison called the Family Equality Council to advise them on how to get even more tickets on the White House Web site .
“ President Obama obviously includes us when he thinks of diverse families , ” Miss Chrisler said .
Following the tradition of the past several years , same - sex parents wore rainbow - colored leis as they walked around the South Lawn , their children moving from the egg - roll station to face - painting , story - time and jump - roping .
The leis made them instantly identifiable , immediately drawing attention to their sexual orientation .
Miss Chrisler , trying to keep track of her two rambunctious red - headed 7 - year - olds , Tim and Tom , was just fine with that .
“ The more we can introduce ourselves to the American public , the more they can see that we participate in America 's traditions , the more that they understand we are worried about the same things that they 're worried about , the more they 'll come to know that we have a lot in common .
They 'll see that treating us differently does n't really help , it actually hurts our families , ” she said .
But no one treated the LGTB families differently and , in fact , they appeared to be the only ones singling themselves out .
Asked about the disconnect , Miss Chrisler said : “ What we 're doing is showing that we 're being included .
These are opportunities to show ourselves in a more public way . ”
Recent headlines are rife with advances for the LGTB community .
A week ago , gays and lesbians gained another victory when Vermont joined Connecticut , Massachusetts and Iowa in giving gay couples the right to marry .
The D.C. Council voted to recognize gay marriages performed in other states .
In the same year Americans elected their first black president , the voters of tiny Silverton , Ore. , also elected the country 's first transgender mayor , Stu Rasmussen .
Miss Chrisler said the controversy has certainly faded from years past .
“ Everyone 's being accepting and moving on , and I think that 's a good thing .
It 's good for my kids , it 's good for my family , it 's good for all of us , ” she said .
“ And it would be great to be back here next year and not have any coverage at all . ”

In Defense of Food : An Eater 's Manifesto
by Michael Pollan
Rating : ****
Synopsis :
In his previous book , The Omnivore 's Dilemma , Michael Pollan took a detailed look at the American diet , revealing that most of what we eat has its root in corn and oil , and that the organic label is not all it 's purported to be .
His book has been called a wake up call for the hungry and left many people asking , " Now what am I supposed to eat ? "
In Defense of Food is Pollan 's answer to that question , and the first three sentences of this book sum it up : " Eat food .
Not too much .
Mostly plants . "
Those sentences describe Pollan 's philosophy so concisely , you could almost get away with not reading the rest of the book .
Almost .
The problem is that those statements need some explaining , so Pollan spends the next 200 pages fleshing out what he means when he says , " Eat food " ( real food , not the processed food that makes up most of our diet ) , " Not too much " ( focus on quality rather than quantity ) , " Mostly plants " ( more leaves than seeds ) .
Pollan begins by ripping apart food science , or what he calls " nutritionism . "
He asserts that the method we use to analyze food ( categorizing its parts into fats and carbohydrates , nutrients and micronutrients ) is flawed , and as we as a culture have succumbed to the ideas of nutritionism , we 've actually become less healthy , replacing much of the traditional foods our ancestors ate with food - like substances fortified with the supposedly essential nutrients .
Pollan suggests that rather than dividing foods into their various parts , we should focus on the whole food , eating more plant - based foods , eschewing processed foods , and enjoying food as a social and cultural action .
My Opinion :
Pollan 's ideas here are very similar to Nina Planck 's Real Food , and both books could be summarized with the suggestion to eat more traditional foods .
Pollan 's book also had similar flaws to Planck 's , particularly cherry - picking research to support ideas and overlooking lack of exercise as a huge factor in the Western diseases ( obesity , diabetes , heart disease ) .
Nevertheless , I enjoyed Pollan 's book more than Planck 's because she focused so heavily on meat - eating .
Pollan does not advocate a vegetarian diet ( although he does n't discount it ) , but instead he supports eating meat from pastured , healthy , well - treated animals .
Still , I thought a lot of this book was overly - wordy and repetitive , as if Pollan really did n't have much to say on the subject .
And because of that , I think most people could skip the first two sections of the book and only read the last , where Pollan details his eating philosophy .
In fact , for those too busy to read this book , I 'm going to go ahead and give you the Clif 's Notes version .
Here 's what / how you should be eating :
Do n't eat anything your great grandmother would n't recognize as food .
Avoid food products containing ingredients that are a ) unfamiliar , b ) unpronouncable , c ) more than five in number , or that include d ) high - fructose corn syrup .
Avoid food products that make health claims .
Shop the peripheries of the supermarket and stay out of the middle .
Get out of the supermarket whenever possible .
Eat mostly plants , especially leaves .
You are what you eat eats too .
If you have the space , buy a freezer .
Eat like an omnivore .
Eat well - grown food from healthy soils .
Eat wild foods when you can .
Be the kind of person who takes supplements .
Eat more like the French , or the Italians , or the Japanese , or the Indians , or the Greeks .
Regard nontraditional foods with skepticism .
Do n't look for the magic bullet in the traditional diet .
Have a glass of wine with dinner .
Pay more , eat less .
Eat meals .
Do all your eating at a table .
Do n't get your fuel from th same place your car does .
Try not to eat alone .
Consult your gut .
Eat slowly .
Cook and , if you can , plant a garden .
This was another book where I felt like I already knew too much about the subject for it to grab me .
I need some suggestions for a really thought - provoking , pushing - the - limits - of - new - ideas kind of book ... Next up on my reading list ...
Cradle to Cradle by William McDonough
Conservationists have rescued a number of critically endangered " mountain chicken " frogs from the path of a fatal disease which has hit their Caribbean island home of Montserrat .
The decision to remove 50 mountain chicken frogs ( Leptodactylus fallax ) from their natural habitat was taken in the face of the spread of the chytrid fungus , which is devastating amphibian populations worldwide .
The Zoological Society London ( ZSL ) and the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , based in Jersey , have each provided a home for 12 of the frogs which have been removed from Montserrat .
Another 26 have gone to Parken zoo in Stockholm .
The plan is to breed the rescued frogs in captivity in a bid to save the species from extinction .
Montserrat is one of only two sites where the once - common mountain chicken is found , but hundreds of the frogs - one of the world 's largest species - have been killed in the last few weeks by the disease .
The mountain chicken - named because its flesh is said to taste like chicken - is threatened by hunting for food and loss of habitat , and most recently by outbreaks of the chytrid fungus .
Chytrid fungus is a disease which infects the skin through which many amphibians drink and breathe .
In recent decades it has spread rapidly , and some scientists believe the situation is worsening as temperatures rise due to of climate change .
The other stronghold of the species , Dominica , saw populations crash from around 2002 onwards as a result of the disease , which is thought to have spread to Montserrat late last year or earlier this year .
Andrew Cunningham , a senior ZSL scientist , said : " Chytridiomycosis has already decimated the mountain chickens on Dominica and within a few weeks of the disease being diagnosed on the neighbouring island of Montserrat , its impact has been catastrophic .
The mountain chicken frog has been virtually wiped out on the island and the number of surviving frogs decreases every day . "
Director of conservation at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , John Fa , said the drastic action to remove the frogs was taken " simply because we know from other experiences that chytrid will completely decimate populations of frogs " .
Scientists working with the Montserrat government were able to reach the main healthy population , which they knew would be soon by hit by the spreading chytrid , and remove individuals before it was too late , he said .
The Durrell trust has housed its rescued mountain chickens in a bio -secure unit at its wildlife park in Jersey and hopes to breed from the frogs to create a population which can be reintroduced in as little as two years .
ZSL London zoo will now house mountain chicken frogs from both Dominica and Montserrat in its captive breeding unit which includes temperature controlled rooms , automated spray systems and dedicated areas for rearing live food .
Bio-security measures including full paper suits , masks and gloves worn by keepers , ensure that no pathogens - such as the chytridiomycosis - can enter from the outside .
The mountain chicken is difficult to keep and breed in captivity because of its voracious appetite and its unusual breeding behaviour in which the frog creates a foam nest in the ground for the tadpoles which the female then feeds regularly with unfertilised eggs .
The plan is to reintroduce the frogs to a part of Montserrat which has not been affected by the chytrid fungus , while also maintaining a " safety net population " in captivity in case wild populations are hit by future outbreaks of chytrid .

The last survivor of the sinking of the Titanic Millvina Dean was a babe in arms when her family boarded the ocean liner .
She remembers nothing of the journey , of her rescue , or of her father , who perished when it sank .
But it was an event that has shaped the 97 - year - old 's life .
Millvina Dean in her mother 's arms a few weeks after the disaster
At the age of just nine weeks , Millvina Dean was lowered to safety from the deck of the sinking Titanic .
Now she is selling the last of her memorabilia to help pay her nursing home fees .
Almost 100 years after it dipped below the waves , the supposedly unsinkable ocean liner still exerts a powerful hold on our collective imagination .
It was heralded as an engineering triumph , yet succumbed to the forces of nature on its first voyage across the Atlantic .
Among the 1,517 who perished were the rich , the poor , and those in between .
The fascination is such that recently an enthusiast wrote to her , offering £ 100 for a lock of hair .
Even she - a veteran of the Titanic convention circuit since 1985 - is somewhat bemused .
" The girls chopped a bit of hair off and put some red ribbon around it and said : ' that 's the last you 'll hear from him ' , " she says , a smile spreading across her face .
I believe in fate - we were n't supposed to go on the Titanic at all , we were supposed to go on an American ship
Millvina Dean
" But he sent the cheque .
I wrote back to say he'd restored my faith in people 's honesty . "
This anecdote has a more serious side .
The spinster is struggling with monthly bills of about £ 3,000 and is in danger of losing her room at her Southampton nursing home .
And so on 18 April , the last of her Titanic memorabilia is going the hammer , including a canvas mailbag used to carry family belongings back from New York after she , her mother and two - year - old brother were rescued .
" I have a philosophy , if you have to do something you have to .
Do n't look back and be broken hearted about it , " she says .
The same auctioneer was also selling a flask another man used to give hot milk to his wife and two daughters .
That devoted father shinned down the rope of a rescue boat before returning to the deck - and his inevitable fate .
Collective consciousness Millvina more than anyone knows how deep fascination with the Titanic still runs .
Lot 135 : The US mailbag used to carry the family belongings
Her voyage in 1912 profoundly shaped her life , yet she has no memory of it , or her father , lost in the freezing waters on that fateful day .
She was both part of the story , and detached from it .
What is it like to have lived her entire life in the shadows of arguably the most famous sea disaster ?
" I 'm the type of person who treats everything as it comes , " she says .
" Perhaps I 'm out of the ordinary but I never ask anything about it - to me it 's just something that happened in the past .
" It altered my life entirely , of course .
If it had n't been for the ship going down , I 'd be an American leading an ordinary American life . "
And the flipside of experiencing such a tragedy is that it opened up adventures she would never otherwise have had - travelling the world to talk to Titanic enthusiasts .
" The Titanic has created great opportunity in my life .
I 've stayed in the best hotels and met so many awfully nice people .
I would n't have had a lot of experiences I 've enjoyed , like going to America , Switzerland , Germany , Sweden , France . "
Millvina was eight when her mother Georgetta revealed her father Bertram , aged 27 , had died in the tragedy and they had survived .
TITANIC IN NUMBERS 882ft by 92ft , 46,328 tonnes - largest vessel afloat at time 2,223 passengers and crew left Southampton on 10 April 1912 Struck iceberg , sank in two hrs 40 mins at 0220 GMT on 15 April 1,517 killed , 706 survived Total lifeboat capacity : 1,178 but ship could carry up to 3,547 Survival rates by ticket class - first : 60 % , second : 44 % , third : 25 % , crew : 24 %
She had been too distraught to speak of it until then .
" I felt unemotional when I was told , because I did n't know my father , " says Millvina .
While the Titanic was seldom discussed , Georgetta spoke enough about it over the years for Millvina to built up a picture of what happened .
The family boarded the ship in Southampton to start a new life in Kansas , where Bertram planned to open a tobacconist's .
" I believe in fate because we were n't supposed to go on the Titanic at all - we were supposed to go on an American ship , " Millvina says .
" There was a coal strike and all the coal had to go on the Titanic , so our ship could n't sail .
Someone wrote to my father and asked if he'd like to go on the Titanic , and of course he thought it was wonderful . "
Millvina aged three with her mother and older brother Vere
On that fateful night , her father heard a crash and went up on deck to investigate .
" He came back and said the ship had apparently struck an iceberg and told my mother to get the children out of bed and up on deck immediately .
" I envisage that 's what saved us .
We were third class and quite a lot of the third class children were not saved . "
While happy to recall events from afar , Millvina refuses to watch James Cameron 's dramatised film of the disaster for fear it will be too upsetting .
" Although I did n't know my father , at the end I 'd feel quite emotional .
I 'd wonder what happened to him - would he jump overboard ?
I 'd be letting my imagination run right away with me , thinking what he would do . "
She believes this tragedy will continue to fascinate .
Not only did fate throw a cruel twist at the luxurious and acclaimed liner loaded with millionaires and ordinary people alike , there is no age bar among enthusiasts .
A mischievous smile plays around her lips as she recalls the many school groups she has spoken to about the Titanic .
" I 'm usually sitting in the middle surrounded by small children .
I dislike intensely small boys because they always know more than I do . "
Millvina Dean 's sale of Titanic memorabilia is taking place at Henry Aldridge & Son auctioneer in Devizes , Wiltshire on 18 April .

Women favored the slim body of Tillie , while men lusted over Anna ’s size 12 figure .
This post might be a little NSFW due to the images attached , so be cautious .
The British website Fabulous Mag has conducted a survey asking the visitors of their website ( men and women ) about their most ideal body type for a woman , and the results came quite shocking .
It seems men and women have very different ideas about the perfect female figure .
According to the results , it has been found that :
Women yearn for the waspish waist of a size 8 model ; men hanker after a curvy size 12 with hips .
When men were asked what they would alter about their partner ’s appearance , the majority said they were perfectly happy .
In fact , the only thing they ’d wish for that their women would love their bodies as much as they do .
When asked about which female celebrity has the best body , men chose the English model / actress Kelly Brook as their ideal prototype , while women favored the English actress / model / singer / TV presenter Myleene Klass .
So girls , do n’t blame us men for the long hours you stay in the gym or for the extensive months of deprivation you have to put up through to gain the perfect body .
It ’s your own delusions that have been keeping you away from that Haagen - Dazs pint in your fridge .
Us men are reasonable creatures ( well , sort of ) , we ai n’t demanding much .
Kelly Brook – Men ’s favorite body for women :
Myleene Klass – Women ’s ideal body for women :
The mission was obviously possible :-)

Until Monday , Button had not properly driven an F1 car since 19 November
Jenson Button , driving for the newly formed Brawn GP team , ended the first of four days of testing fourth fastest after an encouraging day in Barcelona .
Button and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello have retained their places for this season in the new Mercedes - powered car .
But he finished fourth behind the BMW Sauber of Nick Heidfeld , Ferrari 's Kimi Raikkonen and Toyota 's Jarno Trulli .
" I am so happy the team is on the grid and that 's the most important thing for me , " said Button .
Button , who has taken a big pay cut to stay in Formula One , spent the morning at the top of the timesheets .
He added : " Whatever people have said about drivers in the past , and me personally , I 'm here to race .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I love racing , this is the best place to be doing it and you 've got to make a lot of sacrifices .
" But I 'm not the only one , we all do , especially at this difficult time .
We all have to make sacrifices . "
Owner Ross Brawn said he hopes the team make a " respectable " start to the season in Australia on 29 March .
And the early signs from the Circuit de Catalunya , home of the Spanish Grand Prix , were promising .
Button 's fastest lap for Honda in last year 's Spanish Grand Prix was 1:22.353 but he recorded an unofficial time of 1:21.140 in the Brawn car , running without branding in its new black , white and yellow colour scheme , on his first full day driving since 19 November .
Button 's time was 0.8secs slower than Heidfeld 's best .

Our plans for F1 coverage this year ...
BBC Sport 's Mark Wilkin Honda Racing decided to withdraw from F1 in early December as a result of the global financial crisis , but ex-team principal and former Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn confirmed last Friday that he had taken over the team .
McLaren 's partners Mercedes have replaced Honda as the engine provider , with the new V8 unit believed to be providing around 60 horsepower more than the one used by Button last year , and they are hoping for a big step up in performance .
In 2008 , Honda had a miserable season with Button scoring just three points from 18 races .
But after Honda announced their departure Brawn said the new car was considered a potential race winner .
And 29 - year - old Button admitted that racing for the newly formed team had given him a huge lift and a different perspective on his career .
" I would n't say in the last few years it all went a bit stale but , when something happens like that ( Honda pulling out ) , it 's like ' Wow ! ' and it does become a fresh start , " said Button .
We all do feel like kids again
Jenson Button " Getting into a Formula
One car now , I feel like a kid again .
It 's so exciting .
" It feels like 2000 again ( the year he started out in F1 ) but with nine years of experience , so it 's the perfect position to be in .
" I have the experience but I have the hunger to achieve and I 'm not the only person that feels like that within the team .
" It 's all of us , especially after having produced a car I think is competitive and very different to the last two cars .
" We all do feel like kids again and you can see that within the team , the smiles on people 's faces , and that was before we drove the car today .
" There 's a great atmosphere and it's brought everyone that much closer together , and it's a great thing to be a part of . "

Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak , founder of Sulabh Sanitation Movement in India , has been awarded the 2009 Stockholm Water Prize Laureate for his innovative work in the sanitation field .
Photo by magnusfranklin
Dr. PathakÂ has worked tirelessly since 1970 to change cultural and social attitudes toward the traditional latrine practices in rural villages and slums , which are unsanitary and unnecessarily expose people to disease .
Dr. Pathak ’s aim is to improve public health , advance social progress , and improve human rights in India and other countries , and he serves as a model for non-governmental organizations and global public health agencies .
“ The results of Dr. Pathakâ€™s endeavors constitute one of the most amazing examples of how one person can impact the well being of millions .
Dr. Pathakâ€™s leadership in attaining these remarkable socio- environmental results has been universally recognized , and not least by those who have secured the freedom of human dignity as a consequence of his efforts . ” – Stockholm Water Prize nominating committee
His campaign to abolish the practice of manual scavenging of human waste from bucket latrines in India and his willingness to stand up for the rights of the former scavengers to economic opportunity , dignity , and a decent standard of living are unprecedented .
These scavengers are considered “ untouchable ” in India ’s caste system , and Dr. Pathak has voiced his belief that the scavenging is “ a dehumanizing ” practice .
Dr. Pathak has led the development of culturally appropriate and cost - effective toilets and treatment systems to replace the traditional unsanitary bucket latrines in poor villages throughout India .
Dr. Pathak cites the common toilet as one of civilizationâ€™s most significant advances , yet for the poor , the pit toilet is a health risk .
One of his accomplishments , the Sulabh Shauchalaya twin pit , pour - flush toilet system is now in use in more than 1.2 million residences and buildings .
United Nations HABITAT and Centre for Human Settlements has declared the technology a Global Best Practice , and is now recommended by the UNDP for use by more than 2.6 billion people around the world .
Dr. Pathak has also developed several technologies to convert waste from Sulabh Shauchalaya toilets into biogas for use in heating , cooking , and generating electricity .
Dr. Pathak will receive the 2009 Stockholm Water Prize this August at a Royal Award Ceremony and Banquet during the World Water Week in Stockholm .
Please note that my NES PC is not for sale
One day , I stumbled across the website www.mini-itx.com, and was amazed at some of the things people built a mini-itx motherboard into .
These tiny ( 170x170 mm ) boards had been crammed into toasters , pictureframes , oil cans , breadbins and all sorts .
One of them caught my eye – a Nintendo NES console .
“ I can do that ! ” , I thought .
Very soon , the parts had been ordered – one EPIA - 800 mini-itx board , a 55W laptop style PSU , and a convertor to allow a laptop CD - ROM drive to be used on a standard IDE channel .
I already had a spare hard drive and some ram , and salvaged a CD - ROM drive out of a broken laptop .
I was ready .
Or not .
I was missing a NES !
Actually , I already had a NES , but I was damned if I was going to destroy a working machine to make my NES PC .
I asked around on the newsgroups to see if anyone had a non-working NES they could sell me , and a helpful chap called David Boyd sent me one for the price of postage .
Cheers , David !
Now I was ready !
1 . First things first : open up the NES ( save the screws ! ) and remove all the NESy bits from inside .
2 . One empty NES unit .
I marked those risers that I did n’t want to remove with a black pen – these are the two screw holes for the buttons , the keeper for the buttons , and the 6 case screw holes .
3 . This is the button assembly .
I wanted to use the NES buttons on the PC , so had to remove some metal from the power button ( to stop it staying in when pressed ) and soldered some salvaged PC cables on .
These fit the power , reset and power LED pins on the motherboard .
4 . A close - up of the soldering .
Note that I cut some chunks out of the board to avoid shorting – my soldering skillz are not 1337 yet .
I then taped over the soldering with electrical tape to insulate it .
5. Using a Dremel , I cut off all of the vertical screw hole bits , except for the four corner ones – those are needed to screw the case back together !
6 . To make a space for the hard drive , which I wanted to sit under the motherboard , I cut out some of the risen plastic at the back of the case .
Of course , this made a big hole , but I could live with that .
The hard drive is a slimline one , so is almost the same height as the remaining plastic .
7 . I sanded the plastic edges down so that they were almost gone completely .
The marks in the plastic you can see are just scuff marks – I have n’t spilt glue in there or anything .
8 . I decided to cut the front off a mouse mat to fit over the hole in the base of the case .
I drilled a hole through it and the case to allow me to firmly afix the drive .
9 . As you can see , the hard drive fits pretty well .
Note also that I have removed the joypad sockets and cut out the bit of plastic between them .
All will become clear …
10 . A bottom view .
Yeah , it ’s yellow – but it is on the bottom , so you ca n’t actually see it !
11 . A test to see if everything fits .
“ No ” being the obvious answer .
A bit of reshuffling everything should be able to cure that problem , however .
12 . The motherboard will rest happily on the hard drive and the edge of the NES power button board .
Of course , the bottom of the motherboard needs to be insulated from them , so another mouse mat ( also yellow ) is employed .
13 . Another attempt at cramming everything in .
I ’ve cut a rectangular chunk out of the back of the bottom of the case , to hold the bottom of the mini-itx backplate .
Also notice the custom USB concoction in the middle : the EPIA board does n’t have a standard USB header , so I used a USB backplate and some old CD - ROM audio lead plugs along with these instructions .
14 .
This is where the power board is going to go .
It actually wedges in quite well , and with the case shut it wo n’t move .
Note the USB ports again – they ’re the joypad ports now !
The power socket is in a little hole I drilled in the back of the NES – just below the original DC power socket .
15 . I chopped some bits out of the top of the case of the NES too , partly to fit the CD - ROM drive , and partly to allow a bit of space for the ATX connector on the motherboard .
The drive was attached to the case with heavy - duty gaffer tape .
I also cut a rectangular piece out of the back for the top part of the backplate .
16 . Fingers crossed , the whole thing was carefully fitted back together .
It was a tight squeeze , but with clever IDE cable folding , it all went in .
17 .
And here it is with the power on and the CD - ROM drive open .
I now have Windows XP installed on it , and it is connected to my TV .
Naturally , the first game played was Super Mario Brothers !
Much in this way of life is said about a sub or slave serving her Dom / Master , that it is His pleasure that matters , no matter what the task is it is His satisfaction that is important be it fetching Him a drink or during a scene , what He wishes is what is important and there is no geater time that this is evident than in oral sex .
Very few subs or slaves can honestly say they can orgasm from giving their Dom or Master oral sex yet they do this if it is asked of them , so why when they receive no pleasure themselves do they want to do it ?
Simply put it is because it pleases their Dom or Master .
Submitting to another means you will do as they wish within the boundries of your relationship and this is more evident when it involves sex , as this is where even those who are not in a 24/7 relationship tend to submit , and the pleasure of the Owner is always the focus .
Microsoft has been ordered to pay $ 388 million in compensation after a court found it had infringed a patent in its anti-piracy measures .
Uniloc alleged before the Federal Court in Rhode Island that Microsoft used its patented technology as part of Microsoft ’s product activation methods .
The court found that Microsoft had infringed the patent in Windows XP , Office XP and Windows 2003 .
Microsoft spokesperson David Bowermaster said that Microsoft would appeal the ruling .
“ We believe that we do not infringe , that the patent is invalid and that this award of damages is legally and factually unsupported , ” he said .
“ We will ask the court to overturn the verdict . ”
A Mississauga high school student was found guilty of manslaughter today in the death of a rival player during a rugby game .
The teen , now 18 , was visibly upset – as were family members – after Justice Bruce Duncan rendered his decision in a Brampton courtroom .
His mother hugged him as he sat forlorn , his head down , at a table at the front of the packed Brampton courtroom .
Justice Bruce Duncan decided his actions on the Lorne Park Secondary School playing field in 2007 caused the death of Manny Castillo .
The convicted teen , a major junior hockey player with an Ontario Hockey League team , remains on bail .
He 'll return to court July 6 for his sentencing hearing .
For now , his identity remains protected by Canada 's youth laws .
But that could change .
Crown prosecutor John Raftery said he 's considering asking for an adult sentence .
Duncan , however , told the Crown after rendering his decision that he did n't believe - from what he heard - that an adult sentence was appropriate .
There is no minimum sentence for manslaughter .
He faces a maximum three years sentence if sentenced as a youth .
Life in prison is the maximum adult sentence but it 's unlikely in this case , even if an adult sentence is rendered .
Castillo 's parents declined to comment .
Their thoughts will be given when they file their victim impact statements at their 15 - year - old son 's killer 's sentencing hearing .
They and the convicted teen and his mother were taken to an underground level of the courthouse and driven away instead of walking out the front door .
In rendering his decision , Justice Duncan rejected the defendant 's self - defence claim that he only pushed Castillo to the ground to get out of a choking headlock during continuous play on May 9 , 2007 .
" The defendant intentionally applied force that was outside the rules of the game or any standard by which the game is played , " Duncan said .
" Manny did not explicitly consent to that force .
" I 'm satisfied beyond any doubt no consent can be implied .
" There was no justification in self defence .
Accordingly , the defendant committed an assault , an unlawful act .
That unlawful act caused death .
The defendant is therefore guilty of manslaughter . "
Defence lawyers Lisa White and Calvin Barry had suggested Castillo knew he was playing in a physical game and that he accepted the dangers of the contact sport when he entered the field to play for his Lorne Park team that tragic day .
But Duncan rejected her assertion .
He described what the defendant did as being a " sucker tackle " and said at its " highest " it was done out of retaliation , not self defence .
Although he believed evidence indicated Castillo likely did place the defendant in a headlock , it was only for a brief few seconds and it ended before he was tackled to the hard playing surface .
Castillo died from a serious head injury a few days after the incident .
Crown prosecutor John Raftery said during the two - week trial that the accused committed manslaughter when he lifted Castillo into the air , his feet facing upwards , and drove him head first into the ground .
He took the stand in his own defence and claimed he reacted aggressively to get out of a headlock applied by Castillo , who was pushed , not dumped , to the dirt .
He said it was an unlawful assault outside the rules of the game .

Raftery insisted in his closing remarks that the deadly move was separate and away from the normal play on the field and the ball was nowhere near them .
Following the critical play , Castillo lay motionless , and was dying from severe head and spinal cord injuries .
During the trial , various witnesses – including players , coaches , the referee , parents and rugby experts – gave conflicting accounts of what they saw .
Some said they saw Castillo put the defendant into a headlock and others did n't .
Some said the play had already stopped at the time and others did n't .
Some witnesses saw Castillo driven to the ground , others said they saw him fall gently over the shoulder of the accused .
As for the convicted teen , he testified that he fell on top of Castillo when he wrestled his way out of a headlock .
He said he had panicked because he could n't breathe and denied intentionally hurting the opposing player .
He said he was unaware Castillo was injured when they both fell to the ground .
He never lifted him up or drove him head - first into the ground or boasted about it afterwards , as Crown witnesses said .
Duncan found it was a fact that the defendant was put in a headlock but only for a few brief seconds .
He did n't believe he was ever in a choke hold and if he was , he never just used his hands to take Castillo 's arms away from him .
He did n't believe the fatal assault occurred during a continuous play .
He found there was as a " hiatus " or break between the headlock and the assaulted tackle .
" I 'm satisfied beyond any doubt the headlock ended before the tackle and it ceased to have any legal significance , " Duncan said .
He found the defendant tackled Castillo from some distance .
He said the intentional force applied by the defendant was not within the rules of the game , "
Castillo was later declared brain dead in hospital .
He also sustained a bruised spinal cord , which would have been fatal had paramedics not attended .
The spinal cord injury occurred when his neck was flexed forward – not backward – beyond its range of motion , according to a neuropathologist .
Had he survived , Castillo could have been paralyzed .

U.S. consumers are warming to Blu-ray disc players in a big way , according to The NPD Group , a market research firm .
First quarter 2009 sales of standalone Blu-ray players in the U.S. topped 400,000 units , a significant 72 percent increase over Q1 2008 .
Two trends are leading the sales surge : A rising number of HDTV owners seeking high - def content , and cheaper Blu-ray players .
" The rising penetration of high - definition televisions and lower Blu-ray player prices are broadening the format ’s market opportunity , " said NPD Group analyst Ross Rubin in a prepared statement .
And while HD movie fans have a growing number of online alternatives to physical media , including high - def flicks on iTunes and Amazon Video on Demand , “ Blu-ray is carrying forward the widespread appeal of DVD into the high - definition marketplace , " Rubin says .
It ’s likely that part of that appeal is the fact that Blu-ray looks and acts like DVD .
There ’s little if any learning curve , particularly if you simply want to play discs and not fuss with Blu-ray ’s more innovative features , such as Ethernet connectivity and Internet streaming via Netflix , CinemaNow , and other online providers .
If you ’re familiar with DVD -- and everybody is at this point -- the transition to Blu-ray appears painless .
Simply slip a disc into the player , and you ’re good to go .
While online services are n’t necessarily complex , many users are likely reluctant to try something new .
The NPD Group report also illustrates how dramatically Blu-ray player prices have fallen in the past year .
The average selling price has plummeted 34 percent -- from $ 393 in Q1 2008 to $ 261 in Q1 2009 .
Street prices are probably closer to $ 200 now , and some Blu-ray players could go for under $ 100 before the end of the year .
Vizio , best known for its aggressively - priced HDTVs , plans to debut a $ 200 Blu-ray player in August , a development that could help push prices lower as well .
This story , " U.S. Sales of Blu-ray Players Soar : NPD Group " was originally published by PCWorld .
On March 13 , Ohio blogger Matt Hurley , who has been running Weapons of Mass Discussion for over five years , received an email from “ someone in the business ” — specifically , the social services “ business ” in Warren County , Ohio , just northeast of Cincinnati ( typos in original have been corrected ) :
Subject : Food Stamp Case
One of the workers here just approved an ongoing food stamp case where the family has over $ 80,000 in the bank , owns a 2001 Toyota and 2006 Mercedes Benz , and a $ 311,000 home that is paid for .
Monthly benefits of over $ 500 in FS , received over $ 300 in expedited .
3 household members — husband , wife , and child .
Wife recently lost job , husband receives SS benefits .
There ’s something badly wrong with this program that allows a family that kind of resources to still get food stamps .
This is where things have gotten to .
I would think the world would want to know about this .
The emailer was only partially correct .
Southwestern Ohio was interested , as Warren County and neighboring Butler County pushed back , promising to resist approving similar future aid applications .
A Warren County - based state legislator has drafted a bill to tighten eligibility rules .
But most of the rest of the state has shown little interest , and in the rest of the nation there has barely been a ripple .
I believe that needs to change .
The fact is that many states quietly and significantly liberalized their food stamp eligibility rules last fall .
An October 19 USA Today article was one of the very few that even noticed it .
But in doing so , the newspaper ’s Wendy Koch played down their importance :
Some states are going further to expand eligibility .
Last month , California enacted a bill that will allow low - income people to keep some savings and still qualify for food aid .
At least four other states — Maryland , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Vermont — similarly eased the asset test this year .
“ People wo n’t have to sink to ground zero to get help , ” says Paul Fraunholtz , a deputy director in Ohio ’s Department of Job and Family Services .
Who knew that $ 80,000 was “ some savings ” ?
Or that it ’s barely above what Ohio ’s Fraunholtz refers to as “ ground zero ” ?
I have since learned that Ohio ’s change does not appear to be as comprehensive as it first seemed ; the lifting of asset limits such as not having more than $ 2,000 in the bank , etc. , appears to apply only to certain situations ( but note that USA Today ’s Koch incorrectly gave readers the impression that recipients are n’t allowed to have any savings ) .
Nevertheless , the fact is that the food stamp program ’s eligibility rules and benefit structure were just fine before September 30 and there was no crying need for change .
( This issue is separate from whether applicants tell the truth when they apply .
That has been an ongoing problem for decades and there ’s no space to address it here . )
For almost two years , advocates of program expansion have been peddling the fiction that food stamp benefits are inadequate to meet participants ’ needs , claiming that the average benefit of $ 21 - $ 23 per person per week is not enough to meet a person ’s food and nutritional needs .
They have conducted “ food stamp challenges ” around the country , coaxing activists , journalists , governors , congressmen , and other politicians into trying to buy and live on the aforementioned dollar amounts of food for a week .
Routinely failing ( of course ) , they have then reached the “ obvious ” conclusion that the government has to increase benefits to keep people from starving .
There ’s only one problem : actual program benefits for those who have very low incomes and no other resources are much higher .
What follows , directly from the USDA ’s site , are the maximum monthly allotments ( i.e. , benefits ) for varying household sizes , effective October 1 , 2008 , accompanied on the right by the weekly costs per person of various ages of what the USDA calls its “ thrifty meal plan , ” also as of last October ( the USDA estimates costs at four levels at its “ cost of food at home ” page : thrifty , low - cost , moderate , and liberal ) :
In other words , the benefit levels above give participants the ability to have what the USDA calls a “ nutritious diet ” if they choose to be “ thrifty . ”
Last time I checked , it was not unreasonable to expect beneficiaries of taxpayer largess to actually be thrifty — or if they ’re not , to pay the extra price themselves .
Even getting by on the bogusly claimed $ 21 - $ 23 can be done .
Colorado couple Ari and Jennifer Armstrong proved in August 2007 that they could buy and live on $ 180 worth of food in a month — the advocates ’ monthly equivalent of the “ impossible ” $ 21 - $ 23 a week — and had over $ 20 left over when they were done .
Of course , the Denver media , many of whom attempted and of course “ failed ” at their own “ food stamp challenge , ” pretended the Armstrongs did n’t exist .
Here ’s what those who want to expand benefits do n’t want us to know :
The average actual benefit is lower because , as the USDA states , “ food stamp households are expected to spend about 30 percent of their resources on food ” ( from income , as the USDA defines it , and assets ) .
In other words , if you earn enough money to be able to pay for part of your food costs , after appropriately considering other expenses and individual / family circumstances , you should do so .
Imagine that .
Further , if you have enough money in the bank to pay for your own food , you should do that before running to the government for assistance .
Yet running to the government is clearly what happened in the Warren County case that got the whole controversy rolling .
There are now reports of similar examples coming in from other Ohio counties .
In theory ( but again , in relatively limited situations ) , there appears to be no reason why an applicant with $ 1 million in liquid assets could n’t apply for benefits and get them .
This is outrageous .
Since when did it become taxpayers ’ duty to feed people who have more than enough money to feed themselves — even quite well ?
I would suggest that taxpayers in the other states mentioned by USA Today , and perhaps others , should look into what has happened where they live , get past the nice descriptions , and find out what the social services folks have decided to do with what is , after all , your money .

A takeover approach has sent shares in the wind farm company Renewable Energy Generation soaring by almost 50 % .
Renewable , which operates 11 wind farms in the UK and Canada , declined to name the potential bidder and did not say at what level an offer may be made .
However , the company confirmed that talks were continuing .
Renewable 's share price fell from 130 p last August to a low of 27.5 p in March .
By mid-morning on Friday the shares had recovered to 52.75 p .
“ If one were to trade the S&P 500 for one day , the probability of losing money is about 46 percent , ” Bernstein states .
“ However , as one extends that time horizon from one day to one month to one quarter to one year to 10 years , the probability of losing money decreases as the time horizon lengthens . ”
To which I would add this observation from Keynes : “ In the long run , we are all dead . ”
This is what I heard Bernstein say : give up .
You ’re not going to make money on your investments in the next 10 years , or 15 , or 20 , so you should stop worrying about your portfolio and go to the movies like everyone else .
I called Bernstein and asked him if he was , in fact , advocating a form of Stoicism .
He said I was misinterpreting his views .
“ This is not some sort of psychological compensation device .
What I ’m saying is that in looking for investment ideas , we should be looking over a five - , six - , seven - year time period .
You have to give an investment strategy time to reach gestation . ”
But my investment strategy gestated for 15 years .
And then it died .
As I write this , the markets are back down to 1997 levels .
In Japan , they ’ve sunk to 1983 levels .
I pointed out to Bernstein that 1983 was 26 years ago .
The investor who bought Japanese equities in 1983 and held on to them has stayed absolutely flat .
“ That ’s not correct , ” Bernstein said .
“ That does n’t take into account dividend payments . ”
Even with all those munificent dividend payments , my net worth has dropped by a third , and new vistas of worry open up for me each day .
I ’m not complaining , by the way , and not only because I have no right to complain .
I make more money than most Americans .
I will ungrudgingly pay more taxes if it means keeping people in their homes — even the schmucks in overleveraged McMansions .
My wife and I are lucky .
We have substantial equity in a small but perfectly nice house in Washington , D.C. , a city that is now , among other things , America ’s financial - services capital , which should help keep real - estate prices steady .
I have a late - model minivan .
Most important , I have a job ( and in the thriving magazine industry , no less ! ) .
If I lose my job , then I ’ll complain ( at which point , of course , I ’ll no longer have a public venue for my complaints ) .
But for now , no whining : just confusion and bemusement and fear , along with an uncharacteristic sense of paralysis .
In the past six months , I ’ve bought and sold virtually no equities .
And I rarely take the pulse of my 401( k ) .
I called a psychologist to find out what could explain this weird passivity .
Daniel Kahneman is a Nobel Prize–winning innovator in the field of behavioral economics .
He explained that my feelings of paralysis were to be expected .
“ You no longer know the world you live in , ” he said .
“ You played by the rules , the rules benefited you .
The world functioned according to some regularities .
Right now , it ’s unclear what rules apply .
There is a new regime .
What seemed prudent earlier has disappeared .
I ’m surprised Americans are n’t more panicked .
Americans seem to accept a level of insecurity in their lives that Europeans would n’t tolerate .
Paralysis is one response to this level of insecurity . ”
Becoming a mother “ was a joy , ” said Anna Wilde Matthews in The Wall Street Journal , but paying for the delivery ?
Not so much .
Health insurance covered most of the above - average $ 17,300 hospital bill , but I was still stuck paying $ 2,100 .
Who knew babies had their own deductibles ?
Many hospitals will estimate your out - of - pocket costs beforehand , but you have to ask .
The costs do n’t end at the hospital , said Kristen Gerencher in MarketWatch .
Breast - feeding is an “ inexpensive and healthful way ” to nourish your child , but if you work , “ pumping breast milk on the job ” can be inconvenient .
And some women fear looking less productive .
Still , the big health and financial benefits might make it worth the hassle .
The salary for all the “ Mom jobs ” mothers do at home , said Janet Bodnar in Kiplinger ’s , would be $ 122,732 for stay - at - homers and $ 76,184 for working moms , and that does n’t include the CFO role most moms play .
This Mother ’s Day , Mom , give some TLC to your own finances :
Put your retirement savings before your kids ’ college funds , and set aside a little “ treat yourself ” fund , too .
You earned it .
GUWAHATI : Ten days before it goes to the polls and 24 hours before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was to land in his home state , Assam was rocked by four deadly explosions on Monday that left at least nine people dead and more than 60 people injured .
( Watch )
Undeterred by the terror attacks , the prime minister will go ahead with his visit and address a rally at Dispur on Tuesday , officials in New Delhi said .
Union home minister P Chidambaram called chief minister Tarun Gogoi minutes after the blasts .
Official sources said the Union cabinet secretary , defence secretary and home secretary would arrive here on Tuesday to take stock of the situation .
The finger of suspicion pointed to the northeast 's most active terrorist outfit , the United Liberation Front Of Asom ( Ulfa ) , which is to mark its 30th ' Raising Day ' on Tuesday .
In the past , Ulfa terrorists have triggered blasts in the state to observe the day and also planted bombs just ahead of VVIP visits , the deadliest being serial blasts in January , just ahead of Chidamabaram 's first visit to Guwahati as home minister .
( Watch )
Monday 's deadliest blast was triggered at a busy bus stop at Maligaon on the outskirts of Guwahati around 1.40 pm and killed eight people , including a 10 - year - old boy .
More than 50 people were injured there .
The Maligaon police station and the headquarters of the Northeast Frontier Railway are a stone 's throw from the site .
According to a police officer scanning the site minutes after the blast , the explosion at Maligaon was caused by an improvised explosive device ( IED ) planted either on a bicycle or a motorcycle .
People waiting at the bus stop were the first to be hit .
The blast was so powerful that several cars and motorcycles parked nearby caught fire .
The flames soon spread to neighbouring houses .
Many people jumped out of their windows in panic to escape the fire and smoke and injured themselves .
Less than two hours later , another explosion , this time at a busy marketplace in Dhekiajuli in Sonitpur district , injured three Railway Protection Force personnel on election duty .
Here , too , the bomb was strapped to a parked bicycle , a vehicle of terror that has been used effectively by Ulfa terrorists .
In the third blast in the evening , terrorists threw a grenade at the Mancachar police station in Dhubri district , killing a constable .
Another grenade lobbed in the Garo Basti area in Udalguri district did not explode .
A fourth bomb explosion rocked Karbi Anglong district , injuring two people .
Gogoi condemned the blasts and said his government would crush the terrorist elements operating in the state .
Deputy inspector general of police ( central range ) G P Singh said Ulfa was behind the blasts .
" We had information about the outfit 's plans to carry out terror activities ahead of its foundation day on April 7 , " he said .
Sources said intercepted messages of Ulfa militants suggest the outfit will now target security forces and non-Assamese people .
" The Maligaon blast may have been carried out by one of Ulfa 's 109th battalion members who have recently sneaked into the city .
We came to know about a 27th battalion Ulfa cadre named Deepak who had supposedly hired a man called Sagar Topno to carry out the blast in Sonitpur district , " a source said .
Forensic experts who visited the blast site at Maligaon said bicycle ball - bearings were packed into the bomb as shrapnel .
Experts said chemical tests would be required to confirm the type of explosives used .
An NSG bomb squad is also expected to arrive on Tuesday .
A woman who shot her son dead then killed herself at a US shooting range said she was the anti-Christ and that she needed to save her son .
In rambling , teary audio recordings left for her boyfriend and authorities , as well as shorter suicide notes , Marie Moore , 44 , apologised several times and said repeatedly : " I had to send my son to heaven and myself to hell . "
I am the anti-Christ ... Maria Moore points a gun at her 20 - year old - son Mitchell .

Authorities said on Wednesday they still had no motive for the murder - suicide that shocked fellow customers and employees at the Shoot Straight gun range in Casselberry , about 16 kilometres north of Orlando , on Sunday .
" We have no clue .
I do n't even want to begin to speculate , " said Deputy Chief Bill McNeil of the Casselberry Police Department , Florida .
A woman who was shot in the head not only survived but made herself tea and offered an astonished deputy something to drink , authorities said .
Tammy Sexton , 47 , remained in hospital three days after being wounded by her husband , who killed himself after he shot his wife .
She is expected to fully recover .
" There 's no way she should be alive other than a miracle from God , " said Sheriff Mike Byrd of Jackson County , Mississippi .
Byrd said deputies were looking for Sexton 's husband , Donald Ray Sexton , earlier in the week to give him a document ordering him to stay away from his wife .
Court records show he was put on probation for six months on April 9 for domestic violence .
He showed up at their home in rural Jackson County in Southeast Mississippi about 12.10 am on Tuesday and confronted his wife as a relative ran next door to call police , the sheriff said .

You think that 's bad ?
Check out what Minnesota " Public " Radio has done :
The court 's ruling Monday is consistent with how they 've ruled throughout this case , but inconsistent with the Minnesota tradition of enfranchising voters .
In his statement , Ginsberg said more than 4,400 Minnesotans remain wrongly disenfranchised by this court 's order .
Note that no quotation marks appear in the above paragraph , and that while the second sentence clearly describes Ginsberg 's statement , the first sentence is stated directly as a " fact " by the journalist .
Compare that with the following news report from The Hill ( among many others I could cite , such as CNN ) : " More than 4,400 Minnesotans remain wrongly disenfranchised by this court 's order , ” said Coleman attorney Ben Ginsberg .
“ The court 's ruling tonight is consistent with how they 've ruled throughout this case but inconsistent with the Minnesota tradition of enfranchising voters . ”
In other words , MPR ( the Minnesota wing of NPR ) took Ginsberg 's talking point and used it , VERBATIM , as what amounts to an editorial statement in the middle of a news story .
It 's conceivable this happened by accident -- that it was supposed to be a quotation and the quotation marks somehow got deleted -- but it certainly looks very fishy .
The whole paragraph would have been written differently if it were a quotation .
At the very least , it calls for explanation .

Yep , after the SCOTUS enabled the theft the 2000 election the ' cons do n't want an electoral equal rights case anywhere near the SCOTUS .
It would be denied cert and DOA .
But ...
Teddy Partridge over at FDL did speculate that since Alito is assigned as the 8th Circuit , which includes Minnesota , that he might issue a stay on Pawlenty signing Franken 's certificate of election until the after SCOTUS cert is officially denied .
That would be so mind - bogglingly stupid of Alito that it 's tempting to think it might be possible

Nope .
The final state process needs to play itself out .
That 's the inevitable MN Supreme Court denial of Coleman 's appeal .
And Coleman will stretch that out as long as possible on behalf of the RNC .
Afterwards , if Coleman goes federal and appeals to the SCOTUS , then it would be right and proper for Reid to seat Franken come hell or high water ... and since would be the right and proper thing to do what do you think the chances of Reid doing it are ?

The story should be : " The biggest embarrassment of all time : Coleman wo n't concede " .

My opinion of Brian Bakst .
Currently a young adult , well groomed , political reporter who does n't take things too serious .
Doubtful he'd ever take on a serious important topic like the War , US Constitution , Electronic Vote Tabulation , Civil Rights , or Banking Fraud .
( I did n't find anything at least , and I sure the fuck ain't paying money to read his work )
His politics appear focused on local St. Paul and greater Minnesota area .
While he likely has a basic understanding of how to dig for answers , I would n't consider him a Shining American Star of the Fourth Estate .
I mean after all in 2007 the guy was talking about Bass Fishing .
Can any of you think of something more important in 2007 than fishing ?
I was unable to find ANY un copyrighted or free work by him .
I do not consider tpt stuff PUBLIC ACCESS , it 's CORPORATE for profit PBS and copyrighted .
( pisses me off more people do n't understand this -- yeah I lump PBS in with ABC , CBS , NBC , FOX - - all corporate ) I doubt he worries about the future much beyond getting paid for his work .
From videos I was able to find , he appears uneasy in a stage presence atmosphere , or large media operations , I doubt he 's a " just do it " leadership oozing man .
I could n't find a personal website , therefore I doubt he has any tcpip / code / database / IT skills , I doubt he served the military , he does n't seem the rough type at all .
---
Then again , I could be wrong ..it 's just a wild guess .
He probably just slipped up with that horrid " vote - getter " description .
-IMO
I ain't saying I am any better !
( remember this is an opinion , I am just passing time now while the country I know in my heart is dieing from about 65 - 70 trillion cuts . )
Or ... Maybe an AP ( webmaster ) / editor / ( person with access ) PUBLISHED AND CHANGED the title for him ?
Who knows .
Who cares anymore , I only hope Minnesota get 's some representation for the people .
The whole thing " feels " like a DoS ( Denial of Service ) attack on our ( broken ) Constitutional Republic as opposed to the California / San Diego hop on the jet fly and fast track the swearing in of the representative before all votes were counted . )

Judges Rule Franken Winner of Senate Race
In Minnesota , Al Franken has moved one step closer to becoming a US senator .
On Monday , a three - judge panel ruled that Franken had received 312 more votes than incumbent Norm Coleman on Election Day , five months ago .
The court rejected Coleman ’s central argument that the election and its aftermath were fraught with systemic errors that made the results invalid .
But the legal battle in Minnesota is not over .
Coleman has vowed to appeal Monday ’s ruling .

i went back to dbl check i was remembering how this all started Republican Sen .
Norm Coleman finished ahead of Democrat Al Franken early Wednesday in the final vote count , but his 571 - vote margin falls within the state 's mandatory recount law .
That law requires a recount any time the margin between the top two candidates is less than one - half of one percent .
The AP called the race prematurely .
Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said the recount wo n't begin until mid-November at the earliest and will probably stretch into December .
Franken has , wisely , not conceded .
More from Brad on all of this , no doubt , when he 's able to get caught back up from out of the prevailing whirlwinds ... diebolds gave the victory to coleman and a hand count has overturned that result , so the next time some election peop tries to tell u , " there may be a few anomolies but they dont change the result " , remind them , they did in minnosota !!

... the zapkitty said Nope .
The final state process needs to play itself out .
That 's the inevitable MN Supreme Court denial of Coleman 's appeal .
And Coleman will stretch that out as long as possible on behalf of the RNC .
Afterwards , if Coleman goes federal and appeals to the SCOTUS , then it would be right and proper for Reid to seat Franken come hell or high water ... and since would be the right and proper thing to do what do you think the chances of Reid doing it are ? "
Right ,
It looks like he is the top vote - getter until this step is cleared .
After that , he 's the winner and he better be certified and Harry Ried better seat him .
Thank's for the help in clarifying the timeline .

WASHINGTON , March 2 ( Reuters ) - One in every 31 U.S. adults is in the corrections system , which includes jail , prison , probation and supervision , more than double the rate of a quarter century ago , according to a report released on Monday by the Pew Center on the States .
The study , which said the current rate compares to one in 77 in 1982 , concluded that with declining resources , more emphasis should be put on community supervision , not jail or prison .
“ Violent and career criminals need to be locked up , and for a long time .
But our research shows that prisons are housing too many people who can be managed safely and held accountable in the community at far lower cost , ” said Adam Gelb , director of the Center ’s Public Safety Performance Project , which produced the report .
The United States has the highest incarceration rate and the biggest prison population of any country in the world , according to figures from the U.S. Department of Justice .
Most of those in the U.S. corrections system -- one in 45 -- are already on probation or parole , with one in 100 in prison or jail , the Pew study found .
Those numbers are higher in certain areas of the country , and Georgia tops all states with one in 13 adults in the justice system .
The other leading states are Idaho , where one in 18 are in corrections and Texas , where the rate is one in 22 .
In the nation ’s capital , Washington , D.C. , nearly 5 percent of adults are in the city ’s penal system .
This was the first criminal justice study that took into account those on probation and parole as well as federal convicts , Pew said .
‘ STATES SPENDING TOO MUCH ’
The numbers are also concentrated among groups , with a little more than 9 percent of black adults in prisons or jails or on probation or parole , as opposed to some 4 percent of Hispanics and 2 percent of whites .
Pew compiled the report as states consider cutting corrections spending during the recession .
The research group said that by changing sentencing laws and probation programs states can lower incarceration rates and save money .
“ Among the many programs that are competing for scarce taxpayer dollars , there is one area of the state budget that could use some trimming , and that area is corrections , ” said Susan Urahn , the center ’s managing director , in a call with reporters .
“ The bottom line is that states are spending too much . ”
Penitentiary systems have been the fastest - growing spending area for states after Medicaid , the healthcare program for those with low income .
Over the last 20 years their spending on criminal justice has increased more than 300 percent , the study found .
During the last 25 years prison and jail populations have grown 274 percent to 2.3 million in 2008 , according to the Pew research , while those under supervision grew 226 percent over the same span to 5.1 million .
It estimated states spent a record $ 51.7 billion on corrections in fiscal year 2008 and incarcerating one inmate cost them , on average , $ 29,000 a year .
But the average annual cost of managing an offender through probation was $ 1,250 and through parole $ 2,750 .
“ The huge differences between states are mostly due not to crime trends , or social and economic forces , ” Gelb said .
“ The rates are different mostly because of choices that the states have made about how they respond to crime . ”
“ New community supervision strategies and technologies need to be strengthened and expanded , not scaled back .
Cutting them may appear to save a few dollars , but it does n’t , ” Gelb said .
Some states have begun experimenting with ankle bracelets , Global Positioning Systems , and even kiosks akin to cash machines in order to track those on probation for less , he said .

Miss California Carrie Prejean “ may not believe in gay nuptials , ” said The Hollywood Gossip , “ but she does believe in posing half - naked ! ”
The Dirty.com recently posted a racy photo of the beauty queen , a shot reportedly taken during her teen modeling days .
For someone who “ claims to live her life according to the Bible , ” it seems hypocritical that Prejean has no problem “ flaunting ” her “ body for money and attention . ”
Keep in mind , said Celebuzz , this is the same Carrie Prejean who allowed the Miss California Organization to pay for her breast implants .
But Prejean claims that “ the photo is perfectly in line with her belief system ” because it ’s just part of being a model .
“ The Man Upstairs might give the thumbs up on Prejean 's topless modeling photos , but the officials for the Miss USA pageant may be another matter ” — she could lose her state title .
Which is “ ridiculous , ” said Abe Luciano in Sports Odds .
The photo of Prejean on TheDirty.com is no big deal — “ I ’ve seen way more revealing stuff in Victoria ’s Secret catalogs ! ”
Miss California is “ under attack by the left - wing media ” solely because of her Christian beliefs .
She has a right to her own opinion on gay marriage , and should be able to express it without being “ hunted down like a wild animal . ”
Given everything we know about sloppy underwriting standards at the mortgage mills from the middle of this decade , it would n't surprise us at all to learn that a lot of crucial mortgage paperwork is just flat out missing .
This issue has been bubbling under the surface for awhile , as some homeowner advocates fight foreclosures on the grounds that the actual paperwork can't be produced .
How big is the problem ?
Bankruptcy lawyer R. Glen
Ayers recently gave a speech saying 1 /3rd of all mortgage backed securities may not be connected to a physical mortgage .
Sure , they 're producing cash flow now .
They 're connected to a household .
But if there were ever need for a foreclosure , it could be much harder than current holders assume .
Talk about toxic assets .

A copy of a classified Iranian government report about the U.S. war in Iraq in the possession of journalist Roxana Saberi was a key piece of evidence that led to her conviction on espionage charges , one of the Iranian American journalist ’s lawyers disclosed Monday .
But a letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calling for a careful review of the case helped secure her swift release Monday , another of her lawyers said , in an appellate court ruling that surprised Iran watchers and removed a stumbling block in the effort to improve U.S. - Iranian relations .
Iranian intelligence and security officials had argued fiercely for her imprisonment up to the last moment of her lengthy appeals court hearing Sunday , the second attorney said .
But the court slashed Saberi ’s sentence from eight years in prison to a suspended two - year term and ordered her released .
Saberi ’s parents and lawyers said she would be leaving Iran within days .
Advertisement
As the appellate court announced the ruling , the 32 - year - old journalist wept .
“ I saw her tears of joy , and this was the best moment , ” said Abdul - Samad Khorramshahi , Saberi ’s lead attorney .
Analysts say Saberi ’s case carries implications for the Obama administration as it seeks to improve relations with Tehran and resolve long - standing grievances over Iran ’s nuclear program and support for militant anti-Israeli organizations .
Saberi ’s arrest demonstrated the unpredictability of Iran ’s fragmented , multilayered political and security system , where dissidents , politicians and journalists are sometimes arrested for transgressing undefined ideological and national security rules , such as by having contact with the West .
But Saberi ’s release also showed a system capable of flexibility , pragmatism and even damage control .
Calls by some senior Iranian officials to review the case suggest that at least some of them were well aware of the harm Saberi ’s continued imprisonment was doing to the country ’s image and opted to do away with the distraction rather than satisfy hard - liners .

“ If we assume that this was due to infighting in the government between those who wanted to undermine diplomacy and those who want to give it a chance , I would conclude that the latter group has been able to succeed in a rather swift and impressive way , ” said Trita Parsi , president of the Washington - based National Iranian American Council and author of “ Treacherous Alliances , ” about relations between Iran , the United States and Israel .
“ The amount of political will and maneuvering it takes to reduce an eight - year sentence to two years and then commute the last two years and release her on the spot is far greater than having a one - day kangaroo court and sentencing her in the first place , ” he said .
Even Stephane Lherbier , a French sailor arrested after straying into Iranian waters and initially accused of espionage , served 15 months in prison on a maritime trespassing charge .
Saberi faced far graver accusations and more formidable adversaries .
After weeks in isolation and continuous interrogation inside Tehran ’s Evin Prison , she was hustled into a courtroom April 14 and convicted of espionage in a trial that lasted less than an hour .
Authorities said she confessed to passing on intelligence to the United States .

Through her lawyer , Saberi quickly recanted , insisting her confession was made under duress .
Khorramshahi filed an appeal .
Saberi quickly became an international cause celebre .
Portraits of the daughter of a Japanese - born mother and Iranian - born father stared out from newspapers and websites around the world .
A distorted but compelling narrative of menacing mullahs locking up a former beauty queen inspired online petition drives and Facebook pages .
But forces continued to work behind the scenes to thwart attempts to release Saberi .
High - profile human rights attorneys say they were barred from joining her defense .
A prosecutor and two Intelligence Ministry officials squared off against Saberi , Khorramshahi and co-counsel Saleh Nikbakht before a two - judge appellate panel Sunday .
Advertisement
The prosecutor accused Saberi of passing on to American officials a classified Iranian report about U.S. involvement in Iraq that she obtained while working at the Strategic Studies Center of Iran ’s Expediency Council , a powerful board of clerics that mediates government disputes , Nikbakht said .
She was also accused of visiting Israel four or five times , considered a crime for Iranian nationals , and accused of having sexual relations with Iranian officials .
Saberi apologized for possessing the think tank document ; she denied having any intimate relations with Iranian officials and said she made two visits to Israel to look for journalism work , Nikbakht said .
Her lawyers produced court rulings and official statements to argue that the United States was not a hostile state like Israel and that simply having contact with American officials did not prove Saberi was passing on information , Nikbakht said .
Advertisement
On Monday , the appeals court announced that it had suspended Saberi ’s sentence and banned her from practicing journalism in Iran for five years , releasing her immediately from prison .
Khorramshahi told the Islamic Republic News Agency that Ahmadinejad ’s letter helped secure Saberi ’s release .
Ali Reza Jamshidi , the spokesman for Iran ’s judiciary , told state television that a judicial review found that Saberi had been sentenced too harshly in the first place and was being let out of jail quickly because she was a first - time offender .
Lawyers and officials said the judges also accepted the defense argument that the U.S. was n’t a hostile state .
Advertisement
“ For different reasons , ” Jamshidi said , “ including her cooperation , the fact that she has expressed regret and also the fact that this was the first time she committed an offense and because of the Islamic principles of compassion and mercy , the overall verdict of the judges was that she deserves to receive a suspended jail sentence . ”

And the Race Is Off
Kathleen Sebelius may be saying that she is not going to enter the Kansas race , but she is still adding to this year ’s saga of women running for the U.S. Senate .
One in five people admitted to peeing in a swimming pool , in a recent poll of Americans .
In fact , the survey conducted by the Water Quality and Health Council found that almost half ( 47 percent ) of the subjects admitted to one or more behaviors that contribute to an unhealthy pool .
Here are some of the survey 's other findings :
About one - third ( 35 percent ) say they do n't shower before entering the pool .
63 percent were unaware of illnesses associated with swallowing , breathing or having contact with contaminated pool water .
Less than one quarter consider the frequency of pool cleaning and chemical treatment ( 23 percent ) and even less ( 16 percent ) think about chlorine levels to maintain clean pool water .
" Swimming is a fun and healthy activity for old and young alike .
Proper water chlorination helps protect swimmers from germs that can make swimmers sick , " said Michele Hlavsa , an epidemiologist in the Division of Parasitic Diseases for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
" But swimmers also have role to play in maintaining a clean and healthy pool .
Unhygienic behavior brings germs into the pool and makes it harder for chlorine to do its job . ”
The survey was conducted online between April 30 to May 3 , 2009 , among a national sample of 1,000 U.S. adults , using the field services of TNS Omnibus .
Results were weighted to reflect the adult population based on U.S. Census figures , including age , gender , geographic region , household income and household size .
The margin of error for the study was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .
The Water Quality & Health Council is a body of independent scientific experts , health professionals and consumer advocates who serve as advisors to the Chlorine Chemistry Division of the American Chemistry Council , an industry trade association .
The CDC urges pool users to follow these six tips for healthy swimming :
Do n’t swim when you have diarrhea .
Do n’t swallow pool water .
Practice good hygiene .
Shower with soap before swimming and wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers .
Take your kids on bathroom breaks or check diapers often .
Change diapers in a bathroom or a diaper - changing area and not at poolside .
Wash your children thoroughly ( especially the rear end ) with soap and water before they go swimming .
Unclean water can lead to recreational water illnesses ( RWI ’s ) — diarrhea , respiratory illness , and ear and skin infections .
Children , pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems can suffer from more severe illness if infected .
According to the CDC , these illnesses are on the rise .
Between 2005 and 2006 , 78 outbreaks were reported in 31 states — the largest number of outbreaks ever in a two - year period .
Close to 4,500 people were affected .
To check that your public pool is properly chlorinated , the Water Quality and Health Council recommends the use of portable pool and spa testing strips , easily purchased at pool supply stores and discount retailers , in addition to trusting your basic senses .
" A smelly pool is a dirty pool , " said National Consumers League President Emeritus and Water Quality and Health Council Vice - Chair Linda Golodner .
" Look for water that 's clean , clear and blue .
Check for tiles that feel smooth and clean .
Make sure there are no strong odors .
Listen for pool cleaning equipment .
Using your senses help you recognize the difference between a healthy pool and one that needs cleaning and treatment . "
Wanda Sykes was the featured comic at the White House Correspondents Dinner and she had some choice words for Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh .
Sykes brought up the fact that Hannity has not lived up to his waterboarding pledge and joked that Limbaugh was the 20th hijacker on 9/11 .
“ Sean Hannity said that he was going to get waterboarded for charity for our armed forces .
He has n’t done it yet I see .
Talking about he can take a waterboarding , please , ok you might be able to get waterboarded by somebody he knows and trusts , but let somebody from Pakistan waterboard him , or let Keith Olbermann waterboard him .
He ca n’t take a waterboarding .
I can break Sean Hannity by giving him a middle seat in coach . ”

Iceland ’s centre - left coalition has swept to power for the first time in the country ’s 65 - year history .
For the jubilant Social Democrat leader Johanna Sigurdardottir the result is confirmation that most people want Iceland to become an EU member .
“ This tells us that people want our vision for the future , our plan for the way into the European Union and the adoption of the Euro , ” she said .
However , her new centre - left coalition government will have to overcome disagreements about entering the EU and cutting spending and raising revenue to get state finances back in order .
The scenes of celebration were a stark contrast to the atmosphere at the Independence Party headquarters .
Its leader said they were paying the price for the global economic downturn .
The election was called after widespread protests against the previous government .
Some blamed it for the crisis that caused the economy to implode as banks collapsed under a weight of massive debts .
Sigurdardottir is Iceland ’s first female prime minister and the world ’s first openly gay leader .

Wikileaks has posted additional original ACTA documents , including draft language for several sections of the treaty .
The leaked documents are consistent with earlier reports on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Chapter .
The leak package also includes the Canadian non-paper on institutional arrangements for ACTA ( Canada has since supplied draft treaty language that has not been leaked ) .
The one document this is completely new is the release of the non-paper on International Enforcement Cooperation and Enforcement Practices , which would form Chapters 3 and 4 of ACTA .
The basis for discussion for the International Enforcement Cooperation ( Chapter 3 ) are :
Affirm the importance of international cooperation in the context of IPR enforcement , including the investigation and prosecution of international IPR crimes regardless of the location of the right holder or the origin of the infringing goods .
Improve coordination of anti-counterfeiting and anti-piracy strategies , including fostering closer cooperation among their respective enforcement officials , through practices such as : shared risk analysis , exchange of best practices , and exchange of relevant information for use in enforcement actions , where appropriate .
Providing for an effective exchange of information and evidence related to IPR crimes between their law enforcement agencies .
This enforcement cooperation should be done in a manner that is appropriate with the factual circumstances and consistent with existing international agreements .
Providing capacity building and technical assistance in improving IPR enforcement , both for developing country parties to the ACTA and for third countries .
These initiatives could be undertaken through , or in conjunction with , the private sector or relevant international organizations .
Working closely with developing country partners to strengthen their domestic legislation , and assisting them improving their national anti-counterfeiting , anti-piracy , and enforcement capacities through sharing IPR enforcement best practices and relevant technical assistance .
The basis for discussion for the Enforcement Practices ( Chapter 4 ) are :
Domestic Coordination
Promoting internal coordination and joint action , where appropriate , among its government agencies concerned with IPR enforcement through coordination bodies or other relevant mechanisms .
Maintaining formal or informal mechanisms for consulting with rights holders and other relevant stakeholders to promote more effective IPR action .
IPR Enforcement Expertise
Developing expertise within domestic law enforcement structures to ensure effective handling of IPR matters .
One way of doing this would be maintaining specialized authorities for the investigation and prosecution of IPR infringement cases .
Public Awareness
Undertaking measures designed to raise awareness among government officials and the public regarding the importance of protecting IPR ( ie . the problems associated with IPR infringement , such as health risks , economic damage , and other detrimental effects ) .
Risk Management Techniques
Adoping and sharing practices that assist in better identifying and targeting for inspection shipments that contain counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods .
Such activities could include :
a. consultations with relevant stakeholders and competent authorities responsible for IPR enforcement to identify and address risks ;
b. exchanging available data with other Parties regarding significant customs seizures of counterfeit and pirated goods wherever possible , including international networks ;
c. sharing information with other Parties on approaches that are developed to provide greater effectiveness in targeting shipments that could contain counterfeit and pirated goods ;
d. providing that its competent authorities may conduct post - entry examinations of business records , methods of payment , purchasing contracts , and importers ' internal controls to track illicit financial gains and expose business practices related to trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy .
Publication of Enforcement Procedures and Practices
Identify publicly competent authorities for IPR enforcement and contact points for assistance to right holders .
Providing that relevant laws , regulations , procedures , final judicial decisions and general administrative rulings pertaining to IPR enforcement are in writing .
The judicial decisions and administrative should state the relevant findings of fact and the reasoning or the legal basis on which the decisions and rulings are based and should be published or made available to the public ( e.g. , through the Internet ) .
Publicizing information on its efforts to provide effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in its civil , administrative , and criminal systems , including any statistical information that the Party may collect for such purposes .
IPR Enforcement Information Sharing
An ACTA Party 's sharing of information related to the IPR enforcement with the public is without prejudice to the need to protect investigative techniques , confidential law enforcement information , and privacy rights .
We are DINK ’s ( Dual Income No Kids ) .
Many years ago we made the decision not to have kids .
That decision did n’t have anything to do with money .
On the contrary , we could have afforded kids quite easily .
We just did n’t want kids .
I ’m the sort of person who likes to visit with my nieces and nephews and then send them home .
I do n’t have the sort of temperament that lends itself to having kids .
I like things just so and I like doing what I want with my time without having to worry about a child .
My husband is much the same way .
Of course in a society that values children to an extreme at times , our choice is often unpopular .
We ’ve been accused of being selfish ; denying a child the benefit of being raised in a comfortable home .
But I ’ve always thought it was the opposite .
It would be more selfish to have a child that I do n’t want to deal with just to satisfy some societal norm than it is to know I do n’t want kids and act confidently on that knowledge .
Now that we ’re many years down the road from that decision , I look back and I realize that part of our ability to remain debt free stems from our decision to forego children .
If we had had children , I think we still would have remained debt free because that is our priority and we ’re very frugal by nature .
We would have found a way to make it work .
Likely we would have forgone a lot of vacations and bought quite a few hand me downs .
I probably would have stayed home to avoid child care expenses .
There would have been far fewer meals out and our kids would certainly have gone to public school or been home - schooled .
They would most certainly not have been spoiled and had the latest of everything .
We ’re just not wired that way .
We would have enjoyed a good standard of living , but certainly without many luxuries .
Our parents did it ; I ’m confident we would have made it , too .
However , not having children does make it much easier to stay out of debt .
When one of us loses a job , we only have ourselves to worry about .
When creating an emergency fund , we only have to worry about each other , not what can go wrong with several children .
Our expenses in every category are less without kids ( except maybe housing as we would have this house with or without kids ) .
We do n’t have college educations to save for so we are able to put away more for our retirement or other big purchases .
Our incomes only have to cover us , not educational expenses , childcare , extra insurance , additional medical bills , lots of clothes , and additional food .
I know friends who have kids that have remained debt free so I know it is possible .
They do a wonderful job of balancing the needs of their children with the household needs and saying , “ No ” when the budget does not allow for extras .
But I do know that it is harder for them than for us .
They say no a lot more often than we do .
And while they have remained debt free , they have not been able to save as much as we have .
They have very little in their retirement accounts and a modest emergency fund that would only last two months .
It is harder for them and I am aware , when I visit with them , that remaining debt free would have been much harder for us if we had kids .
As I said , we did n’t decide to skip kids because of money .
But there is no doubt that remaining debt free has been much easier without that burden .
People often remark , “ Oh , well , you do n’t have kids so it ’s no wonder you do n’t have debt , ” as if kids are an automatic free pass to rack up the debt .
And I do n’t deny that not having kids makes it easier .
But everything about personal finance comes down to your choices in life .
Those of us who choose not to have kids sometimes reap the financial benefits .
But there are plenty who do have kids and remain debt free , albeit with a lot more effort .
I know other DINK ’s who are in debt up to their necks , so being child free does not confer an automatic debt free life , either .
It ’s about the choices you make and the priority you place on remaining debt free .
I would n’t recommend basing the decision to have kids or not solely on your desire to remain debt free .
Kids are about a lot more than money .
But there is no denying that it is much easier without kids .
It ’s yet one more choice and factor that has to be considered when planning your financial future .

The good news :
New research is giving scientists a better handle on when the big one might strike the Pacific Coast .
The bad news :
It probably will be sooner than we thought .
" The amount of devastation is going to be unbelievable , " says Rob Witter , coastal geologist with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries .
" People are n't going to be ready for this .
Even if they are prepared , they are going to be surprised by the level of devastation . "
Witter spoke last week about the latest in earthquake and tsunami studies -- it 's Earthquake and Tsunami Awareness Month -- as part of state and local efforts to educate the public on preparing for a megaquake of magnitude 9 or more .
Witter and James Roddey , spokesman for the state agency , also will give a public talk Tuesday in Newport .
Earthquakes on the West Coast : Are Portland and Seattle prepared for a Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake and tsunami ?
2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami news
Tuesday talk
What : Rob Witter and James Roddey from the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries will explore Native American legends , new geologic discoveries and an earthquake detective story .
When : 6 p.m. Tuesday
Where : Newport City Hall Council Chambers , 169 S.W. Coast Highway
How to prepare for the big one
Discuss :
Sit down with your family and put together an emergency plan .
Find information at www.ready.gov
Build :
Put together an emergency kit with nonperishable food , water , medical supplies , extra prescriptions , warm clothing and provisions if you need to leave your home .
Arrange an out - of - state contact for everyone in case family members are separated .
Know :
If you 're on the coast , know where high ground is from home and places you frequent .
Drop , cover and hold : Practice dropping under a sturdy desk or table and hanging on ; during a quake , you 'll be less likely to be hurt by falling objects .
If you can't get to furniture , go to a corner away from windows and cover your head .

Witter says scientists are now in wide agreement that there 's a 10 to 14 percent chance a powerful earthquake and tsunami will strike the Oregon coast in the next 50 years .
Why do they think that ?
The latest findings come from Chris Goldfinger , director of the Active Tectonics and Seafloor Mapping Lab at Oregon State University , Roddey says .
But to understand Goldfinger 's work , Roddey goes back to what he calls " one of the great scientific detective stories of the 20th century . "
Twenty - five years ago , scientists did n't think the Cascadia subduction zone -- a place 50 to 75 miles off Oregon where two of the Earth 's plates meet , one sliding under the other -- could produce earthquakes .
That changed after Brian Atwater , a renowned geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey , began in the mid-1980s to study earthquakes , eventually tracing a theory all the way to Japan , Roddey says .
Atwater studied a " ghost forest " -- dead trees in a tidal marsh -- by the Copalis River in Washington , and theorized that a megaquake had killed the cedars .
But he needed more evidence .
That came when Japanese researchers published a paper in 1996 about a tsunami that struck Japan on Jan. 27 , 1700 .
Atwater was so intrigued that he learned the language and traveled to Japan .
In 2003 , he and a team of Japanese researchers published the book " The Orphan Tsunami " about their theory that the last megaquake struck the Oregon coast Jan. 26 , 1700 , spawning the tsunami that washed over Japan hours later .
" This was the final puzzle piece that convinced everyone we had the potential for great earthquakes , " Roddey says .
Work to understand just how great has gone on ever since .
Enter Goldfinger , the OSU researcher .
" Chris has been able to go back 10,000 years , and by studying offshore landslides , he found that we 've had about 20 of these magnitude9 - plus subduction zone earthquakes where the whole 600 - mile - long fault ruptures , " Roddey says .
Then he found 18 other quakes magnitude8 to 8.5 in the southern part of the subduction zone .
" So instead of 20 subduction zone earthquakes , we 're up to 38 , " Roddey says .
And , Witter says , instead of thinking giant quakes occur every 500 years , Goldfinger 's work puts the cycle at 300 to 350 years .
" We 've almost doubled the probability of these events happening , " Roddey says .
" It just gives a whole lot more urgency to educate the folks at the coast that , ' Hey , you got to get ready . ' "
Native Americans , Roddey says , have known this for centuries .
Inhabiting the coast for 10,000 years , they passed stories of big quakes from generation to generation .
" They created a cultural tradition by retelling these events and legends , " Roddey says .
" We see that around the world .
When the Sumatra earthquake struck ( the Indian Ocean ) , the Andaman Islands were right in the middle of the rupture zone .
There was huge ground shaking , but very few people died from the tsunami because they had also created this culture of awareness .
They went to high ground .
They survived the event . "
Though the Sumatra and Cascadia subduction zones differ , Witter says , a tsunami here would be much the same .
" The geology and numerical models predict tsunamis could reach as high as 80 to 100 feet in Oregon , which is similar to the tsunami that struck Sumatra , " Witter says .
" We need to be very cautious and prepare for that event .
It may not happen in a person 's lifetime , but if it does , it 's going to be equivalent to a Katrina - like event . "
That does n't mean we need to live in fear , though .
" Once you get prepared and you know where high ground is , once you 've talked to your family about an emergency plan and talked about all those kinds of things , you 've done your homework .
You do n't have to think about it again . "

Two crews for 44 Blue Productions hope to be on board Navy vessels patrolling in the pirate - infested waters off the coast of Africa within two weeks .
The company is aiming to have a series ready to put on the air by September , said Rasha Drachkovitch , 44 Blue 's president and founder .
10 Winning Science Fair Projects That Will Make You Feel Dumb
As beleaguered parents all over the country endeavor to prod their kids to finish their requisite science fair projects , some may find it helpful to provide some inspiration from past winners of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair .
These are not your basic tabletop volcanoes or series of potted sunflowers .
Many sport titles that you 'd expect to see gracing the pages of the most prestigious scientific journals , and some of them actually have .
Others became inventions developed for use in the wider world while their inventors were still in high school .
Each and every one of these projects won their teenage researchers big prizes and hefty scholarships to ensure their future success .
1 . The Sign Translator
Image credit : Patterson
One of the ISEF 2001 winners invented something so completely cool that he bowled over the competition to win a total of more than $ 200,000 in cash prizes and scholarships .
The idea came to then 17 - year old Ryan Randall Patterson of Grand Junction , Colorado , over an order of burger and fries at a fast food restaurant .
The customers were deaf and needed an interpretor to get their order right , so Ryan decided to develop a method to make it easier for the hearing impaired to communicate with regular people .
It 's a glove that translates American Sign Language into large , easy to read letters on a computer screen .
This is a kid who carried around an electrical cord instead of a security blanket as a toddler , and requested extension cords from Santa .
He helped his dad rewire an extension to their house when he was 6 , and managed to live through a bad experiment once when he stuck a screwdriver into an outlet .
Ouch !
Does n't seem to have hurt his brain much , though .
2 . Prototype for Autonomy : Pathway for the Blind
Image credit : Abdulrasool Sometimes the most far - reaching discoveries come about by putting already available technologies to new uses .
One big prizewinner in the 2005 ISEF fair in Phoenix did just that .
18 - year old Ammem Abdulrasool , a senior at the Illinois Junior Academy of Science , developed over three years a way to allow the visually impaired to navigate themselves by using the Global Positioning System .
Inspired by his love for his father , who is visually impaired , Ammem set out to find a way to help and ended up not just winning the big prizes at ISEF , but being named an official Science Hero .
He describes his invention , said to be one of the biggest innovations for the blind since the invention of Braille , as " an ' On - Star ' system at the handheld level for the blind . "
Abdulrasool planned to major in business administration at the University of Illinois , Urbana Champaign .
3 . Brain - Computer Interface for the Muscularly Disabled

We older folks rely on our kids to do many computer things for us these days , so it 's not surprising that the ISEF fairs have a category for computer science .
In 2003 's fair 16 - year old Elena Leah Glassman from Central Bucks High School West in Doylestown , Pennsylvania took top awards for developing an algorithm that allows people with muscular disabilities to use computers with the help of electro - encephalographic signals .
The algorithm interprets signals from the brain when a person thinks about a task .
For interpreting which keys on a keyboard these wavelets are signaling , Glassman achieved 90 percent accuracy using EEG wavelets she found in the public domain .
When putting that to use with electrodes on her own scalp and interpreting the specific wavelets for particular keys , she managed over 70 percent accuracy .
This informed her that in real life applications the software had to be customized to each user .
Impressive !
4 . An Experiment to Determine the Agent / Mechanism Causing the Passivity of Iron in Aerated Distilled Water
Image Credit : Nyberg Michael Nyberg of Old Lyme , Connecticut took top awards in the 2001 ISEF fair with this experiment that explained why iron does n't rust in super - oxygenated water .
That might not sound too spectacular , except that the concept had specific applications that Michael and his father started a company to develop - controlling mosquitoes without the use of insecticides !
They called it the " Larvasonic " and it works by introducing sonic waves into standing water to kill mosquito larvae before they mature and fly away to spread diseases and cause pesky bites .
Even at low frequencies the waves rupture an air bladder just below the head of the larva .
Because the frequency is so specific , it does not harm fish or other species living in the body of water .
5 . Engineering of a Novel Inhibitor of Biofilm - Encapsulated Pathogens
Image Credit : Mahdavi
In the 2006 ISEF fair in Indianapolis , 16 - year old Mahdavi Gavini blew everybody away when she managed to achieve a significant medical research breakthrough while searching for a way to help a friend who suffered from cystic fibrosis .
She began the project when she was just 14 , having found that most CF sufferers die of pseudomonas infections .
These opportunistic pathogens form a thick , protective layer around themselves so that it 's nearly impossible for antibiotics to penetrate .
This student at the Mississippi Institute of Mathematics and Science turned to traditional Ayurvedic medicine to find a way to defeat these deadly bacteria .
Eventually she isolated a specific molecule in a tropical plant extract that inhibited its growth by preventing the transcription of vital genes .
Rather than patenting her discovery , she made the information readily available and plans to seek many more alternative cures in the future .
6 . Determining Carbon Nanotubes ' Thermodynamic Solubility : The Missing Link to a Practical Supermaterial ?
Image credit : Philip Streich
This big winner of $ 70,000 in prizes and scholarships at the 2007 ISEF fair in Albequerque was Sweet 16 at the time .
Philip Streich spent his usual days tending animals on his family 's farm near Platteville , Wisconsin , where he was home schooled by his parents .
He had not at the time decided if he wanted a career in science , but had already racked up college credits , and was a member of the U.S. Physics Team .
Oh ... and MIT 's Lincoln Laboratory named a minor planet after him , as they do for all first and second place category winners .
Streich has a way of explaining his interest in nanotubes that communicates well why this material might capture the imagination of future scientists like your offspring .
Just think of a nanotube as a long , thin pipe made of carbon atoms that have " super- properties . "
Possible applications ?
A bridge to the moon , a super - cool stealth fighter , or maybe just a very light and sturdy frame for a racing bike .
7 . Petrology , Morphology , and Geochemistry of the Southern Juan de Fuca Ridge : Evidence for Off - Axis Volcanism
Image Credit : Langberg
A student at the Canterbury School in Fort Myers , Florida , Sarah Rose Langberg won the big money prizes , some special awards and government prizes in the 2004 ISEF competition with research that put many masters ' theses to shame .
Sarah 's hard work included chemical investigations , a mathematical simulation , and poring over video of the ocean floor to accurately characterize one of the earth 's most active volcanic regions .
She became a Merit - based Scholarship winner at her school as a freshman , went on to become Florida 's National Honor Society vice president in her senior year , and was her class valedictorian .
This is one high school student research project that really did make it into the scholarly scientific press - she presented her research at the National Society of Exploration Geophysicists Convention in Denver in 2004 , and her paper was published in the journal The Leading Edge .
8 . Nanoconstruction with Self - Assembling DNA - PNA Complexes
Image credit : Mittal Alexander C. Mittal , a 17 - year old from Greenwich High School in Greenwich , Connecticut , took top honors in the 2002 ISEF fair with this head - spinning entry in the chemistry category .
His project examined the use of peptide nucleic acid [ PNA ] in combination with DNA to create some unique double - crossover structures that could serve as scaffolding upon which to create molecular size electronic circuits .
Mittal learned from cancer research that the artificial PNA molecule was extremely stable , and hypothesized that a dual DNA - PNA architecture could form a stable structure to be used in electronic arrays .
So he designed and produced a totally new , stable PNA - DNA molecule to demonstrate his hypothesis .
When he was n't being a high school chemical engineering genius , Alexander was a Red Cross volunteer , captain of the school 's cross country team and co-editor of the school newspaper .
His dream ?
To be one of the first astronauts on Mars .
9 . Mechanisms of the Photoisomerization of Conjugated Dienes as a Model for the Primary Visual Event
Image Credit : Jouei Now , that 's a mouthful !
Nazanin Jouei of Ely High School in Pompano Beach , Florida was interested in the chemistry of sight , and developed her own theory to mathematically explain energy changes affecting the configuration of molecules related to our sense of sight .
The chemical change she found in her experiment was subtle , but well documented .
In case there is some confusion , a diene is a molecule with two double bonds .
A conjugated deine is a hydrocarbon molecule with double bonds separated by a single bond .
These form the most stable hydrocarbon molecules .
Photoisomerization is when light excites the molecules and causes an structural change in the molecule even though its atoms remain the same .
Jouei hypothesized that it was this conformational change in certain molecules in the retina of the eye that produce the sense of sight .
10 . Computation of the Alexander - Conway Polynomial on the Chord Diagrams of Singular Knots
Image : YouTube , Raoof 's presentation
In the category of mathematics , 17 - year old Sana Raoof of Jericho High School in Jericho , New York produced this mind - bender to win the Intel Foundation Young Scientist Award and $ 50,000 scholarship in the 2008 fair in Atlanta .
She chose Harvard , which no doubt feels privileged to have won the bidding for this brilliant young mathematician .
Just in case you are having trouble recalling exactly what chord diagrams and singular knots are all about - having perhaps missed that particular sub- chapter in your high school math class - Greg Muller offers a passable introduction at his blog The Everything Seminar to refresh your memory .
Basically , knot theory is about solving simple problems with advanced techniques .
For those of us who do n't like doing things the easy way ...

Elizabeth McKee Gore is director of Nothing But Nets , one of the most successful campaigns to distribute insecticide - treated bed nets to malaria - endemic countries .
The global Roll Back Malaria Partnership estimates that 700 million insecticide - treated bed nets will have to be distributed by 2010 to remain on target for the goal of nearly eliminating malaria by 2015 .
More than half of those nets must be distributed in Africa , where most malaria deaths occur .
Nothing But Nets , based in the United States , uses an integrated approach to distribution , relying on existing networks , such as inoculation campaigns , non-governmental organizations , faith - based communities , health workers and others to ensure nets are delivered to even the most remote villages and that they are consistently and properly used .
So far , Nothing But Nets has distributed nearly 2.5 million bed nets .
Gore recently talked to AllAfrica about how Nothing But Nets came about .
About five years ago what we really needed was larger U.S. government funding for malaria and we needed the rest of the world to start paying attention .
The Aids community in the United States is amazing in terms of advocacy and ensuring proper funding but there 's no malaria community .
So we started thinking at the United Nations Foundation that we 've got to build a public campaign for malaria so people will start supporting it .
Nets seemed like a really interesting entry point and a hook for the public to get behind .
And it 's such a small price for an American – to think of a 10 - dollar donation as literally saving someone 's life .
So we decided to start fundraising for the nets publicly and we were hoping to leverage that into bigger U.S. dollars and start building this constituency .
It was going along okay , not great , but then we got a phone call from Rick Reilly , a writer for Sports Illustrated magazine , who has a huge following .
He called and said , " I just saw this documentary on malaria and I am blown away by it .
In sports we have nothing but nets – even a sports fan can figure it out . "
So , we asked him to write a column about it .
He had not been to Africa .
He just really liked the solution around the net .
So he wrote a column called " Nothing But Nets . "
Nothing but net is a basketball term when you swish a basketball .
It was also used in a McDonald 's commercial .
[ With the column ] he did what the entire UN probably could n't have done and pulled a huge issue down to a 30 - second sound bite , down to 800 words in a column .
He said , if you 've ever scored a goal in soccer , if you 've ever dunked in a basketball net , if you like cheerleaders in fishnets , donate 10 dollars , do it now .
And 1.2 million dollars were raised in four weeks from that article .
It almost crashed our server .
We had to hire temps to man the phones .
The amount of mail that came in was just unbelievable .
And the bigger thing was 18,000 people responded , which in a community , on an issue where you do n't have a following , is pretty huge .
It evolved into the Nothing But Nets campaign and Rick said why not get the sports groups involved .
NBA [ National Basketball Association ]
Cares were immediately in .
They just loved it .
But then we really needed an organizational partner .
We had already been talking to the Methodists a little bit about malaria and so I approached them again .
They came on board , which was huge for us because if you think there are 12 million Methodists worldwide and they agreed to communicate this , suddenly we have this enormous audience .
So those were the pinnacle partners that got us kicked off .
We had the public launch in January 2007 and we took Rick to Nigeria to see where his nets had gone .
And instead of asking the public again we thanked the public .
So he published this article " Nothing But Thanks , " which garnered double the amount of donations and that 's how we broadened out the campaign .
We boiled this whole issue down to Malaria Kills , Send a Net , Save a Life .
Donate 10 dollars .
The UN Foundation pays the cost of the campaign so that 10 dollars is the full contribution .
There 's no overhead taken out , which is important to people at that price point .
Then we just kept bringing in new partners .
Major League Soccer came on board , the WNBA [ Women 's National Basketball Association ]
Cares came on board , the Lutherans , the Union for Reform Judaism .
These partnerships are what created the now 100,000 registered people involved in malaria .
Who would have thought ?
We could n't get three people in a room to talk about malaria and now we have 100,000 registered people .
We think that through all of our partners that Nothing But Nets touches about 25 million people .
We take the marketing very seriously but we also take the distribution very seriously .
We continue to follow this money all the way to the ground .
We go as often as we can to communicate back to the donors : this is how your money is being used , this is what 's happening , this is how the mortality rates have dropped .
So half of our job is reporting back , which I think people love because you 're not just contributing to malaria , you 're learning about Africa , you 're learning about the UN , you 're learning about these awesome kids that we 're working with .

The youth have become the power of this campaign , which was not the original goal .
We have an eight - year - old in Pennsylvania who just hit 100 thousand dollars .
They 're just amazing , they 're our celebrities and they surprise us every day .
These kids are educating us on the new wave of philanthropy and a new way of getting involved .
It 's not just raising money .
While that 's important , it 's the whole awareness around this issue .
We need everybody and most of all we need our peers in Africa to lead this and they are .
We are supporting them and they are leading the way .
These nets only go where they say they should go and I think this has been incredibly effective because they 're our partners .
We are encouraging everyone to go out and do their own Nothing But Nets campaign , whether they 're hosting a bake sale or a basketball tournament , or just educating the public through their own press release in their local town or at their school to get involved .
They can actually populate our Google map on nothingbutnets .
net and show the rest of the world what they 're doing in honor of World Malaria Day .
Uncontroversial , though some , such as Silvio Berlusconi of Italy , would prefer policy to be run by the smaller G8 ( currently chaired by Mr Berlusconi ) .
2 . We face the greatest challenge to the world economy in modern times ; a crisis which has deepened since we last met , which affects the lives of women , men , and children in every country , and which all countries must join together to resolve .
A global crisis requires a global solution .
Again , unarguable .
The latest authoritative forecast , from the OECD , points to a global economic contraction of 2.7 per cent in 2009 , the worst since the Second World War .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
3 . We start from the belief that prosperity is indivisible ; that growth , to be sustained , has to be shared ; and that our global plan for recovery must have at its heart the needs and jobs of hard - working families , not just in developed countries but in emerging markets and the poorest countries of the world too ; and must reflect the interests , not just of today 's population , but of future generations too .
We believe that the only sure foundation for sustainable globalisation and rising prosperity for all is an open world economy based on market principles , effective regulation , and strong global institutions .
Correct , as far as it goes .
No country can easily pursue fiscal expansion on its own , and globalised financial institutions suggest some globalised oversight .
4 . We have today therefore pledged to do whatever is necessary to :
• restore confidence , growth , and jobs ;
• repair the financial system to restore lending ;
• strengthen financial regulation to rebuild trust ;
• fund and reform our international financial institutions to overcome this crisis and prevent future ones ;
• promote global trade and investment and reject protectionism , to underpin prosperity ; and
• build an inclusive , green , and sustainable recovery .
By acting together to fulfil these pledges we will bring the world economy out of recession and prevent a crisis like this from recurring in the future .
" To do whatever is necessary " includes doing little or nothing if you think action is not needed .
5 . The agreements we have reached today , to treble resources available to the IMF to $ 750bn , to support a new SDR allocation of $ 250bn , to support at least $ 100bn of additional lending by the MDBs , to ensure $ 250bn of support for trade finance , and to use the additional resources from agreed IMF gold sales for concessional finance for the poorest countries , constitute an additional $ 1.1 trillion programme of support to restore credit , growth and jobs in the world economy .
Together with the measures we have each taken nationally , this constitutes a global plan for recovery on an unprecedented scale .
The single concrete result of the summit .
Recapitalising the IMF is a genuinely valuable move , reassuring the world that vulnerable nations will not be allowed to go bust .
There is also much more money available to fund international trade .
The IMF will be encouraged to create more of its own money – so - called " special drawing rights " .
That in turn means a global creation of money in the same way the Bank of England and the US Fed are attempting " quantitative easing " .
China may see a bigger role in the IMF .
A fine success that Mr Brown has been working towards for a decade but , arguably , that could have been done through normal channels .
6 . We are undertaking an unprecedented and concerted fiscal expansion , which will save or create millions of jobs which would otherwise have been destroyed , and that will , by the end of next year , amount to $ 5 trillion , raise output by 4 per cent , and accelerate the transition to a green economy .
We are committed to deliver the scale of sustained fiscal effort necessary to restore growth .

This sounds a lot , but much of it is spent .
Glaringly , there is no commitment to , say , the IMF goal that all nations commit to a further fiscal boost of 2 per cent of GDP – about $ 3 trillion .
Germany won this fight but the US will resent that its tax dollars will be used to buy German goods with no reciprocal gesture .
9 . Taken together , these actions will constitute the largest fiscal and monetary stimulus and the most comprehensive support programme for the financial sector in modern times .
Acting together strengthens the impact and the exceptional policy actions announced so far must be implemented without delay .
Today , we have further agreed over $ 1 trillion of additional resources for the world economy through our international financial institutions and trade finance .
Every advanced economy has boosted spending and cut interest rates like never before , showing they will not repeat the policy mistakes of the 1930s that gave us the Great Depression .
11 . We are resolved to ensure long - term fiscal sustainability and price stability and will put in place credible exit strategies from the measures that need to be taken now to support the financial sector and restore global demand .
We are convinced that by implementing our agreed policies we will limit the longer - term costs to our economies , thereby reducing the scale of the fiscal consolidation necessary over the longer term .
Most nations have " exit strategies " – tax rises and spending cuts – to reduce budget deficits , but few are credible .
If launched too soon they could halt a fledgling recovery .
13 . Major failures in the financial sector and in financial regulation and supervision were fundamental causes of the crisis .
Confidence will not be restored until we rebuild trust in our financial system .
We will take action to build a stronger , more globally consistent , supervisory and regulatory framework for the future financial sector , which will support sustainable global growth and serve the needs of business and citizens .
Major failures in the banking system did not help – but there are other causes , such as the vast trade deficit between China and the US that created the " great wall of money " which funded the credit boom and the banks ' misadventures .
This fundamental cause was hardly addressed properly , even in the sessions between presidents Obama and Hu Jintao .
Still , the G20 are asking the banks to own up to their " impaired assets " .
Again .
15 .
To this end we are implementing the Action Plan agreed at our last meeting , as set out in the attached progress report .
We have today also issued a Declaration , Strengthening the Financial System .
In particular we agree :
• to establish a new Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) with a strengthened mandate , as a successor to the Financial Stability Forum ( FSF ) , including all G20 countries , FSF members , Spain , and the European Commission ;
• to endorse and implement the FSF 's tough new principles on pay and compensation and to support sustainable compensation schemes and the corporate social responsibility of all firms .
The new Financial Stability Board could be seen as an embryonic global watchdog – or as another slow - moving collection of regulators .
The attack on " rewards for failure " comes straight from the court of world public opinion , although as usual there are few specifics .
Tax havens also come under attack but what the " sanctions " primed by the G20 will be remain to be seen .
20 .
We agree that the heads and senior leadership of the international financial institutions should be appointed through an open , transparent , and merit - based selection process .
The usual stitch - up whereby the head of the IMF is always European and the head of the World Bank American may come to an end – but when ?
They have been discussing this for years .
21 . We reaffirm the commitment made in Washington : to refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services , imposing new export restrictions , or implementing World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) inconsistent measures to stimulate exports .
In addition we will rectify promptly any such measures .
We extend this pledge to the end of 2010 .
The pledge was not to introduce new tariffs and quotas on trade .
The World Bank says that 17 of the G20 powers then went ahead and did precisely that .
Domestic political pressures to protect jobs are becoming irresistible .
25 .
We are determined not only to restore growth but to lay the foundation for a fair and sustainable world economy .
We recognise that the current crisis has a disproportionate impact on the vulnerable in the poorest countries and recognise our collective responsibility to mitigate the social impact of the crisis to minimise long - lasting damage to global potential .
To this end :
• we reaffirm our historic commitment to meeting the Millennium Development Goals and to achieving our respective ODA pledges , including commitments on Aid for Trade , debt relief , and the Gleneagles commitments , especially to sub-Saharan Africa .
World Bank president Robert Zoellick recognises that falling world trade will hit the poorest and smallest nations hardest .
Do the G20 want to see social unrest and immigration as a result of neglecting the " bottom billion " ?
27 .
We agreed to make the best possible use of investment funded by fiscal stimulus programmes towards the goal of building a resilient , sustainable , and green recovery .
We will make the transition towards clean , innovative , resource efficient , low carbon technologies and infrastructure .
We encourage the MDBs to contribute fully to the achievement of this objective .
We will identify and work together on further measures to build sustainable economies .
The Chinese will probably continue to build a power station a week , usually coal - powered .
More countries are likely to follow Obama 's lead in " greening growth " , however .
29 .
We have committed ourselves to work together with urgency and determination to translate these words into action .
We agreed to meet again before the end of this year to review progress on our commitments .
The circus arrives in Scotland in November .
Dear John — Having my life reduced to selling my punany on 82nd in order to make ends meet has made my rules of the road quite lenient , to say the least .
It 's okay to fuck me up the ass for an extra $ 20 , twist my nipples like you are turning on a goddamned radio station , and slobber all over and come on my tits .
But it is not okay to flag me down when you have your fucking infant strapped in a car seat in the back of your minivan .
I have had guys reach into a diaper bag to clean up splooge , and one guy even tried to use a breast pump bag for a condom .
Tacky , yes , but hey — who am I to judge ?
But it is never okay to hire a ho when you have your kid in the car .
Thanks for letting me know I have not reached the bottom of the food chain .

Quality is dead in computing .
Been dead a while , but like some tech ’d up version of Weekend at Bernie ’s , software purveyors are dressing up its corpse to make us believe computers can bring us joy and salvation .
You know it ’s dead , too , do n’t you ?
You long ago stopped expecting anything to just work on your desktop , right ?
Same here .
But the rot has really set in .
I feel as if my computer is crawling with maggots .
And now it feels that way even when I buy a fresh new computer .
My impression is that up to about ten years ago most companies were still trying , in good faith , to put out a good product .
But now many of them , especially the biggest ones , have completely given up .
One sign of this is the outsourcing trend .
Offshore companies , almost universally , are unwilling and unable to provide solid evidence of their expertise .
But that does n’t matter , because the managers offering them the work care for nothing but the hourly rate of the testers .
The ability of the testers to test means nothing .
In fact , bright inquisitive testers seem to be frowned upon as troublemakers .
This is my Quality is Dead hypothesis : a pleasing level of quality for end users has become too hard to achieve while demand for it has simultaneously evaporated and penalties for not achieving it are weak .
The entropy caused by mindboggling change and innovation in computing has reached a point where it is extremely expensive to use traditional development and testing methods to create reasonably good products and get a reasonable return on investment .
Meanwhile , user expectations of quality have been beaten out of them .
When I say quality is dead , I do n’t mean that it ’s dying , or that it ’s under threat .
What I mean is that we have collectively – and rationally – ceased to expect that software normally works well , even under normal conditions .
Furthermore , there is very little any one user can do about it .
( This explains how it is possible for Microsoft to release Vista with a straight face . )
I know of a major U.S. company , that recently laid off a group of more than a dozen trained , talented , and committed testers , instead outsourcing that work to a company in India that obviously does not know how to test ( judging from documents shown to me ) .
The management of this well - known American company never talked to their testers or test managers about this ( according to the test manager involved and the director above him , both of whom spoke with me ) .
Top management can’t know what they are giving up or what they are getting .
They simply want to spend less on testing .
When testing becomes just a symbolic ritual , any method of testing will work , as long as it looks impressive to ignorant people and does n’t cost too much .
( Exception : sometimes charging a lot for a fake service is a way to make it seem impressive . )
Please do n’t get me wrong .
Saving money is not a bad thing .
But there are ways to spend less on testing without eviscerating the quality of our work .
There are smart ways to outsource , too .
What I ’m talking about is that this management team obviously did n’t care .
They think they can get away with it .
And they can : because quality is dead .
I ’m also not saying that quality is dead because people in charge are bad people .
Instead what we have are systemic incentives that led us to this sorry state , much as did the incentives that resulted in favorable conditions for cholera and plague to sweep across Europe , in centuries past , or the conditions that resulted in the Great Fire of London .
It took great disasters to make them improve things .
Witness today how easily the financial managers of the world are evading their responsibility for bringing down the world economy .
It ’s a similar deal with computing .
Weak laws pertaining to quality , coupled with mass fatalism that computers are always going to be buggy , and mass acceptance of ritualistic development and testing practices make the world an unsafe place for users .
If we use computers , or deal with people who do , we are required to adapt to failure and frustration .
Our tools of “ productivity ” suck away our time and confidence .
We huddle in little groups on the technological terrain , subject to the whims and mercies of the technically elite .
This is true even for members of the technically elite– because being good in one technology does not mean you have much facility with the 5,000 other technologies out there .
Each of us is a helpless user , in some respect .
Want an illustration ?
Just look at my desktop :
Software installation is mysterious and fragile .
Can I look at any given product on my system and determine if it is properly installed and configured ?
No .
Old data and old bits of applications choke my system .
I no longer know for sure what can be thrown away , or where it is .
I seem to have three temp folders on my system .
What is in them ?
Why is it there ?
My task manager is littered with mysterious processes .
Going through , googling each one , and cleaning them up is a whole project in and of itself .
I once used the Autoruns tool to police my startup .
Under Vista , this has become a nightmare .
Looking at the Autoruns output is a little like walking into that famous warehouse in Indiana Jones .
Which of the buzillion processes are really needed at startup ?
Mysterious pauses , flickers , and glitches are numerous and ephemeral .
Investigating them saps too much time and energy .
I see a dozen or two “ Is it okay to run this process ? ” dialog boxes each day , but I never really know if it ’s okay .
How could I know ?
I click YES and hope for the best .
I click “ I Agree ” to EULAs that I rarely read .
What rights am I giving away ?
I have no idea .
I ’m not qualified to understand most of what ’s in those contracts , except they generally disclaim responsibility for quality .
Peripherals with proprietary drivers and formats do n’t play well with each other .
Upgrading to a new computer is now a task comparable with uprooting and moving to a new city .
I ’m sick of becoming a power user of each new software package .
I want to use my time in other ways , so I remain in a state of ongoing confusion .
I am at the mercy of confused computers and their servant who work for credit agencies , utility companies and the government .
I have to accept that my personal data will probably be stolen from one of the many companies I do business with online .
Proliferating online activity now results in far flung and sometimes forgotten pockets of data about me , clinging like Spanish Moss on the limbs of the Web .
Continuous , low grade confusion and irritation , occasionally spiking to impotent rage , is the daily experience of the technically savvy knowledge worker .
I shudder to think what it must be like for computerphobes .
Let me give you one of many examples of what I ’m talking about .
I love my Tivo .
I was a Tivo customer for three years .
So why am I using the Dish Network and not Tivo ?
The Dish Network DVR sucks .
I hate you Dish Network DVR developers !
I HATE YOU !
HAVEN ’T YOU EVER SEEN A TIVO ???
DO YOU NOT CARE ABOUT USABILITY AND RELIABILITY , OR ARE YOU TOTAL INCOMPETENT IDIOTS ???
I want to use a Tivo , but I ca n’t use it with the Dish Network .
I have to use their proprietary system .
I do n’t want to use the Dish Network either , but DirectTV was so difficult to deal with for customer service that I refuse to be their customer any more .
The guy who installed my Dish Network DVR told me that its “ much better than Tivo . ”
The next time I see him , I want to take him by the scruff of his neck and rub his nose on the screen of my Dish Network DVR as it fails once again to record what I told it to record .
You know nothing of Tivos you satellite installer guy !
Do not ever criticize Tivo again !
Of all the technology I have knowingly used in the last ten years , I would say I ’m most happy with the iPod , the Tivo , and the Neatworks receipt scanning system .
My Blackberry has been pretty good , too .
Most other things suck .
Quality is dead .
What do we do about that ?
I have some ideas .
More to come …
PARIS ( Reuters ) - France launched a new campaign to warn potential victims of forced marriages and female genital mutilation on Tuesday , with stark posters and booklets showing a wedding ring made of barbed wire .
France is home to an estimated 55,000 victims of female genital mutilation , mostly of African origin , and some 70,000 young women who are at risk of being forced into marriage , government officials said at a news conference .
“ In both cases , neither tradition nor custom can justify calling into question fundamental rights , ” Solidarity Minister Valerie Letard said .
In a struggle to protect human rights while respecting the values of immigrant communities , European governments have ramped up efforts to protect young women of Asian , Middle Eastern or African descent who are lured abroad and married off .
Victims of genital mutilation are often children of primary school age , who are subjected to the ordeal during family holidays , activists told the news conference .
France ’s government plans to distribute more than 100,000 booklets providing legal and medical advice and contacts for victims as well as doctors , teachers and social workers .
A booklet with a crossed - out red razor blade warned of the potentially lethal impact of genital mutilation , during which the clitoris and other parts of the vagina are removed .
“ The booklets are useful for people who can read and write , but the majority of parents I talk to are illiterate , ” Khady Koita , head of the European network against female genital mutilation , told Reuters .
Koita uses videos and drawings to show parents the dangers of the operation , which is meant to ensure a woman ’s chastity and improve her chances of finding a husband .
“ Over the past few years , their reaction has become more positive .
Many parents now say , ‘ I do n’t do it anymore , but my problem is that when I go back to Africa there is a lot of social pressure ’ , ” Koita said .
Other activists urged the government to provide secure shelters for women who flee forced marriages .
They said it should be mandatory for women ’s rights to be taught in schools , adding the issue is often avoided for fear of offending France ’s ethnic minorities .
In France , forced marriages are illegal and can be annulled even if they were registered abroad .
Registrars are encouraged to look for signs a marriage is not consensual and stop the ceremony if they suspect the bride was forced into it .
OUTSIDERS tend to think of Canada as a wholesome , boy - scoutish kind of place .
Many Canadians have the same view .
Yet their country is as shockingly slow as many in Latin America when it comes to dealing with allegations of corruption and white - collar crime , as a rash of recent cases demonstrates .
Public hearings began this week in a judicial inquiry into the relationship between Brian Mulroney , a former prime minister , and Karlheinz Schreiber , who was once a lobbyist for Airbus and for Thyssen , a German defence and steel company .
The matter under investigation dates back to 1993 , when Mr Mulroney is alleged to have accepted the first of three envelopes stuffed with cash from Mr Schreiber .
It is six years since these payments became public knowledge .
Yet the inquiry is the first attempt by the government to get to the bottom of the affair .
Mr Mulroney says that the cash — C$ 225,000 ( $ 170,000 at the time ) he says ; C$ 300,000 says Mr Schreiber — was payment for lobbying work carried out after he ceased being prime minister , and he insists he has done nothing wrong .
But should the inquiry 's findings lead to criminal charges against him , the subsequent trial would probably drag on for several more years .
This is what happened in the case of Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb , two Canadian theatre impresarios from a company called Livent who were convicted of fraud on March 25th .
They were indicted in the United States in 1999 , and promptly fled to Canada where they were not charged until 2002 .
Justice has moved only slightly faster in the case of Larry O'Brien , the mayor of Ottawa , who was charged 16 months ago with trying to bribe an opponent in an election in 2006 .
His trial begins next month .
Canadian sloth in these matters is shown up by American zeal .
Conrad Black was jailed for fraud south of the border but was never charged in his native Canada , although some of the press baron 's offences were committed there .
The contrast stems in part from differences between legal systems .
America 's grand juries , which have no counterpart in Canada , allow investigators to subpoena witnesses and require them to testify under oath .
Plea bargaining provides another tool to extract evidence .
Canadian police must rely on voluntary co-operation from busy businessmen .
If they procrastinate , cases may be dropped because witnesses die or because of undue delay , as happened with Robert Topol , a third Livent manager .
Another time - consuming Canadian procedure requires police to disclose all documentary evidence when they file charges .
A bigger factor may be public attitudes .
Canadians tend to defer to authority and trust their institutions .
Although the main parties , the Liberals and the Conservatives , play up corruption claims to gain political advantage , their outrage rarely provokes a public groundswell in favour of speedy action or change .
The exception was a scandal over Liberal advertising spending , which cost the party the 2006 election .
The Liberals have had little success in trying to tar Stephen Harper , the Conservative prime minister , with the problems of Mr Mulroney , who formerly acted as a mentor to him .
Mr O'Brien has refused to step down as Ottawa 's mayor .
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation plans to air a new series of a talent show in which Mr Drabinsky is one of the judges .
Mr Mulroney continues to sit on several corporate boards .
“ Canadians are complacent about these things , ” says Tony Coulson of Environics , a polling firm .
At this rate they wo n't earn their boy - scout 's badge for housecleaning .
When it comes to sex and censorship , Government 's insistence that laws are " evidence - based " is little more than hot air .
The statistics quoted in support of any given case are frequently misleading , partial , and - according to one expert in this field - subject to highly unethical collusion of interest between government and researchers .
From rape to lap - dancing , from internet harm to obscure sexual practices , " evidence " is used to back a narrow politicised agenda , rather than as a basis from which to develop policy .
A good – or bad example – of this approach can be found in the Lilith Report on Lap - dancing , produced in 2003 , which sought to link sex crime in Camden with the opening of local lap - dancing clubs .
Sponsored by Eaves Housing For Women – of whom more later - the report quoted , without full context , some selected figures : over a three - year period , the level of sexual offences in Camden fell by less than in two allegedly comparable boroughs , and the level of recorded rape and indecent assault in Camden increased by 50 and 57 per cent following the establishment of two mainstream lap - dancing establishments .
As " research " goes , this contains more holes than the proverbial Swiss cheese .
We asked the Eaves Project for comment , but at time of writing had not received an answer .
It is an absurdly simplistic " correlation equals effect " argument , with virtually no controls of any kind .
Yet such is the political desire that this report be true , it is quoted frequently and as gospel – from the Guardian to Amnesty ’s official site - whenever a journalist wishes to take a pop at lap - dancing .
But then , it was ever thus .
The first and ground - breaking research into sexual behaviour was the 1948 Kinsey report in the United States , followed by Mass Observation ’s " Little Kinsey " , whose findings – including a high level of homosexual experimentation and marital infidelity - were considered so shocking that they were , in typical UK fashion , kept secret for decades after .
Kinsey came in for serious academic criticism on the grounds of sample selection ( volunteers who came forward for interview were mainly self - selected ) and sample bias ( a high proportion of prison inmates and prostitutes ) .
This in turn led critics to argue that both Kinsey ’s focus and findings were coloured by his own interest in masochistic and promiscuous sex .
However , a subsequent re-working of Kinsey ’s data suggested that the sample bias had little effect and that in general , people ’s sex lives were more colourful and more varied than conventional moralists liked to imagine .

I didnt suggest forking GCC .
A kernel - special GCC would likely just
become an inferior fork of GCC over time and would fizzle out .
There 's 100 times more user - space code than kernel - space code and
GCC is too large and too legacy - laden to really be appropriate for
that purpose .
What i think makes sense is to build a _new_ precompiler / compiler
/ assembler / linker combo for Linux , from scratch , hosted in the
kernel proper .
In the past 15 years of Linux we 've invested a lot of time and
effort into working around and dealing with compiler crap .
We wasted
a lot of opportunities waiting years for sane compiler features to
show up .
We might as well have invested that effort into building
our own compiler and could stop bothering about externalities .
The
Linux kernel project certainly involves the right kind of people who
could make something like this happen .
A good technical basis for that would be Sparse , and it could start
by acting as a drop - in replacement for CPP and it could feed its
output to GCC with little changes .
Sparse is small , has a very tidy
code base and is already useful today as an extended static source
code checker .
The Sparse codebase could move into the kernel proper , under
linux / sparse / or so - so the preprocessor / compiler and the kernel
could be in precise feature and bugfix lock - step with no artificial
external synchronization .
We have a lot of annoying preprocessor limitations that Sparse could
help with straight away .
We 'd also get Sparse type checking by
default .
So it 's helpful even without any code generator support .
Then , if this model works out , we could experiment with adding a
code generator backend to Sparse .
I think Jeff Garzik experimented
with that in the past with some surprisingly quick ( but incomplete )
results .
Since most of the performance - critical code in Linux is
hand - optimized already , we dont even need all that many complex ,
exotic optimizations - we want to encourage common - sense coding
practices .
Furthermore , a lot of optimizations in GCC are driven by
SPECint and SPECfp benchmarketing , with little practical relevance
to 99 % of the apps , including the kernel .
There would always be an ' output to GCC ' kind of compatible build
channel as well , for CPU architectures that dont have native code
generator support yet .
We 'd also do that to generally keep our
options open , in case we are wrong about it all or in case some even
better compiler project pops up .

Several people who have signed up for official PlayStation newsletters have been receiving a newsletter stating that the Infamous demo unlocks a free Cole costume for your Home Avatar , The newsletter itself was not completely clear on how to unlock the costume .
The official PlayStation
Home forums were being bombarded with threads asking how to unlock the costume .
Locust_Star one of the Home Community Managers chimmed in to help clear the air .
Hey guys , Regarding the Cole costume :
It will not unlock until after the game is released .
It wo n’t unlock day and date with the release , but likely within a week it will appear in user ’s inventories .
This delay , of course , is not ideal but I think most people wo n’t mind being patient as long as they know that it is coming .
Any help in spreading that word is appreciated .
– Locust_Star , Home Community Manager
So what you have to do in order to look like Cole from Infamous in Home , is download the demo , and within a week it ’ll just magically appear in your inventory .
So if you have n’t already , download the Infamous demo to take advantage of this sweet swag .

Survey indicates around three in four would find outcome at least ' tolerable '
A majority of both Palestinians and Israelis are willing to accept a two - state solution , according to a poll from the international grassroots movement One Voice .
Based on public opinion research methods used in Northern Ireland , 500 interviews were completed in Israel and 600 in the West Bank and Gaza immediately following the Gaza war and the Israeli elections .
Each side was asked which problems they thought were " very significant " and what the solutions might be .
The results indicate that 74 % of Palestinians and 78 % of Israelis are willing to accept a two - state solution on an option range from " tolerable " to " essential " , while 59 % of Palestinians and 66 % of Israelis find a single bi-national state " unacceptable " .
The poll comes as it emerged Barack Obama is to invite Israeli , ­Palestinian and Egyptian leaders to the White House within the next two months in a fresh push for Middle East peace .
Obama , speaking at the White House yesterday , said there was a need to try to rise above the cynicism about prospects for peace .
The results of today 's poll imply that mainstream Israeli and Palestinian populations have yet to acknowledge the significant priorities and fears on the other side .
The top item for Palestinians is the establishment of an independent sovereign state at 97 % , followed by the rights of refugees at 95 % and agreement on the future of Jerusalem at 94 % .
For Israelis the top item is security at 77 % , followed by an agreement on the future of Jerusalem at 68 % and rights to natural resources at 62 % .
An analysis of the poll by One Voice says : " It is absolutely essential that the issues at the top of these two lists get dealt with in any peace agreement or it is unlikely that that agreement will last .
This means Palestinians need to be aware of and address the ' Security of Israel ' problem that comes in 12th on the Palestinian list , and that Israelis need to be aware of and address the cluster of issues at the top of the Palestinian list . "
The poll also revealed significant divisions about the issues of settlements and refugees , on which there was no single proposed solution which met with majority approval on both sides .
Ninety - eight per cent of Palestinians think that all the settlers should leave the occupied territories with the settlements abolished – an option that 53 % of Israelis find unacceptable .
More than 90 % of Palestinians want refugees to be given the right to return with compensation , while 77 % of Israelis say that is unacceptable .
On Jerusalem , the sides are poles apart .
The most attractive option for Palestinians – 95 % – is for all of Jerusalem to remain in Palestine , and for Israelis it is for all of Jerusalem to remain in Israel at 56 % .
The report says that " as these two options are mutually exclusive proposals to internationalise or divide the city also need to be considered " .
One Voice concludes that , at a minimum , the results suggest that " the continued insistence of both sides on a negotiated and mutually acceptable resolution could offer significant legitimacy to political leaders looking to push for negotiations toward a two - state agreement " .
The following article from the NY Times is based on an exclusive interview Friday with President Obama : Obama Ponders Outreach to Elements of the Taliban .
Here are some excerpts :
Mr. Obama indicated that the end was not in sight when it came to the economic crisis and suggested that he expected it could take another $ 750 billion to address the problem of weak and failing financial institutions beyond the $ 700 billion already approved .
The budget plan he released last month included a placeholder estimate of $ 250 billion for additional bank bailouts — an amount that represents the projected long - term cost to taxpayers of a $ 750 billion infusion into the financial sector — and in the interview Mr. Obama indicated that those figures were what he was likely to seek from Congress .
“ We have no reason to revise that estimate , ” he said .
Mr. Obama urged Americans to “ be prudent ” in their personal financial decisions , but not to hunker down so much that it would further slow the recovery .
“ What I do n’t think people should do is suddenly stuff money in their mattresses and pull back completely from spending , ” he said .
Still , he avoided guessing when the situation might begin to turn around .
“ Our belief and expectation is that we will get all the pillars in place for recovery this year , ” he said .
“ How long it will take before recovery actually translates into stronger job markets and so forth is going to depend on a whole range of factors . ”
“ Part of the reason we do n’t spend a lot of time looking at blogs , ” he said , “ is because if you have n’t looked at it very carefully , then you may be under the impression that somehow there ’s a clean answer one way or another — well , you just nationalize all the banks , or you just leave them alone and they ’ll be fine . ”
And on the economy :
And on bloggers :
My feelings are hurt ( just kidding ) .

Babar Ahmad was subjected to prolonged , repeated assaults and religious insults during arrest in south London , high court hears
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The Metropolitan police today agreed to pay £ 60,000 damages to a British Muslim after a high court admission that officers had subjected him to " serious , gratuitous and prolonged " attack .
The court was told that Babar Ahmad , who is accused of raising funds for terrorism , had been punched , kicked and throttled during his arrest by officers from the force 's territorial support group in December 2003 .
The Met had repeatedly denied the claims , saying officers had used reasonable force during the arrest .
However , lawyers for the force 's commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , today admitted at the high court that Ahmad had been the victim of gratuitous and sustained violence at his home in Tooting , south - west London .
" The commissioner has today admitted that his officers subjected Babar Ahmad to grave abuse tantamount to torture during his arrest , " Ahmad 's solicitor , Fiona Murphy , said outside the court .
During the hearing , it emerged that the Met had lost " a number of large mail sacks " containing details of other similar allegations against the officers who assaulted Ahmad .
Murphy said the few documents that had not been mislaid should have triggered a thorough investigation .
" The horrifying nature and volume of complaints against these officers should have provoked an effective response from the Metropolitan police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) long ago , " she said .
" Instead , it has fallen to Babar Ahmad to bring these proceedings to achieve public recognition of the wrong that was done to him . "
She said other crucial documents relating to the case were also lost .
They included all the officers ' contemporaneous notebooks and the taped recording of an interview with the senior officer in the case .
Murphy added : " The papers will be referred to the director of public prosecutions for urgent consideration of criminal charges against the officers concerned and for an investigation as to whether events surrounding the mislaid mail sacks constitute evidence of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice . "
During his arrest , Ahmad was punched , kicked and throttled , the court heard .
Officers stamped on the 34 - year - old 's feet and repeatedly punched him in the head before he was forced into the Muslim prayer position and they shouted : " Where is your God now ?
Pray to him . "
After a sustained attack , he was forced into the back of a police van , where he was again beaten and punched before being put in a " life - threatening " neck hold and told : " You will remember this day for the rest of your life . "
At one stage , one of the officers grabbed his testicles and he was also deliberately wrenched by his handcuffs – a technique known to cause intense pain .
Outside the court , Ahmad 's brother - in - law , Fahad Ahmad , read out a statement on his behalf in which he said he was pleased the police had finally admitted what had happened .
" This abuse took place not in Guantánamo Bay or a secret torture chamber but in Tooting , south London , " the statement said .
" The path to justice is long and difficult but , as long as you remain steadfast upon it , you will get there in the end . "
Ahmad has been in detention since he was rearrested in 2004 after a request from the US government over claims he helped raise money to fund terrorist campaigns .
The court heard that no evidence had been produced against Ahmad , and he had never been charged with any offence .
He is now fighting extradition to the US in the European courts .
An IPCC investigation in 2007 ended with no action being taken against any officer .
In everyday learning and reasoning , people routinely draw successful generalizations from very limited evidence .
Even young children can infer the meanings of words , hidden properties of objects , or the existence of causal relations from just one or a few relevant observations -- far outstripping the capabilities of conventional learning machines .
How do they do it ?
And how can we bring machines closer to these human - like learning abilities ?
I will argue that people 's everyday inductive leaps can be understood as approximations to Bayesian computations operating over structured representations of the world , what cognitive scientists have called " intuitive theories " or " schemas " .
For each of several everyday learning tasks , I will consider how appropriate knowledge representations are structured and used , and how these representations could themselves be learned via Bayesian methods .
The key challenge is to balance the need for strongly constrained inductive biases -- critical for generalization from very few examples -- with the flexibility to learn about the structure of new domains , to learn new inductive biases suitable for environments which we could not have been pre-programmed to perform in .
The models I discuss will connect to several directions in contemporary machine learning , such as semi- supervised learning , structure learning in graphical models , hierarchical Bayesian modeling , and nonparametric Bayes .
Police have released a gruesome photo showing how a Sydney man was shot in the head and neck with a nail gun 34 times .
27 - year - old Chen Liu , who also went by the name of Anthony Liu , was found dead in marshland surrounding the Georges River in Sydney 's south last year .
Police say the severely decomposed body was found just after 6:00 pm ( AEDT ) on 1 November 2008 by two children , aged 9 and 14 , who told their parents they had seen a body in Oatley Bay while on a canoeing trip .
Police say Mr Liu had been dead for 12 days before being discovered .
The Homicide Squad has been handling the case in conjunction with the Hurstville Local Area Command , forming Strike Force Renfree , but so far no arrests have been made .
They have now released an X - ray of the 27 - year - old 's skull and neck , which shows it was filled with 34 nails .
" Post - mortem examination results revealed Mr Liu was shot repeatedly to the head with a high - powered nail gun .
Similar types of nail guns can fire nails up to 85 millimetres long , " Detective Inspector Mark Newham of the Homicide Squad said in a statement .
The head of the Homicide Squad , Geoff Beresford , says the weapon has not been found .
" If anyone knows of a particular nail gun that has been stolen from them or from work premises , building sites , et cetera , we'd be grateful to hear that information , " he said .
He says the victim had been in Australia for eight years , but has no family here .
" In 36 years of investigation , I 've never come across a murder of this nature using a nail gun , " he said .
" May I say it 's a particularly brutal and vicious murder and we are seeking information from the public so we can bring this inquiry to a conclusion . "
Detective Inspector Newham says information about the victim 's car would be useful .
" Strike Force detectives are also appealing for information from anyone who might have seen Mr Liu 's car in Rockdale or Connells Point around 19 October 2008 , " he said .
The car is described as a 2005 model blue Range Rover Sport four wheel drive , which police believe may have been used to dump Mr Liu 's body in the marshland .
People with information are asked to contact Strike Force Renfree via Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 , and police say all information will be treated in strict confidence .
The NY Times reports that :
“ The Chinese government locked down this regional capital of 2.3 million people and other cities across its western desert region on Monday and early Tuesday , imposing curfews , cutting off cellphone and Internet services and sending armed police officers into neighborhoods after clashes erupted here on Sunday evening between Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese .
The fighting left at least 156 people dead and more than 1,000 injured , according to the state news agency . ”
Also :
“ The fighting on Sunday was the deadliest episode of ethnic violence in China in decades .
The bloodshed here , along with the Tibetan uprising last year , shows the extent of racial hostility that still pervades much of western China , fueled partly by economic disparity and by government attempts to restrict religious and political activity by minority groups . ”
Unfortunately , America has done its own part to suppress
Uighur ’s civil rights , refusing them habeas corpus for over 7 and a half years .
Barack Obama has continued these policies , despite promises to do otherwise .
There have been reports that they wave the Al Qaeda flag and have been known to engage in terroism .
Still , since most people acknowledge that the Chinese government is a repressive regime that violates human rights , why would we be surprised that a suppressed minority group would violently resist the government ’s attempts to violate their human rights ?
We can say that they used horrible tactics , but we all remeber what happened last time the Chinese tried to protest against their government .
If these were Christians , as opposed to Muslims , I highly doubt the U.S. would be so silent on the issue .
Apparently , the United States is against human rights violations by China , but when it comes to Muslims , we ’re pretty much on the same page .
Here ’s a question that came up while I ’ve been trying to
href = " http://greenokapi.net/blog/2009/05/04/currying-in-perl/ ">implement
currying in Perl : is Currying monadic ?
I ’ve tried a couple of times , but not managed to explain what I mean very well on #haskell , so let ’s
see if a longer writeup explains it better .
My simplistic understanding of monads is that they take various things that
are nests of nested expressions , and allow you to reason about them , and
given them a pretty syntax that makes it look like they are in fact a
sequence of commands .
For example : ( pseudocode )
let a = 1 let b = 2 output a+b
Looks like a sequence of commands , but you could n’t just separate each
line and string the commands together .
Rather you have to consider it
as a nest :
( let a = 1 ( let b = 2 ( output a +b ) ) )
And in many cases , we can go from a nested structure to a monad , for example , we could simplify these horribly nested if s :
( if file exists ( if file is readable ( if reading the file gave a string ( if the string matches a username ( do some action with the username ) ) ) ) )
… into a nice Maybe monad :
do check file exists check file is readable string
Similarly , nested lists :
( for each i in list 1 ( for each j in list 2 ( is i the same as j ? ( output i ) ) ) )
can be abstracted as a List monad :
do i
OK , so I 'm not talking about wrapping and unwrapping values , the monad
laws , or typing in general .
They are what gives this stuff its strong
theoretical basis and makes it robust .
But the simple - minded " Nest ->
Sequence " idea works for me at least , and gives a good feel for
where monads can come in useful .
Currying
So ... when I was implementing currying , I noted that you could write a
currying sub ( pseudocode again ) :
function add3 ( a , b , c ) { return a+b+c }
as something like this :
function add3 ( a ) { return function ( b ) { return function ( c ) { return a+b+c } } }
This is again a nested expression .
So I wondered if you could again " flatten " it with a monadic do block :
let add3 = do a
OK , so I " know " that functions in Haskell ( which uses currying for
functions as a general rule ) are the " Reader monad " .
But I do n't
understand it well enough to know if that means you can use Reader to
implement the above ...
( I do n't understand Reader at all in fact .
I must bang my head against
it again , but I find it very confusing - how the monad is represented ,
what the functions are , and how they get magically applied . )
So , I did attempt to implement it using my Perl module
Acme:: Monads .
This href = " http://github.com/osfameron/acme--monads/blob/master/t/04_curry.t "
>
test
shows that this sort of works :
my $ add = mdo ( 2 ) { mbind $ x = Curry shift ; mbind $y = Curry shift ; return $ x+$y ; } ; say $ add - > ( 1 ) ->( 2 ) ; # 3 , yay !
Note that the " return " is n't a monadic Unit but Perl 's return ,
i.e. a plain value .
That makes this example strictly speaking not
monadic : what I do n't know is whether that means the whole idea is fatally flawed , or whether ( as I believe ) I was just too dumb to fix the errors I got when I tried running with munit ...
I suspect that it should be possible , with the
whole expression then being wrapped by some function
( runCurry ? ) which extracts the final result out of the monad .
Did this explanation make any sense ?
Please let me know , and any
comments on whether it 's possible / sane to do this ( writing currying as a
monad ) are appreciated !

1. The Golden Jubilee
Weight : 205.07 carats
The Red Cross is canary yellow cushion - shaped diamond with weight of 205.07 carats .
The rough stone weighed 375 carats and was found in Kimberly mines ( South Africa ) in 1901 .
The diamond was presented as a gift to the art sale held in London by Christies in 1918 , on behalf of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St. John .
Another rare feature is that a Maltese Cross is distinctly visible in the top facet , hence the double appropriateness of its name , the Red Cross Diamond .
Weight : 234.65 carats
The De Beers diamond was found in Kimberly mines in 1888 , the rough stone weighed 428.50 carats and measured 47.6 mm through its longest axis and 38.1 mm square .
Weighing 234.65 carats , the De Beers is the 8th largest faceted diamond in the world .
After its display in Paris the Maharaja of Patiala bought the De Beers .
In 1928 Cartier of Paris set it as the centerpiece of a ceremonial necklace that came to be known as the Patiala Necklace .
The necklace originally contained about 2,930 diamonds weighing about 962.25 carats .
Today 's whereabouts of the De Beers diamond and the Patiala Nacklace is unknown .
Weight : 245.35 carats
The Jubilee is a colorless cushion - shaped diamond with a weight of 245.35 carats .
The original rough stone , an irregular octahedron without definite faces or shape weighed 650.80 carats and was found in the Jagersfontein Mine towards the end of 1895 .
When during the cutting it became evident that a superb diamond of exceptional purity and size was being produced , it was planned to present it to Queen Victoria .
In the end this did not happen and the diamond remained with its owners .
The following year marked the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria ( the 75th anniversary of her coronation ) so the gem was renamed the Jubilee to commemorate the occasion .
Weight : 273.85 carats
The Centenary was found in Premier mine in 1986 , in its rough form it weighed 599 carats .
When cutting was completed the Centenary weighed 273.85 carats , measured 39.90 × 50.50 × 24.55 mm , and had 247 facets - 164 on the stone and 83 around its girdle .
Never before had such a high number of facets been polished onto a diamond .
The true value of the Centenary diamond is unknown , but the diamond was insured for around $ 100 million in 1991 .
Weight : 312.24
The Spirit of de Grisogono , at 312.24 carats , is the world 's largest cut black diamond , and world 's 5th largest diamond .
In a white gold mounting , it is set with 702 white diamonds totaling 36.69 carats .
This diamond originally had a rough weight of 587 carats and was mined several decades ago in west Central Africa before being imported into Switzerland .
Weight : 317.40 carats
The Cullinan II is the massive 317.40 carat cushion shaped diamond in the center - front of the Imperial State Crown of Great Britain .
Cullinan II was cut from the largest gem-quality diamond ever found , it weighed 3106 carats , or about 1 1/3 pounds .
It was named after Sir Thomas Cullinan , who opened the mine and was visiting on that eventful day .
The nine larger stones of the Cullinan diamond remain either in the British Crown Jewels or in the personal possession of the Royal Family .
Weight : 407.48 carats
The Incomparable , in its rough state weighing 890 carats , was found in the town of Mbuji Mayi in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( formerly Zaire ) in the 1980s .
Four years were spent studying and then cutting the stone , the biggest piece of rough ultimately yielded a gem weighing 407.48 carats ; it is the third largest diamond ever cut .
Internally flawless clarity and fancy brownish - yellow in color , it measures 53.90 × 35.19 × 28.18 mm .
Weight : 530.20 carats
The Cullinan I , a pear shaped diamond weighing 530.20 carats is also known as the Star of Africa .
It measures 53 mm x 44 mm x 29 mm , and has 76 facets .
It 's called the Cullinan I because it is the largest of 9 large stones cut from the 3106 carat Cullinan Diamond .
Cullinan I was placed by King Edward in the Sovereign 's Royal Sceptre as part of the Crown Jewels , and it is now on display in the tower of London .
Estimated value of Cullinan I is over $ 400 million !
Weight : 545.67 carats
The Golden Jubilee , with the weight of 545.67 carats , is the largest faceted diamond in the world .
Rough stone weighed 755 carats and was discovered in Premier mine , South Africa in 1985 .
The Golden Jubilee was presented to the King of Thailand in 1997 for his Golden Jubilee - the 50th anniversary of his coronation .
Prior to this event , the stone was simply known as the Unnamed Brown .
Estimated value of the Golden Jubilee is $ 4 - $ 12 million .

Details of MPs ' expenses receipts are being offered for sale for up to £ 300,000 , it has been claimed .
Labour MP Sir Stuart Bell said the Speaker 's Commons Estimates Committee he sits on was investigating the case .
In the wake of a string of allegations about expenses , Prime Minister Gordon Brown has suggested scrapping MPs ' controversial second - home payment .
As questions continue about MPs ' claims the Committee on Standards in Public Life said it would speed up its review .
It had planned to start its investigation later this year but the leaders of the three biggest political parties had all called for it to be brought forward so it could recommend changes before the next election .
The suggestion that details of MPs ' expenses claims were being offered for sale comes after weekend revelations that Home Secretary Jacqui Smith " mistakenly " claimed for adult movies watched by her husband .
Sir Stuart told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday : " All of the receipts of 650 - odd MPs , redacted and un-redacted , are for sale at a price of £ 300,000 , so I am told .
" The price is going up because of the interest in the subject . "
It may be a theft , but we will get to the bottom of it .
In the public interest
Sir Stuart Bell Guide : Europe 's MPs ' pay s A guide to MPs ' expenses
Asked who was trying to sell the information , Sir Stuart replied : " Well we have a pretty good idea of not the person , but the source , and that is a subject of a House of Commons investigation . "
" It 's probably a breach of the Official Secrets Act , " Sir Stuart said .
" It may be a theft , but we will get to the bottom of it .
In the public interest , by the way . "
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " We do n't believe that the newspapers will buy all of the 655 for £ 300,000 , but they may wish to take say 10 senior MPs in the limelight and then there 'll be a drip - drip of their expenses .
" All of these expenses will be published , all of the receipts will be published , probably in July of this year , so there 'll be 1.2 million receipts on the table and they can all have a field day . "
Sir Stuart added that all three of the main political parties should commit to reform of MPs ' expenses in their manifestos for the next general election .
Newspapers have reported a string of allegations about MPs ' expenses in recent weeks , fuelling speculation that information might be being leaked by officials within Parliament .
Further anger
The allegations have prompted calls for a reform of the additional costs allowance - known as second - home allowance - which covers up to £ 23,083 of the cost of an MP staying away from their main residence to perform their parliamentary duties .
The row intensified when official figures showed the total expenses claimed by MPs went up 6 % in 2007 - 8 , to just over £ 93 m .
In a letter to the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life , Mr Brown urged it to consider replacing the existing payment with a " simpler overnight allowance " that would be independently determined .
He also suggested that all London MPs should receive the same allowance , ending the current distinction which allows those in outer London to make the additional claim for a second home .
In his letter to the committee 's chairman Sir Christopher Kelly , Mr Brown said : " I would be grateful if you could look to both start and conclude the review earlier than previously indicated to allow us to make progress on the issue as soon as practical . "
Additional costs
He suggested the committee considered scrapping the controversial second - home allowance in favour of a simpler system .
London
MPs should be prevented from claiming for second homes altogether , he indicated , and others moved to " a simpler , overnight allowance that is independently determined " .
The prime minister 's intervention came after allegations about allowances claimed by Employment Minister Tony McNulty and the home secretary .
The Commons authorities have been working to prepare around a million receipts filed by MPs for publication , after losing a long - running freedom of information battle to keep them secret .
The documents have now started circulating to members for them to check and make representations on which parts should be deleted for security and other reasons .
They are expected to prove damaging to many MPs when they are published before the summer recess .
It emerged that Mr McNulty claimed the allowance towards his parents ' home in Harrow which he used in addition to a flat in central London .
Ms Smith was criticised for claiming more than £ 116,000 in allowances for her family home in the West Midlands after nominating her sister 's property in London - where she stayed several nights a week - as her main residence .

Fidel Castro may be seeing more Americans in Cuba in future
A bipartisan group of US senators has introduced a bill that would allow US citizens to travel freely to Cuba .
The US has imposed trade and travel bans on Cuba since 1962 , but Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan said this policy had " failed for 50 years " .
Mr Dorgan , one of the bill 's sponsors , said he believed it would win enough votes in the US Congress to pass .
But Republican Mel Martinez said the US should support pro-democracy activists , not " the Castro regime " .
Mr Dorgan 's bill is co-sponsored by senior Republican Senator Richard Lugar .
A similar bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives - also with support from members of both parties .
Call for change
At present , the US only allows its citizens to go to Cuba if they are journalists , government officials or on a humanitarian mission .
Students or people wanting to visit close relatives can also apply for special licences .
But the BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says calls have been growing for a change in policy .
Business and farm groups , in particular , want to sell into the Cuban market .
And the Obama administration has already supported changes making it easier for Cuban - Americans to visit or send money .
The US began imposing restrictions on Cuba after Fidel Castro took power in 1959 , making it the only Communist state in the Americas - and a Cold War flashpoint .
His younger brother , Raul , formally took over the presidency from him in February last year .
Overview
An anonymous survey of software vendors shows that the average sale to visit ratio is very close to the much quoted “ industry average ” of 1 % .
However the data shows large variations between products and across different sectors ( e.g. Windows vs Mac OS X ) .
The data
The data set comprises 92 valid survey responses to an 8 question survey in April 2009 .
The survey was advertised through a request on this blog , posts on BOS , ASP , MACSB , OISV and BOSnetwork forums and emails to the author ’s contacts .
The results are inevitably biased towards small software vendors , due to the places where the survey was advertised .
As the survey was anonymous it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the data .
However it is unlikely that many vendors would have completed a survey that was n’t anonymous .
The survey consisted of 3 compulsory questions ( unique visits , downloads and sales over a given timeframe ) and 5 optional questions ( the time frame of the data , primary market , primary OS , licence price and trial type ) .
One record had 0 visits ( an iPod app ) , another had 0 downloads ( presumably a web app ) and a few had numbers that I did n’t consider statistically valid for some purposes ( e.g. < 500 visits per month or < 3 sales transactions per month ) .
I did the best I could with the data available , ignoring obvious outliers in some cases .
The data set comprises a total of :
8.1 million unique website visits
2.2 million downloads
110 thousand sales transactions
Where a time frame for the results was given it is possible to work out the range of visitors , downloads and sales per month .
Interestingly the distribution of monthly visits , downloads and sales across the different products all follow the Pareto 80:20 power law quite closely :
22 % of the products account for 80 % of the visits
21 % of the products account for 80 % of the downloads
19 % of the products account for 80 % of the sales
This gives me some faith that the data is reasonably accurate and representative of the industry as a whole .
The data is broken down by OS , market , price and trial type as follows :
Analysis
The average ( mean ) ratio of downloads : visits across all products is 28 %. 50 % of products are in the range 12.1 % to 35.3 % .
I am surprised at how high the average ratio is .
This could partly be due to products that receive a high percentage of downloads from download sites , without the downloader ever visiting the product site .
Conversely sites where visitors make frequent returns after purchase ( e.g. to read forums ) will have a lower downloads : visits ratio .
The average ratio of sales : downloads across all products is 4.5 % .
50 % of products are in the range 1.3 % to 6.4 % .
The average sales : downloads ratio is noticeably lower than the average downloads : visits ratio .
The sales : downloads ratio is noticeably skewed on the right of the graph – a sales : downloads ratio > 20 % seems very high .
The ( logarithmic ) scatter plots below show that the downloads : sales ratio varies a lot more than visits : downloads ratio .
The average ( mean ) sales : visits ratio of all products is 1.16 % [ 1 ] .
However one of the product ratios is an obvious outlier at 13.94 % ( see below ) .
With this outlier removed the average sales : visits conversion ratio across all the products is 0.99 % .
50 % of products are in the range 0.28 % to 1.39 % .
0.99 % is suspiciously close to the mythical ‘ industry average ’ of 1 % .
But I have n’t ( consciously ) massaged the results to get this figure .
You can work out how you compare to this data set using the red ( cumulative ) graph in the histogram below .
For example , if your product sales : visits ratio is 1.5 % , then it is higher than approximately 80 % of the products in the data set .
We can also look at how the ratios vary across sectors .
Surprisingly the average Mac product conversion ratio is more than 4 times the Windows product conversion ratio .
Even if we try to compare like for like , and only compare consumer products selling for <= $ 50 , the ratios are still 2.27 % for Mac and 0.51 % for Windows .
Possible reasons for this large disparity include :
Mac owners more ready to spend money .
There is less competition in the Mac software market .
Mac vendors have a higher percentage of purchasers who never visit their site due to higher quality of Mac download sites .
It is a statistical blip ( there are a lot less Mac products in the survey ) .
My own experience with selling a cross-platform product ( Perfect Table Plan ) on Windows and Mac OS X is that the Mac sales : visits ratio is approximately double that for Windows .
The sales : visits ratio is similar for business and consumer products , with developer products lagging behind .
However there are too few developer products in the data set to draw any real conclusions .
The sales : visits ratio does vary across the price range .
However there are too few products with price > $ 50 in the data set to draw any real conclusions .
The sales : visits ratio does not seem to vary significantly by trial type .
There were insufficient ‘ number of use ’ trial products to include them .
Conclusion
One has to be careful about drawing conclusions from a relatively small and unverifiable data set .
However the results certainly seem to support the much - quoted “ industry standard ” sales : visits conversion ratio of 1 % .
But there are huge variations between products .
The fact that the sales : downloads ratio is both lower on average and more variable than the downloads : visitors ratio implies that getting people to download is the easy bit and converting the download to a sale is a tougher challenge .
The average sales : visits conversion ratio is noticeably higher for Mac OS X products than Windows products .
This is supported by anecdotal evidence and the author ’s own experience with a cross- platform product .
However the number of Mac respondents to the survey is too small for the result to be stated with any great confidence .
Also remember that the Mac market is still a lot smaller than the Windows market before you rush off to start learning Cocoa and Objective -C .
These ratios can be useful for a number of purposes , including : identifying a bottleneck in your conversion funnel ( is your downloads : visitors ratio low compared to other products ? ) ; estimating how much traffic you might need for a viable business ; or estimating how much you can afford to bid on Google Adwords .
And it is useful to track how these ratios change over time ( I track mine on a monthly basis ) .
But make sure you compare like with like if you are comparing your ratios with other products .
For example , a 10 % sales : downloads ratio might be achievable for a niche business product , but unrealistic for a casual game .
And remember that these ratios are only one part of a bigger picture .
There are other , more important , metrics .
Profitability for a start .
The data set is available here :
Raw data ( some invalid records deleted ) , CSV format
Processed data , Excel XLSX format
Feel free to publish your own analysis .
Thank you to everyone that took part in the survey .
[ 1 ] Calculating the mean of all the ratios probably is n’t the way a proper statistician would do it .
But anything more seems overkill given the limited size and unverifiable nature of the data set .

Dear Six Flags Corporation , I am part of a minority in America , in that I donât have cable .
Like the proud Somalians , I must resort to piracy if I am to fulfill my material and entertainment needs .
That is , until last week when my TV inexplicably started having all the major network channels where once there was static .
I guess the Somalian analogy there would be getting sniped in the face , but in a good way .
And though I have since been enjoying occasionally - flickering episodes of House and the Simpsons / Family Guy hybrid that The Simpsons has become , Iâve also been repeatedly reminded why I canceled my cable in the first place .
No , Iâm not talking about commercial breaks , episode preemption orTwo and a Half Men .
My cable - demon has a face .
An old , plastic , wrinkled , terrifying face .
Itâs this guy :
Fuck .
This .
Guy .
I fucking hate him .
He looks like someone left a dead turtle in a stagnant pool of water for a month then put glasses on it .
And as his parent , it 's your responsibility to abort him .
Letâs make one thing clear :
This man has no business giving me advice on anything post - Cold War Era , let alone my choice of amusement park .
If this guy went on a roller coaster , his putrefied organs would ooze out of every orifice .
In fact , THATâ S what you should put in the commercial .
Seriously , if you built a roller coaster called â Der Elderkillerâ  and killed off your mascot in the commercial for it , I promise I would call and buy a season pass immediately .
Whereâd you get this guy ?
SARA NELSON , the former editor of Publishers Weekly , was at a dinner party recently when Ed Rollins , the Republican campaign consultant , arrived carrying a Kindle .
“ And I just said , ‘ Can I see it ? ’ ” said Ms. Nelson , also the author of “ So Many Books , So Little Time . ”
“ In this honeymoon period of Kindle  when a lot of people do n’t have them  you can look to see what someone is reading , in the guise of looking at the hardware . ”
( For the record , Mr. Rollins ’s Kindle was crammed with the day ’s newspapers . )
Ms. Nelson owns a Kindle and a Sony Reader .
And for her , the ownership of an electronic book reader , while not necessarily a badge of literary honor , at least telegraphs a commitment to books .
“ It ’s really expensive , ” she said of the Kindle 2 , which Amazon sells for $ 359 .
“ If you ’re going to pay that , you ’re giving a statement to the world that you like to read  and you ’re probably not using it to read a mass market paperback . ”
The extremist British National Party ( BNP ) is to launch an advertising campaign featuring Jesus Christ .
The far - Right party will use the advert which features a bible verse quoting Jesus ' words about persecution , in the run up to the European Elections in June .
It comes after the Church of England passed a resolution at its General Synod last month banning clergy from being members of the party .
The advert features a picture of Jesus Christ on the cross and quotes a part of a verse from John 's Gospel ( John 15:20 ) in which Jesus says : " If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you " .
The verse comes in the context of Jesus ' teaching about love .
The advert then asks : " What would Jesus do ? " .
The thinktank Ekklesia has monitored attempts by the BNP since 2003 to present itself as a ‘ Christian Party ’ .
It has also warned that misleading stories about ‘ Christian persecution ’ in the UK , as well as appeals by church leaders to recover the idea of ' Christian Britain ' , have played into the hands of the far - Right
In recent years the BNP has used religious rhetoric with increasing frequency .
In recent local elections , the party 's literature included copies of the controversial Mohammed cartoons .
It also helped establish a ' Christian Council of Britain ' .
The goal is to appeal to those in the population who identify with Christianity , but feel panicked both by ' liberal secularism ' and the growth of Islam .
An analysis of the BNP membership list by the thinktank Ekklesia highlighted a number of members who were identified as Christian , taking part in Bible studies , running Christian businesses including bookshops or who were active in their churches .
In an email sent yesterday to BNP supporters , BNP leader Nick Griffin said : “ The British National Party is the only political party which genuinely supports Britain 's Christian heritage .
It is the only party which will defend our ancient faith and nation from the threat of Islamification .
“ What has become of the Christian church in this country ?
Instead of inclusively ‘ embracing all ’ which the church claims is its basis , certain groups within that body have banned people from their ranks simply because of their membership in the British National Party .
“ Surely if God calls a man to his service , no church has the right to contradict HIS holy will !
For many years , the churches in this country scrupulously avoided being politically biased .
Nowadays however we see a small number of clerics and bishops openly preaching hatred towards the BNP .
“ Church leaders actively shun the word of God on issues like sodomy , abortion and social justice .
“ With this in mind I invite you to preview our European election billboard ( pictured right ) aimed at attracting even more Christian voters .
“ Jesus was viewed as a revolutionary figure , hated and hounded to death , not by ' evil men ' but by the corrupt hypocrites who ran the church .
Has nothing changed in two thousand years ?
“ On June 4th , the leaders of Britain 's churches will find out that millions of good decent people support the British National Party .
“ It 's not racist to support British jobs for British workers or to be opposed to militant Islam , it 's just common sense and in line with the teachings of Jesus Christ .
But Jonathan Bartley , co-director of the thinktank Ekklesia said : “ This is clearly a gross misrepresentation of both Jesus Christ and Christianity .
Jesus was completely opposed to bigotry .
He is recorded in the Gospels as challenging those who did n’t welcome foreigners - not as working for their exclusion .
“ But the church must critically reflect on how it is aiding the far - Right .
Leading figures within the Church of England have become far more vocal recently in their calls to ‘ stem the tide of secularism ’ , and to defend the predominant ' Christian culture ' of Britain .
The uncomfortable fact is that this puts the Church into the position of arguing the same political point about national identity as the BNP .
“ Of course the rationales of these messages are very different .
The agenda behind the BNP 's claims is essentially a cultural one - partly in opposition to an alleged liberal elite , and partly in an attempt to whip up fear of minority faiths .
In contrast , few would question the commitment of the Church of England to combating racism .
But the time has come to face the fact that when it uses ' Christian nation ' rhetoric , it risks encouraging support for right - wing extremists .
“ Church figures should also exercise caution in their uncritical backing for high - profile cases of ‘ Christian persecution ’ which have featured most prominently in the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail .
These stories have often been misreported , but used nevertheless by church leaders as examples of a wider move of discrimination against Christians .
This is creating a victim mentality which will only serve to drive people into the BNP ’s hands .
“ But the latest advert from the BNP which quotes Jesus Christ should be seen by the church as an opportunity for a new approach .
Instead of adopting a defensive stance which pleases those seeking to make political capital out of civic ' de - Christianization ' , the Church should refocus on the vocation of Jesus , who clearly challenged bigotry in all its forms .
Whilst ' Christian nation ' rhetoric will only create more BNP support , a focus on Jesus Christ will undermine the party 's ideology completely . ”
Twitter is getting a tremendous amount of buzz from brands , celebrities , media , politicians , and athletes .
Despite the hype , it ’s still a very small social networking site ( likely under 10 mm ) , compared to the social giants like Google , Microsoft , Facebook and MySpace ( 150 - 300 mm ) , see my stats page to learn more .
I assert that mainstream attention is different than mainstream usage .
Even respected analyst firm Gartner suggests that the backlash may start as this microblogging tool gets mainstream attention , although I ’ll suggest we have n’t even begun to see the upcoming revolt , as the pivot point is dependent on mainstream usage .
Here ’s what we should expect to happen over the next few months :
Mainstream media and celebrities to flood Twitter
The tool , having received attention from the elections and political media engines has slowly gained the attention of local based TV news and talk show hosts .
It ’s hard to listen to a talk show , or watch local news without hearing a self - pitch to follow their Twitter account .
With several celebrities jumping on board and playing the ratings game ( first to a million ) we should expect this to be a wake up call to the rest of celebrities and mainstream .
Most media and celebrities will use as a broadcast tool
Being world famous comes with challenges , it ’s hard to tell who your friends are , and as a result , they will likely use these tools to communicate with each other , or talk about their personal insights .
We should n’t expect them to engage in individual conversations with their community .
These stars simple can’t scale , are busy , and well , have better things to do .
Expect some to hire community managers ( Britney does this ) that interact with their followers and post up one - way information .
As a result , expect this to primarily be used as an insiders tool among the elite , but primarily as a broadcast tool , which is what they do best .
Empowered , celebrities will fend off tabloids
Ashton gets self - empowerment from social media , in fact , he commented that he ’s now got the power of a large media network , despite being a single individual .
As a result , expect celebs to bypass intermediaries like tabloids , instead they will directly speak to the people using these self - publishing tools .
Celebs are now more empowered than ever before .
Increase in brands listening then they ’ll join Twitter
Brands , in an ever quest to follow communities and customers are quickly launching Twitter accounts , or dealing with those that have taken over their own namesakes .
Now with mainstream attention , expect more brands to jump on board , and within a few months , it ’ll be an account grabbing experience , much like we saw in late 90s when companies were registering domains .
I ’m waiting to see some celebrities promote brands right on Twitter “ I drink @coke , do n’t you ? ”
Users get new experience with mainstream –yet many will revolt
The conversation with Twitter has always felt personal , with the exception of the elite ‘ A - lister ’ community .
Now , many people will be excited about the chance to interact with celebrities and get to know their personal experiences , but after a while , the excitement will wane , and people will move back to connecting with their true friends .
The geek ‘ A - List ’ early adopters seek a new stage
The ‘ A - Listers ’ are now just ‘ B - Listers ’ again , in fact , this list of the most popular twitter users has dramatically shifted to mainstream media .
We ’re already starting to see some early adopter geeks , those that first experimented and evangelize the tool to seek other communities to join that are n’t saturated .
I was one of those early adopters in early 2007 , but I embrace the mainstream media in this media , it ’s validating , although I expect many of them to approach it without fully understanding .
Expect the early adopters to shift back to blogs , Friendfeed , or put up stronger filters in Twitter .
The power is shifting back , and the bruised egos will force them to move on .
Celebrities will monetize faster than Twitter themselves …
Twitter has only experimented with different ways to monetize such as this sponsored aggregation campaign , but we should expect that celebs will cascade their sponsorships to Twitter , promote their latest work , or benefit from word of mouth marketing .
Collectively , celebs have likely generated more revenue from Twitter than Twitter themselves .
… Yet expect Twitter to monetize brands , media and celebrities
Twitter has indicated that they plan to offer features and tools that help brands ( whether it be corporate , media , or celeb ) to help them manage their own accounts and information .
Expect them to launch new platforms that involve sponsorship , advertising , and potentially lead management ( like CRM ) .
More Hay and less Needles
This increase in people , and brands of all sorts joining Twitter will cause more noise and content to be created .
We have n’t even seen the half of it , as devices like your car , laptop , can start auto - emitting signals that could become tweets .
As a result , expect more filtering tools and analysis by humans to matter more and more .
In three separate cases in as many months , the Obama Justice Department has used the same arguments that the Bush administration Justice Department used to attempt to stop judicial review of extraordinary rendition and warrantless wiretapping .
In the Mohamed v. Jeppesen extraordinary rendition case , the Obama administration reiterated the Bush administration argument that the case should be dismissed to preserve " states secrets . "
Likewise , in the Al - Haramain wiretapping case , Obama 's DOJ used the arguments of the Bush administration to argue , again , that state secrets should prevent the Al - Haramain case -- in which the only secret is n't a secret because it was inadvertently shared with plaintiff 's attorneys -- from moving forward .
Late Friday , the Obama DOJ actually went the Bush administration one argument further , in a third case .
In Jewel v. NSA , the Electronic Frontier Foundation is " suing the National Security Agency ( NSA ) and other government agencies on behalf of AT&T customers to stop the illegal , unconstitutional , and ongoing dragnet surveillance of their communications and communications records . "
The Obama administration filed its first response [ pdf ] to the suit Friday , demanding dismissal of the entire suit .
Just a reminder , as pointed out by Glenn ; one of the rationales provided by all of those Senators who supported the FISAAA that granted immunity to the telcos was the the avenue of suing the government was still open .
Jello Jay wrote : " If administration officials abused their power or improperly violated the privacy of innocent people , they must be held accountable .
That is exactly why we rejected the White House 's year - long push for blanket immunity covering government officials . "
Let 's hope that Senator Rockefeller holds that belief when the government is led by his own party .
Here 's Glenn 's synopsis of the government argument :
[ T ]he Obama DOJ demanded dismissal of the entire lawsuit based on ( 1 ) its Bush - mimicking claim that the " state secrets " privilege bars any lawsuits against the Bush administration for illegal spying , and ( 2 ) a brand new " sovereign immunity " claim of breathtaking scope -- never before advanced even by the Bush administration -- that the Patriot Act bars any lawsuits of any kind for illegal government surveillance unless there is " willful disclosure " of the illegally intercepted communications .
In other words , beyond even the outrageously broad " state secrets " privilege invented by the Bush administration and now embraced fully by the Obama administration , the Obama DOJ has now invented a brand new claim of government immunity , one which literally asserts that the U.S. Government is free to intercept all of your communications ( calls , emails and the like ) and -- even if what they 're doing is blatantly illegal and they know it 's illegal -- you are barred from suing them unless they " willfully disclose " to the public what they have learned .
There are several notable aspects to what happened here with this new court filing from Obama : ( 1 ) Unlike in the prior cases where the Obama DOJ embraced the Bush theory of state secrets -- in which the Obama DOJ was simply maintaining already - asserted arguments in those lawsuits by the Bush DOJ -- the motion filed on Friday was the first response of any kind to this lawsuit by the Government .
Indeed , EFF filed the lawsuit in October but purposely agreed with Bush lawyers to an extension of the time to respond until April , in the hope that by making this Obama 's case , and giving his DOJ officials months to consider what to do when first responding , they would receive a different response than the one they would have gotten from the Bush DOJ .
That did n't happen .
This brief and this case are exclusively the Obama DOJ's , and the ample time that elapsed -- almost three full months -- makes clear that it was fully considered by Obama officials .
Yet they responded exactly as the Bush DOJ would have .
This demonstrates that the Obama DOJ plans to invoke the exact radical doctrines of executive secrecy which Bush used -- not only when the Obama DOJ is taking over a case from the Bush DOJ , but even when they are deciding what response should be made in the first instance .
Everything for which Bush critics excoriated the Bush DOJ -- using an absurdly broad rendition of " state secrets " to block entire lawsuits from proceeding even where they allege radical lawbreaking by the President and inventing new claims of absolute legal immunity -- are now things the Obama DOJ has left no doubt it intends to embrace itself .
( 2 ) It is hard to overstate how extremist is the " sovereign immunity " argument which the Obama DOJ invented here in order to get rid of this lawsuit .
I confirmed with both ACLU and EFF lawyers involved in numerous prior surveillance cases with the Bush administration that the Bush DOJ had never previously argued in any context that the Patriot Act bars all causes of action for any illegal surveillance in the absence of " willful disclosure . "
This is a brand new , extraordinarily broad claim of government immunity made for the first time ever by the Obama DOJ -- all in service of blocking EFF 's lawsuit against Bush officials for illegal spying .
As EFF 's Kevin Bankston put it :
This is the first time [ the DOJ ] claimed sovereign immunity against Wiretap Act and Stored Communications
Act claims .
In other words , the administration is arguing that the U.S. can never be sued for spying that violates federal surveillance statutes , whether FISA , the Wiretap Act or the SCA .
Since EFF 's lawsuit is the first to sue for actual damages under FISA and the Wiretap Act , it 's arguable whether this immunity argument applied to any of the previous lawsuits .
What is clear , though , is that the Bush DOJ , in any context , never articulated this bizarre view that all claims of illegal government surveillance are immunized in the absence of " willful disclosure " to the public of the intercepted communications .
This is a brand new Obama DOJ invention to blanket themselves ( and Bush officials ) with extraordinary immunity even when they knowingly break our country 's surveillance laws .
It 's difficult to read the administration 's brief in any other way than a reinforcement -- even an inflation of -- the unitary executive , or to attribute it to Bush holdovers .
This is first of the cases in which the DOJ attorneys are n't carrying over arguments from the previous administration -- they are initiating this case .
And it appears that the promises of last summer and fall when FISAAA was being argued were pretty damned empty .
As EFF points out :
" President Obama promised the American people a new era of transparency , accountability , and respect for civil liberties , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" But with the Obama Justice Department continuing the Bush administration 's cover -up of the National Security Agency 's dragnet surveillance of millions of Americans , and insisting that the much - publicized warrantless wiretapping program is still a ' secret ' that cannot be reviewed by the courts , it feels like deja vu all over again . "
Judge Walker , the judge also hearing Al - Haramain , has been hostile to these extraordinarily broad claims by the previous government , and will likely be so again .
But it seems pretty clear that the Obama administration will appeal this one , if necessary , as far as it has to .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Bromance ?
On the streets of New York , the term elicited quizzical looks from the several men I approached .
Melvin , a bike messenger with meticulous cornrows and baggy jeans , assumed I was inquiring about something related to homosexuality .
One aspiring writer nervously stammered through our brief chat and made it a point to profess his love for women repeatedly .
Only one young man , a student at Fordham , knew what a bromance was and seemed comfortable enough to profess that he was indeed a bromantic .
Why the weirdness ?
Dudes and feelings are not supposed to mix .
Watch men get nervous about bromance questions »
What is a bromance ?
Simply put : a close non-sexual relationship between two heterosexual males .
And lately it seems Hollywood can't get enough of them .
Comedies featuring bromantic unions have been big at the box office .
" Wedding Crashers " ( Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson ) , " Superbad " ( Michael Cera and Jonah Hill ) and , the latest , " I Love You , Man " ( Paul Rudd and Jason Segel ) have all showcased guys who are more than comfortable with man love .
They 've been budding on the small screen too .
MTV recently aired " Bromance , " a show where men competed to be BFFs with star Brody Jenner ( son of the Olympian Bruce ) .
There are also Chuck Bass and Nate Archibald of " Gossip Girl " ; Barney Stinson and Ted Mosby of " How I Met Your Mother " ; Turk and J.D. of " Scrubs " ; and Dwight and Michael of " The Office . "
To be clear , this is n't the stuff of the movie " Brokeback Mountain . "
These relationships are not being consummated .
But bromantics do share everything else : their innermost feelings over beers ( or a rich burgundy ) , hugs , even tears .
And to the consternation of some female partners , it 's usually pals before gals .
Experts , meanwhile , say that gals should n't necessarily worry -- as long as said bromance remains platonic .
Geoffrey Greif , a Maryland - based psychologist , adds that men who are comfortable sharing their feelings with other men may actually make better partners .
They tend to have no qualms about expressing themselves , he says .
He believes all this bromancing is an outgrowth of the metrosexual movement .
" Men are much more comfortable with grooming , with going to work out , with their bodies , " he says .
" It 's part of the outgrowth of the importance of trying to be yourself and trying to be comfortable with whom you are .
That opens the road to more openness with other men . "
Back on the streets of New York , I asked a few more men if they were open to using the " L - word " with their brothers .
Kevin , who was headed to a lunch date with a buddy said , " Maybe if I was drunk . "

AN autistic boy who was punched in the face then had his bike stolen was out playing for the first time in two years when he was hit .
Police are investigating reports that 10 - year - old Kai Goldie was attacked by two girls while riding his bike in a park on Coleford Drive , St Mellons , and the theft of his bike later that evening .
His mother Deborah Goldie said she now fears her son may not venture outside again .
Deborah , 37 , of Bodnant Close , St Mellons , said : “ I ’m really shocked .
I ’ve been so excited that he ’s been going out because generally he just stays in his room .
“ But this year there have been a lot more kids in the street and he just saw everybody playing .
“ One of his biggest fears is being punched by someone and this will set him back . ”
Kai , whose mild form of autism makes it difficult for him to socialise with other children , went out to play on Wednesday at around 6.30 pm .
He lent his bike to two girls , but they later refused to return it .
When Kai became upset , one of the girls punched him , causing his nose to bleed .
A friend of Deborah ’s was in the area and contacted the mother of three .
“ I was out my door before I even had time to put my 20 - month - old baby in the buggy , ” said Deborah .
“ I was so annoyed and he was really shaken . ”
She contacted the police who took a statement from Kai , but sometime between 7.30 pm and 10.30 pm , Kai ’s bike was taken from the garden .
Deborah described the bike as having a bright yellow frame with the word “ hummer ” written in black down the side .
Deborah said : “ When I asked him what he wanted to do he said he wanted to go back and play on his bike , but now has gone too .
“ Kids should n’t do this to any child , never mind one with autism . ”
South Wales Police said their enquiries were ongoing .

I do n't fucking know , anyway ...
Text on screen : within 48 hours two people were dead
Davida Kelley :
You know everything was backwards the way we were growing up .
Absolutely everything .
Everything that was wrong we were taught was right .
Everything that was really evil and wicked and perverted was done in the name of Jesus .
It really does fuck your head up .
01:51
Text on screen : Cult Killer the rick rodriguez story
Narrator :
Two months after Rick Rodriguez recorded his video , friends are holding his memorial .
02:14
Text on screen : March 2005 , San Diego
Narrator : Like Rick , many of them were raised in a bizzare Christian sect who practiced free love .
Don Irwin :
We 're here to say goodbye to a friend that we had , somebody who need not have passed the way that he did .
Narrator : Like Rick , many of the mourners say they were abused in the cult .
Originally called the Children of God , it followed a radical religious and sexual philosophy they named the Law of Love .
Sarah :
To show ... Elixicia ... how many people loved Ricky and how many lives that he touched .
[ at memorial service ]
Sarah : The Law of Love .
They could do anything that they wanted really .
Text on screen : Sarah Martin left The Family , 1991
03:00
Sarah :
They could do anything that wanted really as they did it out of love .
So they used that a lot for a lot of things .
For the sharing , for the swapping of couples .
So basically that was the only law that they lived under .
Because they certainly did n't abide by society 's laws .
They definitely did n't abide by those laws .
It just gave them an excuse to do whatever they want to anyone or with anyone .
03:45
Narrator : The Law of Love was the creation of David Berg , founder of the cult and promoted and encouraged through its publications .
Voice of David Berg : I practice what I preach , and I preach sex , boys and girls , Hallelujah !
I say ' fuck ' you know what I 'm talking about , do n't you ?
Every one of you know except maybe for some of the children but our kids are so smart they even know what that means .
We do n't think there 's anything evil about it .
We do n't think there 's anything wrong with it .
04:11
Don :
The circumstances of Ricky 's passing are very tragic and uncharacteristic of Ricky as a person .
Ricky would want this memorial , his memorial to be a celebration of life , not a celebration of death ...
Narrator : Don Irwin grew up in the cult and was a close friend of Rick's .
His mother Judy joined in the early days of the sect .
Judy : I actually joined in 1970 and of course , I was 20 , very vulnerable , did n't know what I was doing .
I had always wanted , since I was a kid , wanted to do something for Jesus so ...
You kind of got drawn into the fact that it looked like they were doing something because there were numbers coming at you and actually I joined ... when I joined there were 200 people , withing three years there were ten thousand people .
05:03
Narrator : The Children of God were founded in 1968 in Southern California by a charismatic Baptist minister called David Berg .
Text on screen : Mexico Teen Explosion : The Family
Unidentified male singer :
Who will take the stand and heed the call ...
Narrator :
At first , Berg preached a simple gospel , prophesying the second coming of Jesus but as his popularity grew , his sermons became more disturbing
Unidentified male singer : ... called to live and die for the kingdom as we give our all to the ...
Narrator :
By the early 80s , as film from the time shows , Berg 's band of hippie followers had mobilized into a disciplined army of converts , changing their name to The Family , they fanned out across the globe
Unidentified male singer : ... revolution for Jesus and David our king ...
Judy : I kind of got sucked in and I got sucked in before I knew ...
I really thought I was joining a Christian organization .
I thought it was what God wanted me to do .
I had no idea that eventually it would turn into dark betrayal .
06:09
Text on screen : Witnessing Video : The Family
Narrator :
To the outside world , The Family was a missionary organization spreading their word from Mexico City to Manila .
But behind the closed doors of their communes , free love was their theology .
Daniel Roselle :
At the age of seven , I remember it was in Panama , it was New Year 's and I slept on one of these trundle beds that pulls out from a bunk bed and I remember rolling over and looking and there was the ... behind of a ... of one of the sisters in the Home and she was having sex with my father less than a foot from me .
Text on screen : Daniel Roselle left The Family 1995
Daniel : I remember her name to this day .
I remember getting up and going into the bathroom and looking into my mom's room and my mom was having sex with the woman 's husband .
This was n't an anomaly .
It was part of our doctrine , it was part of our dogma and it was not something that was restricted to adults .
We were taught that as children .

Unidentified female :
He does n't get to appreciate your beauty that often ...
We should show him how we bed down here at night
Unidentified female # 2 : We love you !
Unidentified female # 3 : We love you !
Narrator : Armed with camcorders , far flung communes often recorded their exploits , sending David Berg messages of love ,
Unidentified female # 4 : Good night , we love you !
07:35
Rick : I 've tried so many things , trying to somehow fit in , somehow to find a normal life .
Everyone has said , who I 've talked to about this , " well , everybody has their problems , everybody has their fucked up life . "
But those people who say that they had no clue as to what actually went on because they were n't part of the cult .
Narrator : Rick was the result of grand sexual experiment .
His mother , Karen Zerby , was David Berg 's favorite consort and together they devised a revolutionary method of luring new recruits .
It was called " Flirty Fishing . "
Text on screen : The Little Flirty Fishy !
Phillippe La Plume : Children of God
08:30
Daniel : So , Flirty Fishing basically consisted of Family women more commonly and occasionally men , going to places where they could meet people , bars and nightclubs and what have you and making themselves available to these people , fairly readily available for sex ...
Text on screen : Japan Expo Video : The Family
09:10
Daniel :
And then there was the expectation that they would lead these people to Jesus or pray with them to receive Jesus as their savior .
Unidentified female # 5 : Here we see Faithy as she witnesses to the vice president of an oil company from Sweden and he 's asking her at this time , " Do you think I 'll go to Heaven ? "
Very sweet , very sweet man who enjoyed their contact that night .
Judy : I was never asked to share until the FFing thing came out and thenn it was kind of a pressurized thing , it was like either do it or you 're out .
Interviewer :
What was it like to have to do that ?
Judy :
What was it like ?
Interviewer : Yeah .
Judy : I do n't want to go there .
10:00
Daniel : David Berg in his writing refers to them as " God 's whores . "
My mother ... when I used that terminology , my mother took exception to that and I reminded her that it was n't I whose used the words - " God 's whores " - it was her founder ... she said she 's proud about it and proud to have done it .
Interviewer :
How does that make you feel now ?
Daniel :
It bothers me , to be honest with you ...
If you boil it down to its basic ... my mother was a prostitute
10:32
Narrator : Karen Zerby was a hooker for Jesus , one of the first .
On one trip to Tenerife , she records " fishing " 18 different men .
One of them was a local waiter , Rick 's father .
David Berg wanted an heir apparent he could mold in his own image so he adopted baby Rick , celebrating the new messiah in the cult 's publications and dotting his childhood in intimate family snaps .
11:03
Sarah :
He was almost like a ...
I do n't know , what would you compare that to ... I suppose ...
He was just very famous .
Probably one of the most famous ... sort of like next to his dad , it 's like their family was like royalty and he was like a prince , a soon to be king sort of person .
Narrator :
But the mantle of leadership came with a price .
Berg would also use his son as an ideological plaything . , pushing sexual boundaries for a new generation of disciples ...
11:41
Rick :
You may not believe in God .
I do n't , certainly not the Christian fucked up God with his big fucking dick he wants to stick up everyone 's ...
But , but I do n't know .
I 'm starting to think that life goes on and that fucking scares me , that really does scare me more than anything because I do n't know , I do n't want it to go on , I just want it to be over .
12:10
Sarah :
He talked about suicide a lot .
And I would ask him , why he felt like that , why did he want to die and he said " because I 'm already dead . "
12:36
Rick :
Ok , we 're back .
So anyway , duct tape .
You can fix anything with this fucking stuff .
Yeah , I 'm going to fix some people with this .
Anyway , ok , I 'm sorry I 'm getting all off track here .
Where the fuck was I ?
Suicide , yes , suicide .
13:05
Narrator :
Twenty - four hours after Rick recorded his video , he left his Tucson apartment and hit the freeway .
Driving west through the Arizona desert , he made his last phone call , to his estranged wife , Elixcia .
Text on screen : Elixcia Garcia - Rick 's wife - left the Family 2000
Elixcia :
He said he was afraid of dying .
I told him that I believed in angels and I told him that when he died , that he would feel love that he never got to experience in this world and he told me , " keep telling me nice stories ... "
Different parts of the conversation , he 's like " oh , I think I 'm going to pull in here and kill myself " and I 'm just freaking out ... it 's like what are you going to do ...
By this time he was really tired , I think he had been awake for like two days and he just started mumbling words , he was like " I have to go now , " he goes , " I 'm so tired , I 'm so tired of thinking . "
He was just expressing thoughts , everything that was going through his mind .
And then he was like , " I have to go now . "
0:14:41
Rick : I got in contact with my sister well I consider her my sister because to me she is .
She 's not flesh and blood but I 'm talking about Davida .
She calls me sometimes and we talk .
She tells me the stuff she 's going through and it just breaks my heart because I want to help her but there 's nothing I can do because ... it 's all up here , the damage has been done .
Narrator : David Berg frowned upon conventional families and Rick was raised by a coterie of female acolytes along with a baby girl called Davida .
The pair grew up almost as brother and sister .
15:26
Text on screen : New York
Narrator : As The Family 's patriarch continued to break sexual and religious taboos , Rick and Davida became his latest playthings .
15:40
Davida :
When I was a kid , I remember everything revolved in our lives around religion and sex .
Text on screen : Davida Kelley - left the Family 1996
Davida :
They expected us to have some interaction between ourselves with the intent that we would marry , get married and become the future heirs to the throne so to speak meaning that we would be the next future leaders - the next gurus , the next David Berg and the next Karen Zerby of our time .
Narrator : Not only were Rick and Davida encouraged to have sexual interaction , they also shared David Berg 's bed .
Davida : I must have been five years old .
I was married , supposedly , to ... I was going to become one of David Berg 's brides and there was a ceremony with a ring and everything and once I turned five years old was ... when I was implicated into being one of his queens , so to speak ...
I remember actually I used to look forward to going in and spending time with my ... with him in the evenings , me and Rick , because it was the only time that he would actually let us watch cartoons , we were absolutely not allowed to watch any TV whatsoever and it was the only time that we watched cartoons - he would always let us watch " Scooby Doo . "
Well , we did n't look forward to love - up time but that was port of the package , you get to watch Scooby Doo and eat chocolate and have ... loving interaction with Grandpa ...
There was never penetration but ... up until about 12 years old ... it was never penetration , it was just really all the other forms of molestation - touching , oral and mostly just that ...
Except it was different with Rick , he always had intercourse with the adult women ... because ... as a little boy it's ...
I suppose it 's a little different .
17:42
Daniel :
It was actually very common in The Family for the adult women to have sexual relations with young boys .
The women not only had sexual relationships with the young boys , they were also facilitators , they also gave their children to the men , it was n't just the case of sort of sticking up for your mate or your partner - the woman defending the man and being in denial - well , no , because they were active enablers and active participants in our abuse .
18:20
Text on screen : Story of Davidito
Narrator : Rick and Davida even starred in their own bedtime story printed by The Family as an example for all their children to follow .
Chapters dealt with potty training , discipline and sex .
Davida :
The book was just written by my mother because she was the one that raised , like I said , had raised Rick and myself .
So , she had just written these chronicles explaining on a day - to - day basis how we interacted and what she was teaching us and what we were learning and that included sexual encounters she had had with him and how she used to masturbate him to sleep and how she would make sure that he would have his love up time before bedtime .
It was just so ... it was really ...
I do n't know , you have to read the book .
It 's really ...
So that 's what the Davidito book was , just a book written about our lives and how we were raised and how other people should imitate the way we were raised to try to do the best to raise their children accordingly .
19:26
Narrator :
By the early 80s , David Berg was on the run from Interpol on suspicion of pimping .
Moving with Rick and Davida from one secret compound to the next he never met ordinary members .
Now , he commanded his female acolytes to send him strip videos .
19:45

Celeste : Yeah , glorify God in the dance .
It 's just sad .
It 's just ...
Text on screen : Music with Meaning : The Family
Text on screen : Celeste aged 10
Celeste : David Berg wrote a letter called " Glorify God in the Dance . "
That 's where he gave specific instructions about what he wanted to see on those dance videos .
So it came right from David Berg .
It was his idea and it was for him .
20:51
Rick :
He 's a little life , you know .
She 's a little life .
And you just fuck them over because you 're a sick fucking pervert and you do n't have anything better to do with your life that to fuck up your little kids .
It 's just so far beyond me I just can't fucking imagine it .
But yet it happened , it happened right before me .
It happened to all of you .
Narrator : Celeste 's strip video was filmed at The Family 's commune in Greece .
Led by Berg 's lieutenant Paul Peloquin , this was the unit that most enthusiastically followed the example set by Berg with Rick in the " Story of Davidito . "
Celeste : I hold Paul Peloquin responsible because he was ... he ran the communes , his word was gold and he was the one that did those dance videos when I was in Greece .
I remember him yelling and being quite physically violent with me on many occasions throughout my childhood .
I remember particular sexual abuse when I was 9 years old .
It was on the floor in the studio and ... I had to perform ... masturbate him ... and he masturbated me and then he masturbated himself in front of me .
I remember that particularly .
I do n't remember every instance because it happened so often ...
Paul Peloquin ( on video ) : Joan came to me and she said well since Dad suggested that I make love to him in the latest comment tape , do you think I should masturbate and I said of course that sounds beautiful .
22:41
Celeste :
He was the one that would use David Berg 's writings to support his position and also to help set up the schedules that I would be put on for ... sexually servicing all the men in the Home .
22:57
Text on screen : Don Irwin - left The Family 1997
Don :
They never report to anyone else except for Berg .
What happened in that location is that they they began to institute and institutionalize the pedophilia Berg was already practicing in his personal household .
And sadly what happened with that inner circle as far as some of the guys were ... is that essentially it became a pedophile ring .
They viciously abused my sister and her friend Amy as well as Celeste , in a very systematic way over a very , very long period of time .
Now the pernicious thing about all of this is that the children were inculturated to believe that this was normal .
Paul Peloquin ( on video ) :
It was really a beautiful experience .
It really ...
Narrator : Despite the allegations against Paul Peloquin , he has never been convicted of any child sexual abuse .
23:43
Rick :
What about these fucking perverts ?
Are n't they the real terrorists ?
Terrorising little kids , driving them to suicide ... is n't that like murdering them basically ?
You fuck with their minds so much that they can't go on .
Is n't that like killing them ?
24:05
Rick : I do n't know though , one of these fuckers to the head ...
I do n't think there 's going to be much time to feel anything .

Text on screen : Det. Sgt. Jeff Wade - Blythe Police Dept .
Jeff Wade : A few minutes after 8 AM on Sunday morning , our patrol officers got a call that there was a body , here at the Palo Verde Irrigation District .
located inside a vehicle parked where you can see my car is now .
Text on screen : Blythe Police Case No. 2005 - 0107 , DATE : 010905 , LOC : 180 W. 14th AVE .
CRIME : SUICIDE
Jeff :
Some of the things that we discovered in the car was key card for the Holiday Inn Express which is actually about three quarters of a mile straight across here to the southwest .
Text on screen : Blythe Police Case No. 2005 - 0107 , DATE : 010905 , LOC : 600 W. Donlen CRIME : SUC [ sticker on hotel room door 109 ]
Jeff :
It looks like he probably took a shower , cleaned up , he drank some beers .
It looked like he had laid in the bed but that he had n't slept in the bed and possibly just watched TV and rested after cleaning up and then drove this short distance over to here .
I think it was just a place where he thought he would n't be bothered , he could do what he felt he needed to do ...
It 's a very sad story and if half of what they say occurred happened , it needs to be hopefully looked into and get this abuse stopped .
Rick :
God damn , I can only imagine what my sister goes through .
She has nightmares about being dragged out of bed in the middle of the night to go and have sex with Berg .
God damn .
26:09
Davida :
It was very strange because during a lot of these sexual interactions David Berg would be getting prophecies where he would speak on account of ghosts taht he believed were possessing him ... that were good ghosts ... were saved or Christian but had gone on to heaven and that were living with Jesus and he would burst out speaking in tongues just exactly like they do in a Baptist church where they have tounges and prophecy and he would lift his hands in the air and get a prophecy say that was the best ... saying that that was the most amazing sex that you just had with the ghost gypsy .. they gypsy 's ghost would say thanks that was ... he would get a whole prophecy ... it was really disturbing
26:56
Narrator : Now aged 12 and sequestered in The Family 's secret HQ , Rick 's degradation reached new extremes .
In his father 's eyes , incest was virtuous and he encouraged Rick 's mother , Karen Zerby , to join in their sexual games .
Davida : I specifically remember a couple of accounts where we were all in the same bed .
I was required to be having sexual interaction with the guru at the time , David Berg , and I would be on his right side masturbating him while Rick would be having full sexual intercourse with his mother ... the same ... on the other side of the bed .
But it would be like a big happy family time ... between the four of us ...
Daniel :
There are a lot of things I 've sort of come to terms with .
I understand the issues of control in The Family .
But what I have n't come to understand yet is how such a large group of people , of diverse backgrounds , of diverse ethnicities , of income levels , can so readily turn to wholesale pedophilia .
Not everybody engaged in it but if you were in The Family you knew about it .
Narrator : The Family deny that Karen Zerby ever had sex with Rick and say that he himself never made this allegation .
Nevertheless , whatever happened in David Berg 's bedroom had a profound effect on Rick and his sister .
In recent years , Davida has struggled with drug abuse and today earns her living as an exotic dancer .
Rick : Jesus Christ , you know , anger does not begin to describe how I feel about these people and what they 've done .
I mean rage .
Don :
We want to release doves for Ricky and I 'm also going to read off the names of people that we 've heard of ... people who passed away who were not remembered .
This first dove is for Ricky .
Abe , Amos , Andrew Parker , Ben Farnsworth , Cherish Lloyd , Daniel Parker , Johnny of Steven and Gina , Jonas , Richard P. Rodriguez , River Phoenix , Eman ...
29:40
Narrator : Rick Rodriguez is not the only child born into The Family driven to suicide or to fatally overdose on drugs .
Over the past 10 years , around 30 have died including the actor River Phoenix whose family were once members .
Davida : Well ...
Rick and I grew up together .
We were born in the same country , same hospital ...
My mother raised us both ... and I ... I just want him to see ... that if it was n't for my family and friends who had been there for me , I can't say that I would n't have killed myself a long time ago ...
30:31
Elixcia : Rick was amazing in every way ... for the time in my life that I got to share with him ...
I have so many memories , from the first time we kissed to the first time we got our apartment .
30:53
Elixcia :
These are all his driver 's licenses .
I kept them all .
Him as a baby ...
That 's what he looked like when I first met him ...
He went through a long hair stage ... he was quite skinny at the time .
I always liked taking pictures of him ... he 'd always get mad at me .
But I 'm lucky now because I have all these pictures of him .
Narrator : Rick was 19 when he met Elixcia at the Family commune in Hungary .
Elixcia :
He came down the stairs with beautiful smile , he said " what are you doing ? " and then we just started chatting , he was like " do you know how to play cards ? " and I 'm like " No " and he 's like " Do you want me to teach you ? "
So we went up to my room , hr brought some music and we just started playing cards .
We played cards until like 2 or 3 in the morning .
We just talked and talked .
I went to breakfast the next morning , went back to my room to get my stuff , get ready for the day and he had put a rose on my bed ... and never the same after that .
32:02
Unidentified female # 6 ( singing ) :
After you 're gone , oh Dad you 're gonna break my heart , the love you showed to me ...
Narrator :
With the spread of AIDS and international authorities hot on his heels , David Berg was finally forced to act .
In 1986 , he banned sex with children .
Eight years later , a new band of altogether more wholesome disciples were saying goodbye .
In 1994 , he was dead .
Unidentified children ( singing ) : Oh Dad , we 're going to carry it on ...
Voice of David Berg : God bless you .
It 's hard for me to quit .
Well , I 'm saying goodbye !
Just start fading me out because I can't quit ...
32:45
Text on screen : Porto , Portugal
Narrator : Rick 's mother , Karen Zerby , took over as leader .
At the time Zerby , Rick and Elixcia were living in Portugal .
In 1997 , Celeste Jones joined them in the luxury compound .
Celeste : I 'm pretty sure this is the one because Rick and Elixcia stayed in that room there , where you see , going out into the patio and ... but that was their room .
I 'm pretty sure that 's the one ...
Let 's see .
Unidentified woman # 1 : Can you see ?
Celeste : Yeah ...
Wow , it 's really changed .
It looks like it could have been ... but it 's really changed
Narrator : Zerby and her entourage left the house in 2001 .
While in Portugal , increasingly reclusive and going blind , she kept a tight rein on her son .
34:01
Celeste :
She did n't give him much responsibility .
He did n't have much responsibility in that house ... and that was surprising for me because as a child we were taught that he was going to be the leader , the next leader .
I think she saw him still as her little boy and not as the man he had become .
Respecting his opinions and his wishes , I did n't see that .
It was more like still telling him what to think , what to feel , what to do and that he did n't really have anything to say back .
Narrator : Although pedophilia was banned , under Karen Zerby 's command , wife swapping remained the norm .
Celeste :
There was a prophecy given that this house was called the " house of the open pussy " and so they adopted this phrase as this house was the house of the open pussy not meaning the house and the structure itself but the people in it and that 's how we were supposed to be .
The essence was that sex was the medium to God , to Jesus .
35:10
Elixcia :
Whereever we went , Rick was always a topic of interest for people and there was always girls that wanted to get a piece of him and for me it was really hard to share him .
And her I was , what can I do , I should share him , it would be the right thing to do , it was the way we were brought up to think and then likewise there were people who wanted to date me and that was extremely hard for me because the only person in my mind was Rick , that 's the only person I want to be with .
I remember each time leaving the room and feel just really gross .
I can't explain the feeling , sometimes nothing would happen but just being in the room with that person ...
I hated it , I really did n't like it ... and every time Rick was gone , oh my god , I 'd be crying , I was beside myself .
We struggled a lot with that , a lot .
36:01
Rick :
They sure fucked up our brains .
Used us as slaves because that 's what we were , every last fucking one of us ... no matter how we were treated , we were fucking slaves , just there for those sick fuckers ' pleasure .
That 's all it was .
That 's how it was in Grandpa and Mama 's house .
36:25
Narrator : Rick showed little appetite for the mantle of leadership forced upon him by David Berg .
As he grew older he became increasingly angry with his mother , rejecting everything she stood for .
In 2000 , with little education and no money , Rick and Elixcia left Portugal and The Family for America .
They went northwest , to Tacoma where they knew several ex-cult members .
The couple 's new life began in a cheap apartment on the edge of town .
Elixcia : Just waking up every morning was just amazing because it was just the two of us .
We chose what time we woke up .
We chose what time time we went to bed .
We chose whether we could turn the TV on .
We chose what we had for dinner .
We chose if we did n't want to eat .
But it was our life .
There may not have been much to it but it was ours .
Every single time we ever discussed the topic of his past , of Karen ...
37:34
Narrator : Ex-cult members began contacting Rick , pressurising him to take a stand against their abusers .
Raised to be leader , it was a role he found difficult to refuse .
Elixcia : People would ask him , " Why are n't you doing something about it ?
If you know the truth , you more than anybody else will be believed because of where you were . "
They 're like , " You owe it to us , " and here he is , he 's got a good job , he 's got a happy life and it's hard for him to think it was fair for him to have been given that second chance when there were kids out there that were hurting .
38:22
Narrator : Drove south to Arizona .
Rick :
My mom 's going to pay for that .
She 's going to pay dearly , one way or another .
If I do n't get to her and life goes on , I 'm going to keep hunting her in the next life , let me tell you .
38:40
Rick :
Here in our great state of Arizona , Jesus - land , as some people call it , if you catch an adult sexually abusing a minor , if you catch them in the act , you can walk up to them and execute them and it would be a justifiable homicide , a legal shooting .
Text on screen : Tucson , Arizona
39:12
Narrator :
As leader of a cult with many enemies , Karen Zerby 's whereabouts were a closely guarded secret .
When Rick left The Family , he broke off all contact with her .
So when he decided to challenge his mother over the abuse he had suffered , he had to find her first .
Sarah : I knew he had a plan to find his mother .
I knew that was all that he really wanted to do .
He really wanted to confront her face to face and ask her and get some answers .
Elixcia :
He was searching for his meaning in life .
He really was .
And I think he finally came up with the conclusion that his reason for living was to make right his mother 's wrongs .
40:07
Narrator :
In the summer of 2004 , news reached Rick that his mother had recently visited his grandparents in a Tucson retirement home linked to The Family .
In September he moved to the city and waited for her to make an appearance .
He made contact with his aunt , Zerby 's sister , who lives in Tucson and shuns the cult .
Interviewer :
This must have been very difficult for you because so much of his anger was directed at his mother , your sister .
I mean , you were caught in the middle of this in a sense .
Rosemary Kanspedos :
No , I was n't caught in the middle .
He was my nephew .
He needed help .
He was the one that was going to be helped and any anger he had , he had a right to it .
His mother did n't take care of him .
He did n't have a mother .
Tom Kanspedos : Growing up in ... where he was and not doing drugs , getting out , I thought , You 're amazing that you 've gotten out and this is the first step and you 're struggling right now , it 's very difficult but take another step , keep taking one step at a time ...
Rosemary :
He sat one time and just said " I do n't know .
I do n't know if I can go on . "
And this was probably a week or so before .
And I had known that it was coming .
It was n't a question of ... a matter of " maybe it'll come " it was a matter of when it was going to happen .
41:50
Narrator : Rick rented a room in a rough part of town and found a job as an electrician .
He practised martial arts at a local gym and joined a gun club .
And he waited for his mother .
Four months after arriving in Tucson , Rick set up his new video camera and pressed record .
Rick :
There 's this need that I have .
This need .
It 's not a want , it 's a fucking need and I wish it was n't but it is .
It 's a need for revenge , it 's a need for justice .
Because I can't go on like this .
Text on screen : Det. Ben Jimenz - Tucson Homicide Unit
Ben Jimenz : The Blythe , California police department contacted us on the morning of January 9th .
They found a suicide victim by the name of Ricky Rodriguez and upon contacting his wife in Washington , they found out that Ricky lived here at this apartment complex and he had mentioned some things to her that were somewhat alarming , that possibly there might be a murder victim here in his apartment .
We walked in and the apartment was relatively clean and well kept and a female victim was laying , elderly female , she was laying on the carpet .
It appeared that her throat had been slashed , there were some defensive wounds to her arm , some cuts on her arms as well .
43:45
Narrator :
The woman Rick killed was n't his mother .
It was her close confidante , Angela Smith .
Smith had helped raise Rick and features in the Story of Davidito under the pseudonym Sue .
He arranged to meet her early in the evening of January 8th , planning to force her to reveal his mother 's whereabouts .
Rick : I 'm not trained in torture methods which is why I 'm going to have to make do .
I 've got my drill here .
The reason why it 's got this fucking padding on it is just to try to silence it a bit because I 'm in an apartment .
I 've got a soldering iron , heat .
This rather crude implement I think can work wonders especially if it 's used in the right way .
But I 'm not trained .
I do n't know how to fucking do this .
I do n't even want to do this .
God damn it .
44:45
Narrator : As Rick drove to his death , he called his wife , 1500 miles away in Tacoma , one last time .
Elixcia :
The hardest thing about it was that as she was dying , he said she did n't understand what she had done and I 'm like " oh , she did n't get it .
These people do n't get it . "
He said , " I was n't expecting that answer .
I do n't understand how they cannot see what they have done . "
45:21
Narrator : Despite the savagery of the murder , there was no evident torture and it's not clear whether Angela told Rick where his mother was nor is it clear if he set off across the desert to hunt down his mother , or see his wife or simply to find a quiet place to die .
Interviewer :
It 's pretty extraordinary to want to kill your own mother , is n't it ?
Davida :
Well , when your mother fucks you as a child , instead of being your mother , loving and endearing and teaching you in the right ways ... instead when you fuck your little boy , that 'll do that to you .
That might make you want to kill your mother when you grow up .
It really does fuck your head up .
46:08
Rick :
But yeah , I 've guess I 've fucking said all I can say .
What can I say ?
I would have had a happy peaceful life .
I tried .
I did .
Maybe I did n't try hard enough .
I gave it what I could , you know .
I did .
Unidentified woman # 2 : He wanted to understand .
He wanted to care .
He wanted to do something about the pain that I had suffered and others had suffered like himself .
Sarah : I think many times about why , why did he have to do it that way , why would he cross that line to actually kill someone .
The only thing I can think of is because I think he realized is that 's what it would take , something like that in order to get people 's attention .
47:25
Text on screen :
The Family declined to be interviewed for this film .
The Family concede there may have been isolated instances of sexual abuse in the early 1980s but deny that paedophilia was ever institutionalized .
The Family say in 1986 Rick 's mother , Karen Zerby , was responsible for introducing strict child protection rules .

Americas Watchdog and its Homeowners Consumer Center have been leading in a national and state by state investigation of toxic imported Chinese drywall .
Initially the toxic drywall was discovered in Florida .
Americas Watchdog now has proof of significant quantities of toxic Chinese drywall in Texas , Louisiana , California , Nevada , Mississippi , Alabama , Virginia , Georgia , Connecticut , Oklahoma , Colorado and other U.S. States .
The group estimates that over 100,000 homes in Florida alone have this toxic Chinese drywall .
According to the group , " Exposure to toxic Chinese drywall is making people sick with upper respiratory issues , nose bleeds , unexplained rashes , headaches , sinus issues , and it corrodes , or degrades copper , silver & lead , and or causes air conditioning coils to fail .
We need President Obama , the U.S. EPA , and the CDC to get immediately involved so we can find out what this toxic Chinese drywall is doing to hundreds of thousands of innocent U.S. homeowners and their families . "
For more information contact the Homeowners Consumer Center at 866-714-6466 or contact the group via their web site at http://HomeownersConsumerCenter.com.
" We applaud U.S. Senator Bill Nelson for his efforts in Florida , but much more is needed .
The toxic Chinese drywall is making homeowners , their children , and senior citizens sick , and we need help . "
The group says , " Help includes what is in the toxic drywall that is making people sick ; we need a testing protocol that is effective so that home inspectors can test a home with reliable methods that will help determine how toxic a home with Chinese imported drywall actually is .
We also need structural tests that will determine if the nail plates or metal wood hangers in a home have deteriorated , because of exposure to the gasses , emitted by the Chinese toxic drywall . "
For more information about the toxic Chinese drywall please call 866-714-6466 or contact the Homeowners Consumer Center 's web site at http://HomeownersConsumerCenter.com.
" We are also super worried about New Orleans , Louisiana , Mississippi , Texas , the Florida panhandle and other areas affected by hurricanes like Katrina .
Many repair crews with no licenses , or insurance bonds , installed imported Chinese drywall in homes affected by these storms .
Congress may need to allocate emergency funds to help the tens of thousands of innocent homeowners , who now have toxic Chinese drywall in their homes . "
The group thinks there could be 100,000's of remodeled homes with the toxic Chinese drywall in all U.S. states as well as the Gulf States .
This is why testing is so important .
Note to national or regional homebuilders in Florida & other states : According to the President of Americas Watchdog , " We have heard you intend to destroy myself , or our organizations , for exposing your liability in endangering 100,000's of innocent U.S. citizens with toxic Chinese drywall .
For the record , I have failed in the past , and I will never forgive myself , and I have devoted my life to making things right for everyone .
However , I did not expose 100,000's of U.S. citizens to a Chinese toxic drywall product that could make them sick .
I did not hire over a million undocumented construction workers , and then invent a 1099 tax fraud scheme that has cheated Federal & State tax authorities out of tens and tens of billions of dollars , with no investigation from the U.S. IRS ( even though we have been calling for one for almost four years -- Google Americas Watchdog undocumented workers ) .
We did not commit appraisal fraud by over inflating the values of our nations homes , like you did , and in doing so , help create our nation 's current housing disaster , ( but I warned about it : June 2005 Money Magazine -- Appraisal Fraud your home at risk ) . "
Americas Watchdog and its groups have been trying to help every US citizen since 2001 .
" We also warned about a huge mortgage kickback scheme , called a yield spread premium , that affects 50 million homeowners , and the U.S. Congress has yet to change the transparency rules -- banks have no disclosure requirement to tell a U.S. homeowner they raised the consumer 's mortgage interest rate / monthly mortgage payment , and in doing so , received thousands of extra dollars .
This group includes homebuilders . "
( Google Americas Watchdog Yield Spread Premium ) . "
" Many of these homeowners have now lost their homes .
But we tried , and we will continue to try to get the word out about these , and other important issues .
And we will continue to try to make things right for everyone , " the group 's president continues .
" Am I a failure and a nothing ?
Yes .
Will I continue to try to make things right ?
Yes .
And I will not back down on on the toxic Chinese drywall issue for anyone living in Florida , or any other state . "
In the meantime , Americas Watchdog is begging the Obama Administration to get the full force of the U.S. EPA , the U.S. CDC and Congress involved in what is about to become the worst homeowners environmental disaster in U.S. history , according to the group .
" President Obama , the toxic Chinese drywall issue is national , it 's not just in Florida and the nation needs your help & leadership with this dire situation . "
For more information contact the Homeowners Consumer Center at 866-714-6466 or contact the group at their web site at http://HomeownersConsumerCenter.com.
Americas Watchdog and its Homeowners Consumer Center are all about homeowner , consumer and taxpayer protection .
Note : " And yes , Americas Watchdog does need to work with law firms on the toxic Chinese drywall issue in the listed states .
And we will abide by all ethical rules .
100,000's of Americans stand to lose everything , including their health , because of imported toxic Chinese drywall . "

Premier Dalton McGuinty is warning that Ontario 's pension plan safety net is n't large enough to cover auto workers should GM go bankrupt .
He says the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund has about $ 100 million in it – money that comes nowhere near meeting any liabilities for the auto sector alone , to say nothing of all the other troubled sectors .
McGuinty would n't say whether he agreed with Ottawa 's assertions about the likelihood of bankruptcy for GM and Chrysler and maintains he 's committed to helping the sector .
Regardless of what happens , McGuinty says there 's a " real pension issue " and the government bears some of the responsibility for it .
The Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund has provided pensioners with up to $ 1,000 per month in the case that a pension plan fails to provide its full benefit , or any at all .

Virginia Foxx : Matthew Shepard 's Murder Not a Hate Crime
Updated , 6:21 p.m. ET
Rep. Virginia Foxx ( R - N.C. ) has done it again .
Earlier this month she dropped the racially charged term " tar baby " on the House floor .
Today , she said the murder of 21 - year - old Matthew Shepard in 1998 was not a hate crime .
" It 's really a hoax that that continues to be used as an excuse for passing [ hate crimes ] bills , " Foxx said on the House floor during debate on the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act .
Foxx opposes a bill being considered that would extend federal hate crimes protections to cover crimes committed because of a person 's gender , sexual orientation or disability .
She called Shepard 's murder a " very unfortunate incident " but said " we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery .
It was n't because he was gay . "
And guess who was in the House gallery to hear Foxx say this ?
Matthew Shepard 's mother , Judy , according to Democratic sources .
To refresh your memory on what happened to her son > two men tied the University of Wyoming college freshman to a fence and savagely pistol whipped and beat him to death .
Before doing it , one of the killers tauntingly said to Shepard , " It's Gay Awareness Week . "
Ironically , Foxx is part of a GOP leadership team tasked with finding embarrassing , " You - Tube worthy moments " of vulnerable Democratic freshmen and sophomores .
Here 's what gay liberal blogger John Arivosis has to say about Foxx 's comments .
Stay tuned : there will be plenty more outrage from the gay rights community .
UPDATE : The Human Rights Campaign , a leading Washington based gay - rights group , is furious with Congresswoman Foxx .
" Vile lies , like the one spread by Rep .
Foxx today on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives about Matthew 's brutal hate - fueled murder , continues to underscore how extreme anti-LGBT opponents have become , " says Brad Luna , a spokesman for HRC .
" It is no longer acceptable in this day and age to just come right out and say you do n't like gay people .
Instead , extremist opponents of equality must resort to these types of malicious and twisted lies .
Rep .
Foxx should be ashamed of herself . "
HRC also notes the following groups have endorsed the hate - crimes bill opposed by Foxx : the National Sheriffs Association ; International Association of Chiefs of Police ; 26 state Attorneys General ; the National District Attorneys Association ; the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights ; the Anti-Defamation League ; the NAACP ; the National Council of La Raza ; the Presbyterian Church ; the Episcopal Church ; and the National Disability Rights Network .
As J.J. Abrams ' reboot of the Star Trek franchise boldly goes into cinemas , it 's time for us to go looking for real - life phasers .
While warp drive and transporters clearly belong to the far future , the American military has been working hard to turn sci- fi 's favorite ray gun into a reality .
The famous " set phasers to stun " command sums up the weapon 's two key advantages :
It has several different modes , and it can be used to knock out a target without harming them .
Both of these are capabilities that the military has been seeking ever since they got serious about non-lethal arms in the 1990's .
The fictional phaser has always been a benchmark for nonlethal weapons , and it has inspired numerous directed energy projects .
“ It ’s the closest thing we have right nowto the phasers on the television series ‘ Star Trek , ’ ” Marine Colonel George Fenton told * National Defense * magazine in 2002 , talking about the Pulsed Energy Projectile ( PEP ) .
Colonel he said .
“ Remember how Capt .
Kirk was always saying ‘ set your phasers on stun ? ’
The projectile works like that . ”
Well , not exactly .
The PEP fires a short , intense laser pulse .
This vaporizes the surface of the target , creating plasma which absorbs the rest of the laser energy — and detonates with a flash , bang and electromagnetic pulse .
The idea was that the PEP could be used on low power to warn or stun , or on high power to kill .
Things got more interesting when it turned out that stunning effects were caused by the effect of the electromagnetic pulse on the nervous system , making it possible to tune it to cause excruciating pain , or ' Taser - like ' effects .
In 2002 , Fenton was convinced the PEP would be on battlefields within the decade .
Alas , it was n't meant to be .
The PEP was shelved after six years and $ 14.2 million .
The program was criticized in a recent Government Accountability Office report as one of six programs where the military " did not make timely decisions about when to discontinue its research efforts when several years have passed without substantive progress . "
The PEP has n't quite disappeared , though , as Danger Room recently revealed .
Although considered unsuitable as a non-lethal weapon , PEP - like technology has been taken on by U.S. Special Operations Command ; they 're developing it to shoot down small unmanned aircraft .
Other nonlethal weapons taking their cue from Star Trek include the chunky laser rifle known as " Personnel Halting and Stimulation Response , " or PHaSR .
This incorporates two different lasers : one is a distracting " dazzler , " the other an infra-red device which heats up the skin causing a " repel effect . "
( More pain , in other words . )
It 's an interesting idea , although laser dazzlers are not new , and the repel effect only works on exposed skin .
It might be useful for stopping someone from advancing , or forcing them to drop a knife , but has obvious limitations .
At any rate , it 's the one you 're most likely to face , as the NIJ are developing the technology for police forces .
An altogether more ambitious weapon is a device for projecting ball lightning at high speed , which goes by the name " Phased Hyper - Acceleration for Shock , EMP , and Radiation . "
( Yup , PHASER . )
Inventor Paul Koloc says that the device " can be used for a range of purposes from stunning personnel to destroying the functionality of electronically operated devices , smaller rockets and vehicles ... this dial - able PHASER weapon can be set on ‘ Stun ’ or dialed down , selecting a non-lethal level for persons needed for later interrogation . "
However , a key aspect of the technology — generating a stable ball lightning that can then be compressed and fired — is still under development and funding is being sought .
Almost any non-lethal directed energy weapon invites comparisons with the Phaser , but sometimes this is n’t too convincing .
The Pentagon 's Active Denial System or " pain beam " currently weights nine tons and has a warm - up time of sixteen hours ; plus it only has one setting , " painful heating . "
But in one sense , the Active Denial System really is the closest thing to a Phaser .
According to the production notes for the original Star Trek series , the name " phaser " was a contraction of " Photon Maser . "
The Maser ( a name formed from the acronym Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of radiation ) was invented before the laser ; lasers were originally known as " optical masers . "
Masers were initially more powerful than lasers and the makers of Star Trek at least thought they had more weapons potential .
At the heart of the Active Denial System is a Gyrotron – a free electron Maser .
So , while it can't stun or disintegrate , the Active Denial System is at least a maser and it does fire photons making it a Phaser in one sense .
But there are more sophisticated weapons on the horizon .
Take the Multimode Directed Energy Armament System ( MDEAS ) research project .
If it works , it really will be phaser - esque — with both lethal and non-lethal settings .
MDEAS relies on an ultrashort laser pulse ( one measured in million millionth of a seconds ) to create an ionized channel through the air .
This channel can then be used to conduct a powerful electric shock to the target to stun or kill .
The channel can also act as a waveguide for an intense pulse of microwave energy which can burn out electronics — useful for stopping vehicles and defeating roadside bombs .
Even better , at least one version of the device will be portable enough for Kirk and company to carry around with them .
The Multimode Directed Energy Armament System is still at the laboratory stage , but by the end of 2011 there should be a rugged prototype which works in a realistic environment .
Then they need to start work on those starships …

John Cleese , Andrew Sachs , Prunella Scales and Connie Booth were reunited on Wednesday for a specially made documentary celebrating Fawlty Towers ' 30th anniversary .
Despite the fact only 12 episodes of the comedy were ever made , the cast have ruled out the possibility of ever producing another .
Mr. Leeson is BB&T Professor for the Study of Capitalism at George Mason University and author of the new book , The Invisible Hook : The Hidden Economics of Pirates ( Princeton University Press ) .
Few characters in history inspire as much fascination or mystery as pirates .
For this reason pirates make perfect fodder for pop-culture , which typically depicts sea scoundrels as irrational , if entertaining , characters .
Pirates ’ apparent madness is n’t purely the product of Hollywood producers , however .
A cursory examination of pirate history seems to confirm pirate madness as well .
What else are we to make of pirates ’ seemingly irrational destruction of cargo , gruesome tortures , and even their flamboyant flag of skull - and - bones ?
Each of these practices is a genuine part of early 18th - century pirates ’ history .
But could these and other infamous pirate behaviors be rational ?
In my new book , The Invisible Hook : The Hidden Economics of Pirates , I argue that they are .
Pirates were businessmen ; they were in it for the money .
And each of their seemingly strange behaviors contributed to their bottom line , which is why they engaged in them .
Consider , for instance , pirates ’ infamous flag , the Jolly Roger .
It seems strange that outlaws seeking to avoid the authorities ’ detection would loudly announce their presence with an unmistakable ensign of skull - and - bones .
But beneath this irrational patina lay cunning , piratical business smarts .
Pirates were n’t the only sea scoundrels operating in the Caribbean in the early 18th century .
State - sanctioned Spanish and French “ coast guard ” ships trolled these waters as well .
This posed a potential problem for pirates .
Because of their legal status , coast guard ships were constrained in how violent they could be toward ( allegedly interloping ) merchant ships they accosted .
Because of their outlaw status , pirates , in contrast , were totally unconstrained in this regard .
That meant that between the two , pirates were the more fearsome belligerents , and thus the more important to surrender to if you were a merchantman .
Why did this matter ?
Because a major cost of doing business for pirates was battling prospective prizes .
Contrary to popular portrayal , pirates did n’t look forward to fighting their quarries ; they sought to avoid conflict whenever they could because it eroded their profits .
If pirates had to engage their prey with booming cannon and clashing cutlasses , some of their own might be injured or killed in the contest .
Battle could also damage the pirates ’ ship , or worse yet , damage the prize .
To keep costs down pirates therefore needed to minimize violent conflicts with their prey .
Since pirates typically outmanned and outgunned their prey by a factor or three or more , it was n’t hard to encourage merchantmen ’s peaceful surrender . . . if merchantmen knew their attackers were pirates as opposed to coast guard vessels .
Ultimately , then , to conserve on the costs of conflict , pirates needed a way to identify themselves to their prey and distinguish themselves from coast guard attackers .
What better way to do this than to fly a flag depicting the strength , death , and destruction they could unleash if they were resisted ?
Enter the Jolly Roger .
The Jolly Roger was a well - known symbol of piracy .
For pirates , this was n’t a problem .
Their punishment if they were captured was the same whether they flew the Jolly Roger or not — the hangman ’s noose .
But coast guards were reluctant to adopt this flag since doing so would place them beyond the bounds of the law .
Flying the Jolly Roger would make coast guard vessels pirates and thus render their otherwise legitimate enterprise punishable under the law .
Because of this , pirates could use the Jolly Roger to communicate their pirate status , while coast guards tended not to fly the pirate flag .
When a merchantman saw the black flag , it could reasonably conclude its attacker was a pirate , which it knew it should n’t resist , allowing pirates to take the prize without a costly fight .
Pirates ’ seeming “ madness ” when interacting with legitimate members of society has a similar rational , and economic , foundation .
After pirates secured the peaceful surrender of their quarries at the sight of the Jolly Roger , their work was n’t done .
They still had to locate loot on board .
The problem was that merchant sailors were naturally reluctant to give their booty up to their pirate attackers .
Some tried to hide their valuables .
Others resorted to destroying them .
To prevent this , pirates did what you might expect . . . if they were rational businessmen : they fostered an image of themselves so terrifying that few would dare to do anything other than to immediately yield their valuables up to their pirate captors .
One way pirates created a terrifying reputation was by ruthlessly dealing with prisoners they caught hiding or destroying booty .
This is where most stories of pirate brutality come from .
Some pirates were sadists .
But most were simply cunning businessmen .
They understood that indiscriminately brutalizing captives would not only not help them achieve their goals ; it would actually undermine their goals .
If sailors came to expect torture whether they cooperated with the pirates or not , they would n’t have an incentive to cooperate , leading to the very hiding and destruction of booty pirates sought to avoid .
Thus , rather than torturing prisoners wantonly , many pirates treated cooperative captives more kindly .
In some cases they even showed generosity to compliant captives , no doubt to encourage others to peacefully yield to them in the future .
Another way pirates fostered a terrifying image was by displaying a “ devil - may - care ” attitude to those they encountered .
They threw goods they did n’t want overboard , engaged in seemingly senseless destruction , and openly declared to captives that they feared neither God nor the law .
Sailors led by such pirate posturing to believe that pirates might fly off the handle if they were n’t satisfied were naturally more inclined to comply with pirate demands , enhancing pirates ’ profit .
Strange as it may seem , far from irrational , pirates were as clever and calculating as any contemporary entrepreneur .
The unusual ( and entertaining ! ) behaviors we know pirates for were n’t the result of an inherent unusualness in pirates themselves .
They were the result of rational pirate profit seeking in the rather unusual economic context pirates operated in .

If you think having loads of money , fetching looks , or the admiration of many will improve your life — think again .
A new study by three University of Rochester researchers demonstrates that progress on these fronts can actually make a person less happy .
" People understand that it 's important to pursue goals in their lives and they believe that attaining these goals will have positive consequences .
This study shows that this is not true for all goals , " says author Edward Deci , professor of psychology and the Gowen Professor in the Social Sciences at the University .
" Even though our culture puts a strong emphasis on attaining wealth and fame , pursuing these goals does not contribute to having a satisfying life .
The things that make your life happy are growing as an individual , having loving relationships , and contributing to your community , " Deci says .
The research paper , to be published in the June issue of the Journal of Research in Personality , tracked 147 alumni from two universities during their second year after graduation .
Using in - depth psychological surveys , the researchers assessed participants in key areas , including satisfaction with life , self - esteem , anxiety , physical signs of stress , and the experience of positive and negative emotions .
Aspirations were identified as either " intrinsic " or " extrinsic " by asking participants how much they valued having " deep , enduring relationships " and helping " others improve their lives " ( intrinsic goals ) versus being " a wealthy person " and achieving " the look I 've been after " ( extrinsic goals ) .
Respondents also reported the degree to which they had attained these goals .
To track progress , the survey was administered twice , once a year after graduation and again 12 months later .
This post - graduation period was selected because it is typically a critical developmental juncture for young adults , explains lead author Christopher Niemiec , a doctoral candidate in psychology at the University .
" During this formative period , graduates are no longer in the home or at the university .
For the first time , they are in a position to determine for themselves how they want their lives to proceed . "
As with earlier research , the study confirmed that the more committed an individual is to a goal , the greater the likelihood of success .
But unlike previous findings , this analysis showed that getting what one wants is not always salubrious .
" There is a strong tradition in psychology that says if you value goals and attain them , wellness will follow , " says Niemiec .
" But these earlier studies did not consider the content of the goals . "
What 's " striking and paradoxical " about this research , he says , is that it shows that reaching materialistic and image - related milestones actually contributes to ill - being ; despite their accomplishments , individuals experience more negative emotions like shame and anger and more physical symptoms of anxiety such as headaches , stomachaches , and loss of energy .
By contrast , individuals who value personal growth , close relationships , community involvement , and physical health are more satisfied as they meet success in those areas .
They experience a deeper sense of well - being , more positive feelings toward themselves , richer connections with others , and fewer physical signs of stress .
The findings in this study support Self - Determination Theory , a well - established theory of human motivation developed by two of the paper 's authors , Deci and fellow University psychologist Richard Ryan .
The theory holds that well - being depends in large part on meeting one 's basic psychological needs for autonomy , competence , and relatedness .
Intrinsic aspirations make people happy because they fulfill these foundational needs , conclude the authors .
" Intrinsic aspirations seem to be more closely related to the self , to what 's inside the self , rather than to what 's outside the self , " Niemiec explains .
Striving for wealth and adulation , on the other hand , does little to satisfy these deep human requirements , at least within this early career stage of life .
In addition , this was a well - educated sample , and the authors stress the need for research in other demographics and age ranges .
Yet for this young adult group , the authors suggest that time devoted to extrinsic pursuits , like working long hours , often crowds out opportunities for psychologically nourishing experiences , such as relaxing with friends and family or pursuing a personal passion .
Craving money and adoration also can lead to a preoccupation with " keeping up with the Joneses " — upward social comparisons that breed feelings of inadequacy and jealousy .
And unlike the lasting benefits of caring relationships and hard - earned skills , the thrill of extrinsic accomplishments fade quickly ; all too soon , the salary raise is a distant memory and the rave review forgotten .
The research was supported in part by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health .
Over the past few weeks I ’ve been thinking about web site redesigns and what a ridiculous process it can be in higher education .
Even a simple site ( 40 - 100 pages ) at my University takes anywhere from two months to a full year depending on how many people are involved .
It seems after 6 - 12 months faculty and staff get tired of looking at the same homepage and their first thought is “ the site looks old and is ready for a redesign ” .
We web workers know the tale all too well , from “ the site needs more movement ” to “ everything we put out is green and gold ( school colors ) , can we use a different color to make our site stand out ? ”
So I am proposing with all web site redesigns to work right into the proposal a schedule of changes based on some basic parameters .
These incremental changes will make the site feel fresh and new while re factoring itself to better fit the users needs in the process .
Everyone is happy , especially the web design and development team who can spend their time working on something more meaningful .
A / B Testing
This has to be the best technique to show clients ( administrators ) the direct reactions to design / copy changes ( especially ones they make ) .
The fastest and free way to do this is with Google Website Optimizer .
Google makes is easy to setup , you just have to create two unique URL ’s for your content setup and a conversion page .
Run it for a desired number of conversions and it maps and give you direct results .
I found it works great with navigation ordering or “ promotion ” placement .
Another great way to use A/B testing on your own or with Google Optimizer is alternating content for internal vs external audiences .
Most universities own a range of IP ’s so it is easy to program your site to display different content based on the users location .
Although you cannot guarantee that a prospective student is not using a computer on campus , you have a high likelihood they ’re not .
So putting a greater emphasis on prospective student content for outside computers could yield better results .
Hidden features
One thing we have done especially with higher traffic sites over time is pepper in some hidden features .
It may sound silly but when people discover that an arrow they never clicked before opens a drawer and they can get more information they get excited .
Its these types of experiences as long as they add value can make a user enjoy browsing your site and keep them coming back .
What is nice is Google Analytics has the ability to track page view and actions .
This way you can see what percentage of users are discovering these features .
User test groups
The most direct way to get feedback is to actually watch users use your site .
It does n’t even have to be direct focus groups in a formal setting , a great way is to just go to the library and watch users use your site .
I like to go up to a random student and ask something like “ Im not a student yet but I am trying to look for some scholarships , where is the best place to do that on the ____.edu site ” and just see where they take you .
Or even if you do n’t go up to them and have them use your site , seeing how they interact with the sites they do visit ( facebook is an exception ) can be super valuable .
Agile design / writing / development
With testing and analytics designers / writers / developers get immediate feedback and understand what is working and how users are interacting with your site .
It also shows that your institution cares , not just administration coming through every once and a while , but small and frequent successes .
But remember , it is all about conversion .
Every homepage needs to have a goal , where do you want the user to go , how do you want them to get there .
These simple tweaks need to increase your conversion rate .
Start with the site or page that will make the most impact , if you oversee your university ’s admissions site , start there .
If you just oversee a single department start with the program information and request information areas .
The web is flexible and adaptable , use it to your advantage .
Last but not least , show results .
It not only gives you approval to make the changes but also brings a level of legitimacy and authority to you or your team .
Wash , rinse and repeat
Do n’t get me wrong there are some great and valid reasons to redesign .
If your site has outgrown its current navigation , the needs of your users have changed or the business goals of your department have changed , then a redesign is in order .
Washington , D.C. -
Two public interest groups today called on the government to stop blocking the release of information about a secret intellectual property trade agreement with broad implications for privacy and innovation around the world .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and Public Knowledge said that the April 30th release of 36 pages of material by the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) was the second time the government had the opportunity to provide some public insight into the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , but declined to do so .
More than a thousand pages of material about ACTA are still being withheld , despite the Obama administration 's promises to run a more open government .
" We are very disappointed with the USTR 's decision to continue to withhold these documents , " said EFF Senior Counsel David Sobel .
" The president promised an open and transparent administration .
But in this case and others we are litigating at EFF , we 've found that the new guidelines liberalizing implementation of the Freedom of Information Act have n't changed a thing . "
EFF and Public Knowledge filed suit in September of 2008 , demanding that background documents on ACTA be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) .
Initially , USTR released 159 pages of information about ACTA and withheld more than 1300 additional pages , claiming they implicate national security or reveal the USTR's " deliberative process . "
After reconsidering the release under the Obama administration 's new transparency policies , the USTR disclosed the additional pages last week , most of which contain no substantive information .
However , one of the documents implies that treaty negotiators are zeroing in on Internet regulation .
A discussion of the challenges for the pact includes " the speed and ease of digital reproductions " and " the growing importance of the Internet as a means of distribution . "
Other publicly available information shows that the treaty could establish far - reaching customs regulations over Internet traffic in the guise of anti-counterfeiting measures .
Additionally , multi-national IP industry companies have publicly requested that ISPs be required to engage in filtering of their customers '
Internet communications for potentially copyright - infringing material , force mandatory disclosure of personal information about alleged copyright infringers , and adopt " Three Strikes " policies requiring ISPs to automatically terminate customers '
Internet access upon a repeat allegation of copyright infringement .
" What we 've seen tends to confirm that the substance of ACTA remains a grave concern , " said Public Knowledge Staff Attorney Sherwin Siy .
" The agreement increasingly looks like an attempt by Hollywood and the content industries to perform an end - run around national legislatures and public international forums to advance an aggressive , radical change in the way that copyright and trademark laws are enforced . "
" The USTR 's official summary of the process , released last month , recognized the lack of transparency so far while doing nothing to broaden stakeholder input or engage public debate , " said International Affairs Director Eddan Katz .
" The radical proposals being considered under the Internet provisions deserve a more transparent process with greater public participation . "
Litigation in the case will now continue , with USTR asking U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer to uphold its decision to conceal virtually all of the information that EFF and PK seek concerning the ACTA negotiations .

Their warning went unchecked by the Education Department , the Department of Community Services and police from the child protection unit , culminating a month later in the drugging and multiple rape of another teenage girl .
In March , Bailey , 43 , pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual intercourse with a person in his care .
Pointing out the obvious to society at large .
Glenn Beck 's getting increasingly strident and desperate in his attempt to portray the Obama White House as a den of Communism .
Yesterday he opened up with yet another " Comrade Update " that actually depicted visiting British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a totalitarian simply for having extolled " cooperation . "
By that standard , I guess , Sesame Street is a Commie Indoctrination Program .
And at this point , I honestly would n't be surprised to find out the Beck indeed believes that to be the case .
In any event , he followed this smear by immediately having on Sam Webb of the Communist Party USA , claiming that Webb had declared Barack Obama a Communist ally :
Beck :
You said that he was not only a friend , but an ally .
Webb : I do n't think I said that .
I only said that he is a people 's advocate .
Beck :
No , you said an ally .
Webb :
No , I do n't think I did .
I made the speech , you did n't .
Actually , if you peruse the speech in question , you 'll see that Beck is wrong .
Maybe this is the part he 's thinking of :
In the meantime , we have some immediate struggles on our hands
But the good news is that the broad movement that elected President Obama and larger majorities in the Congress is up and running .
This movement , or if you like , this loose coalition in which labor plays a larger and larger leadership role , can exercise an enormous influence on the political process .
Never before has a coalition with such breadth walked on the political stage of our country .
It is far larger than the coalition that entered the election process a year ago ; it is larger still than the coalition that came out of the Democratic Party convention in August .
The task of labor and its allies is to provide energy and leadership to this wide - ranging coalition .
Yes , we can bring issues and positions into the political process that go beyond the initiatives of the Obama administration .
But we should do this within the framework of the main task of supporting Obama ’s program of action .
We can disagree with the Obama administration without being disagreeable .
Our tone should be respectful .
We now have not simply a friend , but a people 's advocate in the White House .
What is in fact most remarkable about Webb 's speech is that , unlike conservatives , Communists -- who have clear philosophical differences with Obama and could similarly wish for him to fail -- are more concerned that Obama 's plan succeed because it 's better for the country .
In other words : A bunch of Commies are more concerned about the nation 's economic well - being than Conservatives are .
Beck in any event tries , McCarthylike , to bait Webb into casting Obama in the line of Communist thinkers , like Marx or Lenin -- and Webb refuses .
Webb :
He 's not a Socialist , he 's not a Marxist .
Beck :
Why do you push yourself away from Lenin and Marx ?
Webb : I do n't , myself , but Barack Obama does .
He 's not a Socialist , he 's not a Communist .
You know , you bandied that about during the campaign , and now people are bandying it about town , and the answer is no .
Beck at this point interrupts Webb , and spends the next three minutes talking over him and badgering him .
At one point he asks : " Why ca n't you have a real conversation ? "
Answer should have been : " Because you keep interrupting , you moron ! "
But there you have it , folks .
Glenn Beck : A New McCarthy for a New Century !
Today Good Morning America featured a couple whose roles reversed when Rick got laid off , forcing his wife Eleanor to work more .
Rick found that he likes being " Mr. Mom , " but Eleanor does n't respect him .
Rick likes that he can be there for their 7 - year - old daughter , but Eleanor says , " I do n't like coming home and seeing him in my apron . "
Eleanor says she does n't know if she can learn to respect her husband if he can't find a job because , " that 's one of the basic things that little girls grow up thinking , that the man is going to put a roof over her head he 's going to support the family . "

Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol has criticized the sentences received by the crew of The Pirate Bay , branding them as “ way over the top ” .
The band 's frontman also says if you 're a file - sharer and you know how to get music for free , " f** king go for it . "
Meet you at The Pirate Bay then ?
Ever since the whiter - than - white judge threw the book at The Pirate Bay Four in their recent trial , many in the music industry have been most vocal and , it has to be said , most jubilant at the news of this historic victory .
There have n’t been that many words of support for The Pirate Bay from the music world , so it ’s interesting to read some comments today printed in Scotland ’s Big Issue .
The court in The Pirate Bay case decided that for assisting others to commit copyright infringement , the four defendants would receive fines of around $ 905,000 each plus one year in jail .
Gary Lightbody of the alternative rock band Snow Patrol does n’t agree with this punishment , and has criticized the sentences handed out to the four as “ way over the top ” .
“ They should n’t have been jailed .
A year in jail for someone doing that is crazy , ” Lightbody said .
“ The punishment does n’t fit the crime . ”
Arrr , Snow Patrol
Lightbody went on to say that he was n’t against file - sharing at all .
“ This is the modern way , ” he added .
Indeed it is and you can go around sueing everyone , be pragmatic as Lightbody appears to be , or you can do something about it and try and turn it to your advantage , like the band Trivium are attempting .
“ Let ’s recreate the tape trade virally and all that sh*t .
This is today and this is the Internet , so get out there , grab those CD ’s , rip them , copy them , compile them , cut out the shit you do n’t like , ” says Trivium frontman Matt Heafy .
Interesting , since Trivium are signed to Roadrunner Records , along with likes of Slipknot and Nickelback .
“ Make your own Trivium CD , hand it out , mail it out , upload it , zip it , FTP it … do it .
With today ’s fast flowing lives with the Internet and quick paced progress , now is the time for music to match that and evolve to the next level , get it out let people know what your all about , let people know what type of fan you are ! ”
We ’ll let Gary Lightbody have the last word , “ This is what we ’ve brought on ourselves and you have to live in the society you created .
Music is available to everyone if they know how to get it and I say f**king go for it . ”
Let ’s waste no more time then .
You can download ( and upload ) lots of Trivium ’s music – with their blessing – from The Pirate Bay .

As we reported yesterday , President Obama ’s Iraq “ withdrawal ” plan will leave up to 50,000 troops in a warzone engaging in combat missions .
Today the president detailed the plans for members of Congress , and said the remnant forces , which would remain for an indefinite period of time , will be in Iraq to “ advise Iraqi troops and protect US interests . ”
The decision to keep such an enormous number of ground troops in the nation after the war is ostensibly over , engaging in combat no less , does not sit well with many in Congress .
The White House briefings are meant to shore up support for Obama ’s new position , a stark contrast from his campaign promises .
During the campaign the president spoke repeatedly of a 16 month timetable , but backed off of it almost immediately after taking office .
The current plan would spell a significant cut in ground troops in 19 months , but leaves open the question of when ( or even if ) the Obama Administration ever intends to formally leave the nation .
In a speech at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , President Obama declared that “ by August 31 , 2010 , our combat mission in Iraq will end . ”
He added that he intends to remove the up to 50,000 others by the end of 2011 .
In between those two dates , however , the troops will continue to conduct “ targeted counter - terrorism missions , ” which seems to be combat in everything but name .
With careful feeding , bacteria can produce vaccines against themselves , scientists in the US and China have found .
If proven safe , the method could greatly simplify the process of making vaccines against dangerous bacterial illnesses , such as pneumonia .
’ Bacteria grow lots of polysaccharides ( complex sugars ) on their surface - it ’s similar to the way humans grow hair , ’ says Peng George Wang , one of the authors of the study at Ohio State University , US .
These sugars form the outermost layer of the bacteria and play a critical role in how they interact with immune cells in the body .
By attaching these tell - tale sugars to carrier proteins , they can be injected into the body to provoke an immune response , building up resistance against the bacteria and acting like a vaccine .
But the sugars alone are typically not enough to trigger a strong immune response .
’ For a vaccine , you need to make the polysaccharides more active , ’ Wang says , but the modifications needed to boost activity can be difficult .
Now , Wang and colleagues at Shandong University and Nankai University in China , have found a much simpler way to do this .
By supplying the bacteria with ready - modified sugars , the team discovered that the bacteria take them up and incorporate them into the structure .
’ We feed the bacteria these chemicals while they are growing , and those chemicals end up in the polysaccharides , ’ Wang adds .
’ This way , we do n’t have to do anything to modify the polysaccharides - we let bacteria do it for us . ’
The team demonstrated the technique by switching one of the sugars in Escherichia coli for a number of different analogs .
Wang hopes that by harvesting the sugars from mutated bacteria like this , vaccines against a wide variety of bacterial illnesses could be created and produced cheaply .
The lab have already started investigating the potential for a new vaccine against the pneumococcus bacteria - which is typically responsible for causing pneumonia - funded by a $ 100,000 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Although vaccines against pneumonia are currently available , at around $ 50 per injection they are too costly for use in the developing world .
’ This is an innovative strategy to reengineer a metabolic pathway , ’ says Chris Whitfield , a cell biology expert at the Universityof Guelph in Ontario , Canada .
’ Other bacteria and other pathways should be amenable to similar approaches and the cell surfaces can be modified in many different ways . ’
There are also other possible applications for the technology , Whitfield thinks .
’ One can envisage exploiting these structures to follow pathogens in cells and tissues , ’ he adds .
’ Also , the modification provides a robust scaffold on the cell surface for applications such as targeted delivery of specific ligands and prodrugs . ’

WASHINGTON  President Obama has slammed high - flying executives traveling in cushy jets at a time of economic turmoil .
But soon he will have to decide whether to proceed with some of the priciest aircraft in the world  a new fleet of 28 Marine One helicopters that will each cost more than the last Air Force One .
A six - year - old project to build state - of - the - art presidential helicopters has bogged down in a contracting quagmire that will challenge Mr. Obama ’s desire to rein in military contracting expenses .
The price tag has nearly doubled , production has fallen years behind schedule and much of the program has been frozen until the new administration figures out what to do about it .
The choice confronting Mr. Obama encapsulates the tension between two imperatives of his nascent presidency , the need to meet the continuing threats of an age of terrorism and the demand for austerity in a period of economic hardship .
Equipped to deflect missile attacks and capable of waging war from the air , the new VH - 71 helicopters would fly farther , faster and more safely than the current decades - old craft .
But each improvement pushes up the cost .
The program ’s original $ 6.1 billion contract has ballooned to $ 11.2 billion , and the Pentagon notified Congress last month that it was so far over budget that the law required a review .
The Obama administration now must determine if the project is essential to national security and if there are alternatives that would cost less .
The Wikimedia Foundation , the organization behind the popular Wikipedia website , has called for the project 's contributors to vote on a proposal which calls for the adoption of the Creative Commons Atribution Share - Alike ( CC - By - SA ) license .
This change would lower the barriers for repurposing content from the Internet encyclopedia .
Wikipedia content is currently made available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License ( GFDL ) , which was devised by the Free Software Foundation to govern the distribution of technical documentation that was produced by the GNU project .
The license was adopted for Wikipedia early in the project 's existence .
When Wikipedia participants submit content , the editing page currently includes a notice which informs them that they must irrevocably agree to release their contributions under the terms of the GFDL .
The GFDL serves most of the project 's needs , but it has some well - known flaws and limitations .
It is not compatible with the GPL or any Creative Commons licenses .
This weakness has largely prevented Wikipedia material from being mixed with other free culture content .
The GFDL also imposes significant burdens on print distribution , which consequently reduces public accessibility of the content .
The CC - By - SA license is functionally similar in intent but provides greater flexibility , clearer language , and fewer restrictions .
Although the case for migrating to CC - By - SA is very strong , the Wikimedia Foundation was previously unable to do it because individual Wikpedia contributors retain possession of the copyright for the content that they submit .
The Wikimedia Foundation can't unilaterally migrate all of the content to an incompatible license because it does n't have the rights to do so .
The compatibility issue made it seem impossible for Wikipedia to ever migrate to a Creative Commons license .
The situation changed last year when the Free Software Foundation released an update to the GFDL .
The update included language which enabled CC - By - SA migrations within a narrow time window between November 1 , 2008 and August 1 , 2009 .
The change was made specifically to enable Wikipedia and other projects in a similar position to make licensing changes .
The GFDL change has made it possible for the Wikimedia Foundation to proceed with a potential relicensing effort , but — in conformance with Wikimedia 's governance policy — the organization has opted to give its contributors the opportunity to participate in the decision - making process .
The Wikimedia Board of Trustees has endorsed a proposal to dual - license Wikipedia content so that it is available under both the GFDL and CC - By - SA license .
The proposal states that the most burdensome restrictions of the GFDL have not been enforced by the Wikimedia Foundation , but it acknowledges that these restrictions are problematic and detrimental to the project .
" Wikimedia is committed to the widest possible dissemination of free knowledge .
While our terms of use have always allowed for lower barriers to re-use , their inconsistency with the license text leads to fear , uncertainty , and doubt about what is legal and what is not .
It advantages those re-users who can afford legal advice and research over those who cannot .
This is counter to Wikimedia 's mission , " the proposal states .
" The proposed license update is designed to achieve greater interoperability and greater re-use of free knowledge world - wide in service to our vision : a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge . "
Voting will be open to all content contributors who have made at least 25 edits before March 15 , 2009 .
If the proposal is supported by a majority of the voters , it will be passed to the board of trustees for approval before it is implemented .
Because the board has already endorsed the proposal and it's relatively uncontroversial in nature , it seems likely that it will be implemented .
In a statement that was published on Tuesday , Wikimedia Foundation deputy director Erik Moeller provided more details about the dual - licensing process , the board 's position on the issue , and the reasons why dual - licensing will be advantageous for the project and its users .
He explains that the electronic voting will be administered and overseen by Software in the Public Interest and that the vote will be tallied by a committee of selected Wikimedia volunteers .
The board hopes to have the voting process finished in early May .

The New York Post issued an apology on Thursday night “ to those who were offended , ” while maintaining that the cartoon was not intended to be racist .
Gov. David A. Paterson , Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand , the Rev. Al Sharpton and others expressed concern on Wednesday morning over an editorial cartoon in The New York Post that showed a police officer telling his colleague who just shot a chimpanzee , “ They ’ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill . ”
Critics said the cartoon , drawn by Sean Delonas , implicitly compared President Obama with the primate and evoked a history of racist imagery of blacks .
The chimpanzee was an apparent reference to the 200 - pound pet chimpanzee that was shot dead by a police officer in Stamford , Conn. , on Monday evening , after it mauled a friend of his owner .
Speaking at a conference of the New York Academy of Medicine on Wednesday morning , Mr. Paterson said that while he had not seen the cartoon , he believed that The Post should explain it .
Given the possibility that some people could conclude the cartoon had a racial subtext , Mr. Paterson said the newspaper needed to clarify its meaning .
“ It would be very important for The New York Post to explain what the cartoon was intended to portray , ” Mr. Paterson said in response to a question about whether the cartoon ’s depiction of a monkey was racist , as Mr. Sharpton has suggested .
“ Obviously those types of associations have been made .
They do feed a kind of negative and stereotypical way that people think .
But I think if it ’s enough that people are raising this issue , I hope they would clarify . ”
Senator Gillibrand , Democrat of New York , said in a statement : “ I found the Post cartoon offensive and purposefully hurtful .
This type of cartoon serves no productive role in the public discourse . ”
City Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr. , a Queens Democrat , called for a boycott of the newspaper .
“ To run such a violent , racist cartoon is an insult to all New Yorkers , ” he said in a statement .
“ This was an unfortunate incident in which a human being was seriously injured - not an opportunity to sling dangerous rhetoric .
It is my belief that The New York Post owes an immediate apology to this city for demonstrating such terrible judgment and insensitivity . ”
Mr. Comrie urged New Yorkers to “ demonstrate their displeasure with the New York Post by writing letters to their advertisers and simply stop purchasing a publication that clearly has no respect or sensitivity for people of color . ”
On Wednesday evening , the Brooklyn borough president , Marty Markowitz , also weighed in , saying :
My office has received complaints about this so - called cartoon , and I can see why .
If its disturbing connection to reprehensible racial stereotyping was unintentional , it just proves once again how disconnected The Post is from New York City and its residents .
And for such a weak joke ?
There ’s no excuse .
The ‘ editors ’ overseeing such content should be ashamed — and held accountable .
The Post is always quick on the attack , so now we ask that they do the right thing and apologize to all who were offended by this tasteless cartoon .
A newsroom employee at The Post , who spoke on condition of anonymity because employees were not permitted to comment on the matter , said its newsroom received many calls of complaints on Wednesday morning after the publication of the cartoon .
“ Every line was lit up for several hours , ” the employee said .
“ The phones on the city desk have never rung like that before . ”
Many
Post staff members were dismayed by the cartoon , the employee added .
The cartoon was on Page 12 of Wednesday ’s edition , next to the paper ’s Page Six gossip column .
On Page 11 , the reverse side , was a photograph of President Obama signing the stimulus bill into law in Denver .
Mr. Sharpton , who has been an unflattering subject in cartoons drawn by Mr. Delonas in The Post , said in a statement on his Web site :
The cartoon in today ’s New York Post is troubling at best , given the racist attacks throughout history that have made African - Americans synonymous with monkeys .
One has to question whether the cartoonist is making a less than casual inference to this form of racism when , in the cartoon , the police say after shooting a chimpanzee , “ now they will have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill . ”
Being that the stimulus bill has been the first legislative victory of President Barack Obama ( the first African American president ) and has become synonymous with him it is not a reach to wonder whether the Post cartoonist was inferring that a monkey wrote it ?
In a statement , Col Allan , editor in chief of The Post , denied Mr. Sharpton ’s assertion that the cartoon was “ racially charged . ”
Mr. Allan said :
The cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event , to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in Connecticut .
It broadly mocks Washington ’s efforts to revive the economy .
Again , Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist .
A 2001 cartoon by Mr. Delonas depicted Fernando Ferrer , the Bronx borough president who was seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor that year , kissing the buttocks of Mr. Sharpton — a depiction that was widely criticized as demeaning , and even racist .
In a phone interview , Mr. Sharpton said he planned to hold a protest outside The Post ’s Midtown offices at noon on Thursday .
“ What does shooting a chimpanzee have to do with a stimulus bill ? ” Mr. Sharpton said .
“ This raises all the racial stereotypes we are trying to get away from in this country . ”
He added : “ I ’m not speaking on behalf of the president or the chimpanzee .
I ‘m speaking on behalf of the offended African - American community . ”
Mr. Delonas has drawn ire from a number of groups for past cartoons in The Post .
In 2006 , the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation denounced a cartoon of his that showed a man carrying a sheep wearing a bridal veil to a “ New Jersey Marriage Licenses ” window , a reference to the State Supreme Court ’s ruling that year requiring the state to grant same - sex couples the same legal rights and benefits as heterosexual couples through civil unions .
Andrew Rojecki , associate professor of communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago and co-author of “ The Black Image in the White Mind ” ( University of Chicago Press , 2000 ) , a study of racial attitudes and their relationship to mass media content , said he found the cartoon deeply troubling .
“ Of course I would say it ’s racist , ” Professor Rojecki said in an interview .
“ There ’s no question about it . ”
He added , “ The cartoonist , whether he did this consciously or not , was drawing upon a very historically deep source of images about African - Americans that African - Americans do not have a lot of control over . ”
Such images are harmful on a number of levels , he said .
“ Even people who do not harbor deep - seated prejudices , because they have stereotypes deeply embedded in their consciousness , may react unconsciously when those associations are triggered , ” he said .
Professor Rojecki rejected Mr. Allan ’s assertion that the cartoon was devoid of racial content .
“ It strains credulity to imagine that there is any association between a chimpanzee that was shot because it had attacked someone and a bill that has successfully passed through Congress , ” he said .
“ It makes no sense .
What possible explanation could there be ? ”
Jan Nederveen Pieterse , a professor of global studies and sociology at the University of California , Santa Barbara , and author of “ White on Black : Images of Africa and Blacks in Western Popular Culture ” ( Yale University Press , 1995 ) , said , “ I agree the cartoon is racist , without a doubt . ”
Professor Pieterse , who is Dutch , said that portrayal of non-Westerners as primates became well - established in both the United States and Europe in the late 19th century , and has affected not only blacks , but also the Irish and Chinese , for example .
“ It ’s absolutely outrageous , ” he said of the cartoon , “ and I think people are concerned because it sets a nasty , mean , very aggressive tone .
You ca n’t get any lower . ”
Now that the Somali Pirates have been decisively ... killed , their fellow pirates are vowing to " retaliate . "
Oh geez .
Hey guys , pirates — you 're going about this the wrong way .
Follow this friendly advice , before you 're all destroyed :
Do not fuck with America any more :
If you do , you will be totally wiped off the map , okay ?
Just do n't .
If you do , you will be totally wiped off the map , okay ?
Just do n't .
More hippie , less terroristy :
The reason you pirates became folk heroes in the first place was , 1 . you were n't fucking with Americans ( see above ) , and 2 . because you embodied a certain sort of free - living ideal that appealed to average Americans trapped by American suburban luxury .
If you can believe it !
The guns and things should be props , just for show , not something you use to actually shoot people .
Be the new Merry Pranksters , not the new Al - Qaeda .

You must regain the affection of the media : Look , the US media is by and large a big herd of sheep , led by a few wolves .
Everyone in the media is afraid to be a contrarian , except for the handful of professional contrarians , who are ignored .
When some shit like the kidnapping of the Captain incident happens , it becomes a contest to see which media outlet can most strenuously condemn you .
For chrissake , even the NYT and the New Yorker have lost their sense of bemusement and bleeding heartism about the pirate situation .
They 're agreeing with Glenn Beck , like this was 9/11 .
Well , fuck that .
What you must do , pirates , is to cultivate a few loud voices who are n't afraid to steer the rest of the sheeplike media back towards a more understanding point of view .
It 's a classic PR strategy .
Turn one reporter and watch the rest follow .
Make friends with some of those ragged East African correspondents .
Give some exclusives .
They 'll love you for it !
The rote rewriters stateside will defer to those on the scene — your new friends .
So play nice .

Think like a 21st century capitalist , not an 18th century one : Piracy , really ?
It 's cool and everything , but the money in piracy is not in holding boats for ransom .
Your time has run out on that .
Nations are now officially pissed .
Soon you will start getting dead from doing the hijacking thing .
So think bigger : exploit the pirate fantasy for cash .
Look how well Disney 's done with it .
And you 're much cooler than Disney .
The time has come to move into pirate merchandising , pirate experiential tourism , pirate speaking tours , and all the other lucrative spinoffs of your pirate " brand " that do n't involve being shot by Navy SEAL snipers .
Hello , US college campus speaking tour , complete with t- shirt sales , a hastily recorded CD of pirate songs , and a pitch for weeklong excursions on a genuine pirate boat off the Somali coast , only $ 3,999 ?
And television , guys .
Television !
Spike TV just ordered up a reality show called Pirate Hunters about the US Navy hunting you down .
A reality show starring the pirates would get five times the ratings .
There are plenty of Hollywood agents willing to fly to Somalia to make this happen .
You guys can corner the pirate fantasy market in a year .
Get off those skiffs and get on it .

ParseTree is a library that allows to access the parse tree of Ruby code - either Ruby source code or Ruby code already loaded in the interpreter .
Ryan Davis , who is one of the developers behind ParseTree , now makes it clear in a post on ParseTree 's future :
ParseTree is dead on ruby 1.9 and there is no plan to make it work .
Because of changes to internals in 1.9 , ParseTree simply can not work .
I asked for hooks / options to allow us to get to the information but they never arrived .
Specifically if you 're using ParseTree to access the AST of a live method / block / proc , you 're SOL .
If you 're just using ParseTree to do static analysis , then you can switch to
ruby_parser in about a minute of work and you 're good to go .
While ParseTree continues to work fine on Ruby 1.8.x , it wo n't work on Ruby 1.9.1 .
There are solutions for parts of ParseTree 's functionality , though .
Ruby 1.9.x comes with Ripper , which allows to parse Ruby code and analyze their parse trees .
ruby_parser is a Ruby parser written in Ruby ( by Ryan Davis ) ; the output is the same as ParseTree 's output .
Static Analysis tools that work on source are best served by switching to ruby_parser , mostly because it does n't require code changes ( ruby_parser 's output is the same as ParseTree's ) .
Ruby_parser also provides source locations of AST nodes , which is obviously necessary for code analysis or code transformation tools in Ruby .
Using ruby_parser also allows these tools to be used across all Ruby implementations - ParseTree is only available for MRI ( a mostly complete version for JRuby exists , but lacks some runtime features ) .
However , there is one feature that ruby_parser can't provide : return the parse tree of Ruby code loaded in an interpreter .
Some libraries make use of this feature to analyze Ruby code at runtime .
One of them is Merb 's action arguments , which look at the formal arguments of a method .
The feature a was already ported to JRuby without the use of ParseTree .
Now , a port to Ruby 1.9.1 is available with the methopara project .
Methopara came from work by YARV creator Sasada Koichi and members of asakusa.rb , one of Tokyo's Ruby user groups .
The methopara project brings a new API to Ruby 1.9.1 :
This gem is only for Ruby - 1.9.1 .
Because Ruby18 x have merb-action - args , and Ruby - 1.9.2 and its successors will have built - in Method # parameters .
Do you use ParseTree ?
Can you switch to ruby_parser or is the lack of ParseTree on 1.9.x a problem ?
WASHINGTON — The U.S. program of drone aircraft strikes against higher - ranking officials of al Qaeda and allied militant organizations , which has been touted by proponents as having eliminated nine of the 20 top al Qaeda leaders , is actually weakening Pakistan ’s defense against the insurgency of the Islamic militants there by killing large numbers of civilians based on faulty intelligence and discrediting the Pakistani military , according to data from the Pakistani government and interviews with senior analysts .
Some evidence indicates , moreover , that the top officials in the Barack Obama administration now see the program more as an incentive for the Pakistani military to take a more aggressive posture toward the militants rather than as an effective tool against the insurgents .
Although the strikes have been sold to the U.S. public as a way to weaken and disrupt al Qaeda , which is an explicitly counter - terrorist objective , al Qaeda is not actually the main threat to U.S. security emanating from Pakistan , according to some analysts .
The real threat comes from the broader , rapidly growing insurgency of Islamic militants against the shaky Pakistani government and military , they observe , and the drone strikes are a strategically inappropriate approach to that problem .
“ Al Qaeda has very little to do with the militancy in the tribal areas of Pakistan , ” said Marvin Weinbaum , former Afghanistan and Pakistan analyst at the Bureau of Intelligence Research at the U.S. Department of State and now scholar - in - residence at the Middle East Institute .
John McCreary , a senior intelligence analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency until his retirement in 2006 , agrees with Weinbaum ’s assessment .
“ The drone program is supposed to be all about al Qaeda , ” he told Inter Press Service ( IPS ) in an interview , but in fact , “ the threat is much larger . ”
McCreary observes that the targets in recent months “ have been expanded to include Pakistani Pashtun militants . ”
The administration apparently had dealt with that contradiction by effectively broadening the definition of al Qaeda , according to McCreary
Ambassador James Dobbins , the director of National Security Studies at the Rand Corporation , who maintains contacts with a range of administration national security officials , told IPS in an interview that the drone strikes in Pakistan are aimed “ in the short and medium term ” at the counter - terrorism objective of preventing attacks on Washington and other capitals .
But as they have shifted to Pakistani Taliban targets , Dobbins said , “ To degree the targets are insurgents and are Pakistanis not Arabs it would be correct to assess that they are part of an insurgency . ”
That raises the question , he said , whether the drone program “ is feeding the insurgency and popular support for it . ”
The drone program cannot even be expected to be a decisive factor in al Qaeda ’s ability to operate , according to McCreary .
“ All you can do with drones is decapitate leadership , ” McCreary told IPS in a recent interview .
“ Even in relation to al Qaeda ’s organizational dynamics , it has only limited , temporary impact . ”
McCreary warned that the drone strikes will cause much more serious problems when they increase and expand into new parts of Pakistan as the administration is now seriously considering , according to an April 7th New York Times article .
“ Now al Qaeda is fleeing to other cities , ” said McCreary .
“ The program is escalating and having ripple effects that are incalculable . ”
McCreary said one of the longer - term consequences of the attacks is “ the public humiliation of the Pakistan Army as a defender of the national patrimony . ”
That effect of striking Pakistani targets with U.S. aircraft is “ the least understood dimension of the attacks , the most discounted and most dangerous ” .
McCreary said the attacks ’ “ ensure that successive generations of Pakistani military officers will be viscerally anti-American . ”
Administration officials have defended the drone strikes program as necessary to weaken and disrupt al Qaeda to prevent terrorist attacks , and officials have leaked to the media in recent weeks the fact that the program has killed nine of 20 top al Qaeda leaders .
But the Pakistani government leaked data last week to The News in Lahore showing that only 10 drone attacks out of 60 carried out from Jan. 29 , 2009 to Apr. 8 , 2009 actually hit al Qaeda leaders , while 50 other strikes were based on faulty intelligence and killed a total of 537 civilians but no al Qaeda leaders .
The drone strikes have been even less accurate in their targeting in 2009 than they had been from 2006 through 2008 , according to the detailed data from Pakistani authorities .
Of 14 drone strikes carried out in those 99 days , only one was successful , killing a senior al Qaeda commander in North Waziristan and its external operations chief .
The other 13 strikes had killed 152 people without netting a single al Qaeda leader .
Dobbins , speaking to IPS before the Pakistani data on drone strikes was released , said it was difficult for an outsider to evaluate the benefits of the program but that “ we can assess that there is a significant price that is being paid ” in terms of the impact on Pakistani opinion toward U.S. efforts to stem the tide of the insurgency .
Dobbins said one of the reasons for the continuing drone attacks , despite the high political price , is that “ it is an incentive aimed prodding the Pakistani government . ”
He said he believes the United States would be happy to trade off the strikes in return for a more effective counterinsurgency campaign by the Pakistani government .
Further bolstering that interpretation of the objective of continued drone strikes is a report , in the same story in The News , that the most recent strike took place only hours after U.S. officials had reportedly received a rejection by Pakistani authorities Apr. 8 of a proposal for joint military operations against militant organizations in the tribal areas from U.S. South Asia envoy Richard Holbrooke and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm .
Mike Mullen , who were visiting Islamabad .
Other analysts suggest that the program has acquired bureaucratic and political momentum because it a politically important symbol that the wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan are against al Qaeda and because the United States has no other policy instrument to demonstrate that it is doing something about the growth of Islamic groups that share al Qaeda ’s extremist Islamic militancy .
McCreary believes that the program is related to the fear of the Obama administration that it would be unable to get support for operations in Afghanistan if it did n’t focus on al Qaeda .
“ I think it was a way to link Afghanistan operations to al Qaeda , ” he said .
“ That suggests to me that the tactic for motivating domestic support is influencing the policy , ” said McCreary .
The former senior DIA analyst added that the drone strike program “ has acquired its own momentum , which is now having immense consequences . ”
Weinbaum told IPS in an interview that the drone attacks are being continued , “ primarily because we ’re enormously frustrated , and they represent the only thing we really have . ”
Sure , you probably slather on the sunscreen when you go to the beach , but what does the discerning BitTorrenter use to protect file transfers from the harsh light of day ?
Northwestern University researchers suggest " SwarmScreen , " their new torrenting obfuscation tool .
It 's not encryption — and that 's the point .
Professors Fabi�n Bustamante , Roger Guimer� , and Luis Amaral assembled a team to look at BitTorrent swarms , and their research revealed something curious : " user connection patterns reveal strong communities . "
That is , most BitTorrent users actually tend to connect to the same sets of peers , a natural affiliation that arises based on shared interest in films , TV shows , music , or all that legal content The Pirate Bay says it hosts .
Encrypting the transfers would obscure the contents of the files being traded , but it would still reveal the identities of swarm members .
As Northwestern describes it , this means that " the patterns of connections — not the data itself — is sufficient to create a powerful threat to user privacy . "
( In a similar way , deep packet inspection gear can often identity data types , such as P2P traffic , simply by analyzing data " flows , " not by peeking into packets or relying on header information . )
Because people tend to group themselves in communities , third parties can " enable a guilt - by - association attack , where an entire community of users can be classified by monitoring one of its members . "
The research team shows that someone watching BitTorrent can correctly slot a particular user into a " community " with 86 percent accuracy simply by monitoring 1 percent of the network .
Thus , SwarmScreen .
The Vuze / Azureus open - source plugin starts a host of random torrents ( comprising between 25 percent and 50 percent of a user 's BitTorrent activity ) to provide " plausible deniability " to BitTorrent users .
The random torrents create enough noise in the data that it becomes impossible to sort users into communities .
The recording industry , no doubt gnashing its teeth at such research , will be even less pleased to note that it was all funded by Uncle Sam through a pair of National Science Foundation grants .

Benâs Log , A revelation has come to me .
After years of confusion and desperation , I believe I finally understand .
I believe I finally understand everything , and that is all I have ever asked in return for my many sacrifices .
It 's perfectly clear now : Jacob was not the island , Richard is .
Jacob was an incarnate version of an old god , hidden here in a place where old gods could still exist , not at odds with the modern world outside .
Jacob was the avatar of a god , as was his brother , but it 's Richard who is the avatar of the island itself .
He cannot die in this place because he is this place .
These long years have had me thinking that I served the island through Jacob , but I was merely serving Jacob because it is what the island , Richard himself , asked of me .
It is Richard who should have my loyalty .
Richard who is truly important to me .
It is Richard who has my answers .
And at long last I believe thereare answers to be had ...
P.S. Nevermind .
Richard was just beaten to death by a four - toed , bird - headed giant named ADAM - 1 .
His death was foretold by the talking polar bear totem thatâs apparently been haunting the dreamtime of the Oceanic Six .

A community of microbes that have lived cut off from the rest of the world for more than 1.5 million years has been discovered beneath a vast glacier in the Antarctic .
The organisms have survived in total darkness on nothing but the minerals and long - decayed organic matter that were also trapped at the base of the glacier .
Instead of breathing oxygen , they have learnt to " breathe " iron to produce energy .
The discovery of the microbes demonstrates the tenacious capacity of life to survive in the most extreme environments , and raises the prospect that it may one day be possible to find life in equally extreme environments both on Earth and on other planets .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" It 's a bit like finding a forest that nobody has seen for 1.5 million years , " said Professor Ann Pearson of Harvard University , one of the scientists who made the discovery .
" Intriguingly , the species living there are similar to contemporary organisms , and yet quite different – a result , no doubt , of having lived in such an inhospitable environment for so long . "
The scientists discovered the microbes by analysing the very salty water flowing out of a crack in the wall of the Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of East Antarctica .
The glacier is famous for its " Blood Falls " , an outflow of rusty - red mineral deposits first discovered in 1911 .
The brine seeping from the glacier contained no oxygen , indicating that it had been isolated from the atmosphere , but it did include the telltale genetic signatures of living organisms living beneath the mass of ice .
The scientists believe that the microbes are descended from a population of marine organisms that once lived in an ancient ocean that had become a landlocked briny pond before being covered in the glacier between 1.5 m and 2 m years ago .
The exact size of the pond is not known but it lies more than 1,300 feet below ice , about 2.5 miles from Blood Falls .
" This briny pond is a unique sort of time capsule from a period in Earth 's history , " said Jill Mikucki of Dartmouth College , New Hampshire , the lead author of the study , published today in the journal Science .
The scientists obtained a cold , clear sample of the brine as it flowed from a crack in the glacier .
" When I started running the chemical analysis on it , there was no oxygen .
That was when this got really interesting .
It was a real Eureka moment , " Dr Mikucki said .
" The brine is about four times more salty than seawater and so it does not freeze , despite being at a temperature of about - 10C .
The chemical analysis showed that the genes of the microbes found in the brine were closely related to the genes of modern - day marine microbes even though they have been cut off from the ocean for more than a million years .
The salts associated with these features are marine salts , and given the history of marine water in the dry valleys , it made sense that subglacial microbial communities might retain some of their marine heritage , " Dr Mikucki said .
Scientists at the site are using the same sort of analytical techniques to search for extreme terrestrial life forms that they hope to use in the search for life on Mars and Europa , the frozen moon of Jupiter .
Feet suggest hobbits unrelated to H. erectus Paleoanthropology
The extinct hominids commonly known as hobbits may have been small of body and brain , but their feet were flat and exceptionally long .
Scientists , completing the first detailed analysis of the hominid 's foot bones , say the findings bolster their controversial interpretation that these individuals belonged to a primitive population distinct from modern humans that lived as recently as 17,000 years ago on the Indonesian island of Flores .
The new anatomical evidence , being reported today in the journal Nature , is unlikely to solve the mystery of just where the species - formally designated Homo floresiensis - fits in human evolution .
That fact even the researchers acknowledge , and some of their critics still contend that the skull and bones are nothing more than remains of modern pygmy humans deformed by genetic or pathological disorders .
The controversy erupted almost immediately after the H. floresiensis discovery was announced in 2004 .
The single skull was unusually small , indicating its brain was no bigger than a chimpanzee's .
It topped a body little more than 3 feet tall .
Now the examination of lower limbs and especially an almost complete left foot and parts of the right , the researchers reported , shows that the species walked upright , like other known hominids .
There were five toes , as in other primates , but the big toe was stubby , more like a chimp's .
Stranger still was the size of the feet - more than 7 1/ 2 inches long , out of proportion to its short lower limbs .
The imbalance evoked the physiology of some African apes , but it has never before been seen in hominids .
And then there were those flat feet .
Humans sometimes have fallen arches and flat feet , but scientists noted that this was no human foot .
The navicular bone , which helps form the arch in the modern foot , was especially primitive , more akin to one in great apes .
Without a strong arch - that is , flat - footed - the hominid would have lacked the spring - like action needed for efficient running .
It could walk , but not run like humans .
Weighing the new evidence , the research team led by William L. Jungers , a paleoanthropologist at the Stony Brook University Medical Center on Long Island , N.Y. , concluded that " the foot of H. floresiensis exhibits a broad array of primitive features that are not seen in modern humans of any body size . "
The team contended that it is improbable that all of these traits from head to toe - including small brain and primitive shoulders and wrists , as previously reported - " were simply a consequence of ' island dwarfing . ' "
Jungers and his colleagues raised the possibility that the ancestor of the species was not Homo erectus , as had been the original assumption .
H. erectus is known as the earliest hominid to leave Africa and make its way across Asia .
At a symposium two weeks ago , several scientists edged toward the view that the so - called hobbits emerged from another , more primitive hominid ancestor .
In a commentary accompanying the journal report , Daniel E. Lieberman , a Harvard University paleoanthropologist who was not a member of the team , noted that the initial skepticism over the hominid as a distinct species was understandable .
" All in all , many scientists ( myself included ) have sat on the fence , waiting for more evidence about the nature and form of H. floresiensis , " Lieberman wrote .
" And now we have some . "
Lieberman , who specializes in hominid locomotion studies , said the primitive foot provided a " tantalizing model " for a nonmodern hominid that " evolved for effective walking before selection for endurance running occurred in human evolution . "
That might have occurred even before H. erectus , judging by footprints in Africa of an erectus with an apparently humanlike foot .
Some scientists speculate that the ancestor of H. floresiensis evolved from an earlier and smaller erectus , or the enigmatic Homo habilis , or even a pre-Homo genus .
In a related report in the journal , Eleanor Weston and other researchers at the Natural History Museum in London suggested that the H. floresiensis skull might be that of an erectus that had become dwarfed from living isolated on an island .
They made the proposal based on a study of extinct dwarf hippos on Madagascar , whose brains were 30 percent smaller than would be expected by scaling down their mainland African ancestor .
Robert E. Eckhardt , a Penn State University evolutionary biologist who remains skeptical , said in an e-mail message that supporters of that interpretation " have ignored , overlooked , discounted or misrepresented the extent of normal and abnormal variation in morphological structure and biomechanical function that exists in members of our own species , Homo sapiens . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Overweight people eat more than thin people and are more likely to travel by car , making excess body weight doubly bad for the environment , according to a study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine .
“ When it comes to food consumption , moving about in a heavy body is like driving around in a gas guzzler , ” and food production is a major source of greenhouse gases , researchers Phil Edwards and Ian Roberts wrote in their study , published in the International Journal of Epidemiology .
“ We need to be doing a lot more to reverse the global trend toward fatness , and recognize it as a key factor in the battle to reduce ( carbon ) emissions and slow climate change , ” the British scientists said .
They estimated that each fat person is responsible for about one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions a year more on average than each thin person , adding up to an extra one billion tonnes of CO2 a year in a population of one billion overweight people .
The European Union estimates each EU citizen accounts for 11 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year .
Musicians Have A Biological Advantage When It Comes To Emotions In Sounds
In a study in the latest issue of European Journal of Neuroscience , an interdisciplinary Northwestern research team says they have found biological evidence that musical training enhances an individual 's ability to recognize emotion in sound .
The study found that the more years of musical experience musicians possessed and the earlier the age they began their music studies also increased their nervous systems ' abilities to process emotion in sound .
A doctoral student in the Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Music , Dana Strait , primary author of the study , does research in the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory directed by neuroscientist Nina Kraus .
The laboratory has done pioneering work on the neurobiology underlying speech and music perception and learning - associated brain plasticity .
" Quickly and accurately identifying emotion in sound is a skill that translates across all arenas , whether in the predator - infested jungle or in the classroom , boardroom or bedroom , " says Strait .
" Scientists already know that emotion is carried less by the linguistic meaning of a word than by the way in which the sound is communicated . "
The Northwestern researchers measured brainstem processing of three acoustic correlates ( pitch , timing and timbre ) in musicians and non-musicians to a scientifically validated emotion sound .
The musicians , who learn to use all their senses to practice and perform a musical piece , were found to have " finely tuned " auditory systems .
This fine - tuning appears to lend broad perceptual advantages to musicians .
" Previous research has indicated that musicians demonstrate greater sensitivity to the nuances of emotion in speech , " says Ashley , who explores the link between emotion perception and musical experience .
One of his recent studies indicated that musicians might even be able to sense emotion in sounds after hearing them for only 50 milliseconds .
The 30 right - handed men and women with and without music training in the European Journal of Neuroscience study were between the ages of 19 and 35 .
Subjects with music training were grouped using two criteria -- years of musical experience and onset age of training ( before or after age 7 ) .
Study participants were asked to watch a subtitled nature film to keep them entertained while they were hearing , through earphones , a 250 - millisecond fragment of a distressed baby 's cry .
Sensitivity to the sound , and in particular to the more complicated part of the sound that contributes most to its emotional content , was measured through scalp electrodes .
The results were not exactly what the researchers expected .
They found that musicians ' brainstems lock onto the complex part of the sound known to carry more emotional elements but de-emphasize the simpler ( less emotion conveying ) part of the sound .
This was not the case in non-musicians .
In essence , musicians more economically and more quickly focus their neural resources on the important -- in this case emotional -- aspect of sound .
" That their brains respond more quickly and accurately than the brains of non-musicians is something we'd expect to translate into the perception of emotion in other settings , " Strait says .
The authors of the study also note that the acoustic elements that musicians process more efficiently are the very same ones that children with language disorders , such as dyslexia and autism , have problems encoding .
" It would not be a leap to suggest that children with language processing disorders may benefit from musical experience , " says Kraus .
Strait , a pianist and oboe player who formerly worked as a therapist with autistic children , goes a step further .
Noting that impaired emotional perception is a hallmark of autism and Asberger 's syndromes , she suggests that musical training might promote emotion processing in these populations .
Kraus , Northwestern 's Hugh Knowles Professor of Communication Sciences and Neurobiology ; Richard Ashley , associate professor of music cognition ; and Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory manager Erika Skoe co-authored the study titled " Musical Experience and Neural Efficiency : Effects of Training on Subcortical Processing of Vocal Expressions in Emotion . "
The study was funded by the National Science Foundation
A spokesman for the drug policy office declined to comment , saying the office wanted to wait until the Senate has confirmed Obama 's drug czar nominee , Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske .
Responsibilities .
-- The Director -- [...]
( 12 ) shall ensure that no Federal funds appropriated to the Office of National Drug Control Policy shall be expended for any study or contract relating to the legalization ( for a medical use or any other use ) of a substance listed in schedule I of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act ( 21 U.S.C. 812 ) and take such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use of a substance ( in any form ) that --
1. is listed in schedule I of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act ( 21 U.S.C. 812 ) ; and

I 've previously noted the reluctance of the current administration to actually debate marijuana legalization .
When cornered , they 'll say they 're against it , but they wo n’t say why or offer any interesting observations about our marijuana laws .
Another great example appeared in this superb MSN piece on the merits of legalizing and taxing marijuana .
The article goes on and on about the economic benefits of legalization , to which the drug czar 's office replied with a shrug :
This wait - and - see response may sound reasonable enough , but it 's totally nuts when you consider that opposing legalization is literally one of the fundamental purposes of the this office as defined by law
That is all perfectly straightforward , and yet the office currently has no talking points prepared when a reporter calls for a quote about marijuana legalization ?
ONDCP has never been anything other than a clearinghouse for unhinged drug war propaganda .
It is literally a factory for designing crazy arguments against legalizing drugs .
So if they can't answer a simple pot policy question without the help of a guy who does n’t even work there yet , then it 's safe to say that ONDCP as we know it has been completely destroyed .
Once the new drug czar arrives , the office will no doubt regroup and formulate some kind of response to the thunderous cries for reform that presently surround them .
I 'm sure whatever they present will be deeply problematic .
But it is simply delicious to witness even a temporary collapse of the once - great government drug war propaganda machine .

Advertisement A Colombian man has appeared in court accused of raping his daughter over many years and fathering several children with her .
Arcebio Alvarez , dubbed the " monster of Mariquita " by the local media , allegedly abused his daughter , now in her 30s , since she was nine years old .
The case has shocked Colombia , and the 59 - year - old needed police and army protection for his court appearance .
Mr Alvarez denies incest and rape , saying his daughter was adopted .
" We agreed to have a romantic relationship because we really loved each other .
But she was not my own child , " he told the court in the central Tolima province .
Sometimes I would ask him [ why we were doing it ] and he would say it was God 's will
Arcedio Alvarez 's daughter
It is not clear whether his claim is true , or whether it would affect the charges he faces , but the woman says she always saw him as her father .
" I always respected him as my father and he is my father , " she said .
" He never spoke about [ incest ] , about why we were doing it .
Sometimes I would ask him and he would say it was God 's will . "
The woman told police how her mother died when she was five years old , leaving her in the care of Mr Alvarez .
She says she was raped repeatedly and became pregnant 14 times .
Eight of her children , aged between one and 19 , survived .
The woman and her children are now under state protection .
Child welfare campaigners have called for a life sentence if he is convicted , saying there are hundreds of thousands of child sexual abuse cases in Colombia not being prosecuted .
The case has also prompted a movement to change Colombian law , says the BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Colombia , to ensure that those found guilty of raping children go to prison for life .

Do we really want to eat food created by Monsanto , and sprayed with Monsanto 's chemicals ?
Before we take another bite , a bit of research is in order .
This is the first sentence of the Monsanto Pledge , taken from www.monsanto.com:
" We want to make the world a better place for future generations . "
Really ?
This sounds so good .
Environmentally responsible people looking out for the good of humanity .
However , I believe that no matter what is said , we can judge the fruit of this company by its actions .
Please read the following article from SourceWatch , and judge for yourself if Monsanto 's " claim that " a healthy , sustainable environment is important to our business " is true , or just another Public Relations spin .

In the 1930's Monsanto bought the company that invented PCBs and became the source of all PCBs in the United States . [ 1 ]
( PCBs ) is the acronym for Polychlorinated biphenyls which are complex chlorinated compounds [ 2 ] .
In the Washington Post article ( Jan 1 , 2002 ) " Monsanto Hid Decades Of Pollution PCBs Drenched Ala .
Town , But No One Was Ever Told " a grim story of Monsanto 's treacherous behavior in Anniston Alabama was revealed .
It is summed up in this chilling paragraph : " They also know that for nearly 40 years , while producing the now - banned industrial coolants known as PCBs at a local factory , Monsanto Co. routinely discharged toxic waste into a west Anniston creek and dumped millions of pounds of PCBs into oozing open - pit landfills .
And thousands of pages of Monsanto documents -- many emblazoned with warnings such as " CONFIDENTIAL : Read and Destroy " -- show that for decades , the corporate giant concealed what it did and what it knew . " [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Anniston Alabama
" On the west side of Anniston , the poor side of Anniston , the people ate dirt .
They called it " Alabama clay " and cooked it for extra flavor .
They also grew berries in their gardens , raised hogs in their back yards , caught bass in the murky streams where their children swam and played and were baptized .
They did n't know their dirt and yards and bass and kids -- along with the acrid air they breathed -- were all contaminated with chemicals .
They did n't know they lived in one of the most polluted patches of America . "
" In 1966 , Monsanto managers discovered that fish submerged in that creek turned belly - up within 10 seconds , spurting blood and shedding skin as if dunked into boiling water .
They told no one .
In 1969 , they found fish in another creek with 7,500 times the legal PCB levels .
They decided " there is little object in going to expensive extremes in limiting discharges . " "
" Sylvester Harris , 63 , an undertaker who lived across the street from the plant , said he always thought he was burying too many young children .
' I knew something was wrong around here , ' he said . "
The article must have been a severe blow to Monsanto PR since it had previously stated in response to a 1994 Sierra magazine article [ 5 ] that " Monsanto has never concealed any hazard of PCBs " and " Claims of ' cover - ups ' and ' sacrificing " life itself " to corporate profits ' are untrue and out of touch with Monsanto 's way of doing business " [ 6 ] .
This comment makes sense in light of a 1969 Monsanto directive to " a committee the company formed to address controversies about PCBs " , it was to have " only two formal objectives : ' Permit continued sales and profits ' and ' protect image of . . . the corporation ' " [ 7 ] ( 1 ) .
" We ca n't afford to lose one dollar of business " an internal memo concluded [ 8 ] .
The next year Monsanto secretly agreed that " any written effluent level reports [ on PCBs ] would be held confidential by the Technical Staff and would not be available to the public until or unless Monsanto released it " [ 9 ] .
And that was apparently the final word because nothing changed for decades .
According to the WP article the public did not become fully aware of the problem until 1993 when , " after a local angler caught deformed largemouth bass [ in a local creek ] ... the first advisories against eating fish from the area " were issued .
This was " 27 years after Monsanto learned about those bluegills sliding out of their skins " .
Monsanto's PCB monopoly had been netting them $ 22 million dollars a year .
" Today , parts of Anniston are so contaminated that residents have been told not to grow vegetables in the soil , kick up dirt , eat food , chew gum or smoke cigarettes while working in their yards .
' Our children have to play in the streets , on the sidewalks , because they can't play in the grass because it 's contaminated , ' says resident David Baker .
' We have to wear masks if we cut our grass .
Where else in the United States of America are people doing that ? ' "
" In my judgment , there 's no question this is the most contaminated site in the U.S. , " says Dr. David Carpenter , a professor of environmental health at the State University of New York in Albany . [ 10 ] .

Abstract
The identification of an extrasolar planet as Earth - like will depend on the detection of atmospheric signatures or surface non-uniformities .
In this paper we present spatially unresolved flux light curves of Earth for the purpose of studying a prototype extrasolar terrestrial planet .
Our monitoring of the photometric variability of earthshine revealed changes of up to 23 % per hour in the brightness of Earth 's scattered light at around 600 nm , due to the removal of specular reflection from the view of the Moon .
This variability is accompanied by reddening of the spectrum and results from a change in surface properties across the continental boundary between the Indian Ocean and Africa 's east coast .
Our results based on earthshine monitoring indicate that specular reflection should provide a useful tool in determining the presence of liquid water on extrasolar planets via photometric observations .
Key Words : Earthshine — Photometric monitoring — Earth .

More than 300 stray dogs that were dumped on isolated islands turned to cannibalism after weeks of starvation , animal welfare activists said Thursday .
The plight of the dogs cast away by villagers on two small , uninhabited islands off Malaysia 's western Selangor state ignited outrage after activists this week released photographs showing dogs eating the carcasses of ones that had died .
Residents of a fishing village on Pulau Ketam , another island off Selangor , caught the dogs last month and took them to the islands covered in mangroves .
The villagers said they never intended to be cruel _ they believed the dogs could feed on the deserted islands ' wildlife _ but wanted to rid their island of dogs that defecate on the streets and sometimes bite children .
A team from the Selangor Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals visited one of the islands _ Pulau Selat Kering _ on Monday and saw several emaciated dogs " crowded and hunched around something _ they were hungrily feasting on the remains of another dog , " the SPCA said in a statement .
" Nearby , a weak dog was screaming because several dogs were trying to bite her , " it said .
Volunteers have so far rescued two dogs and left food for the others , said SPCA official Jacinta Johnson .
They estimate 200 might have survived .
Activists would also try to rescue any dogs left on the other island , Pulau Tengah .
Pulau Ketam 's residents have said some dogs tried to swim back to their island , about a half - hour boat ride away , but it was not clear how many succeeded .
Efforts to save the dogs have been slow because many were fearful of people and scampered into mangrove swamps when rescuers approached , Johnson said .
Activists have persuaded Pulau Ketam 's villagers not to dump any more dogs and are considering measures such as sterilization and relocation to ease problems posed by an estimated 2,000 stray dogs , the SPCA said .
Scammers are always on the lookout for sociopolitical events they can craft into a phishing hook ; we 've seen the thieves try lures flavored with everything from holiday celebrations to information on international assassinations .
The various security firms and organizations in the United States have been warning of an uptick in recession - themed spam for the past few months .
Families feeling the pinch — particularly those where one or more providers is in their second to third month of unemployment — are more likely to take a chance on an ad that seems too good to be true , even if they logically know the chance of finding a golden ticket is slim indeed .
The financial damage these bogus claims could inflict on the population is significant enough that both the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) are taking action now .
According to PC
World , scammers are thus far focusing on fake pay - to - play websites that dupe the visitor into paying a small registration fee , promise to submit relief - seeking filings on their behalf , and then hammer the registrant for all manner of trumped - up costs and bogus charges .
Ads for these fraudulent websites have appeared in Google 's text link advertising — the company has pledged to watch for them — and have been spotted on social networking sites .
If it sounds too good to be true it probably is , especially if it involves an economic windfall headed your way in a time of crisis .
Expect to see more of the bogus websites , ads , and e-mail in the future ; do n't forget the basic rules of e-mail security .
Do n't hand out bank account numbers for " verification " purposes , reveal your Social Security number , or accept assurances that yes , the person on the other end of the phone really is from the IRS .
It 's a particularly good idea to warn friends and family who are either less computer - savvy or in more desperate financial straits than yourself — the entire point of scams like this is that they function best when matched with people who do n't know how to make the rent or grocery bill .
Real information on government grants or the economic stimulus package should visit Grants.gov or Recovery.gov ; the full text of the FTC 's statement regarding these scam sites is available here .

Advertisement Leaders of the world 's largest economies have reached an agreement to tackle the global financial crisis with measures worth $ 1.1 trillion ( £ 681bn ) .
To help countries with troubled economies , the resources available to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) will be tripled to $ 750 bn .
There will also be sanctions against secretive tax havens and tougher global financial regulation .
And the G20 has committed about $ 250 bn to boost global trade .
US President Barack Obama said the summit could mark a " turning point " in the pursuit of economic recovery and made progress in reforming a " failed regulatory system " .
NEW FUNDING PLEDGES $ 500bn for the IMF to lend to struggling economies $ 250 bn to boost world trade $ 250bn for a new IMF " overdraft facility " countries can draw on $ 100bn that international development banks can lend to poorest countries IMF will raise $ 6bn from selling gold reserves to increase lending for the poorest countries Source : BBC
G20 leaders ' statement Global markets rise on G20 deal Historic IMF changes Q&A : The G20's $ 1tn deal First Lady moved by school visit Mixed reactions to G20 outcome " By any measure the London summit was historic .
" It was historic because of the size and the scope of the challenges that we face and because of the timeliness and the magnitude of our response , " he said .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there was " no quick fix " for the world economy but there was a commitment to do whatever was necessary .
" This is the day that the world came together to fight back against the global recession , not with words , but with a plan for global recovery and for reform and with a clear timetable for its delivery , " Mr Brown said .
Another G20 meeting will be held in New York in September to check on progress , the BBC has learned .
The deal was announced shortly before the European stock markets closed and gave leading indexes a significant boost .
London 's FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended 4.3 % higher .
In Paris , the Cac 40 jumped 5.4 % and in Frankfurt , the Dax rose 6 % .
The deal
On behalf of the G20 , Mr Brown announced the following steps : Bankers ' pay and bonuses will be subject to stricter controls A new Financial Stability Board will be set up to work with the IMF to ensure co-operation across borders and provide an early warning mechanism for the financial system
There will be greater regulation of hedge funds and credit ratings agencies
A common approach to cleaning up banks ' toxic assets has been agreed
The world 's poorest countries will receive $ 100bn extra aid
G20 countries are already implementing the biggest economic stimulus " the world has ever seen " - an injection of $ 5tn by the end of next year .
IMF boost
The IMF has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the G20 summit .
The resources it has to help troubled economies will be increased to $ 500bn .
An overdraft facility will also be increased to $ 250bn ( in the IMF 's currency , so - called Special Drawing Rights ) that all members can call upon .
Mr Brown said that there would be a crackdown on tax havens to prevent the loss of sorely needed tax revenue .
HOW BIG IS ONE TRILLION ?
Big numbers explained Shortly after the summit finished the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development published a blacklist of countries deemed uncooperative .
It said Costa Rica , Malaysia , Philippines and Uruguay had not made any commitment to respecting international standards .
" We have agreed tough standards and sanctions for use against those who do n't come into line in the future , " Mr Brown said .
President Obama was said to have played a key role in brokering the agreement on tax havens , resolving differences between France and China .
Hopes met ?
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that the conclusions of the G20 summit were " more than we could have hoped for " .
HAVE YOUR SAY 1.1 trillion ... how can that ever be accounted for ?
Success for them .
Failure for everyone else Nathan McConnell , Grantsburg , US Earlier , there had been suggestions of rifts between France and Germany and the US and the UK .
The US and UK emphasised the need for public spending to ease the crisis while France and Germany were keen for tougher financial regulation .
Mr Sarkozy had threatened to walk out of the meeting if it did not yield concrete results .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also praised the outcome .
She said the new measures would give the world a " clearer financial market architecture " and the agreement was " a very , very good , almost historic compromise " .
Her finance minister , Peer Steinbrueck , said he was pleased that the G20 statement did not oblige states to launch further economic stimulus packages .
Protests Protesters gathered outside the summit , but in smaller numbers than during Wednesday 's demonstrations in London 's financial district .
Several hundred staged " noisy but calm " protests near the Excel centre , representing groups including the Stop the War Coalition and CND .
And about 400 more demonstrators were boxed in by police outside the Bank of England in London 's financial district , during angry but peaceful protests .
More than 100 people were arrested over the two days of protests - 86 of them on Wednesday , police said .
A small group of protesters gathered earlier at the London Stock Exchange , but later dispersed .
Poor benefit
The G20 countries have pledged $ 100bn in aid for developing countries , more than expected .
The money will be dispensed through multilateral lenders such as the Asian Development Bank .
The measure that could make the most difference in the short term for the poorest countries is the availability of $ 250bn of trade credit , says BBC international development correspondent David Loyn .
It will enable goods currently rotting on the quayside in Africa to move again , he says .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said the tougher financial regulation announced by the G20 was a significant step .
He said it sounded the death knell for the freewheeling Anglo - American way of banking and conducting financial markets .
However , he said the measures would not get the world out of recession overnight .

Sgt Myers 's coffin arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware
The media have been given access to the return home of a dead US soldier for the first time since an 18 - year ban on coverage was lifted .
Reporters were allowed to witness the ceremony marking the return of the body of Air Force Staff Sgt Phillip Myers , with the permission of his family .
Sgt Myers was killed by an improvised explosive device near Helmand province , Afghanistan on 4 April .
The media ban was first put in place during the 1991 Gulf War .
President George H W Bush , who implemented the media blackout , said it was necessary to protect the families of fallen soldiers .
The BBC's Kevin Connolly says critics of the ban always felt it was an attempt by the American government to disguise the human cost of the war from public opinion .
Flag - draped coffin
President Obama and Defence Secretary Robert Gates opted to change the policy shortly after Mr Obama took office .
Under new guidelines , the media are allowed access to the ceremonies , but only with the permission of the dead soldiers ' family members .
Sgt Myers 's flag - draped coffin arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on the evening of 5 April .
After a brief prayer was delivered by Maj Klavens Noel , the base 's mortuary chaplain , the coffin was carried from a military transport plane to a white truck by eight men wearing white gloves and camouflage battle uniforms .
The truck then transported the coffin to the base 's morgue where it will be processed before being returned to his family .
Sgt Myers 's widow and other family members , along with around two dozen members of the media , attended the 20 - minute - long ceremony .
Although Sgt Myers 's family consented to the media presence , they declined to be interviewed or photographed .
It has become one of the staples of modern , hi-tech life : using satellite navigation tools built into your car or mobile phone to find your way from A to B .
But experts have warned that the system may be close to breakdown .
US government officials are concerned that the quality of the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) could begin to deteriorate as early as next year , resulting in regular blackouts and failures – or even dishing out inaccurate directions to millions of people worldwide .
The warning centres on the network of GPS satellites that constantly orbit the planet and beam signals back to the ground that help pinpoint your position on the Earth 's surface .
The satellites are overseen by the US Air Force , which has maintained the GPS network since the early 1990s .
According to a study by the US government accountability office ( GAO ) , mismanagement and a lack of investment means that some of the crucial GPS satellites could begin to fail as early as next year .
" It is uncertain whether the Air Force will be able to acquire new satellites in time to maintain current GPS service without interruption , " said the report , presented to Congress .
" If not , some military operations and some civilian users could be adversely affected . "
The report says that Air Force officials have failed to execute the necessary steps to keep the system running smoothly .
Although it is currently spending nearly $ 2bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) to bring the 20 - year - old system up to date , the GAO – which is the equivalent of Britain 's National Audit Office – says that delays and overspending are putting the entire system in jeopardy .
" In recent years , the Air Force has struggled to successfully build GPS satellites within cost and schedule goals , " said the report .
" It encountered significant technical problems … [ and ] struggled with a different contractor . "
The first replacement GPS satellite was due to launch at the beginning of 2007 , but has been delayed several times and is now scheduled to go into orbit in November this year – almost three years late .
The impact on ordinary users could be significant , with millions of satnav users potential victims of bad directions or failed services .
There would also be similar side effects on the military , which uses GPS for mapping , reconnaissance and for tracking hostile targets .
Some suggest that it could also have an impact on the proliferation of so - called location applications on mobile handsets – just as applications on the iPhone and other GPS - enabled smartphones are starting to get more popular .
Tom Coates , the head of Yahoo's Fire Eagle system – which lets users share their location data from their mobile – said he was sceptical that US officials would let the system fall into total disrepair because it was important to so many people and companies .
" I 'd be surprised if anyone in the US government was actually OK with letting it fail – it's too useful , " he told the Guardian .
" It sounds like something that could be very serious in a whole range of areas if it were to actually happen .
It probably would n't damage many locative services applications now , but potentially it would retard their development and mainstreaming if it were to come to pass . "
The failings of GPS could also play into the hands of other countries – including opening the door to Galileo , the European - funded attempt to rival America 's satellite navigation system , which is scheduled to start rolling out later next year .
Russia , India and China have developed their own satellite navigation technologies that are currently being expanded .

Dogbert the CEO
The boss says , " The new motivational posers are in . " the boss says , " As you requested , I bought the least expensive ones . "
Dogbert says , " Excuse me while I stretch my wagger . "
If all else fails ? your coworkers are edible
It was n't too long ago that the Pentagon 's bomb - fighting department focused the lion 's share of its time and money on just a few things .
Buying radio frequency jammers and other bomb - stopping gear was at the top of the list .
So was training troops in how to spot the jury - rigged weapons .
But the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization ( JIEDDO ) has been branching out in all sorts of unexpected ways .
Now , the group is helping to bust jihadist front companies , spread anti-bomb propaganda – and , of course , develop new counter - bomb gadgetry .
JIEDDO recently released its annual report , outlining how it spent $ 3.5 billion in the last fiscal year .
Tucked inside are all sorts of projects you 'd never think to see , coming from a group that use to concentrate on buying jammers .
For instance , in 2008 , JIEDDO participated in " a joint and multinational investigation into supply sources of electronic components for IEDs [ that ] culminated in the detention of several members of the Iraq - based Sea Sun Company .
This effectively shut down an 'al Qaeda in Iraq ' ( AQI ) front company and major source of supply for these components in Iraq .
Following this roll - up of individuals associated with the Sea Sun Company , coalition forces saw a significant decrease in IEDs that used these electronic components . "
The group also used " non-attributable information from television , radio and print media " in order to " eliminate support for the use of IEDs by local , regional , and international populations . "
JIEDDO says it worked with the Army 's 1st Information Operations Command to develop " strategies to influence and neutralize the [ bombing ] networks . "
In the process , they worked with the Naval Postgraduate School " to leverage a counter - narratives program in support of operations in Afghanistan . "
JIEDDO did n't leave the tech totally behind , however .
It worked with Ahura Scientific to bring to Afghanistan and Iraq " the first viable capability to identify home made explosive and precursor components on the battlefield . "
That 's important , Ahura explains , because today 's IEDs rely on " industrial chemicals like nitric acid , ammonium nitrate , diesel fuel and sugar " instead of " traditional explosive materials like TNT . "
Which means the bombs often " avoid detection by traditional explosive detection technologies and trained canines .
This has led military organizations and civilian agencies to research and quickly deploy new systems to counter the current IED threat . "
The group also bankrolled development of Calilgo , a system for defeating infrared bomb triggers ; 80 are of the Humvee - mounted gagdets are now in Iraq .
And it worked on " Keyhole , " a reconnaissance kit that " provides snipers with an increased capability to visually detect the enemy emplacing IEDs . "
Not all the tech worked out so well , however .
JIEDDO dropped its funding for " Rabbit , " a remote - controlled Humvee kit and the " Improvised Ordnance Disruptor " that was " designed to neutralize IEDs " with electricity .
" It was terminated due to poor performance during testing . "
So too was " Trailblazer II , " a tool meant to do the same thing , but with radio waves .
An effort to get 20 more " combat tracker dog " teams into the field appears to be going more smoothly , however .
But despite it and all the other JIEDDO projects , the number of improvised explosives in Afghanistan continues to escalate .
The bomb - fighters in Afghanistan 's Task Force Paladin task predict " bomb attacks will rise 50 percent this year to 5,700 — up from 3,800 last year . "

Yesterday , I joined one of our Mahalo employees at Federal District Court as he was sentenced to 48 months in jail for crimes related to computer security .
Before my employee John Schiefer was sentenced , a violent career criminal was facing 60 months for beating up a prison guard .
I could hear John ’s breathing deepening as the judge spoke–his fiancee ’s leg shaking more and more as the reality of John ’s situation set in .
John wound up getting 48 months in prison , a number which could be reduced if he behaves himself .
He goes to jail on June 1st , and maybe he ’ll be out in two or three years .
We did n’t know John was convicted of infecting 250,000 computers with bots when we hired him .
We have a rigorous hiring process at Mahalo , in which each candidate must go through an average of five to eight interviews , and in which at least three , but more typically five , references are checked .
Our CTO , and one of my oldest friends , Mark Jeffrey , did all of this with John , and he passed with flying colors .
However , Mark screwed up by not doing a simple Google search on John ’s name .
If Mark had , he would have easily found out about these crimes , we would never have hired John , and I would not be writing this letter .
Why would we even take the risk of hiring a felon hacker ?
No one would , right ?
Months after John ’s hiring , our VP of Operations found out about the crimes John had committed .
We sat down with John and learned about what he did when he was younger , how he was abused as a child , his anger issues , and how he found some level of peace in being part of the team at Mahalo .
Now I was left with the decision to fire John on the spot and cut my losses and responsibility .
This was the easy choice , obviously .
If I really wanted to cover my butt , I could turn on one of my best friends , Mark Jeffrey , and fire him for making the only mistake he ’s ever made working for me .
The other option was to keep John on and deal with the potential firestorm of criticism that we ’re now facing .
I chose to put my job and reputation on the line and keep John employed .
At this moment , I ’m honestly glad we did n’t know about what John did when we hired him and I ’m happy we ’ve kept him on board .
It ’s taught me a lot about society , computer crime and rehabilitation .
In John , I see almost every computer programmer from my time “ hacking ” on BBSes as a kid , attending hacker conferences and hiring “ white hat ” hackers for a living .
Almost all talented developers push the envelope when they ’re young .
Anyone in technology knows this dark , dirty little secret .
When I worked for Sony , I watched folks in the IT department read their bosses ’ email .
When I was in high school and college , I watched daily as folks explored the areas of the computer networks they were specifically told not to enter .
In fact , I was fired from my first computer job for creating a partition on a hard drive in the computer lab where I stored my files .
When the Web emerged , I watched as folks created honey pots to prove they could socially manipulate people into giving away private information .
Many of these folks moved on to marketing firms which do essentially the same things –except they play by the rules .
At conferences , I see people pop out WiFi sniffers and show me passwords of executives in the room .
I ’ve heard senior executives recount stories of putting keyboard monitor software on computers in their offices and recording all instant messaging traffic to find out what their employees are up to .
What is the difference between the hackers who put one foot over the line and the ones who race past it ?
Being bored ?
A lack of guidance ?
Low self - esteem ?
I ’m not a psychologist , so I ca n’t tell you exactly .
However , I consider myself a fairly decent judge of character , and after spending months with John , I ’m convinced he was an angry stupid kid when he launched his botnet attack ( which did .000000001 % of the damage it could have ) .
Now he ’s an adult who just wants to make a decent living , spend time with his significant other and breathe the clean air off the Pacific Ocean by our offices in Santa Monica .
John ’s going to have to spend a couple of years in jail for what he did .
Certainly we have to punish those who ’ve committed crimes .
But watching this go down , I wish in my heart of hearts that judge had given John a sentence from home , where we could have supervised him .
I ’m hoping that the time he ’s spent being a productive member of the Mahalo team inspires him to keep his head down in jail .
When he comes out , I hope to be able to offer him a job and that we can work together again .
Life is short , we all make mistakes and I ’m glad we ’ve been given the opportunity to work with someone who needs the help and guidance .
Note to Mahalo Users : John ’s work is well - supervised .
Mahalo follows strict security policies and we do n’t store any sensitive data anyway .
( Even if one of our employees did go off the deep end , the most they would have access to would be your questions and answers on Mahalo Answers– not much damage can be done there since they ’re all public anyway ) .
Thank you for taking the time to hear me out .
all the best ,
Jason
6,000 rare Irrawaddy dolphins have been discovered in the freshwater of Bangladesh ’s Sundarbans mangrove forest and the Bay of Bengal .
Previously , the largest group of Irrawaddy dolphins were thought to be in the low hundreds .
The recent discovery has prompted new guidelines for marine wildlife viewing in the Pacific Islands .
Last week , the first ever International Conference on Marine Mammal Protected Areas met .
Â 200 delegates from 40 countries gathered in Maui representing a diversity of marine protected areas .
Â Naomi McIntosh , Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary superintendent , described the event :
An immediate outcome from this conference is the recognition that managers of marine mammal protected areas have more in common than we realized .
Â
There are more than 500 existing or proposed Marine Protected Areas for marine mammals in some 90 countries , yet this is the first dedicated gathering of marine mammal and MPA experts and practitioners .
Irrawaddy dolphins are unique in that they fish cooperatively with humans .
These rare dolphins actually herd schools of fish towards fishing boats .
The dolphins then prey on cornered fish ; however , they are becoming increasingly threatened by entanglement in fishing nets .
The Wildlife Conservation Society is working to expand and establish protection areas in the Sundarbans mangrove forest .
The new guidelines for whale and dolphin viewing are designed to minimize the potential impacts of tourism activities on the marine animals and their environment .
Â Olive Andrews of the International Fund for Animal Welfare explains :
The Pacific Islands region offers visitors a unique cultural nature tourism experience with endangered whales in their breeding grounds .
It is vital that governments and industry ensure the protection of the animals that are attracting increased prosperity to many countries in the region …
Safe , responsible whale watching that minimises disturbance to the animals is best for the whales , best for tourists and best for the community .
Whale watching brings in $ 21 million dollars a year to Pacific Islands , and this number is growing 45 percent a year .
India is not the only country where Mein Kampf is popular .
It has been a best - seller in Croatia since it was first published in while in turkey it sold 100,000 in just two months in 2005 .
In Russia it has been reprinted three times since the de facto ban on the book was overturned in 1992 .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The chief constable for Britain 's Greater Manchester Police indicated Thursday there would have been the potential for terrorist acts this weekend if police had not made a dozen arrests .
Bob Quick was photographed arriving at Downing Street holding a document revealing details of the raid .
" We would urge the public to be vigilant ... and contact the terrorist hotline if they see something suspicious , " Chief Constable Peter Fahy said at a news conference Thursday .
Britain's chief terrorism officer resigned from the police force Thursday , a day after he accidentally exposed a sensitive document about the investigation .
The 12 people were taken into custody at several locations , mainly in northwest Manchester , Fahy said , and counterfoils police were questioning them and carrying out searches as part of the probe .
" A number of premises are being served , are being searched , " he said .
Watch more about the raids »
The terrorism threat level , which he said is already at a heightened state in Britain because of perceived threats , will not be raised , Fahy said .
He urged Britons to carry out their usual activities and said they did n't have to avoid certain locations .
Arrest locations mentioned in the media are " pure speculation , " he said , adding , " There is no particular threat against any particular location . "
Fahy said the probe had reached a point where police felt they had to take action -- even without the blunder made by Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick , who inadvertently revealed a secret document to two media photographers at the prime minister 's residence .
The document contained the names of those to be arrested .
Once the word was out , police rushed to make the arrests .
Fahy said those actions would have been taken in the next 24 hours anyway .
Manchester is about 200 miles northwest of London .
" I have today offered my resignation in the knowledge that my action could have compromised a major counterterrorism operation , " Quick said in a statement .
" I deeply regret the disruption caused to colleagues undertaking the operation and remain grateful for the way in which they adapted quickly and professionally to a revised time scale . "
Steve Back , one of the photographers who snapped the image , said he was at No. 10 Downing Street to cover a breakfast meeting of more than 30 chief constables .
He photographed Quick as he arrived toward the end of the meeting , he said .
" I did n't know what I had until I put it in my computer , " Back told CNN .
He zoomed in and was able to read parts of the document , with " Secret " printed atop the page .
" This is a Security service led investigation into suspected AQ [ al Qaeda ] driven attack planning within the UK , " the document read .
It described the " planned detention " of 11 people in Manchester , Leeds and Birmingham .
Ironically , the bottom of the document read , " Media strategy has been ratified . "
Resigning was the only acceptable option for Quick , counterterrorism analyst Will Geddes told CNN .
The blunder " does raise major concerns which would have led to a very major inquiry , " Geddes said .
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said he continued to hold Quick in the highest regard despite his error .
London Mayor Boris Johnson also praised Quick 's " long and distinguished career " and said he accepted the resignation with regret .
" Bob understands fully that the security breach which occurred yesterday was a serious issue for which he has taken personal responsibility , " Johnson said .
Quick is not the first official to be photographed with sensitive documents at Downing Street .
In May , then - Housing Minister Caroline Flint was photographed carrying notes that warned of a plunge in the property market .
Photographers have caught Communities Secretary Hazel Blears carrying plans for a reality TV show starring the prime minister .
Though Downing Street is blocked to the public , the news media are allowed to stand as close as 20 feet from the front door .
" Time and time again , I 've spoken to the press officer in Downing Street about this , " said Back , the photographer .
Assistant Commissioner John
Yates will take over as head of specialist operations , Stephenson said .

It turns out that Fox News ’s Neil Cavuto , who has already had a pretty tough week , intentionally inflated the attendance number for the Sacramento , CA rally that the was broadcasting live from .
After being told that attendance was 5,000 , he went on the air and claimed that it was double or triple this amount .
Here is the video from Countdown :
Advertisements
The 5,000 attendance number was backed up by the California Highway Patrol , who called the demonstration large but peaceful and estimated the crowd at above 5,000 .
On Countdown Olbermann showed both the off air video of Cavuto getting the crowd estimate , and then his on air estimate of 10,000 - 15,000 .
Is it any surprise that FNC felt the need to lie about the attendance numbers , after turnout was not nearly as large as they hoped for ?
I know the FNC apologists will find some way to spin this , but what else can you call someone who goes on the air and does n’t tell the truth when asked a question that he knew the answer to ?
Neil Cavuto lied .
It has been a really bad week for Neil .
First he claimed that Fox News covered the Million Man March , which happened the year before the network went on the air , and now this .
I am sure that Dick Armey thought that a tax protest on tax day was a great idea , and it would be if Obama had done something with the tax code that was worth protesting .
The fact is that these people were protesting tax rates that have n’t been changed in 16 years .
Where were the protests about high spending while George W. Bush was taking billions of dollars out of your pocket and giving them to private defense contractors in Iraq ?
I did n’t see any deficit hawks in the street when the very same President Bush managed to turn a budget surplus into a trillion dollar deficit .
Who was concerned about the children then ?
The problem did n’t begin and it wo n’t end with Obama .
The problem is that both parties like to spend too much money , and until they stop playing politics with the issue , nothing will ever change .
The move is part of an MoD review into the future of UK naval bases
Naval move would ' devastate ' city The Royal Navy dockyard at Plymouth is to have all of its frigate warships transferred to Portsmouth , Ministry of Defence sources have told the BBC .
Portsmouth is set to become the home of almost all the Navy 's warships .
Portsmouth had been expected to lose out to Plymouth as part of an MoD review to cut over - capacity and costs .
An MoD source said it " makes sense " to have all the Navy 's frigates and destroyers in Portsmouth , as the city was home to the fleet headquarters .
The review , which began in 2006 , looked at the three UK Navy bases in Plymouth , Portsmouth and Faslane .
BBC
South has learned of the decision ahead of an official announcement by the MoD , expected in the next few weeks .
DEVONPORT Founded in 1691 Employs 4,800 Sole UK refitting base for Vanguard nuclear missile - firing submarines
At present Portsmouth is home to the Navy 's two operational aircraft carriers , six frigates and seven destroyers .
MoD sources have told the BBC that 11 frigates currently based at Plymouth 's Devonport dockyard will move to Portsmouth as a result of the review .
The MoD source said : " Portsmouth is the home of the Royal Navy and it will be the home of the operational fleet .
" It makes sense to have all the navy 's frigates and destroyers in Portsmouth as the city is already the home of fleet headquarters and has the infrastructure to support operational ships .
' Efficient and logical '
" The changes to be announced are the most efficient and most logical way of using Britain 's three naval bases . "
The MoD 's official response in a statement said : " Work on the Maritime Change Programme ( MCP ) is ongoing but no final decisions on the programme have been taken and no date for an announcement has been planned . "
Portsmouth 's naval dockyard currently employs more than 17,000 people and is home to about two - thirds of the Royal Navy 's surface ships .

Devonport , which in area is western Europe 's largest naval shipyard , employs 4,800 people and is the UK's sole refitting base for Vanguard submarines , which provide the UK 's strategic nuclear deterrent with Trident nuclear missiles .
It is understood Devonport will retain its submarines and amphibious assault ships as well as re-fit work .
Nuclear submarine base Faslane is expected to be largely unaffected by the review .
Tim Jones , of the Devon and Cornwall Business Council , said if confirmed any relocations of naval frigates to Portsmouth would " be a bombshell " and would have " quite devastating repercussions for Plymouth and the surrounding area " .
" If the transfer of the frigates goes ahead , we are likely to experience a significant shift in terms of basic employment and core manufacturing which will be difficult to absorb . "
Plymouth Sutton MP and House of Commons Defence Select Committee member Linda Gilroy said she had been assured earlier in 2009 there would be no changes made to the base - porting of ships within the next five years .
PORTSMOUTH Founded in 1194 Employs 17,200
Home to almost two - thirds of the Royal Navy 's surface ships However Mike Hancock , MP for Portsmouth South and also a member of the Defence Select Committee , said : " It 's going to be great news for Portsmouth . "
He said it " put into place the final part of the jigsaw " regarding the Navy 's shore - based future over the next 25 years , " possibly longer " .
" It will mean that virtually the whole of the surface fleet , including the two new carriers , will be port - based here in Portsmouth .
" I think it 's great news for the city as a whole , super news for the naval base . "
He said there had been a " cloud of despair right across the city " when the naval base review had been first announced in 2006 and there had been speculation that nearly 20,000 jobs could be lost .

Some of those protesting on Tuesday bore the Romanian flag Moldova 's president has accused neighbouring Romania of stoking the protests that erupted into violence in the capital Chisinau on Tuesday .
Romania has rejected the accusation as a " provocation " .
Thousands of young protesters thronged Chisinau , fighting police and ransacking parliament , in protest at the results of Sunday 's election .
Official results gave the ruling Communists about 50 % of the vote in the Romanian - speaking ex-Soviet republic .
International observers said the vote appeared to have been fair , though one told the BBC she had her doubts .
Some of my colleagues went in and later said they smashed everything and put the president 's chair and portrait on fire

Eyewitness : Moldova protests
What is behind unrest ?
Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin , a Communist , was quoted by Russian agency Interfax saying : " We know that certain political forces in Romania are behind this unrest .
The Romanian flags fixed on the government buildings in Chisinau attest to this . "
He ordered that Romania 's ambassador be expelled , recalled the Moldovan envoy from Bucharest , and said Romanians would in future need visas to cross into Moldova .
Earlier the president described the violence as " a coup d'etat " .
Some of the protesters on Tuesday had carried Romanian flags and called for the unification of Moldova with Romania , its bigger neighbour .
Russia 's foreign ministry said there was a plot aimed at undermining " the sovereignty of Moldova " .
But Romania 's foreign ministry said : " This accusation is a provocation aimed at the Romanian state . "
It is " unacceptable that the Communists in power in Chisinau shift the blame for internal problems in Moldova onto Romania and the Romanian people " , the statement added .
Summoned on Twitter
There was no sign of a repeat of the violence on Wednesday , though some people gathered to demand the release of the 193 people reportedly arrested on Tuesday .
In pictures : Moldova protests Vlad Filat , leader of the Liberal Democratic Party , called the demonstrations " a spontaneous action by protesting young people " .
He said the opposition had tried to prevent excesses , like the attacks on parliament , but said : " We are not scared of arrests or intimidation .
The people do not want to live like this and want to live free and without fear . "
Word of the demonstrations was spread by text message , via the internet , and on social networking tools .
" We sent messages on Twitter but did n't expect 15,000 people to join in .
At the most we expected 1,000 , " Oleg Brega , of the activist group Hyde Park told the Associated Press news agency .
' Manipulation ' suspected Chisinau Mayor Dorin Chirtoaca , a member of the Liberal Party , said : " The elections were fraudulent , there was multiple voting . "

The opposition have called for ballots to be recounted or the vote to be reheld - a request rejected so far by the government .
A report by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe on Sunday 's vote gave a mostly positive assessment of the poll .
But a British member of the OSCE 's observation team questioned that conclusion .
Baroness Emma Nicholson said she found it " difficult to endorse the very warm press statement " from the head of the OSCE .
" The problem was that it was an OSCE report , and in the OSCE are , of course , the Russians , and their view was quite different , quite substantially different , for example from my own , " she told BBC News .
She said she and other observers had a " very , very strong feeling " that there had been some manipulation , " but we could n't find any proof " .
Moldova , sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine , is the poorest country in Europe , where the average wage is just under $ 250 ( £ 168 ) a month .
The people speak Romanian and the country shares many cultural links with Romania .
However it was annexed by the Soviet Union in World War II and gained independence in 1991 .
There remains an unresolved conflict with the breakaway region of Trans - Dniester , which has run its own affairs , with Moscow 's support , since the end of hostilities in a brief war in 1992 .

Broadcaster Art Bell . *
Photo : Joe Pugliese * Nearly 20 years ago , Art Bell created the wildly popular radio program Coast to Coast AM , a wee - hour forum for weird science .
We asked him why the show entertains , even encourages , the crazies .
Wired :
You were hosting a political talk show before you jumped to the supernatural .
What inspired the switch ?
Bell : I was crushingly bored talking about politics 30 hours a week .
So one day I said , " The hell with it , " and I brought on John Lear , a very outspoken ufologist .
The audience just went nuts !
The phones lit up .
Wired :
How did your bosses react ?
Bell :
They had heart attacks .
But when the ratings came in , we were overwhelmingly number one .
I was lucky because the show was on at night .
There 's a different breed of person awake at those hours .
And the world is a quieter place , with less to distract us from esoteric thought .
I think — no , I 'm sure — Coast to Coast would n't work with a daytime audience .
Wired :
Why are people so drawn to the paranormal ?
Bell :
The same reason we 're drawn to God .
The greatest question of all is whether our experience on this planet is " it " or whether there is something else .
Things in the supernatural realm give support , strangely perhaps , to the things we take on faith .
Like ghosts , for example — they underscore the possibility of an afterlife .
Wired :
Do you believe in ghosts ?
Bell : I 've never seen one , so I 'm skeptical .
But I do believe in the paranormal , that there are things our brains just can't understand .
Wired :
As you 're listening to callers , how often do you think , " No f-ing way " ?
Bell : Oh , all the time .
But if you 're into a really great tale , then it does n't actually matter if it 's true or not .
Wired :
The funny thing about radio is that you never have to show any evidence .
Bell :
That 's right .
That 's why radio is " the theater of the mind . "

Those hunting for the latest episodes of Lost , Heroes and Prison Break on Mininova may have already noticed that they are hard to find .
With the recently implemented copyright filter , many of the popular TV - show releases and blockbuster movies have been removed and put on a ban list .
A few days ago the owners of BitTorrent ’s largest torrent indexer announced that they would start experimenting with a new content removal tool that enables copyright holders to easily remove and ban torrents from the site .
The system seems to be pretty effective , as searches for TV - shows such as Lost , Heroes and Prison Break only return a handful of results , and not even those you ’d expect .
Mininova lost most Prison Break torrents
Those who try to upload a ‘ possibly infringing ’ torrent to Mininova get the following message ; “ Your torrent has been uploaded successfully .
It will not appear immediately on the site , as the content will be downloaded first by a third party to check for infringing content .
If the content is found to be non-infringing , the torrent will be posted on the site right away . ”
Mininova has announced that they are currently testing the removal system with only a few titles , among these are most of the torrents uploaded by the popular scene and release groups .
It looks like the removal system checks the info hashes to see if the torrents are on the ban list .
If this is indeed the case , the easiest way to get around the filter would be to modify the torrent by adding a small file to the original release and create a new torrent .
This new torrent will have an unique info hash and will be accepted by Mininova , until it is blacklisted of course .
This could be the death of scene releases and torrents from popular release groups , since these will be the prime targets of the copyright holders simply because they are downloaded more often than others .
This will mean that more exotic and home brewed torrents could remain on Mininova , and will likely be incompatible with the popular releases offered elsewhere , resulting in smaller swarm sizes for Mininova users .
One of the TV release groups that has seen most of its torrents banned from Mininova is EZTV .
However , NovaKing , one of the admins at EZTV , is sympathetic towards Mininova , despite the filter .
“ I can understand why Mininova is going down this path .
It is wiser for them to push the initiative and show the content distributors that they are not the bad guys instead of being forced by a judge to more than likely do the same thing in their upcoming court case , ” he told us .
“ We are not sure how much this affects the TV shows that we release as the filter has only been in effect for a short period of time .
But to cater for the users out there that do not know we actually have our own website and only get their shows via Mininova , we have changed how we post our torrents to Mininova , ” NovaKing added .
Since Mininova ’s content removal tool checks for the info hash of the torrent , they circumvent the system by linking to the ‘ infringing ’ torrents indirectly .
“ Now when you see a show from us it will contain a text file which contains a link to a valid torrent file , this will keep us from being filtered as the torrent we post does not contain any copyrighted content . ”
Of course , the latest torrents and news about EZTV are also posted on Twitter , EZTV ’s own website and on many other torrent sites .
Only time will tell how effective the removal system will be , and whether the Mininova team will continue to use it in the future .
It is likely that it is a compromise that they were forced to make , as a sign of goodwill towards the copyright holders who they are set to face in court next week .
If successful , this test case might be used to pressure other torrent site owners to do the same .
We hope , however , that the copyright holders will invest their time and money in serving their customers instead .
Opening Hulu up to everyone outside the US might be a good start .
Or they perhaps they could license content to Mininova .
( CNN ) --
The brutal winter storm that caused havoc from Texas to Maine has paralyzed swaths of Kentucky , where officials are working to cope with what they say is the worst power outage in the state 's history .
" We are kind of in a state of emergency .
It 's pretty bad , " said iReporter Dwight Stanley of Louisville , Kentucky .

Andrew Melnykovych , spokesman for Kentucky 's Public Service Commission , said it is " an indescribable mess everywhere . "
Ice storms covered parts of the state Friday , with moderate snowstorms expected to continue into Saturday morning , the National Weather Service said .
Temperatures that dipped into the teens on Friday are expected to rise to the upper 30s to lower 40s on Saturday , the weather service said .
Larry Holeman , deputy emergency management director of rural Grayson County , called his hard - hit community " a war zone . "
The emergency reflects the challenges faced in states such as Kentucky , where many rural and remote regions struggle to keep warm and dry under dire weather conditions .
Nine weather - related deaths have been reported , with two confirmed , said the office of Gov. Steve Beshear .
A previously confirmed death has since been found to be unrelated to the weather .
In western Louisville , three adults were found dead Friday morning of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator the family brought indoors , Mayor Jerry Abramson said .
The deaths prompted authorities to issue a stern warning about the dangers of carbon monoxide .
" We 've lost three citizens because people were n't listening to the fire department when they look into the cameras and talk on the radios and say , ' listen up , carbon monoxide kills , ' " Abramson said in a press conference Friday afternoon .
" We ca n't talk enough about it . "
The storm caused the largest power outage in Kentucky 's history , with more than 607,000 customers out of power .
Watch residents of Grayson County , Kentucky , try to cope with outage »
But Melnykovych said that while the state is saying 607,000 customers have lost power , he thinks the number is closer to 650,000 because the state figure comes only from utilities it regulates .
When Hurricane Ike hit in September , 600,000 customers lost power .
Melnykovych said the temperature was around 75 degrees and power outages were more of an " inconvenience than a life - threatening situation . "

" Hurricane Ike did n't have this kind of impact , " he said .
Of the state 's 120 counties , 78 have declared emergencies .
So have 47 cities , the governor 's office said .
At least 113 emergency shelters have been opened .
Jewel Tomes , who lives in Leitchfield , took shelter at a high school after a complex for the elderly lost power and was " thrilled to have a place to come to . "
" The high school here was generous , and more than 500 people have been sheltered here , and we have had cots and blankets and three meals a day .
And we had medication , " she said .
Around 93,000 customers on 55 water systems remain without access to water because of outages and storm damage .
Photos of storm 's impact »
Crews across the state were working to clear roads of snow , ice and trees .
A key concern is getting generators to water treatment facilities because of the large number of people without water .
The Kentucky National Guard , which has had 620 soldiers on duty , is bolstering to 1,000 the number of soldiers aiding recovery efforts .
Three of the battalions are headed to Paducah , Owensboro and Benton in the west and others are headed to other hard - hit spots .
The state said the Federal Emergency Management Agency will operate out of a National Guard center in Frankfort .
Beshear praised the Obama administration 's prompt reaction to the storm .
" They really hit the ground running , " he said .
" They 're working very hard to get all the equipment and supplies here that we need . "
For a third day , Beshear on Friday visited regions of the state slammed by the storm .
" Western Kentucky has obviously been hit very badly by this storm , " Beshear said Friday .
It 's the first ice storm for Debbie Pelissero , who moved to Lexington from San Diego in May .
She took pictures of the " peaceful and surreal " scenes for her California family .
" I never saw anything like it before .
I 've never lived in anything like this , " she said , watching crews salt the road for the next expected storm .
The newcomer is learning a basic principle about her new Kentucky home , uttered by the governor .
Kentuckians , he said are " a very resilient bunch . "

THE very big terror plot uncovered by police last week is not big , does not involve terrorists and is not a plot of any kind , it it has emerged .
As nine brown men were deported for having beards , the police blamed the Home Office , the Home Office blamed MI5 and MI5 warned everyone it could kill them with its thumb .
An inquiry will now be launched into why the prime minister was allowed to scare the shit out of everyone , though experts insist it may just have had something to do with the news agenda .
A police spokesman said : " We were hoping to charge them with conspiracy to go to the shops to buy crisps and Tizer , but according to our lawyers that that 's not an actual offence , as yet .
" We have therefore taken the precautionary step of sending these men and their potentially explosive beards back from whence they came . "
He added : " Come to think of it , Bob Quick must be absolutely fucking livid .
Whadya reckon ? "
A spokesman for home secretary Jacqui Smith said : " Embarrassed ?
No , we 're way , way beyond embarrassment at this stage .
" That 's a bit like asking a streaker if he 's embarrassed because he has n't shaved . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. health officials confirmed a total of 91 human cases of H1N1 swine flu across the country on Tuesday .

Advertisement Sri Lankan leader Mahinda Rajapaksa has declared the country " liberated " from Tamil Tiger rebels after a 26 - year war .
Mr Rajapaksa made the announcement in a speech to the country 's parliament , a day after the army said rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran had been killed .
Sri Lankan television stations broadcast footage of a body purported to be that of Prabhakaran .
Tamil media outside Sri Lanka have denied the army 's claims that the Tiger chief is dead .
Sri Lankan television showed a body purported to be that of Prabhakaran After a day of feverish speculation over Prabhakaran 's fate , Sri Lankan army chief Lt Gen Sarath Fonseka announced on state television that his body had been found .
" A few hours ago , the body of terrorist leader Prabhakaran , who ruined this country , was found on the battleground , " he said , adding that it had been positively identified using DNA testing .
Television pictures showed Sri Lankan troops standing over a bloated , uniformed corpse , whose face closely resembled that of the rebel leader .
The forehead had been covered with a cloth , but the face was exposed , its eyes and mouth open .
The footage also showed a copy of a military ID tag written in Tamil , bearing the number " 0:01 " , and what appeared to be a Tamil Tiger identity card bearing Prabhakaran 's photograph .
' Liberation ' VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARAN
Born November , 1954 1972 : Founded Tamil New Tigers ( TNT ) , forerunner of LTTE Reputation as fearless and ruthless leader Pioneered use of suicide bombings in guerilla warfare Wanted in Sri Lanka and India
Tamil doubts over death Obituary : Velupillai Prabhakaran
Winning the peace Joy and wariness in Sri Lanka Earlier , in a nationally televised live address , President Rajapaksa hailed " a day which is very , very significant - not only to us Sri Lankans but to the entire world " .
" Today we have been able to liberate the entire country from the clutches of terrorism , " he said .
" We have been able to defeat one of the most heinous terrorist groups in the world . "
As he walked into parliament , schoolgirls sang an ancient song of praise , while lawmakers held up the national flag .
After speaking in his native Sinhala , President Rajapaksa switched to the language of the Tamil minority , saying ethnic and religious divisions should end .
" We must find a homegrown solution to this conflict .
That solution should be acceptable to all the communities . "
Denial On Monday the army said it had killed Prabhakaran after over - running the last patch of territory held by the Tamil Tiger rebels ( Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , or LTTE ) .

It said Prabhakaran , who founded and had led the LTTE since the mid-1970s , was shot dead with two senior deputies as they tried to escape .
There were scenes of jubilation across the country as reports of Prabhakaran 's death spread .
Drivers and motorcyclists sounded their horns , while others waved flags and set off firecrackers .
" We are happy today to see the end of that ruthless terrorist organisation and its heartless leader .
We can live in peace after this , " said Sinhalese businessman Lal Hettige .
SRI LANKA CONFLICT TIMELINE 1976 - LTTE formed 1983 - First attacks by Tamil Tiger rebels ; start of ' First Eelam War ' Feb 2002 - Government and rebels sign ceasefire 2004 - 2008 - Violence mounts Jan 2008 - Government pulls out of ceasefire agreement Jan 2009 - Government captures Tigers ' Kilinochchi headquarters May 2009 - Government declares victory against Tigers
In pictures : Sri Lanka victorious Media react to ' victory '
However , the website TamilNet quoted LTTE diplomatic head Selvarajah Pathmanathan as saying Prabhakaran was still alive .
" I wish to inform the global Tamil community distressed witnessing the final events of the war that our beloved leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran is alive and safe , " he said .
Neither sides ' claims have been independently verified because reporters are not allowed into the former conflict zone .
The Tigers had been fighting for a separate state for Tamils in the north and east of Sri Lanka since the 1970s .
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict and thousands displaced .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was " deeply troubled " by civilian deaths and that he would visit Sri Lanka on Friday to assess the situation .

When Thomas and Ann Farrow were found murdered in their paint shop , their heads crushed with a blunt object , the only clue was a bloody right thumbprint on the store ’s empty cash box .
The brazen murder shocked the people of Debtford , a sooty industrial suburb of London .
They clamored for police to find the killer .
The year was 1905 .
Forensic science was in its infancy .
Scotland Yard had only recently begun collecting carefully pressed fingerprints from criminals , stashing the cards in pigeonholes of a makeshift filing system .
But Scotland Yard Inspector Charles Collins believed that the bloody print could help him solve his crime .
After learning that a man named Alfred Stratton had been seen near the crime scene , he collected the unemployed ruffian ’s thumbprint and compared it with the one left at the crime scene .
A close inspection showed there were 11 minute features that the two prints shared .
Advertisement
The prosecutor at Stratton ’s trial told jurors the similarities left “ not the shadow of a doubt ” that the crime - scene print belonged to Stratton .
But the defense had a surprising ally at their table : Henry Faulds , a Scottish doctor who two decades earlier was the first to propose using fingerprints to solve crimes .
Faulds believed that even if fingerprints were unique -- there was , after all , no scientific basis for the popular assumption -- the same was not necessarily true of “ smudges , ” the blurry partial prints accidentally left behind at crime scenes in blood , sweat or grease .
A single bloody thumbprint , he felt , was not enough evidence to convict anyone of murder .
Advertisement
Stratton ’s trial would be the first test of the new science of fingerprinting , and it raised concerns that , more than a century later , still have not been addressed .
Today , fingerprints are once again on trial .
In 2007 , a Maryland judge threw out fingerprint evidence in a death penalty case , calling it “ a subjective , untested , unverifiable identification procedure that purports to be infallible . ”
The ruling sided with the scientists , law professors and defense lawyers who for a decade had been noting the dearth of research into the reliability of fingerprinting .
Their lonely crusade for sound science in the courtroom has often been ignored by the courts , but last month it was endorsed by the prestigious National Academy of Sciences .
Advertisement
The question is not whether fingerprints are unique -- most scientists agree they probably are , though that assumption remains largely unstudied .
The issue is whether the blurry partial prints often found at crime scenes -- what Faulds called “ smudges ” -- are sufficient to identify someone with any reliability .
The answer : No one knows .
There are no national standards for declaring a fingerprint “ match . ”
As a result , fingerprint identifications are largely subjective .
For ages , people have marveled at the immutable ridges , arches , loops and whorls embedded in every fingertip .
Believing them unique , ancient Babylonians pressed their fingers into wet clay tablets to sign legal contracts .
But it was not until the 1880s that Faulds discovered their utility as a forensic tool .
He had begun cataloging the curious impressions when someone stole alcohol from his laboratory , according to Colin Beavan , the author of a book about Faulds and the Stratton trial .
Faulds used the fingerprints left on the glass vial to identify the culprit -- the first known use of latent prints to solve a crime .
Advertisement
But by the time of Stratton ’s trial in 1905 , fingerprinting had moved from the realm of scientists to that of police agencies .
Faulds was sitting silently at the defense table , Beavan wrote , stewing bitterly .
The limitations of his technique were being ignored .
“ The least smudginess in the printing of them might easily veil important divergences ... with appalling results , ” Faulds wrote in a book that year .
Police were “ apt to misunderstand or overstrain , in their natural eagerness to secure convictions . ”
His warnings were ignored .
Jurors took just two hours to decide Stratton ’s fate , with the fingerprint as the only piece of evidence linking him to the crime .
He and his brother were hanged 19 days later .
Advertisement
The concerns Faulds raised would go unanswered and largely ignored for decades as fingerprints became definitive proof of identity .
What had started as a hypothesis for 19th century scientists became an article of faith for forensic scientists and the courts in the 20th century , says Michael Saks , the author of several articles on the social history of identification sciences .
When fingerprints were first used in an American court in a 1920 Chicago murder trial , a juror told reporters that “ fingerprints and fingerprints alone convinced us . ”
Ever since , experts have claimed their power to eliminate any doubt .
That air of certainty soon carried over to other emerging forms of forensic identification .
Handwriting , shoe prints , tire tracks , bite marks -- all were asserted to be reliable identifiers , based largely on faith and police experience rather than any rigorous scientific study .
Even the hard science of DNA evidence gained credibility in its early days by calling itself “ genetic fingerprinting . ”
Even today , fingerprint experts present their conclusions as nothing short of certainty .
Many testify that fingerprinting has an error rate of zero .
Few judges have been willing to question such statements , fearful of contradicting a century of legal precedent .
Advertisement
Only recently , with the advent of DNA evidence , have the “ appalling results ” that Faulds warned of begun to come to light .
In 2004 , the Boston Police Department was forced to shut down its fingerprint lab after a “ glaring mistake ” led to a wrongful conviction .
That same year , the FBI ’s top fingerprint analysts were forced to admit that they were wrong after claiming to be “ absolutely confident ” that a fingerprint had linked a lawyer in Oregon to the Madrid train bombings .
The Los Angeles Police Department is now reviewing nearly 1,000 fingerprint cases after an internal review that found two people had been wrongfully accused by fingerprint “ matches . ”
If the National Academy report succeeds in forcing the courts to ponder questions first raised a century ago , Faulds , who went to his grave in 1930 still angry that the limits of “ smudges ” were being ignored , might finally rest in peace .

Primary challenges to moderate Dems are ' healthy ' for democracy : Hamsher Rachel Oswald
Published : Monday April 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Targeting moderate Democrats in primaries can only be good for democracy , a prominent liberal blogger and activist told RAW STORY Friday .
Last week , Rep. Chris Van Hollen , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , warned that groups pushing for a more liberal Congress in 2010 could see their strategy backfire with more Republicans elected instead .
 What Ive been warning people very clearly is , beware of forming a circular firing squad , " Van Hollen said at a press conference last Wednesday .
" We believe people should be focusing their efforts on expanding the Democratic majority , and that should be their singular focus . "
Hamsher , however , disagreed with this sentiment .
 If Representative Van Hollen believes in democracy , he should be happy about this .
If hes not happy about this , you have to wonder what he believes ,  Hamsher said .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said that what liberals groups are trying to do is not helpful to the Democratic Party 's goal of increasing Democratic majorities in Congress .
" It s not helpful to me .
It s not helpful to the Democratic Caucus , " Reid said .
Formed with the intention of targeting incumbent Democrats that are viewed as being too beholden to corporate interests , the Accountability Now Political Action Committee plans to run a slew of progressive candidates in primaries across the country in 2010 .
In addition to Hamsher , who started Firedoglake.com , Accountablity Now includes Salons Glenn Greenwald and Daily Kos creator Markos Moulitsas .
It is also supported by MoveOn.org .
Hamsher said Accountability
Now was not above recruiting Republicans with progressive leanings to run in primaries in safely red districts .
 We think a healthy primary market on both sides of the aisle is good for democracy ,  she said .
Hamsher declined to mention which districts specifically the group was looking at .
 Right now were in the stage of looking at districts around the country and recruiting candidates ,  said Hamsher .
 We dont want to give away too much too soon . 
In their strategy to choose which Democratic incumbents to go after , Accountability Now is focusing on Congressmen whose votes dont match up with the political views of their constituents .
As an example , Hamsher points to Democratic Congressmen who hail from districts with high foreclosure rates but that saw fit to vote last week in favor of an amendment that would weaken attempts to cap executive pay at companies receiving federal bailout money .
Accountability
Now will be closely looking at November 2008 election results , Hamsher said .
While President Obama helped a lot of shaky Democrats win their elections by bringing out large numbers of supporters to the polls , Democrats wont have the advantage of a president headlining the top of their tickets in 2010 .
Hamsher and others are hoping this will make Congressional conservative and moderate Democrats more vulnerable to the criticism of liberal groups .
Many factors are in play to determine whether an Accountability Now candidate would do well in a primary race .
These include consideration of the strength of the local party machine and the media market cost of running ads .
Also weighed is the risk of losing a general election to a Republican after successfully besting the incumbent Democrat during the primary .
That last concern though , according to Hamsher , is not as great as some might think because so many districts across the country have become so gerrymandered that there is little chance of party - seats changing over .
 We re just trying to build a healthy primary environment , " Hamsher said .
" We believe that s good for democracy . 

One - third of the Maldives ' economy depends on tourism
The Maldives will become carbon - neutral within a decade by switching completely to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power , its leader has said .
President Mohamed Nasheed told the BBC the Maldives understood better than most what would happen if the world failed to tackle climate change .
His tiny country is one of the lowest - lying on Earth and so is extremely vulnerable to rises in sea level .
He said he hoped his plan would serve as a blueprint for other nations .
We start almost from scratch ... and it is quite pointless for us to go to yesterday 's technologies
President Mohamed Nasheed
Heightened fears for lowering lands Country profile : The Maldives Mr Nasheed was due to announce the plan formally after the screening of a new film on climate change , The Age of Stupid , on Sunday .
The Maldives is made up of a chain of nearly 1,200 islands , most of them uninhabited , which lie off the Indian sub - continent .
None of the coral islands measures more than 1.8 metres ( six feet ) above sea level , making the country vulnerable to a rise in sea levels associated with global warming .
' Starting from scratch '
" We understand more than perhaps anyone what would happen to us if we did n't do anything about it or if the rest of the world does n't find the imagination to confront this problem , " Mr Nasheed told Newshour , speaking by telephone from the capital , Male .

It is estimated that the Maldives , which has high levels of poverty , will need to spend about $ 110 m a year to make the transition to renewable energy sources .
Asked how it could afford this , the president said the country was already spending similar sums on existing energy sources , and he expected to recover the extra cost within the decade .
" We start almost from scratch , we are having to go for new investments in almost all areas and it is quite pointless for us to go to yesterday 's technologies , " he said .
The Age of Stupid stars British actor Pete Postlethwaite as an old man living in a devastated future Earth , watching archive film of the planet and asking why more was not done to combat climate change .
The film 's producer , Franny Armstrong , told the BBC the Maldives had set a good example to the developed world .
" I think the challenge has now been laid down by the Maldives , a very poor undeveloped country , " she said .
" So now it 's over to us , to the rich countries . "

When phosphates are outlawed , only outlaws will use phosphates .
A Spokane County , Wash. , ban on dishwasher detergents that contain phosphates has led to residents crossing the border into Idaho to seek out forbidden cleaners .
Residents says that the greener alternatives left on the shelves - Seventh Generation , Ecover or phosphate - free products from Palmolive and other companies - just do n't clean as well , although that might be due more to hard water than the ingredients in them .
The Washington Lake Protection Association is encouraging consumers to try out different green brands or install water softeners , but that 's not enough to stop the stream of residents looking for their old detergents elsewhere .
Steve Marcy , manager of the Costco in Coeur d'Alene , about 10 miles east of the Washington state line , estimated that sales of dishwasher detergent in his store have increased 10 percent .
He knows where the customers are coming from .
" I 'll joke with them and ask if they are from Spokane , " Marcy said .
" They say , ` Oh yeah . ' "
Those who bring in banned detergents are n't really breaking any laws .
The ban applies to selling detergents with phosphates , not to using or possessing them .
Phosphates are a concern in consumer products because when they end up in streams , lakes and rivers ( they are n't easily removed in wastewater treatment plants ) , they promote the growth of algae , which sucks up oxygen , stealing it from other animals and organisms in the water .
The ban on dishwasher detergents with phosphates is set to take effect across Washington state in July 2010 though it 's starting in Spokane County .
Under the ban , dishwasher detergents can have no more than 0.5 percent phosphates , compared to conventional detergents , which have up to 9 percent phosphates .
Similar bans have gone into effect or will take place in Illinois , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , New York , Pennsylvania , Vermont and Virginia .
Phosphates have been banned from laundry detergent since the early 1990s .

Harman begins to backtrack denials of wiretap story John Byrne
Published : Wednesday April 22 , 2009
Print This Email This The California Democrat who was allegedly caught on an FBI wiretap promising to aid accused Israeli spies in 2005 has begun walking back her original denials .
Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) originally denied -- emphatically -- that she had in any way agreed in a plot to get herself appointed chairwoman of the House Intelligence Committee by getting an Israeli agent to work a major California donor to threaten to withhold campaign contributions from then - Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) .
The call between Harman and the Israeli national was caught on an FBI wiretap as part of a broader Israeli espionage case .
But in an interview on National Public Radio's " All Things Considered , " Harman began qualifying her answers under heavy questioning .
" We do n't know if there was a phone call , " Harman said , backtracking on her previous statements .
Pressed on the specifics of the call , Harman said she could n't " recall with any specificity a conversation I may have had four years ago . "
Harman also appeared on numerous news networks , including CNN and MSNBC , to press her case of denial -- before beginning to backtrack on her answers .

MINNEAPOLIS , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
A three - judge panel ruled Monday against Republican Norm Coleman in his dispute with Democrat Al Franken over who should be declared the winner of the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota .
GOP Sen .
Norm Coleman , left , and Democrat Al Franken are in a battle for a Minnesota Senate seat .
The judges determined that " Franken is entitled to receive the certificate of election " after defeating Coleman by 312 votes .
The Minnesota secretary of state is unlikely to issue that certificate , however , until all legal proceedings have been completed .
Coleman has 10 days to appeal the 68 - page ruling to the state Supreme Court and could opt to continue into the federal arena if he loses at the state level .
Defense attorney Ben Ginsberg told CNN that the court 's order " wrongly disenfranchised " thousands of voters .
" The court 's ruling tonight is consistent with how they 've ruled throughout this case but inconsistent with the Minnesota tradition of enfranchising voters , " he said .
" This order ignores the reality of what happened in the counties and cities on Election Day in terms of counting the votes .
" By its own terms , the court has included votes it has found to be ' illegal ' in the contest to remain included in the final counts from Election Day , and equal protection and due process concerns have been ignored .
For these reasons , we must appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court so that no voter is left behind . "
Franken , saying he was confident he would eventually be certified , urged Coleman not to appeal and to " let me get to work as soon as possible . "
" The campaign for this Senate seat has been long and expensive , " he told reporters outside his home .
" The fight ahead , the fight to rebuild our economy and broken healthcare system and to restore our standing in the world , that 's a fight we must win .
It 's a fight we must win by setting aside partisan gamesmanship and working together . "
Coleman , the freshman senator who 's seeking a second term , led Franken after Election Day by 215 votes out of nearly 3 million cast in the contest .
That tiny margin triggered an automatic recount , which took nearly two months to complete .
Franken , the progressive radio talk show host , comedian , and former cast member of " Saturday Night Live , " led by 225 votes after the statewide recount results were announced at the beginning of this year .
Coleman contested the results and took the case to court .
The key issue in the proceedings was whether some rejected absentee ballots should have been included in the recount .
Earlier in the process , the panel allowed the addition of more than 300 wrongly excluded absentee ballots , resulting in 198 more votes for Franken and 111 more for Coleman .
But Monday 's decision dismisses Coleman 's complaint and orders him to pay attorneys ' fees .
The court rejected Coleman 's arguments that Minnesota 's election laws violate the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution , acknowledging that some errors were made but that the simple fact of an error does not automatically rise to the level of a violation .
" Equal protection does not guarantee a perfect election , " the judges wrote .
Further , the judges said , equal protection does not require that each county in the state handle ballots " with rigid sameness . "
The bottom line , the judges said , was that Coleman failed to meet the burden of proof and especially , they said , did not show that " errors or irregularities affected the outcome of the election . "
" The overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that the November 4 , 2008 , election was conducted fairly , impartially and accurately , " the judges wrote in an addendum to the ruling .
" After seven weeks of trial , the factual record is devoid of any allegations of fraud , tampering , or security breaches on Election Day , during the recount process , or during the election contest , " they wrote .
" On the contrary , the general election resulted in a ' fair expression ' of the voters of Minnesota .
If Franken is ultimately determined to be the winner , he would become the 59th member of the Democrats ' coalition in a chamber that requires 60 votes to break a filibuster .

A strong earthquake has struck south of Mexico 's capital , Mexico City , causing buildings to shake and prompting workers to rush out on to the streets .
The quake had a magnitude of 5.6 , according to the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
The USGS said the quake had hit 240 km ( 150 miles ) south of the capital .
There were no reports of injuries .
Mexico is currently battling an outbreak of the swine flu virus , which has claimed as many as 149 lives there .
The tremor struck at about 1145 local time ( 1645 GMT ) and was centred near the southern city of Chilpancingo .
" I 'm scared , " Sarai Luna Pajas , a 22 - year - old Mexico City resident , told the Associated Press news agency .
" We Mexicans are not used to living with so much fear , but all that is happening - the economic crisis , the illnesses and now this - it feels like the Apocalypse . "
The USGS initially measured the earthquake 's magnitude at 6.0 but later revised the figure down to 5.6 .
If North Korea successfully launches its rocket , it would demonstrate that the North has the technological skills to send up a missile that could travel as far as the western United States .
Washington and its allies also consider North Korea ’s missile program an additional threat because the North has sold missile technology to the Middle East and is developing nuclear weapons that could potentially be loaded on its missiles .
After North Korea detonated its first nuclear device in 2006 , the Security Council adopted a resolution banning North Korea from further nuclear and missile tests .
Washington warned that it would seek punishment at the Security Council  probably more sanctions on the already isolated country  if it goes ahead with the planned launch .
And Japan has vowed to press for new sanctions if the rocket is tested .
But North Korea warned this week that further sanctions would cause it to quit the so - called six - party talks .
The United States , South Korea , Japan , China and Russia have been trying for years to persuade North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic aid .
The North ’s defiance is the first major test for President Obama in dealing with Pyongyang .
“ We intend to raise this violation of the Security Council resolution , if it goes forward , in the U.N. , ” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday .
“ This provocative action in violation of the U.N. mandate will not go unnoticed , and there will be consequences . ”
The mother who is helping her Down 's son lose his virginity insists :
He has just as much right to a love life as anyone else
Otto Baxter 's mother Lucy has caused controversy by appealing for a woman who will help her Down 's Syndrome son lose his virginity
Sipping a bitter shandy , Otto Baxter is describing to me his ideal girlfriend .
He 'd like her to be pretty , petite , with a good sense of humour to match his own .
Someone like former pop star and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Rachel Stevens would do , he says .
' I want to meet a nice girl , I want to make love , I want to get married one day , ' he grins , ' but I do n't want any children .
I can't be doing with getting up in the night and changing nappies . '
So , not very different from other 21 - year - old , hot - blooded males .
Only Otto has Down 's syndrome and his public quest to find a lover - to be just like his friends - has stirred up a hornet 's nest of controversy over the taboo subject of disability and sex .
This week , his adoptive mother Lucy Baxter , 51 , was accused of being ' odd ' , ' irresponsible ' , ' creepy ' , and ' strange ' after she revealed she was actively helping her son seek a partner , setting up a Bebo page for him on the net and researching dating agencies so Otto can ' enjoy the same experiences as other men his age ' .
Her assertion that she would support him if he ever wanted to seek the services of a prostitute prompted an even more vitriolic response that she would be ' pimping ' out her son rather than protecting a vulnerable young man .
Some readers found the very thought ' disgusting ' .
Far from being hurt , Lucy Baxter welcomes the debate her words have sparked , bringing the whole issue of Down 's syndrome and sexuality into the open .
No matter how uncomfortable people feel about it , she says , young people with Down 's have exactly the same emotions and desires as so - called ' normal ' people , so why should they be deprived of a fully - rounded life ?
As she points out , Otto - while unable to lead a completely independent life - is on the higher functioning scale of Down 's syndrome , with no medical issues and better cognitive abilities than many , further enhanced by his education and upbringing .
' Only last Sunday , Otto came downstairs and said to me : " Mum , I really want a girlfriend , " ' says Lucy , who works for the mental health charity Mencap and lives in Abingdon , Oxfordshire .
Lucy insists
Otto is just the same as any other young man of his age so why should he be treated any differently
' It 's not bravado , he just wants to be like everyone else .
All his friends are slowly pairing off and his cousins now have girlfriends .
He feels he 's lagging behind .
' He 's a romantic .
He thinks he 's James Bond half the time .
Recently , he won two wine glasses in a raffle and he dreams of the day he can entwine arms with a girlfriend and drink from them over a candlelit dinner .
' And yes , just like other 21 - year - old men , he 's interested in sex .
Why should n't I help him try to find a partner in the same way I 've helped him make friends , educate him and write his CV to get a job ?
This is what he wants and I 'm simply supporting him .
' If he is capable of forming long - lasting friendships with so - called normal people , I really can't see why he would n't be able to sustain a sexual relationship , too .
Otto has female friends but is yet to lose his virginity
' And although he says he does n't want children now , I think that 's because he 's 21 and that 's how most young men feel .
But when he 's 30 or 40 , I think it would be wonderful . '
But to say she would n't mind him going to a prostitute ?
Most mothers would prefer to encourage their sons to form loving , respectful relationships with the opposite sex rather than pay for a soulless encounter .
' I would never pay for him to go to a prostitute , but if he wanted to pay himself to go to one , I would n't object .
I think a lot of 21 - year - old single men joke about going to Amsterdam and would consider paying a prostitute as a dare .
The point I 'm making is that Otto is no different from everyone else .
' I 'm not appealing for women to come forward just so he can have sex - that would be tasteless .
What I want for him is the same thing all mothers want for their sons .
' I think people feel so uncomfortable about the thought of someone with Down 's having sex or getting married because they see herds of these young adults tramping down the street to go to some day centre , people who have been put in a box through fear and prejudice and deprived of cultural stimulation , education , challenges , expectations and , in some cases , love .
' Any child , regardless of whether they have Down's , brought up deprived of all those things would be incapable of sustaining a healthy relationship .
' But Otto has n't been brought up like that .
He 's been to mainstream school , he 's been educated , he 's appeared as an actor in local stage productions , he 's been on a mini- gap year to India , volunteering in a children 's orphanage .
' In a few days time he 'll be travelling to Las Vegas to promote himself as an actor .
I want him to have a fullyrounded life , and having a girlfriend is part of that .
Ideally , I 'd like him to have a girlfriend without Down 's because he needs someone as sophisticated and educated as he is .
Otto says he enjoys swimming and football on his internet blog but is also ' scared of sex with older ladies '
' He needs to be with someone he has something in common with and he wo n't find that with a girl who 's spent her life in day - care centres .
' To expect him to marry another person with Down 's is a bit like saying that all people with red hair should marry each other .
' I think that it is very sad , almost criminal , that some children with Down 's are not encouraged to share our culture .
A treat for them is going to McDonald's .
We all have rites of passage in our lives ; that special celebratory meal , the first weekend away with your boyfriend .
' But for most children with Down 's , there will be a shandy and a tame party with their parents at 18 or 21 - and nothing else .
It just stops there , which is so wrong . '
At the beginning of the last century the life expectancy of people with Down 's was nine years , but today it is more than 50 , and one in ten is expected to live to 70 years of age .
These days , it is widely accepted that having Down 's syndrome does not protect against the hormonal maelstrom which usually accompanies adolescence .
Lecturer and author Dr Stephen Trumble believes people with disabilities are sexual beings and those with Down 's syndrome are no exception .
' It is a grave injustice , ' he writes , ' to hold a stereotype of people with Down 's as " happy eternal children " , as any parent will agree .
' Teenagers with Down 's are subject to the same tempers , desires and emotions as anyone else , although they are often more frustrated in their expression . '
Lucy accepts that not all people with Down 's are capable of , or desire , what Otto so clearly yearns for .
Yet one can't help but wonder if her crusade to give
Otto a normal life and one day become a grandmother has made her dismiss valid concerns as prejudice .
After all , although Otto has travelled widely , he does so in the company of a personal assistant and does need help and protection .
According to the scant research available , fertility is impaired in both sexes in the Down 's syndrome population and only one man with Down 's in the UK has been recorded as giving birth to a normal child .
Women with Down 's are , according to one study , 50 per cent more likely to have a child with the same condition , and experts have expressed concern over the parenting abilities of such adults ; they may be more likely to neglect their children through acts of omission , especially without familial and societal support .
Many parents and carers of Down 's children are often alarmed by emerging sexuality , often rightly fearing that
Once only available through the Apple TV , HD movies can now be purchased or rented directly through iTunes on Macs and PCs .
The company now says that customers of the US iTunes Store can buy new - release movies in 720 p directly from iTunes for $ 19.99 and rent them for $ 4.99 within 30 days of their being made available for sale .
Many older titles are also available for rent in the HD format for $ 3.99 .
As with TV shows , each HD copy also comes with a standard - definition version of the movie that can be transferred to an iPhone or iPod , neither of which yet supports HD .
The initial lineup of HD rentals includes pre-orders for the Bond movie Quantum of Solace as well as Twilight and is focusing on new releases .
An HD Movies page is currently highlighting those titles that are already available at the increased resolution .
Using the feature requires iTunes 8.1 or higher and a Mac or Windows PC capable of smoothly playing HD movies .
The iconic " Pillars of Creation " in the Eagle Nebula are vast clouds of gas and dust that are known hide embryonic stars , but astronomers are still working out how the dramatic structures could form .
A new model presented at an astronomy meeting in the UK this week suggests one mechanism .
Roving gas clouds will accumulate in shadowy regions where they are most shielded from the intense ultraviolet light of young , hot stars , the research suggests .
Over the course of 150,000 years or so , these clouds can merge together to form pillars .
The original clouds needed to form such large pillars might need to be especially dense , since some estimates pin the age of the nebula at just 100,000 years old .
Some astronomers suspect a supernova blast might have already blown the pillars away , but because of the time it takes light from the nebula to reach Earth , we will not witness their destruction for another 1000 years .

This bubble was spotted in Centaurus A , a galaxy that boasts a supermassive black hole at its core .
As matter falls towards the black hole , jets of plasma are thrown out .
These inflate large bubbles filled with energetic particles , driving shock waves through the stars and gas that surround the galaxy 's core .
This creates X - rays and gamma rays that are visible from Earth .
Centaurus A , which sits some 14 million light years away , is thought to be the nearest galaxy to contain such jets .

A 100,000 - light - year - long fountain of stars , gas , and dust seems to be streaming down from a pair of colliding galaxies ( top ) .
The gravitational forces involved have stretched a spiral arm and stoked star formation , creating a bright blue streamer full of newborn , blue stars .
A third galaxy ( bottom ) seems to be connected by this bridge of material , but it is actually in the background and not connected at all .
Together the trio of galaxies are part of a system known as Arp 194 and they sit about 600 million light years away from Earth in the constellation Cepheus .
The Hubble Space Telescope 's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 , which is set to be replaced next month , took this image , which was released to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the telescope 's launch on 24 April 1990 .

The final space shuttle mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope passed an important milestone this week , as the Hubble cargo was stowed on the space shuttle Atlantis ( foreground ) .
Since the telescope orbits at an altitude that is more than 100 kilometres higher than the International Space Station , astronauts will not be able to reach the station in case of an emergency .
As a result , the Kennedy Space Center in Florida is keeping the space shuttle Endeavour at the ready in case a rescue mission is needed .
Both shuttles are now installed on their launch pads , which sit some 2.5 kilometres away from one another .

A large haul of unusual white dwarfs has been found in an ancient swarm of stars called NGC 6397 , which orbits the Milky Way and sits some 7200 light years away in the southern constellation Ara .
White dwarfs , the dense remains of sun- like stars , ordinarily contain carbon and oxygen .
But a new study has found 18 white dwarfs that seem to be made of helium .
All told , the star cluster NGC 6397 contains two dozen of the unusual helium - core dwarfs .
The stars ' positions in the centre of the cluster suggests they are anchored there by heavy , as yet unidentified companions .
These companions could have pulled away a lot of material from the stars before the stars became white dwarfs , preventing them from forming heavier elements .
Stellar pairs are thought to play an important role in such globular clusters , stirring up surrounding stars and preventing the core from getting too dense and collapsing to form a large black hole .

The Las Vegas Sun won the most prestigious Public Service Prize for reporting on the high death rate among construction workers on the Las Vegas strip , according to the board of the Pulitzer Prizes in Journalism , Letters , Drama and Music .
The strength of the prize winners ’ work shows the power and significance of print journalism , said Sig Gissler , administrator of the Pulitzers .
Newspapers are suffering badly in the recession , with massive job losses , elimination of sections and cancellation of home delivery .
A few have ceased publication , slashed salaries and filed for bankruptcy .
“ The watchdog still barks .
The watchdog still bites , ” Gissler said .
“ Who would be doing this day to day if we did n’t have newspapers ? ”
None of the prizes went to stories about the economy or the financial crisis .
The Wall Street Journal , one of the nation ’s most prestigious daily papers , did not win a prize this year .
The paper has not won a Pulitzer since Rupert Murdoch bought it through News Corp ’s purchase of Dow Jones & Co in December 2007 .
In the previous 10 years , the Journal won Pulitzers in all but two years .
This marked the first year that entries from news organizations that publish entirely on the Internet could compete in the journalism categories .
Despite the growth of online journalism , there were no online winners and only Politico.com , a largely online outlet , was a finalist in editorial cartooning , said Gissler .
The editorial cartooning prize went to Steve Breen of The San Diego Union Tribune .
The New York Times staff won the breaking news reporting award for coverage of a sex scandal that led to the resignation of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and international reporting for coverage of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan under dangerous conditions .
The Times won for investigative reporting by David Barstow on retired U.S. generals who were working as media analysts and co-opted by the Pentagon to defend the U.S. - led war in Iraq .
PICTURES OF OBAMA CAMPAIGN
The feature photography prize went to the Times ’ Damon Winter for pictures of Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign and the criticism prize went to Times ’ art critic Holland Cotter .
The record number of Pulitzers won in any year was the Times , which won seven in 2002 .
The Los Angeles Times won for explanatory reporting on the cost and effectiveness of attempts to combat wildfires across the western United States .
Local reporting was a tie between the Detroit Free Press for uncovering lies by Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick , including denial of a sexual relationship with his female chief of staff , that led to jail terms for the two officials , and the East Valley Tribune of Mesa , Arizona , for showing how a focus on immigration enforcement endangered public safety .
National reporting went to the St. Petersburg Times for PolitiFact , a fact - checking initiative in the presidential campaign that examined more than 750 political claims .
Lane DeGregory of the St. Petersburg
Times won the feature writing award for the story of a neglected little girl found in a roach - infested room , unable to talk or feed herself , who was adopted by a new family .
The award for breaking news photography went to Patrick Farrell of The Miami Herald for coverage of damage and despair caused by Hurricane Ike and other storms in Haiti .
The commentary prize went to Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post for writings on the presidential campaign .
The editorial writing prize went to Mark Mahoney of The Post - Star in Glens Falls , New York , for writing about the dangers of local government secrecy .
NON - NEWS CATEGORIES
The fiction prize went to “ Olive Kitteridge ” by Elizabeth Strout of stories from coastal Maine .
The history prize went to “ The Hemingses of Monticello : An American Family ” by Annette Gordon - Reed , which won a U.S. National Book Award in 2008 .
It tells the story of a slave family with ties to President Thomas Jefferson .
The drama prize went to playwright Lynn Nottage , who explored rape as a weapon of war in “ Ruined , ” set in a Congolese brothel .
The prize for biography went to “ American Lion : Andrew Jackson in the White House ” by Jon Meacham , and the general non-fiction prize went to “ Slavery by Another Name : The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II ” by Douglas A. Blackmon .
The poetry prize went to “ The Shadow of Sirius ” by W.S. Merwin and the music prize went to “ Double Sextet ” by Steve Reich .
There were 1,028 entries submitted , down slightly from the previous year ’s 1,167 entries for the prizes honouring the best in U.S. print journalism .

On Tuesday , South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster notified craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster that unless craigslist removes its erotic services section within 10 days , " craigslist management may be subject to criminal investigation and prosecution . "
McMaster 's threat comes on the heels of increasingly bellicose rhetoric in recent weeks from other AGs such as Rhode Island AG Patrick Lynch , Illinois AG Lisa Madigan , and Connecticut AG Richard Blumenthal .
The case further echos the suit brought by Cook County ( Illinois ) Sheriff Thomas Dart back in March seeking , among other things , compensation for funds the County spent on combating prostitution .
The AGs would almost certainly lose any such threatened lawsuit .
Craigslist , as previous courts have held , is protected by federal law .
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , passed in 1996 , immunizes providers of " interactive computer service " such as Craigslist -- website operators , ISPs , domain name registrars -- from state criminal liability for content posted by third parties .
Under CDA 230 , it is irrelevant that such a service might have known about the posts or could have done more to block them .
Indeed , one of the explicit rationales for passing CDA 230 in the first place was to protect service providers who wanted to engage in the kinds of self - regulatory measures as Craigslist has already done to help limit access to sexually explicit materials online .
As California Representative Christopher
Cox noted in support of the future statute , CDA 230 would “ protect [ online service providers ] from taking on liability ... that they should not face ... for helping us solve this problem ” as well as establish a federal policy of nonregulation to “ encourage what is right now the most energetic technological revolution that any of us has ever witnessed . ”
The notion that craigslist ( and their officers ! ) should be held responsible for third party content on their site because they did n't do enough to satisfy the individual whims of respective state attorneys general is wholly inconsistent with the law .
In fact , craigslist has gone far beyond their obligations under the law .
In November of 2008 , craigslist agreed to implement a series of technical and policy changes to curb the use of their site for illegal purposes by third parties , including ( among other things ) requiring telephone and credit card verification for " erotic services " ads posted on their site , automatically blocking certain ads that it believes may be illegal , tagging adult - oriented ads to help facilitate the effectiveness of parental - screening software , improving its search capabilities in an attempt to help law enforcement to locate missing persons and identify exploited minors and victims of human trafficking , and the like .
Even before their November 2008 agreement , according to craigslist , the number of erotic services ads dropped 90 % as a result of craigslist 's own internal efforts to screen ads that violated their terms of service .
Despite these efforts and results , it appears that some of craigslist 's governmental critics will remain unsatisfied unless they can control the ad categories offered on the site .
Attorney General Henry McMaster has no case .
Neither do AGs Lynch or Blumenthal .
And neither does Sheriff Dart , as craigslist explained Monday in their motion to dismiss his March lawsuit .
While the AGs may wish it was not so , federal law protects craigslist and no amount of posturing will change that fact .
And that 's a good thing .
The existence of sites that rely on third party content depends on strong uniform legal protections against liability based on material posted by users .
If site operators were forced to screen all third party contributions under risk of civil or criminal penalty , the Internet would lose many of the vibrant services that have made it so dynamic .
The problem would be further compounded if , as these state AGs now suggest , each state was able to put together its own wish list instructing website operators how to treat third party content .
Under such a radical re-envisioning , the Internet would ultimately become the province of rich and cautious media companies who would actively serve as gatekeepers to decide whether and how users could engage with the world .
The AGs are wrong to promote such a profound change ... and out of line to suggest that such a legal world already exists .

CNSNews is reporting the U.S. Army has launched an investigation into the deployment of troops on the streets of Samson , Alabama , after a murder spree on March 10 .
The use of the troops in domestic law enforcement is a violation of the Posse Comitatus
Act substantially limiting the powers of the federal government to use the military for law enforcement .
From Reuters : “ U.S. Army soldiers from Ft. Rucker patrol the downtown area of Samson , Alabama after a shooting spree March 10 , 2009 . ”
Alabama Gov. Bob Riley did not deploy the troops or were they sent by the request of president Obama , CNSNews reports .
Todd Stacy , spokesman for Riley , was unaware of the deployment and expressed surprise when he was told that troops had been sent to the town .
Harvey Perritt , spokesman for the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command ( TRADOC ) at Fort Monroe , Virginia , said the Army has launched an inquiry to determine “ whether law , regulation and policy were followed . ”
TRADOC is the headquarters command for Ft. Rucker .
On March 11 , Infowars posted an article on the deployment after we saw a Reuters photo of soldiers in downtown Samson following the shooting incident .
The deployment of federal troops was not reported by the corporate media with the exception of the photo .
If not for Infowars , the alternative media and the blogosphere , the story would have gone unreported and the Army would likely not have launched an investigation .
[ efoods ]
After Alex Jones covered the story on his radio program , hundreds of people called the Samson Police Department and the the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Rucker complaining about the deployment .
“ We ’ve been getting a lot of calls , ” Jim Stromenger , a dispatcher at the Samson Police Department , told CNSNews .
“ They were n’t here to police , let me make that clear .
They were here to help with traffic and to control the crime scene–so people would n’t trample all over ( it ) . ”
Stromenger said he was unaware of who called the Army and requested the deployment of troops .
The Directorate of Public Safety at the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence at Fort Rucker “ maintains liaison with federal , state and local law enforcement and fire agencies , ” according to the DPS website at Fort Rucker .
Since September 11 , 2001 , and the passage of the Patriot Act and associated legislation , the Posse Comitatus Act has faced repeated challenge and periodic violation .
“ The federal government has also moved in recent years to erode restrictions on the use of the military ’s vast assets for law enforcement operations , ” writes J.D. Tuccille for the Examiner .
“ The military is now explicitly authorized to participate in drug enforcement efforts , as well as to help control immigration and collect tariffs .
States can also call on federal troops to put down insurrections or help with natural disasters .
The federal government can send troops of its own accord to suppress rebellions or when ‘ major public emergencies ’ render state and local authorities incapable of protecting people ’s constitutionally guaranteed rights . ”
CNSNews notes that the U.S. Justice Department has prosecuting authority if it is deemed any violation of the law occurred .
The Justice Department did not respond to CNSNews and it remains to be seen if they will take action in the case .

' Kumar ' actor leaves White Castle for White House Rachel Oswald
Published : Tuesday April 7 , 2009
Print This Email This
Though his character was just killed off on ' House , ' fans of Kal Penn can expect to see the actor - turned - government employee around -- in his new job as a public liaison with President Obama 's White House .
Penn , who did some campaign stumping for Obama in 2008 , told Entertainment Weekly of his decision to voluntarily leave the show after he was offered a position under Obama Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett as an associate director in the White House 's Office of Public Liaison .
" I was incredibly honored a couple of months ago to get the opportunity to go work in the White House , " Penn revealed to EW .
" I got to know the President and some of the staff during the campaign and had expressed interest in working there . "
Penn explained his new job will consist of outreach efforts to the general public and various organizations .
" They 're basically the front door of the White House , " he said of the Office of Public Liaison .
" They take out all of the red tape that falls between the general public and the White House .
It 's similar to what I was doing on the campaign . "
A White House spokesman confirmed to The Chicago Sun-Times that Penn will be working for the Obama administration .
Penn , who first rose to fame through turns in stoner comedies like " Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle , " said he is n't giving up acting for good but that working for the Obama administration is something he really wants to do for now .
" I 've been thinking about [ moving into politics ] for a while ....
From the time I was a kid , I really enjoyed that balance between the arts and public service , " Penn said .
" I thought this might be the right time to go off and do something else .
The ultimate irony , of course , is that I love being on " House ' .
There 's not a smarter group of people that I 've been surrounded by in television . "
Penn played Dr. Lawrence Kutner in the fourth and fifth seasons of " House . "
In one famous scene from " Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay , " Penn 's character gets stoned with President George W. Bush at his Texas home .
In light of his well - known roles as stoner Kumar , some news outlets are cracking jokes about Penn 's appointment .
Jokes Vanity Fair writer Bill Bradley , " While its unclear what the associate director of public liaison does , what is clear is that President Obama is getting weeded out , watching movies , and going , ' I want that guy . '

Moving to Los Angeles and preparing for the long haul
I get this sort of question quite frequently from people : “ I ’m moving to Los Angeles in a few months .
Where should I live and what is a good job to have while pursuing a career as a screenwriter ? ”
Getting established in Los Angeles is a critical step in building a career as a screenwriter .
You need to prepare for the long haul because you ’re most likely not going to sell a script for a long time .
When I first moved to Los Angeles years ago I lived in Valley Village , which used to be part of North Hollywood .
It ’s not one of the hip , trendy places in L.A. to live like the beach communities but it ’s well positioned so you can get to just about anywhere in L.A. in a reasonable amount of time and it ’s about as inexpensive as you ’re going to find in the L.A. area .
It ’s very close ( less than a 15 minute drive ) to Burbank , Toluca Lake , Hollywood , and Studio City .
You can get to places like Los Feliz , Silver Lake , and downtown L.A. fairly easily .
You can get to the Westside ( Santa Monica , West Hollywood , Brentwood , Venice and Culver City ) usually in about an hour during rush hour traffic .
So no matter where you end up working or where you want to get in L.A. , Valley Village is a good choice and probably the best value for your money .
Valley Village bleeds into North Hollywood and prices get even cheaper the further north you go .
If you ’re going to live in North Hollywood try and stay as far south as you can as it gets a little dodgy way up in the northern part of North Hollywood .
Stay in Valley Village or as close to Studio City as you can afford .
As a rule the closer you are to Ventura Blvd .
the better the neighborhood is going to be .
Here ’s a link to Valley Village on Google Maps :
http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS313US313&sourceid=chrome&q=valley+village,+ca&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=us&ei=Rl77SaGIF6DaswPgwJzgAQ&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1
Update : A reader emailed me with a nice tool so you can see pricing and safety ratings in neighborhoods around Los Angeles .
It ’s here : http://www.lalife.com/
Valley Village is here : http://lalife.com/Valley_Village
One word of warning : Valley Village is in the San Fernando Valley and there are people in L.A. who thumb their noses at the Valley .
It ’s definitely not the hippest place in L.A. to live but personally I never cared and was glad to find someplace centrally located for a reasonable price .
If this is a concern for you look in the Hollywood area .
You ’ll probably pay 10 % to 25 % more in Hollywood and 50 % to 100 % more to live in a trendy beach community like Santa Monica or Venice but they are “ cool ” compared to the valley .
Another thing I like about the valley is that it ’s much more suburban where as places like Hollywood or Santa Monica have a more urban feel and getting around is much more difficult than in the Valley .
Do n’t move to L.A. without a car .
Public transportation can work in a pinch but L.A. is too spread out for it to be useful .
L.A. is essentially urban sprawl for hundreds of miles so walking places usually is n’t feasible either .
I love to walk and I ’m a very fast walker but I rarely walk anywhere .
When you first get to L.A .
I highly recommend that you find the best job that you can even if it ’s NOT in the entertainment industry .
If you have experience in a particular field purse a job in that field .
When I first moved to L.A. I worked at a tennis club .
There were lots of actors , writers , producers , and directors who were members of the tennis club so I made lots of “ industry contacts ” quickly .
However , not one of these contacts ever produced any tangible results as far as actually helping my screenwriting career .
Sure they gave me some advice , passed me scripts to read , and even read some of my material and gave me notes on it , but nothing that really helped me sell a script .
Unless you ’re above the line talent ( producer , director , actors , and writer ) working any job in the entertainment business is going to be long hours with minimal pay .
Once I worked as a production assistant for an independent production company and they paid me $ 50 per day for working 10 to 12 hours a day .
After I was hired I found the stack of resumes that they had gone through to choose me .
They had received over 100 resumes so I was lucky to even get the job !
Since I was only making $ 50 per day working for them I continued to teach tennis on the weekends .
As things got busier with the production company they wanted me to work on the weekends and when I refused they fired me !
It does n’t take a mathematician to realize that if you ’re working 12 hours per day Monday thru Friday and then working a second job on the weekends you ’re not going to have a lot of time to work on your writing .
Do n’t fall into this trap .
If you ’re a great networker maybe you can make it work and an industry job would be worth the time you lose .
But I ’m not a good networker so I never made any connections through the industry jobs and I would have been much wiser to spend my time working a more normal job with normal hours and writing in my spare time ( which is what I eventually did ) .
Try to make your life as comfortable as possible so that you like living in Los Angeles .
Find a second career that you enjoy , can make decent money at in case screenwriting does n’t work out , and gives you some spare time and money to continue writing .
If you like living in Los Angeles you ’ll be more apt to stick it out for years , which means you ’ll be more likely to finally sell a script .
If you take that “ survival ” job and end up hating your life you ’ll increasingly feel like moving back home .
Getting established as a screenwriter is n’t going to happen overnight .
In fact there ’s a Hollywood saying that goes something like “ the overnight success takes 10 years . ”
I firmly believe this so if you ’re moving to L.A. be prepared to work hard for 10 years or more before selling a single script .
Make those 10 years as enjoyable and productive as possible .
Life really is a journey not a destination so enjoy the 10 years .
Keep in mind , too , by living in Los Angeles you ’ll be meeting other aspiring filmmakers all the time – even at your non-entertainment industry job .
If you have time and money you can start to work with them on small projects .
Maybe you ’ll meet a director and you can pool some money together and shoot a short film that you wrote .
Maybe you ’ll meet a talented actor who wants you to help him write a vehicle for him to start in – and maybe you ’ll want to shoot a trailer for the script to try and find financing for it .
These are the sorts of things that can slowly build your career but you ca n’t do them if you have no time and no money .
Check out my post
Do you have to live in Los Angeles to be a screenwriter ?
to learn why I think living in L.A. is so critical to being a successful screenwriter .
Count former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich among the political pet pooh - poohers in Washington .
Gingrich , in an interview Sunday , minced no words in stating his annoyance at the media frenzy around new first dog Bo. CNN reports :
" I hope that the girls love the dog , " Gingrich said on ABC's " This Week . "
" I hope the family – and all the pressure they 're going to be in – finds it useful .
And I think that this whole thing is fairly stupid . " ... " It 's great that they have a dog .
It 's great that the kids are adjusting , " Gingrich said .
" And where they got it from – who cares ?
It 's a nice gesture on Senator Kennedy 's part to give it to them but who cares ? "
Gingrich added .
For the record , CNN says feelings about the first dog appear to be splitting across party lines , since prominent Democratic strategist Donna Brazile called Bo Obama " cute " and " adorable . "
" What 's not to like about this dog ? " she asked on CNN's " State of the Union . "

Some people think that IE6 is dead already .
But only developers who have the luxury of a specialist audience , or who do n’t have any business interest vested in their work , can think like that .
For the rest of us , who have a real - world audience of ordinary , non-technical users to think about , IE6 is still very much a going concern .
But maybe not for much longer .
Now that IE8 is out we ’ll see a greater number of users finally upgrading ; there ’s no doubt that Microsoft wil be pushing for this , and pushing hard .
Quite apart from that , we ’re seeing a slow but steady progression of users moving away from Internet Explorer altogether , and turning to Firefox and other browsers ; Arstechnica recently reported that Firefox usage is overtaking Internet Explorer in Europe for the first time .
Inevitably , there will come a time when IE6 has a sufficiently minor audience that we can treat it like we did Netscape 4 a few years ago — as legacy technology that it no longer behoves us to support , and its remaining users as willfully stubborn individuals whom we ’re not required to pander to any longer !
( It ’s funny really .
You would n’t go into your local mobile phone store and complain that the handset you bought in 2001 does n’t work on a 3G network and you ca n’t get picture messaging on it .
Yet for some reason , a minority of web users do behave exactly like that . )
Anyway , by my estimation , the day is approximately 12 months away when we ’ll be able to kiss a fond goodbye to IE6 support forever .
And when that day comes , here are some useful things we ’ll be able to do that we could n’t really do on mainstream sites before :
Use child selectors
No more having to define endless descendent rules to cancel out other descendent rules .
With CSS2 child selectors we can specify CSS rules that only apply to direct children , not to descendants in general .
Make full use of 24 - bit PNGs
No more blending images against different coloured backgrounds so that the edges have decent anti-aliasing .
With PNG alpha - channel support we can use images with shadows , glows and other opacity effects , safe in the knowledge that all graphical browser users can see them .
Use attribute selectors
No more having to define type classes for inputs — things like < input class = " text " ... /> — when we can address them with CSS2 attribute selectors like input[ type = " text " ] .
We can even use CSS3 substring - matching attribute selectors ( supported in all modern browsers including IE7 ) , which can be very useful for defining selectors that apply to a range of different attribute values , thereby reducing significantly the amount of code it takes to address groups of elements with similar class names ( for example ) .
Use a wider range of display properties Being able to use things like display : inline - block instead of float : left means no more endless float within float within float , or the slightly - dubious use of overflow : hidden , just to get blocks to clear properly .
( Though I should point out , we had to wait until Firefox 3 for this one too ! )
Use min-width and max - width Although IE6 ‘s implementation of width is very similar to the correct implementation of min-width , it ’s not the same , and it does n’t serve every purpose ; and it does n’t do anything about max - width .
With the end of IE6 can come a new renaissance in block - layout design , with the greater flexibility that designers have been crying out for for years .
Throw away 90 % of CSS hacks ( and 90 % of the reasons for needing them ! )
No more worrying about bizarrely repeating characters , mysteriously invisible blocks , or frustrating double margins ; with the end of IE6 comes the end of needing to be able to diagnose and cure such a large array of rendering bugs .
Add abbreviations that everyone can see Although personally , I only use the < abbr > element and never use < acronym > , still it does occasionally irk me to remember that IE6 users wo n’t see the expansion , and bugs me even more on the odd occasion that I need to script for them ( and ca n ’t ) .
Trust z- index again
No more scratching our heads as we ponder why layer X is on top of layer Y when it should be beneath , wondering what we might have done wrong , only to remember that — d’oh — we have n’t done anything wrong , it ’s a stacking context bug in IE6 .
Save time and money Significantly less time spent hacking means shorter development time and lower development costs .
Enjoy ourselves again !
Writing CSS will become the pleasure that it used to be .
That is , until our expectations rise again , and IE7 becomes our nemesis …
But 3 Things We ’ll Still Have To Wait For
Sadly , there are still plenty of things we wo n’t be able to do with impunity until IE7 is also just a memory !
Use CSS Counters
So we still ca n’t let go of the unfortunately - deprecated start attribute , or do any of the interesting things we want with generated content .
Use the box - sizing property
The CSS3 box - sizing property , implemented in IE8 and other modern browsers , means that we can finally choose for ourselves which box model we want for a particular situation , and end , once and for all , the tedious arguments over which one is “ correct ” .
Any improvements to JavaScript
There are many things I ’d like to see for day to day JavaScript programming — an end to event target forking , a single event - listening mechanism , reliable and consistent retrieval of computed style properties — but all of that will have to wait until IE7 has also gone the way of the fairies , because only in IE8 have any improvements to the scripting engine been made ( although what those improvements actually amount to remains to be seen ! ) .
So mark the day in your calendar , for early in 2010 , when the fuller potential of CSS will finally begin to emerge !

TEHRAN , May 10 ( UPI ) -- A 12 - year - old boy running for Iranian president says his platform would include stopping the killing of Gaza 's children by Israel .
Local media reports said the boy , Koresh Mouzuni of Tehran , arrived at election headquarters with his father and dutifully answered questions about Israel and the Iranian nuclear program , the Israeli Web site Ynetnews.com reported .

Koresh seems to have been influenced by the current president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , when it comes his views on Israel .
When asked about the Jewish state , he reportedly replied , " I will buy Hawaii , ( U.S. President Barack ) Obama 's birthplace , from the United States and lease it to Israelis who will go live there -- so that they do n't kill the children in Gaza . "
The boy is one of 250 Iranian presidential candidates who have taken the time to fill out the proper paperwork , Ynetnews said .
In his written platform , Koresh said , " If my candidacy is approved I will appoint Ahmadinejad as my first deputy " and promised not to appoint his father as a minister in his future government .

There was no way to verify General Abbas ’s account ; reporters and most outsiders have been blocked from the areas .
The Pakistani government and the military , which has largely stood by as the Taliban insurgency has surged forward in recent months , have been under intense American pressure to take action against the militants .

A government official reached at his home in Mingora said many militants had been killed this week when Pakistani helicopter gunships attacked an emerald mine that sits on the approach to Mingora .
Still , the government ’s position was unchanged , the official said ; it was clinging to only a small corner of Mingora .
The mayor ’s office and police headquarters were still in Taliban hands .
The official said electricity and water in the district capital were both gone .
“ Thousands of people are leaving , ” he said , speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear that he would be killed .
A Pakistani who spoke to his family in Mingora on Friday said they had confirmed that the Taliban remained in control of the city .
He said the roads into the capital had been booby - trapped with land mines , and that in some places , like Matta , a Taliban stronghold , militants were blocking civilians from leaving .
Another Pakistani in Swat , also speaking on the condition of anonymity , said Taliban fighters had begun to loot local banks , including three on Thursday .
Some civilians fleeing the area said the Pakistani Army had imposed a round - the - clock curfew across much of the embattled area , preventing thousands of people from leaving .
Those people would flee at the first chance , the refugees said .
When do commercial pressures affect ideals ?
Testing that proposition was an unexpected result of the " Wikipedia Art " project .
Two artists , Scott Kildall and Nathaniel Stern , created a self - referential article on Wikipedia , about the self - same article .
Simultaneously , they had several blogs write about the project .
They stated : " Wikipedia Art is a conceptual artwork composed on Wikipedia , and is thus art that anyone can edit .
As a consequence of such collaborative and consensus - driven edits to the page , Wikipedia Art , itself , changes over time . "
In reading their goals and intentions , I was struck by how some observations covered well - trodden ground among Wikipedia critics , though I would n't want to disparage the validity of making these points to an audience that might find the ideas novel .
One message gave a litany of flaws : everything from ( my paraphrases ) the tension around the Wikipedia slogan – " anyone can edit " ( yet a very small number of gatekeepers will determine if contributions are accepted ) – to the focus on pop culture and neglect of high culture .
However , their points tended to be expressed in an obscure and frankly irritating manner , where the artists could not seem to grasp a basic , if often rudely put , objection – they were nowhere near as clever as they seemed to think they were .
People familiar with some of the darker aspects of Wikipedia would n't find it surprising that naive believers in the PR line of love and community do n't fare well when they run into a reality of a cult filled with suspicion , fanaticism , and group dysfunction .
But it all would have been another long - winded Wikipedia debate , had the matter not turned into a dispute over trademark rights v fair use of trademarks as references .
Funding has always been a problem for Wikipedia .
Its owner , the Wikimedia Foundation , " continues to explore strategic partnerships " .
One such recent arrangement with Orange ( France Telecom ) describes how : " This partnership will extend co-branding opportunities …
This is an additional revenue stream to build on our most important revenue stream – our successful fundraising campaigns . "
This makes its trademarks valuable commercial property .
And ­creates pressure to be aggressive regarding any possible infringement .
The artists had a website , wikipedia­art.org , also using the title " Wikipedia Art " to discuss their efforts .
They received a formal law firm letter from a lawyer , stating in part , " Wikimedia has asked me to investigate whether your actions violate [ many trademark laws listed ] . "
The letter requested they " transfer [ the domain wikipediaart.org ] to Wikimedia and cease using the Wikipedia trademark . "
This led to pro-bono legal defence from the organisation Public Citizen .
" With respect , I am very disappointed to learn that an entity group that I res­pect … nevertheless sent out a demand letter predicated on a view of trademark law that we have been fighting for years , with a fair amount of success … "
And remarks from the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( eff.org ) : " Can a noncommercial critical website use the trademark of the entity it critiques in its domain name ?
It appears the usually open - minded folks at Wikipedia think not . "
Reacting in part to the bad publicity , Wikimedia 's general counsel claimed : " No litigation was threatened or commenced . "
And Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales ) alleged : " There was never a legal threat , no action of any kind , and there is no intention to take action of any kind .
We asked them politely to put up a legal notice distinguishing themselves from Wikipedia , and they did … A group of trolls managed to manufacture for the media a publicity stunt . "
Kildall commented on a mailing list : " It 's weird to see how they 've framed this issue as Nathaniel and myself as ' performance artists ' who have somehow hoodwinked the EFF , but I assume this is a media - spinning tactic . "
While the Wikimedia Foundation has backed off , the moral of the story is : money changes everything .
And , as more " revenue streams " are sought , more clashes of values may occur .

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission announced last night that Dodo , a frequent target of false advertising complaints , had misled customers who signed up to its " free offer plans " between October last year and March this year .
But ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel said today his efforts to clamp down on rogue telcos were being hampered because he did not have the power to fine them .
---------------------------------------------------
Blog : Optus ' dodgy monster call caps
---------------------------------------------------
" In the absence of penalties for misleading and deceptive conduct , what essentially it says to businesses is you can engage in conduct that is essentially dishonest and affects consumers but you do n't face any financial consequences from doing so , " he told smh.com.au .
Dodo had promised customers who signed up to mobile and broadband plans either a " free " Asus Eee PC , fuel card or cash payment , but the regulator found the extras were far from free .
In fact , Dodo was offering comparable plans without the " free " goods for $ 30 a month less .
Dodo has now promised to refund customers who signed up to the free offer plans and lower their monthly fees .
Samuel said he was unable to impose a fine on Dodo over the misleading " free offer plans " and was fortunate to even secure refunds , due to a " quite significant deficiency " in the Trade Practices Act .
Dodo regularly appears towards the top of the ombudsman 's complaints list and last year the Australian Communications and Media Authority fined it $ 147,000 for calling numbers listed on the " Do not call " register without consent .
The authority had already warned Dodo to clean up its act on complaints handling and billing .
In 2007 , Dodo was heavily criticised for offering " free " ADSL2 + broadband plans .
The fine print , however , said the free offer only included 150 MB of usage , which could be used up within a minute , after which heavy excess usage penalties applied .
The refunds were agreed to voluntarily by Dodo and Samuel said they would have been " very difficult " to secure if the ACCC was forced to take action against Dodo in the Federal Court .
" We can stop them by injunctions but what we can't do is obtain financial penalties , so therefore the consequences of engaging in misleading conduct in Part 5 [ of the Trade Practices Act ] ... is pretty light - handed , " he said .
A spokesman for the Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs Minister , Chris Bowen , said changes to the Trade Practices Act , to be introduced to Parliament in June , would " enhance powers for the ACCC " including allowing it to impose financial penalties and seek refunds on behalf of consumers .
Dodo 's managing director , Larry Kestelman , said in a statement this afternoon : " Although we had no intention to mislead any consumers , we will work harder to make sure that our offers are clear and straight forward . "
At a communications conference in March , Samuel said he was " putting the telecommunications industry on notice " .
" The ACCC is drawing a line in the sand - we 're saying to the poor performers - and there are many of them - mend your ways , " he said .
" Misleading advertising , unfair contracts , inadequate disclosure and subscription scams are all in the ACCC 's sights .
Standards must improve or risk increased scrutiny and action . "

ANNAPOLIS ( March 31 , 2009 ) -
When a police officer asked her what she was doing behind a van in the park , Pamela Hughes told him the honest truth .
" I said I was smoking a cannabis cigarette , " she said .
She presented the stunned policeman with a written recommendation from her doctor and a copy of Maryland 's " Compassionate Use Act , " which reduces the penalties for possession of medical marijuana .
" I honestly thought that I was n't breaking the law , " Hughes said .
Rather than take her word for it , the officer called for backup that included a canine unit , she said .
Hughes ended up spending several hours in jail .
She fought the charges and won , but only after a lot of time , stress and money — three things that her fibromyalgia , a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain and fatigue , and a reoccurrence of stage IV cancer were already monopolizing .
Hughes and several other patients told the House Judiciary Committee last week that while Maryland 's Compassionate Use Act was a step forward for its time , the law merely provides them with a false sense of security .
The patients testified on behalf of a bill that would establish a task force to evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of the current law and consider whether medical marijuana should become legal in the state .
They said medical marijuana provides relief for certain ailments in ways no other medication can replicate .
No one testified against the bill , and a vote on the legislation has not been scheduled .
Medical marijuana has been legalized in 13 states , including California , Maine , Rhode Island and Vermont .
U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder said recently that federal law enforcement will no longer target providers that are operating within state law , a major departure from the Bush administration 's stance on the issue .
The Darryl Putnam Compassionate Use Act , passed by the General Assembly in 2003 , was a compromise between those advocating the legalization of medical marijuana and those against such a move .
The act is named after Putnam , a former Green Beret and Howard County Farm Bureau director who advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana .
He died of cancer in 1999 .
The Compassionate Use
Act reduced the penalties for marijuana possession to a maximum $ 100 fine , provided a patient has a recommendation from a medical doctor .
However , patients still have to buy their " medicine " on the street and face the health and legal risks inherent in doing so .
Those with drug offenses on their records could also face eviction from subsidized housing .
John McCarthy , an AIDS activist who has been HIV - positive for 18 years , said that medical marijuana has allowed him to reduce his pill intake from 45 to 13 pills a day .
Most of those pills had been prescribed merely to alleviate the side effects of other pills , which include vomiting , headaches and neuropathy , a condition " where the nerve endings burn . "
McCarthy , who lives in subsidized housing , said a drug conviction under the present law could cause someone to be evicted from public housing no matter how old they were or what their condition was .
Eric Sterling , a Chevy Chase lawyer and president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation , said the law needs to be revised .
" It 's really barbaric to think that we would prosecute sick people , " he said .
" These ( cases ) should never go to court . "
The American College of Physicians , which calls itself the " largest medical - specialty organization and second - largest physician group in the United States , " has endorsed the use of non-smoked marijuana in cases where it has been proven to have therapeutic value .
A 2008 policy paper said the organization " strongly urges protection from criminal or civil penalties for patients who use medical marijuana as permitted under state laws . "
It advocated further research on the issue and said that " the science on medical marijuana should not be obscured or hindered by the debate surrounding the legalization of marijuana for general use . "
Americans for Safe Access , a group that advances legalizing marijuana for therapeutics and research , and brought many of the witnesses together in Annapolis last week , was careful to clarify its intentions .
Caren Woodson , director of government affairs for the group , said the goal was to have safe and legal access to medical marijuana for patients and researchers — " and that 's it . "
" That 's the line , and we do n't cross over it , " she said .
However , some say others are crossing that line every day .
Jerrod Menz , president of A Better Tomorrow Treatment Center Inc. , a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Murrieta , Calif. , said some young people in his state are faking back pain and other hard - to - prove ailments in order to legally obtain marijuana .
He said a client in his early 20s recently admitted telling his doctor he was suffering from foot pain , which helped him obtain a medical marijuana card after a five - minute examination .
Menz said doctors need to use more care in their examinations to better prevent people from abusing the intent of medical marijuana laws .
He said that some problems could be prevented by having the federal government regulate medical marijuana like any other drug , although he did not endorse such a move .
For Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Vallario Jr. , D - Prince George 's , federal law is the line that should n't be crossed — and the reason for the 2003 compromise legislation in the first place .
" How can you pass something that 's against federal law ? " he said .
" That really is the bottom line . "
Delegate Henry Heller , D - Montgomery , the sponsor of the bill , said the task force would also consider establishing research programs at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland medical schools .
He said this would not only allow further research on medical marijuana , but also help provide a safe product .
As the law stands , Heller said glaucoma and cancer patients at Leisure World , a retirement community in Silver Spring where he lives and represents , have to buy their marijuana on the street .
" It 's not the safest way to buy medicine , " he said .

It 's been a rough week for the RIAA as massive layoffs are about to cost many employees their job .
On top of that , the anti-piracy outfit is being sued for abusing the legal system for its war on piracy , civil conspiracy , deceptive trade practices , trespassing and computer fraud .
Covering the progress in the various RIAA cases has never been one of our top priorities here at TorrentFreak .
The legalese and numerous cases seem to drag on forever , or end up in a settlement where the alleged ‘ pirate ’ pays the record labels a few thousand dollars .
Today ’s coverage at both P2Pnet and Ray Beckerman ’s blog , however , caught our eye .
In what seems to be a classic David versus Goliath story , Shahanda Moursy from North Carolina has demanded a trial against three major record labels and the RIAA .
Also among the defendants is Mediasentry , the company that harvests IP - addresses of alleged copyright infringers .
Previously , Mediasentry ’s investigation tactics were deemed illegal in several states because it operated without the appropriate and required paperwork .
This is one of the many offenses being used in the present claim .
Moursy is suing the RIAA and others for several offenses , but what really caught our eye is the description of the RIAA ’s practices .
According to the complaint the RIAA and record labels :
… [ through ] concerted efforts and cartels , control or attempt to control the channels of creation , distribution , and sale of musical works throughout the United States and the world .
They are not artists , songwriters , or musicians .
They did not write or record the songs .
For a number of years , a group of large , multinational , multi-billion dollar record companies , including these [ record labels ] , have been abusing the federal court judicial system for the purpose of waging a public relations and public threat campaign targeting digital file sharing activities .
To us , this indeed seems to be a fairly accurate description , but it ’s only the start .
As we ’ve outlined before , the RIAA tends to target the weak , and aim for an early settlement of a few thousand dollars .
As part of this campaign of their sham litigation program , the [ record labels ] enhance the intimidation factor by actually filing suit in a number of instances with no prior warning .
These suits are designed to attract media attention , and often do , as stories emerge of [ record labels ’ ] suits against the elderly , disabled , technologically clueless , and other vulnerable victims .
Many of these victims have no idea how to operate a computer , let alone how to install and use peer - to - peer networking software to exchange music they would not likely be listening to anyway .
But actual innocence is rarely a consideration to the [ record labels ] .
And on top of that ..
[ The record labels ’ ] litigation campaign , its preceding demands , and illegal investigations , are part of a concerted pattern of sham litigation .
The [ record labels ’ ] true purpose is not to obtain the relief claimed in its sham litigation , but to intimidate , harass , and oppress the defendant targets and other users of computer networks .
To many , this will all sound very familiar and it ’s good to see Mrs.
Moursy ’s legal representatives describing the tactics of these outfits so vividly .
Over the years , tens of thousands have been harassed and threatened because they allegedly downloaded music illegally , exclusively based on shoddy evidence .
Justice is calling .
Rapper Snoop
Dogg surprised fans and reporters alike this weekend by revealing he has joined the Nation of Islam .
Speaking at the religious group 's Saviours '
Day convention in Chicago , the 37 - year - old praised the group 's supreme minister and national representative Louis Farrakhan .
It is reported by the Associated Press that he also made a donation to the group of $ 1,000 .
Snoop Dogg , real name Calvin Broadus , talked about his reasons for joining the religious group in relatively loose terms .
" I 'm an advocate for peace .
I 've been in the peace movement ever since I 've been making music , " he told followers .
" My whole thing is not about really trying to push my thing on you .
It 's just about the way I live , and I live how I 'm supposed to live as far as doing what 's right and representing what 's right .
That 's why I was here today . "
The Nation of Islam was founded in 1930 with the aim of promoting the conditions of black Americans .
The group 's most famous convert is activist Malcolm X .
Snoop Dogg 's career has spanned nearly two decades and has been as controversial as it has been successful .
He has been arrested numerous times , mainly for possession of marijuana , and was charged as an accomplice to the murder of Phillip Woldermarian in 1993 .
The rapper was found not guilty .
He sought to reinvent himself as a family man with the recent reality show Snoop Dogg 's Father Hood , which portrays his domestic side along with his wife and three children .
However , he was prevented from entering the UK in 2007 following a previous violent incident at Heathrow airport .
Discussing his religious beliefs at this weekend 's Nation of Islam event , the Doggystyle rapper referred to himself as the " leader of the hip - hop community " and hinted that his affiliation with the group is not new .
" It 's about seeing yourself and what you can do to better the situation , " Broadus said .
" We 're doing a lot of wrongs among ourselves that need correcting . "

Third complaint against Met in wake of Tomlinson death
The policing of the G20 protests in London has come under further scrutiny with the release of a video that appears to show at least two instances of unprovoked violence by riot officers against demonstrators .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said last night it was investigating a third instance of potential police misconduct during the demonstrations on 1 - 2 April after a complaint from a 23 - year - old man who says he was assaulted at a police cordon near Cornhill in the City .
Two officers from the Metropolitan police territorial support group ( TSG ) , which deals with public disorder situations , have already been suspended over their behaviour during the demonstrations .
The new footage , which is not related to the cases being investigated by the IPCC , has been compiled and edited by activists .
It concerns incidents during the evening of 1 April when riot police broke up the so - called Climate Camp , an action by anti-global warming activists on Bishopsgate in the City of London that had to that point been peaceful .
Firstly , in the excerpt shown above , as officers attempt to push the tightly packed crowd of activists back on the street , one officer can be seen striking the front of his riot shield with apparent force against the head of one man , who is not resisting and has just turned his head away from the police .
The riot officers involved have their faces covered with balaclavas and some appear not to be showing police numbers on their uniforms .
The protester involved has been named as Alex Kinnane , a 24 - year - old IT worker .
Later that evening , in the excerpt below , as police try and push back another crowd at the camp a riot officer appears to punch a demonstrator in the face with a clenched fist .
The Guardian has already received testimony from a series of people involved with the climate demonstration claiming that police used excessive and unjustified force in breaking it up .
Other video footage from the camp shows police using their batons and the edges of their riot shields to strike protesters who appear not to be resisting .
Neither of the latest incidents , or any other at the camp , is thus far the subject of a formal IPCC investigation .
The Guardian has additionally passed to the IPCC a series of further videos showing apparent excessive force or questionable tactics by police at the G20 protests .
One TSG officer faces investigation in connection with potential manslaughter charges after video footage was published by the Guardian showing Ian Tomlinson , a 47 - year - old newspaper vendor , being struck on the legs and pushed to the ground as he tried to get home .
Tomlinson collapsed and died shortly afterwards .
While an initial postmortem blamed heart failure , a second examination concluded that he died from internal bleeding .
Another case involving a TSG officer is being looked into in connection with video footage showing him slapping and using a baton on Nicola Fisher , 35 , from Brighton , East Sussex .

In the sixth paragraph , we originally misspelt Alex Kinnane 's name as ' Cinnane ' .
This has been corrected .
Spanish AG : No torture probe of ' Bush 6 ' RAW STORY
Published : Thursday April 16 , 2009
Print This Email This Spanish prosecutors will recommend against opening an investigation into whether Bush administration officials sanctioned torture against terror suspects , that country 's attorney general said Thursday .
Attorney General Candido Conde - Pumpido told reporters that the case was without merit because the officials were not present when the alleged torture took place and that a trial would turn Spain 's National Court into " a plaything " for political ends .
The intention had been to target six officials whose advice and legal opinions cleared the way for the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay : former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith , former vice presidential chief of staff David Addington , Justice Department officials John Yoo and Jay S. Bybee , and Pentagon lawyer William Haynes .
" If one is dealing with a crime of mistreatment of prisoners of war , the complaint should go against those who physically carried it out , " Conde - Pumpido stated .
" If there is a reason to file a complaint against these people , it should be done before local courts with jurisdiction , in other words in the United States . "
Attorney Scott Horton , who reported on Monday that Spanish prosecutors had decided to press forward with the investigation , now explains that " the Spanish prosecutors report to the attorney general and he is entitled to review and modify their decisions much in the way that the U.S. attorney general supervises and directs the work of career federal prosecutors . "
Horton goes on to say , " Interventions of this sort , however , are fairly unusual .
' The circumstances of the attorney generals announcement suggest that political intervention at a very high level has occurred , ' remarked one lawyer involved with the complaint .
The attorney generals intervention may well reflect the concern of the government of Prime Minister Jose Zapatero over relations with the new Obama administration . "
Gonzalo Boyé , one of the four human rights lawyers who brought the case in Spain , said the decision by Conde - Pumpido was not only politically motivated but sets a terrible course for Spanish justice .
When provisional criminal proceedings began in late March , Boyé believed Spain 's chief prosecutor would have little choice but to approve the prosecution .
" The only route of escape the prosecutor might have is to ask whether there is ongoing process in the US against these people , " he told the Observer .
" This case will go ahead .
It will be against the law not to go ahead . "
Now Boyé is complaining bitterly about the recommendation to drop the case .
" The attorney - general speaks of the court being turned into a plaything , " he told the Associated Press .
" Well , I do n't think the attorney - general 's office should be turned into a plaything for politicians .
It is a terrible precedent if those intellectually responsible for crimes can no longer be held accountable . "
Boyé also told CNN that the case could still go forward if Judge Baltasar Garzon decides to pursue it , and he noted that prosecutors had opposed Garzon 's investigations of ex-Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
" It 's up to the resolution of a court as it has always been , " Boye stated .
" Garzon has to decide .
This is a jurisdiction decision for a judge , not for the prosecution . "
However , a senior court official told AP that prosecutors will recommend that Garzon be replaced by a different judge who is already investigating whether secret CIA flights to Guantanamo entered Spanish airspace .
This would be another serious blow to the hopes of human rights lawyers .
" It 's a shame the prosecutor is taking this position , but not a surprise , " Boyé observed .
" They always obey political orders .
They do n't want to be in a bad position in front of the Obama administration . "

The run after the new gold , the unlimited and cheap energy , is being pursued all over the world , not only in the US .
There are states , like Israel , where solar power has been harnessed for decades in the form of hot water for its inhabitants .
All those solar water heaters have been build by economical needs .
In fact , only economical needs can stimulate the world to such an extent that it develops new technologies .
Yet another Israel - based company , named ZenithSolar , led by Roy Segev , has a plan of building a special kind of solar panels that could have 75 % efficiency by harnessing both the light ’s visible spectrum and the heat it transports .
It ’s a hybrid , a compromise between photovoltaic panels and the classic solar water heating systems .
In fact , Segev ’s solar panels are cheap , too .
The energy they provide will come at a price that rivals fossil fuels : about 8.6 cents per kilowatt .
The solar system is made of 1200 small mirrors that focus on a surface of 10 square centimeters , where a special high - temperature PV panel is installed .
A special one is needed , since the heat accumulated could melt metals .
They could install these small solar furnaces in your backyard , but the pilot - built big ’uns produce 70 kW of electricity and the equivalent of 140 kW of water heating , also saving precious energy otherwise derived from charcoal .
Is n’t it sometimes improvizations are the next best thing to do ?
Let ’s not avoid them anymore .

Spanning 39,598 square miles , Virginia has a population of almost 7.5 million residents .
Roughly half of these residents are concentrated in the northern Virginia , central Virginia , and Hampton Roads regions .
All three of these regions feature ethnically diverse populations with cultural ties to the Middle East , the horn of Africa , Southeast Asia , and other areas heavily impacted by terrorist activities .
Virginia ’s network of colleges and universities also represent a potential avenue of entry for terrorist operatives and a possible forum for recruitment of sympathizers .
In addition to reviewing information directly reported to the VFC , surveys were sent to all Virginia local law enforcement agencies to determine the extent of terrorism activities throughout the state .
Information of interest included not only event - specific data , but also suspicious traffic stops or activities consistent with pre-operational attack planning .
Assessments of the overall threat posed by specific terror and extremist groups or movements were completed utilizing the Project SLEIPNIR : Revised Long Matrix for Criminal Extremism utilized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The purpose of the 2009 Terrorism Threat Assessment is to convey potential terrorism threats affecting the Commonwealth of Virginia .
Terrorism , for the purpose of this report , is defined as politically motivated violence or threat of violence designed to coerce action or to prevent others from taking intended actions .
While there is no intelligence that indicates terrorists are currently planning attacks in Virginia , the presence of extremists , evidence of trends linked to terrorism , and the abundance of potential targets , suggests that the potential for Virginia to be targeted remains significant .
As with previous years , the threat from terrorist and extremist groups can be categorized as international or domestic threats .
Each of these groups holds particular values and political goals and thus represents a different type of threat to Virginia and the U.S.
The international terrorism threat to Virginia and the nation as a whole stems from several radical Islamic militant groups .
The domestic terrorist threat is comprised of a wide variety of groups , to include special interest groups , anarchists , race - based groups , including black separatists and white supremacists , militias and sovereign citizens , and homegrown extremists .
In Virginia , identified activities have been limited primarily to non-violent acts and crimes committed to raise funds to finance group activities .
Some activities also relate to criminal endeavors generally used by extremists to further operational planning .
The Virginia Fusion Center monitors international , national , and regional trends relating to terrorism and criminal extremism for indicators of emerging activity in the Commonwealth .
Terrorism trends of greatest concern in 2009 include terrorism tradecraft , recruitment , and radicalization , terrorist use of technology , and terrorism financing .
As terrorists adapt and evolve to offset existing counterterrorism measures , they have successfully exploited available technology and modified their tactics to ensure successful operations .
While several of the trends noted are applicable to all terrorist and extremist groups , increasing linkages are noted to specific critical infrastructure and key resources .
As such , this product highlights , where possible , connections noted between groups , their behaviors , and potentially targeted infrastructure .
Based on the information gathered , the Commonwealth of Virginia could be potentially targeted for terrorist attack due to its location and proximity to Washington , D.C. , its concentration of critical infrastructure , and the amount of extremist activity documented in Virginia .
In order to detect and deter terrorist attacks , it is essential that information regarding suspected terrorists and suspicious activity in Virginia be closely monitored and reported in a timely manner .
Additionally , it remains important to determine the extent of existing trends and to collect , analyze , and disseminate this information to law enforcement partners in Virginia .
OVERVIEW
The 2009 Terrorism Threat Assessment , in keeping with the Virginia Fusion Center ( VFC ) mission of integrating threat information from public and private sector agencies to prevent terrorist attacks , is designed to afford law enforcement , homeland security , and policy making officials terrorism threat intelligence of relevance to Virginia .
Included in this assessment is an overview of identified groups , individuals , or activities ; known or suspected trends ; and critical infrastructure or key resources with significant U.S. or Virginia reporting within the past five years .
While there is no intelligence that indicates terrorists are planning attacks in Virginia , the abundance of potential targets provides terrorists with many possibilities and opportunities throughout the Commonwealth .
Information contained in this Threat Assessment is current as of February 2009 and will be
reviewed and updated on an annual basis .
In addressing the terrorism threat to Virginia , it is important to define terrorism and the scope of activities included .
Terrorism can be defined as politically motivated violence or threat of violence designed to coerce others into actions they would not otherwise undertake or to refrain from actions they desired to take .
Terrorism is generally directed against civilian targets and is intended to produce effects beyond immediate physical damage , to produce long - term psychological repercussions , especially fear , on a particular target audience .
For the purposes of this Threat Assessment , terrorism is divided into two categories : international and domestic terrorism .
International terrorism involves threats emanating primarily from the international jihad movement , foreign terrorist organizations , and state sponsors of terrorism .
Domestic terrorism includes threats from special interest groups , white supremacists , black separatists , and anti-government groups .
Terrorism trends included in this assessment are activities , such as recruitment , financing , training , and planning , conducted in furtherance of terrorism .
[ efoods ]
Terrorism remains a threat to Virginia , not only because of its proximity to the nation ’s capitol , but also due to the volume of significant infrastructure .
Such infrastructure includes military installations such as the Pentagon ; two nuclear power plants ; and a major East Coast seaport .
Virginia is also home to a wide range of transportation sector targets of interest , including interstate highways with high - traffic bridges and tunnels ; railways and subways ; and aviation and port facilities .
While other infrastructure sectors , such as water , energy , and information technology could be targeted , it is also possible that terrorist attention could be directed toward law enforcement at the local , state , and federal levels .
Spanning 39,598 square miles , Virginia has a population of almost 7.5 million residents .
Roughly half of these residents are concentrated in the northern Virginia , central Virginia , and Hampton Roads regions .
All three of these regions feature ethnically diverse populations with cultural ties to the Middle East , the horn of Africa , Southeast Asia , and other areas heavily impacted by terrorist activities .
While the vast majority of these individuals are law - abiding , this ethnic diversity also affords terrorist operatives the opportunity to assimilate easily into society , without arousing suspicion .
Virginia ’s network of colleges and universities also represent a potential avenue of entry for terrorist operatives and a possible forum for recruitment of sympathizers .
Additionally , Virginia ’s correctional system remains an attractive venue for recruitment and radicalization relating to terror organizations and hate groups .
The VFC has compiled information from local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies , as well as open sources to create this Threat Assessment .
In addition to reviewing information directly reported to the VFC , surveys were sent to all Virginia local law enforcement agencies to determine the extent of terrorism activities throughout the state .
Information of interest included not only event - specific data , but also suspicious traffic stops or activities consistent with pre-operational attack planning .
Assessments of the overall threat posed by specific terror and extremist groups or movements were completed utilizing the Project Sleipnir : Revised Long Matrix for Criminal Extremism utilized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Although the primary objective of this report is to share valuable terrorism intelligence with public safety agencies in Virginia , a secondary goal is to highlight the types of data needed from local , state , and federal partners of the VFC .
While every effort was made to ensure accurate , thorough reporting of the terrorist threat , it is expected that not every incident of possible terrorist activity will be reported or forwarded to the VFC .

One aspect of coming back to Perl for ‘ recreational ’ programming is that if , like me , you ’ve declared war on @_ and boilerplate code , then testing can be somewhat trying .
The Perl testing framework that best fits my head is Test : : Class , which is an excellent Perlish implementation of xUnit style testing .
If you ’re unfamiliar with the , library , Ovid is writing what ’s shaping up to be an excellent series of introductory articles about it at http://www.modernperlbooks.com/.
The problem I ’m having with Test : : Class at the moment is that I can’t write :
use MooseX :: Declare class Test :: Person extends Test :: Class { use Test :: Most ; method class\_under\_test {' Person'} method startup : Test ( startup =>
1 ) { use\_ok $ test->class\_under\_test } ... }
use ... ; testclass Test :: Person exercises Person { startup class under test should be usable ( 1 test ) { use\_ok $ test->class\_under\_test } }
testclass Test :: Person exercises Person { ... } testclass Test :: Person :: Employee extends Test :: Person exercises Person { ... }
testclass AnotherTest helpers - More , - Exception , Carp { \# use Test :: More ; \# use Test : : Exception ; \# use Carp ; ... }
testclass AnotherTest +uses Carp { \# use Test :: Most ; \# use Carp ; ... }
testclass exercises Person { ... }
describe SomeClass , " in some context " before each \# set things up end it " should do something or another " ... end end
describe SomeClass , " in some context " do before : each do \# set things up end it " should do something or another " do ... end end
do
:
devel/declare.rb
use Test :: Class :: Sugar testclass exercises Foo +uses - Warn { ... }
{ package Test :: Foo ; use base qw / Test :: Class / ; use Test :: Most ; use Test : : Warn ... }
test with multiple assertions << 3 {...}
Test :: Class is doing too much in its initialization phase , and relies too heavily on code attributes , for it to play well with [ MooseX : : Declare ] ( http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Declare).
Drat .
On reflection though , this might be a good thing , because maybe MooseX : : Declare is n't really what 's needed .
What I 'd like to write is something like :
And have the library '...' expand the `testclass` declaration into something that looks like the first code snippet .
After all , if MooseX : : Declare can work without source filters , it should be possible to come up with something nicely declarative for specifying test classes .
Obviously , there 's nothing on CPAN that does this yet though .
So I went fossicking through MooseX : : Declare to see how it works [ 1 ] and discovered thing of Lovecraftian beauty that is ... ### [ Devel : : Declare ] ( http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Declare)
Devel :: Declare is possibly the most hostilely documented library I 've ever come across .
Its documentation only begins to make sense when you already understand enough about how it works that you do n't really need the docs .
What it does is to let you declare your own Perl keywords .
You could , for instance use it to introduce `given / when` into versions of Perl that do n't have it yet .
You declare your keywords and associate them with parsers .
When , during its compilation phase , perl hits one of your keywords in the right context , it hands off to your parser which can then do what the hell it likes in the way of code transformation , before handing control back to Perl , which then parses the transformed code as if that was what was there all along .
So , to want to transform that `testclass` syntax I just pulled out of my ass into a real Test : : Class package , I just need to write an appropriate parser and code generator , perform the appropriate Devel : : Declare incantations , and I 'm laughing .
### Making progress
So far , I 've got to the point where I have a working `testclass` keyword , but nothing yet for the ' inner ' bits ( `setup` , `test` , `teardown` , etc ) .
I can write : and , as I write this , I 'm realising that the syntax I 'd cooked up for using extra test helper modules : would probably read better as : and also that I want this : to build me a Test : : Person class .
What 's still blowing my mind about Devel : : Declare 's possibilities is that I 'm no longer constrained to writing a [ Domain Specific Pidgin ] ( http://www.bofh.org.uk/2007/08/08/domain-specific-pidgin) which works by building a tower of proxy objects and weird evaluation contexts to produce something that 's legal code in the host language , but which has the feel of another language .
With Devel : : Declare , I control the horizontal * and* the vertical until I choose to hand control back to Perl .
Right now that means my error reporting is disgracefully bad , but it also means that I can roll a syntax that makes sense without worrying about how I 'm going to get perl to parse it .
One of the things I find frustrating about writing RSpec specifications is that `describe` and `it` both * want * to be first class keywords - it feels like you should be able to write :
But , because RSpec works by taking advantage of Ruby 's block magic , you have to write : I definitely prefer the version without the extraneouss and the gratuitiousbefore `each` in the `before` declaration .
Does anyone feel like writing ?
###
Show us the code !
If you want to see the current state of my Test : : Class : : Sugar art , the place to look is http://www.github.com/pdcawley/test-class-sugar.
At the time of writing it relies on http://www.github.com/rafl/devel-declare and does n't have anything so useful as documentation , a ` Makefile .
PL` or even any tests beyond the collection of code samples that is `t / initial .t` .
Expect all those when and if I push it to CPAN .
### Caveats
Yes , I * know * that this sort of metasyntactic abstraction is trivial in a Lisp .
I just happen to like syntax , okay ?
### Update 20090312
Now generatesSo that 's one hurdle jumped .
And I now know how to write the various method helpers and , when I get the appropriately shaped tuits , I shall actually write the damned things .
Then all I have to do is document it .
And write up a proposal about it for YAPC :: Europe .
### Update 20090314
I now know what a plan looks like :
And , more importantly , I 've implemented , and * documented * everything and am almost good to cut a 0.001 distribution .
I need a few ducks up on CPAN , but once that 's done , we 're good and I can get on with parameterizing some of the assumptions that are hard coded at the moment . [ 1 ]

A Chat with director Craig Singer ( “ Dark Ride , ” “ Perkins ’ 14 ” )
You ca n’t look at the New Releases rack of your local video store these days without happening upon four or five dozen flicks ( at least ) that have bypassed theatrical release and gone straight to video .
This is a particular annoyance for horror aficionados , who ’ve seen their genre of choice end up as a sad collection of remakes , quick - turnaround franchises , or sometimes both .
Thank goodness , then , for Lionsgate and their After Dark Horrorfest series , which provides brief theatrical releases and high - profile DVD releases for both up - and - coming and established filmmakers .
Director Craig Singer found sufficient success with his first After Dark venture , “ Dark Ride , ” to find his way back into the fold for the latest round of Horrorfest films .
But Singer ’s “ Perkins ’ 13 ” is a bit more adventurous than the usual motion picture , as he explained to Premium Hollywood in a discussion which also tackled some of his other works , including “ Animal Room , ” with Neil Patrick Harris , and “ A Good Night To Die , ” with Michael Rapaport .
Stay tuned for …
Premium Hollywood :
Hey , Craig , how ’s it going ?
Craig Singer : Hey , Will , how are you ?
PH : I ’m good .
You know , I actually realized the other day that you and I have traded comments in the past .
When I reviewed your last film , “ Dark Ride , ” on Premium Hollywood , you left a comment to thank me for the kind words .
CS : Oh , that ’s so funny !
Well , thank you very much !
( Laughs )
PH : No problem .
Well , I checked out “ Perkins ’ 14 ” earlier today …
CS : Very cool .
PH : … and I understand that a lot of specifics about the film were chosen and decided upon by online fans .
CS : It was !
It was kind of a unique process , something that was – at least at one time – very experimental , and it became more inevitable .
PH : So how did it come about ?
Whose idea was it to go that direction ?
CS : My partner , Chris Williams , and I had been working for many , many years on collaborative platforms , and we had a company called FanLib , and we were developing different interactive platforms to let fans kind of involve themselves in the creative process in a deeper way .
So we were working on that with two of the major studios about doing a film …a horror film … that was going to involve the fans .
And , at the same time , I ’d completed “ Dark Ride ” for Lionsgate and After Dark , and Courtney Solomon had asked me to do another feature for them .
So we basically put them in touch with a company called Massify , in New York , who we were partners with us to kind of create the first fan - crafted horror film , and the timing seemed to be right .
And , again , at one time , this was all very experimental , where the internet was just moving in that direction in terms of growing and galvanizing audiences by letting them feel more a part of the process .
So we came up with the concept , and originally we were going to let the fans write the whole screenplay , one scene at a time , but we decided to do it this way , with Massify and After Dark and Lionsgate , and let the fans come up with the basic premise and idea for the film .
And what happened was hundreds of submissions came in , with every conceivable sub - genre of the horror category : ghost films , vampire films , slasher films , zombie films .
And they were whittled down to finalists , and ultimately “ Perkins ” was chosen .
And then they decided to open four of the roles up in the feature to the fans as well , and we had an online audition process and open casting calls at some of the horror conventions and trade shows around the country .
And that was whittled down , too , to about 20 finalists , who were flown to Los Angeles and did screen tests .
And then the four winners who were cast in the film were flown out to Romania .
Then the marketing department came up with the fan poster contest .
And we had , like , 500 submissions .
We were really fortunate .
Talk about the creative juices that are out there , but the poster that won is just , in my opinion , one of the best posters to come down the pike in a long time .
It ’s a true retro-Grindhouse poster .
PH : Oh , absolutely .
It ’s awesome .
CS : It was the one poster … like , I did n’t have a hand in choosing the winner , I had nothing to do with it , but it was the one poster where I felt so strongly about it that I went behind the scenes and sent the guy kudos .
Y’know , just telling him that I was really proud of his work and that I wanted to congratulate him whether he won or he lost .
But he happened to win , and I was really fortunate that we were able to end up with that poster .
PH : Now , on the Wikipedia page , the poster they show is a bit different from the one on the DVD .
CS : Yeah , it ’s funny : the MPAA disallowed the winning poster for …I think they said it was for three reasons .
The blood on the girl ’s face , the bars , and just generally the woman - in - peril theme .
So the same artist had to go ahead and kind of clean it up a little .
But we had some mini - posters made up , and … ( Laughs ) … obviously , they liked the original better .
PH : Oh , yeah , like you said , it ’s got a very retro ‘ 70s feel to it .
The original “ Perkins ’ 14 ” poster .
CS : Is n’t it cool ?
PH : Definitely .
And speaking of retro , when I did my write - up of “ Dark Ride ” a couple of years ago , I noted how , in this post - “ Saw ” world , you actually tried to get away with capturing the feel of the ‘ 70s and ‘ 80s horror films .
Is that your favorite era of horror films ?
CS : Well , you know , I was really a student of that period of filmmaking and filmmakers , specifically .
I think that it was just a lot more original , a lot more visionary in some respects , and a lot of the low - budget horror films that came out in the ‘ 70s just had a really unique feeling and quality .
I think there ’s kind of a gloss and a shine to today ’s films , specifically the remakes , which feel more formulaic and less enjoyable .
That was something I wanted to be mindful of .
Taking a contrarian approach and being a little bit experimental with the film in respect to the composition and even the structure , the characters , and the story .
I think it makes it a more enjoyable experience for the audience .
PH : In the case of “ Dark Ride , ” it also felt like it was specifically geared to the people who enjoyed the films of that era .
I mean , it ’s not like you really find that many dilapidated and abandoned amusement parks these days .
CS : ( Laughs )
That ’s true .
It ’s funny , because I get so much love for that film from the fans .
At the trade shows and conventions , they come up to me .
It really kind of struck a chord with a lot of people , and it makes me really happy , because there was a lot of love that went into that film .
PH : I made a comparison to Tobe Hooper ’s “ Fun House ” in the review .
CS : I get that a lot , but strangely enough , it really was n’t an influence .
To be perfectly honest , it came more from my own personal experience of actually going on these types of rides when I was a kid , where I ’d always find myself thinking , “ What would happen if there was some crazy person on here with me ? ”
Because your imagination just kicks into high gear , and once you ’re in the dark , all bets are off .
PH : Jumping back to “ Perkins , ” it almost feels like two movies in one : a psychological thriller and a zombie flick .
I do n’t know if that ’s the result of the fans voting on the specifics , or …
CS : Well , it really was designed that way .
Actually , the idea was that so many films nowadays do n’t really give you a chance to get to know the characters or to have any empathy .
It ’s more like they ’re just setting up imaginary bowling pins and try to think of imaginative ways to knock ‘em down and slaughter the characters .
But I always felt like , once you get inside Dwayne Hopper ’s head … and he ’s beautifully played by Patrick O’Kane , who we cast out of London .
He ’s a very well - respected Shakespearean stage actor .
I felt like he had the kind of empathy and tortured quality , that kind of inner struggle of a father who ’s been through this terrible event , and once you really had that feeling for him , you have a lot more liberty and license to kind of let the fur fly in the third act , so to speak .
You ’re developing the characters and making it kind of a psychological thriller during the first two - thirds , lulling the audience into that false sense of security , and then you hopefully emotionally pull the rug out from under them by letting the vino pour , so to speak .
PH : Do you try to pay tribute to past films when you ’re making your movies , insofar as including homages to your favorites ?
CS : Well , I do n’t think you can help it .
As filmmakers , we all kind of borrow and steal .
I do n’t think it ’s an intentional tribute , but you ’re influenced by things that you ’ve seen , and a lot of times it ’s about where you wish films had taken you .
So you ’re using your imagination to say , “ Would n’t it be great if … ”
Or , you know , “ I ’ve never really kind of seen this executed quite in this way before . ”
So you try to keep it fresh , and if you ’re gonna steal , steal from the best … ( Laughs ) … so you look at the greatest films that have influenced you , and hopefully you can either put a fresh spin on it , or you offer a variation on a theme that was effective as you viewed a film and then hopefully you can re-create the same kind of emotion .
But , ultimately , you want to try and keep it fresh , and you want to try to have your own distinctive DNA in the type of work you present to an audience .
People now are savvy and sophisticated , and they ’re very harsh critics !
( Laughs )
They ’re very vocal , and they ’re not shy with their feelings or their opinions at all .
So , hopefully , the entertainment value trumps everything else .
PH : By being involved with the whole Horrorfest concept , are you finding that you ’re getting a greater amount of acknowledgement and appreciation of your work ?
CS : It ’s a blessing , because at this level , to get your film theatrically released is almost unprecedented .
It ’s almost unheard of in today ’s economics .
It ’s very challenging for a filmmaker to get exhibition and distribution on any level , let alone theatrical and the type of DVD push that these folks do .
They market the hell out of the films , and it ’s a blessing .
I feel very fortunate to have been asked to direct two of them , and they actually want me to do a third .
We ’ll see if that happens .
But , clearly , if you ’re not doing tentpole $ 100 million Hollywood fare … I mean , it ’s a rare thing to be able to make kind of more experimental films in nature , to not be micromanaged , and to get a significant amount of creative control and have them be very respectful of my work in that way .
You do n’t see too much of that .
Larger Hollywood films are pretty much by the numbers , and there ’s a formula that they follow because they need to protect these franchises and they need to kind of keep the marketing engines turning and keep the lights on .
And that really was n’t the case with “ Perkins ’ 14 . ”
We had final cut , and I ’m really blessed in that respect .
PH : So how long have you been a Misfits fan ?
CS : That ’s a good question .
The Misfits were in my first feature film , “ Animal Room , ” and I did n’t know who they were .
( Laughs )
It ’s funny , because when I met with them at a diner out in West Jersey , they were not in makeup .
They were just normal guys .
And then when they showed up on the day of filming , they were in their Halloween outfits , and I thought somebody was playing a practical joke on me !
So after that small cameo , I ran into Michale Graves at one of the horror conventions , and he was gushing with how much he enjoyed that experience and how he wanted to become an actor , and if there was anything I might have for him .
So that kind of stuck with me for about a year and a half , and when Eric ’s role came up in “ Perkins ’ 14 , ” I said , “ Would you mind auditioning ? ”
And he said , “ Absolutely not .
Anything you need . ”
And he was right for the role , so we flew him out to Romania .
( Laughs )
PH : Speaking of “ Animal Room , ” you had Neil Patrick Harris starring in that , who was , I guess you ’d say , between fame .
CS : Well said .
( Laughs )
Yes , absolutely , he was the lead .
PH : How was it working with him on a project like that ?
CS : Neil was great .
We went out to lunch after he read the script , and he really liked the material .
I think he was kinda trying to distance himself from “ Doogie , ” and I think that role helped him achieve that .
So we developed a friendship , and then the rest of the cast really fell into place .
Matthew Lillard had n’t really done anything at that point , and as you know , it was Amanda Peet ’s first film , and Catherine Hicks was in it as well .
I was really blessed with a great cast for my first film .
I did n’t really know much about filmmaking at the time , so it was kind of a trial by fire , but it was great .
PH : And then it was about six years before you did your next film , “ Dead Dogs Lie . ”
CS : Um … I think I did “ Pieces of Ronnie ” first , a short , then “ Dead Dogs Lie , ” and then “ A Good Night to Die . ”
Actually , Mickey Rourke was attached to play the lead in “ A Good Night to Die ” for many years .
Mickey and I became friends , we wrote a script together called “ Penance . ”
Actually , Mickey wrote it , and I kind of re-wrote it with him and Robert ( Dean ) Klein , my writing partner .
And then Mickey was replaced by Michael Rapaport literally at the last minute .
PH : Both “ A Good Night to Die ” and “ Dead Dogs Lie ” were hitman - themed films .
Were you just kind of in the hitman - mindset at the time ?
CS : Actually , they were written by Robert Klein , and they were scripts that he was just really passionate about getting made .
And they were fun scripts , so I just decided to give them a whirl .
Looking back , people always ask why I did n’t make a horror film earlier , and I do n’t really have any easy answer for that .
The timing was just right .
After we premiered “ A Good Night to Die ” at the Cannes Film Festival , a Lionsgate executive came up to us and asked what we wanted to do next , and I said , “ A horror film . ”
And Lionsgate said , “ Okay , we ’re your partners . ”
So that ’s how it came about .
I had always been a huge fan and have nothing but admiration and respect for the horror genre , so it ’s no surprise that I ’ve done a few horror films in a row now .
PH : So do you plan to continue working in the genre , or are you going to move back out to do other things ?
CS : Well , we ’re going to do another fan - participatory horror , which will probably give fans a level of involvement that exceeds “ Perkins ” and will really let the fans have a robust role in the creation of the film .
There ’s a project I ’ve been working on for a number of years now , and my partner Chris Williams and I will probably do that next .
And , actually , there ’s a comedy , a diamond heist , a love story , a drama … I ’m pretty eclectic when it comes to what I like aesthetically , but I ’d say there are still a few more horror films in my future .
PH : And just to stick on “ A Good Night to Die ” for a moment longer , you had a lot of great people in that film as well : Seymour Cassell , Debbie Harry , Ralph Macchio …
CS : Sure .
Lainie Kazan , Robin Givens …
PH : Yeah .
It ’s loaded with a lot of familiar faces , to be sure .
CS : That was fun , because a lot of the actors , like Frank Whaley , would just come in for a day or so , so I did n’t have much of a chance to really develop much of a relationship with them .
But there certainly was no shortage of characters in the film .
With “ Dark Ride , ” there was a lot of debate with respect to Jamie - Lynn Sigler ’s involvement , because a lot of times a “ name ” actor can bring an audience or a film out of a horror film , because you do n’t have that voyeuristic docu- drama feel .
And sometimes it does n’t .
It ’s a subjective kind of question , and I think the proof is in the pudding .
The right actor can enhance a character regardless of their fame , but sometimes it does kind of take you out of the film .
PH : I thought she did a good job , though I think part of that was because I ’d only really seen her in “ The Sopranos , ” so it was nice to see her doing something else .
CS : It ’s like the case with “ Doogie Howser . ”
I had n’t really watched “ The Sopranos , ” and I never really watched “ Doogie Howser , ” either … ( Laughs ) … so I think that was a blessing for me when working with both Jamie - Lynn and Neil Patrick Harris .
PH : Honestly , if anything , I think I was more distracted by Patrick Renna , because seeing him just kept making me think of “ The Sandlot . ”
CS : I know , right ?
That ’s so funny .
I get a lot of really interesting fan mail from people who love Patrick because he ’s such a character .
He ’s a really nice guy , and I thought he did a great job .
PH : Oh , yeah , he ’s very memorable , spouting trivia as he does .
Oh , I wanted to ask you about the gore in your films .
When it comes to that , do you have somewhere in the back of your mind a level of how far you ’ll go ?
I tend to think not …
CS : Well , you know , again , the audiences are very sophisticated and they ’ve kind of seen it , done it , and been there , so you really have to be imaginative and come up with things that are …
I do n’t want to say over the top , but steeped within the reality of your film and the flavor of your film .
But , also , you want to kind of push the envelope , so you can hopefully exceed expectations for the audience .
“ Perkins ’ 14 ” has a wonderful balance of gore .
I think tonally the film is exactly what I wanted to achieve .
It does n’t have the laughs or the humor that “ Dark Ride ” did .
It ’s more dire and serious in nature , and that ’s what I was after .
But , you know , we were so excited when “ Dark Ride ” got the Clip of the Week on “ The Soup ” for the head scene …
PH : Yes !
CS : Yeah , so most people who ’ve seen the film know what I mean will understand what I ’m talking about .
It was really outrageous , and it was something I ’d never seen in any film before and I do n’t think since .
And it ’s hard to think gags like that up , because everything ’s been done to death !
( Laughs )
There are a couple of moments in “ Dark Ride ” that were really imaginative .
But with “ Perkins , ” I wanted it to be more somber and more psychological and more of a relationship film , but it did also deliver the gore and the scares when called for .
I think we achieved that .
PH : Is it hard to walk the tightrope between “ dark ” and “ disturbing ” ?
CS : Good question !
Um …you know , there are certain films that I call “ an emotional root canal , ” that are just kind of numb .
They make you numb after you watch them , and it ’s kind of an unsettling feeling .
I do n’t really go for that personally .
Some people do , and that ’s fine for them , but for me , if something just becomes an endurance test of keeping your dinner down , that ’s not an enjoyable experience .
It can be extreme and over the top , but sometimes there ’s just a shock value that people are after .
It ’s one way to get a reaction , but for me , it ’s always more powerful when you ’re dealing with human behavior and the transformation of behavior from normal to abnormal , and you create drama within that sense .
That ’s really what I was after with “ Perkins . ”
PH : And , lastly , what are your favorite horror films ?
Either gore or just straightforward horror , since they ’re really two separate genres .
CS : I really like Romero ’s work , obviously .
And Danny Boyle … I loved “ 28 Days Later . ”
I think it ’s one of the best films I ’ve seen , period , in a lot time .
I like some of the earlier Argento stuff , like “ Bird with the Crystal Plumage ” and “ Deep Red , ” or “ The Hatchet Murders . ”
I thought that was really good .
And , obviously , “ Evil Dead , ” “ Dawn of the Dead , ” I ’m fans of those films .
Again , the psychological films are good .
“ Suspiria ” I thought was an interesting film , and some of Polanski ’s earlier stuff as well .
But generally speaking , I ’m not married completely to the horror films or the horror filmmakers .
I like Kazan ’s work very , very much .
He ’s probably my favorite filmmaker .
Elia Kazan , Stanley Kubrick , and guys like that .
Then sprinkle in a couple of horror films , and you ’ve got yourself a well - balanced meal !
In a nutshell , I am a libertarian because conservatives are a bunch of gun-totting , Hummer - driving , hard - drinking , Bible - thumping , black - and - white - thinking , fist - pounding , shoe - stomping , morally - hypocritical blowhards , and liberals are a bunch of tree - hugging , whale - saving , hybrid - driving , sandle - wearing , bottled - water - drinking , ACLU - supporting , flip - flopping , wishy - washy , Namby Pamby bedwetters .
There ’s a better way .
Libertarianism .
Okay , now that I have your attention , let me address the constructive comments posted in response to last week ’s blog post on how I became a libertarian , and this week explain why .
But first , what is a libertarian ?
I hate labels , and as you can see from the comments people make certain assumptions based on the label instead of the person and particular beliefs .
Nevertheless , labels are cognitive shortcuts , so the shortest thumbnail is this : a libertarian is socially liberal and fiscally conservative .
It ’s an alternative to the standard left - right linear spectrum , and it allows one to nuance positions on different issues .
For example , I am pro-choice , pro gay marriage , and pro separation of church and state , which makes me a card - carrying liberal , right ?
Well , I am also in favor of lower taxes , cutting welfare programs , privatizing social security , and replacing the income tax with either a flat tax or abolishing it altogether and replacing it with a national income tax , which makes me a card - carrying conservative , right ?
So what am I ?
( Parenthetically , I find it troubling that most atheists , agnostics , skeptics , free thinkers , humanists and secular humanists are liberal .
The reason I find this troubling is not because I am not a liberal ( although as noted above , I agree with liberals on many issues ) , but because most people think that the skeptical / humanist movement is ( or should be ) politically neutral .
If it were , there would be roughly a 50/50 split of liberals and conservatives .
But it is n’t , and I think that ’s a problem .
Humanists , for example , are supposed to be in favor of all humans , but when virtually our entire constituency votes Democratic , that means we are missing half the human population !
There ’s something wrong with this picture .
I ’m not saying that we should all be libertarians ; only that a more politically diversified membership would indicate that our movement is more politically balanced .
When I point out this discrepancy to my liberal friends and colleagues , they predictably explain the left - leaning bias as due to the fact that liberals are right !
Of course …
My conservative friends say the same thing when I note the conservative bias in businesses and commerce related organizations . )
Basically , libertarians are for freedom and liberty for individuals , and we prefer not to have the state involved in either our bedrooms or our boardrooms .
This is not a simple hedonistic “ I want to move to Idaho and smoke pot and watch porn and the rest of you all be damned ” ( although I ’m sure there are libertarians who want precisely this ) .
Rather , libertarianism is based on the principle that individuals should be free to choose for themselves .
Libertarianism is grounded in the Principle of Freedom :
All people are free to think , believe , and act as they choose , as long as they do not infringe on the equal freedom of others .
There is a very simple reason why libertarians do not like government : it is not just that government is so inefficient ( although it is ) , or that it elevates graft and corruption to new levels of bureaucratic efficiency ( although it does ) , or that it treats its citizens like we ’re a bunch of juvenile helpless pinhead morons in need of a nanny to take care of us from womb to tomb ( we are n’t and we do n’t ) ; it is because it infringes on our freedoms to choose .
Of course , the devil is in the details of what constitutes “ infringement , ” but as I outlined in The Mind of the Market , there are at least a dozen essentials to freedom :
The rule of law .
Property rights .
Economic stability through a secure and trustworthy banking and monetary system .
A reliable infrastructure and the freedom to move about the country .
Freedom of speech and the press .
Freedom of association .
Mass education .
Protection of civil liberties .
A robust military for protection of our liberties from attacks by other states .
A potent police force for protection of our freedoms from attacks by other people within the state .
A viable legislative system for establishing fair and just laws .
An effective judicial system for the equitable enforcement of those fair and just laws .
Under our current system of politics government clearly has a role in most ( but not all ) of these 12 , but only in the capacity of what we might call Preventative Rights : preventing others from infringing on our freedoms ( taking my property , preventing me from speaking or writing or associating , inhibiting my freedom to exchange with others on a voluntary basis , etc. ) .
By contrast , government should not be in the business of Providing Rights : providing goods and services that require the infringement of our freedoms ( e.g. , taking my property through taxes to pay for someone else ’s education , health care , vacations , paternity leaves , etc. ) .
Basically I believe in individual choice and responsibility .
You make your choices and you are responsible for the consequences of those choices .
Of course , we are not just individuals living in isolation ; we are spouses and significant others , we are members of families and extended families , we are constituents of social communities , and we are citizens of societies .
As such , we have a moral obligation to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves ( children , the elderly , the infirm ) , to help those who cannot help themselves ( the mentally ill , severely handicapped ) , and to give aid and comfort to victims of natural disasters and totalitarian regimes , but through private choice and charity .
It is none of the government ’s business who I choose to help and give aid and charity to , and I find it deeply morally repugnant that bureaucratic agencies have the legal right to confiscate my wealth through force or the threat of force ( taxes ) , launder my money and waste most of it to run the government organizations that process my money ( with dollops allocated for paying for bridges to nowhere and prostitutes for politicians ) , and redistribute it to people who I do not know .
Libertarians are not uncharitable selfish hedonists ; we just want the freedom to choose .
Okay , I know , you ’re all sick of hearing about the other “ L Word , ” so for next week ’s blog I ’ll write about my experiences at the Thinking Digital conference in Newcastle Upon Tyne , the UK ’s version of TED .
San Francisco
If you hang around the renewable - energy business for long , you ’ll hear a lot of tall tales .
You ’ll hear about someone who ’s invented a process to convert coal into vegetable oil in his garage and someone else who has a duck in his basement that paddles a wheel , blows up a balloon , turns a turbine and creates enough electricity to power his doghouse .
Hang around long enough and you ’ll even hear that in another 10 or 20 years hydrogen - powered cars or fusion energy will be a commercial reality .
If I had a dime for every time I ’ve heard one of those stories , I could buy my own space shuttle .
No wonder cynics often say that viable fusion energy or hydrogen - powered cars are “ 20 years away and always will be . ”
But what if this time is different ?
What if a laser - powered fusion energy power plant that would have all the reliability of coal , without the carbon dioxide , all the cleanliness of wind and solar , without having to worry about the sun not shining or the wind not blowing , and all the scale of nuclear , without all the waste , was indeed just 10 years away or less ?
That would be a holy cow game - changer .
Are we there ?
That is the tantalizing question I was left with after visiting the recently completed National Ignition Facility , or N.I.F. , at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , 50 miles east of San Francisco .
The government - funded N.I.F. consists of 192 giant lasers  which can deliver 50 times more energy than any previous fusion laser system .
They ’re all housed in a 10 - story building the size of three football fields  the rather dull cover to a vast internal steel forest of laser beams that must be what the engine room of Star Trek ’s U.S.S.
Enterprise space ship looked like .
A remarkable quote involving the scary notion of judicial empathy :
“ [ W ] hen a case comes before me involving , let ’s say , someone who is an immigrant — and we get an awful lot of immigration cases and naturalization cases —
I ca n’t help but think of my own ancestors , because it was n’t that long ago when they were in that position .
“ And so it ’s my job to apply the law .
It ’s not my job to change the law or to bend the law to achieve any result .
But when I look at those cases , I have to say to myself , and I do say to myself , ‘ You know , this could be your grandfather , this could be your grandmother .
They were not citizens at one time , and they were people who came to this country . ’ …
“ When I get a case about discrimination , I have to think about people in my own family who suffered discrimination because of their ethnic background or because of religion or because of gender .
And I do take that into account . ”
The day after our team finished carrying the cross up Mount Kilimanjaro , we had a day of rest and then toured the Tarangire National Park , where we rode among the elephants , zebras and lions .
On our way out of Tanzania and into Kenya .
we stopped alongside the road where some Maasai warriors were selling trinkets and souvenirs .
The warriors told us that in the old days , for a boy to become a man , he had to go out alone and kill a lion with a spear .
Now they are selling their handmade spears as mementos to tourists .
One of our team members , David Treat , had a new leather backpack and came up with a great idea .
He wanted a special souvenir to take back from his journey : a hole in his backpack made by one of those spears .
When someone asked him what happened , all he would have to do was to say , “ Got speared by a Maasai warrior . ”
“ If we put this backpack a good distance away , will one of you spear it ? ” we asked the young men .
They puffed out their chests the way all men do when you challenge them in front of their peers .
A young warrior who seemed to be the leader of the group immediately grabbed a spear , took a stance that aimed the spear at the backpack and then threw it hard .
The spear wobbled in the air and dropped to the ground only halfway to the target .
The other warriors laughed , so the young man hastily grabbed and threw a second spear , which veered far off to the right .
Another warrior jumped up to show up the others what he could do ; he threw a spear and missed .
Soon , the entire group of warriors was throwing spears at David ’s backpack .
Everyone missed .
Then they started making excuses for why they could n’t hit the target .
I asked if there was anyone left in the village who might be able to accomplish this feat .
They told us about an old man who was the last warrior they knew to kill a lion as his rite of passage .
They went to get him .
As this old warrior slowly came around the corner , we could tell he had a different demeanor than the younger men .
His skin weathered like leather from spending his life out under the sun , he had a confidence that came from years of providing for and protecting his village .
He did n’t say anything but just nodded as the young warrior pointed out the backpack on the other side of the parking lot .
Slowly , the old man bent down and picked up one of the fallen spears , taking a stance that told us this was not his first battle .
He leaned back , and with a speed like none of the others , he snapped his arm forward .
The spear took off like a heat - seeking missile , heading toward its intended target .
With a thud , it plowed into David ’s leather backpack .
Our team cheered as the victor turned around and shuffled off .
I stood in awe .
Time had overtaken his body , but this old man still had the heart of a warrior .
But my heart ached for those younger men .
Even though they had called themselves “ warriors ” in speaking to us tourists , they knew in their hearts they were nothing but trinket peddlers .
A thousand thoughts come to mind as I look back on that day .
Have we as a church become a lot like this group of Maasai warriors ?
Within the walls , we have men who claim to be warriors .
They stand around beating their chests and posing , but when put to the test , they fall short .
In reality , they are nothing more than religious trinket peddlers .
Where are the warriors who stand for biblical truth , suiting up with the full armor of the gospel and fighting for their marriages , their children and our nation ?
Where are the warriors who represent the voices for the unborn being ripped from the womb ?
Where are the warriors who still respond to the call of fulfilling the Great Commission ?
Have today ’s men left the command of our Lord and commander in chief to “ Go into all the world ” to the women ?
Do we have a warrior left in our midst ?
I have a dear friend who has been in the battle this week .
He has used his power and influence to take a stand against the slaughter of unborn children .
Like any warrior , he has wounds from his most recent battle , not only the wounds of the enemy but those from the other so - called warriors who surround him .
Yet he still stands firm .
Political correctness is for trinket peddlers .
This is a battle for biblical truth is for warriors !
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 15 May 2009 .
In the article below , we said that Hazel Blears , the communities secretary , avoided paying about £ 18,000 in capital gains tax on the £ 45,000 profit she made from selling a flat in Kennington , south London , in 2004 .
This would have been a maximum , but our calculation failed to allow for the possibility of taper relief and any unused part of her annual capital - gains exempt sum .
Indeed , the next day Blears announced that she was sending a cheque to the tax authorities for £ 13,332 as payment .
David Cameron finds the ­Conservative party in the firing line over the highly charged issue of MPs ' expenses and allowances , as embarrassing details about the claims of a series of shadow ­cabinet ministers are leaked .
As a former deputy speaker of the ­Commons warned a general election may have to be held to resolve the expenses crisis , the Tory leader moved last night to seize the political initiative by apologising for the way his MPs had attempted to ­maximise their benefits .
" Tomorrow is going to be another bad day for parliament and , frankly , a bad day for the Conservative party , " Cameron said .
" We have to acknowledge just how bad this is .
The public are really angry and we have to start by saying : ' Look , this system that we have , that we used , that we operated , that we took part in – it was wrong and we are sorry about that ' . "
Cameron 's intervention came as the Daily Telegraph , which has faced criticism for focusing on Labour MPs in the three days since it started publishing leaked details about parliamentary expenses , shifted its attention to the shadow cabinet .
Some are accused of adopting the practice of " flipping " their homes – the process in which MPs changed the designation of a house as their second property – allowing them to claim expenses .
The shadow ministers under pressure are :
• Michael Gove , the shadow schools secretary and a member of Cameron 's inner circle , spent more than £ 7,000 furnishing a London property in 2006 before " flipping " the second home designation to a new one in his Surrey Heath constituency .
• Andrew Lansley , the shadow health secretary , spent thousands of pounds renovating a thatched Tudor country cottage before selling it .
He then moved the second designation to a London flat .
• Alan Duncan , the shadow leader of the Commons who chairs the Commons audit committee which oversees MPs ' expenses , had a claim for £ 3,194 ­gardening expenses declined in March 2007 .
He says this hapened after he raised the matter with the Commons authorities .
• Francis Maude , the shadow cabinet office minister who is leading the Tories ' preparations for government , tried to claim mortgage interest on his family home in Sussex .
This was declined by the Commons fees office .
• Chris Grayling , the shadow home ­secretary and another member of the Cameron circle , claimed for the ­renovation of a London flat which is 17 miles from his family home .
• Cheryl Gillan , the shadow Welsh ­secretary , claimed for dog food .
She has agreed to repay the claim .
• Oliver Letwin , who is in charge of the Tories ' general election manifesto , charged £ 2,000 to replace a leaking pipe under a tennis court .
The pipe was not related to the court and Letwin was obliged to mend the pipe after an order from the local water authority .
• David Willetts , the shadow ­universities secretary , claimed more than £ 100 for workmen to replace 25 lightbulbs at his home .
All the shadow ministers issued detailed statements declaring that they had acted within the rules or , in the case of Gillan , apologising and offering to refund the money .
One
Tory source said that no rules had been broken , but added : " We have a perception problem . "
The series of statements – and Cameron 's apology – showed the Tories were well - prepared .
They were told on Friday the focus would turn to them today , though they were not informed about the individual claims until 11 am yesterday .
Labour was not told about the Telegraph series until 3 pm on Thursday , hours before the publication deadline .
The focus on the Tories is likely to turn the expenses leaks into a wider crisis for the political classes .
The impact was highlighted by Lord Naseby , a former Commons deputy speaker , who said the leaks were so damaging that parliament might have to be dissolved .
" It 's dreadful .
It is quite awful , " the Tory peer told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend .
" I think , frankly , if this runs and runs , then parliament should be dissolved , I think they have to start again .
The Great British public has lost their confidence and I think that it is extremely serious .
And if it is that serious then there is only one way of dealing with it , that is to dissolve parliament . "
His remarks came as Hazel Blears , the communities secretary , faced a fight for her political life after apparently making contradictory declarations about a publicly subsidised flat to avoid a £ 18,000 tax bill .
Blears appeared to have avoided paying capital gains tax when she sold a flat in Kennington , south London , in August 2004 for £ 200,000 , making a profit of £ 45,000 .
To avoid paying tax of about £ 18,000 on the profit , she would have had to declare the flat to the Inland Revenue as her main residence .
But in April 2004 she designated the Kennington flat as her second home to the Commons ­authorities .
This allowed her to claim mortgage interest payments on it of £ 850 a month .
Blears said yesterday she had done nothing wrong .
MPs will make clear the need for change when they agree to a tougher system to audit their expenses .
Sir Stuart Bell , the veteran Labour member of the Commons Commission , said : " In all probability the commission will approve a special specific audit unit , hived off from the fees office , independent of the fees office , which will verify in future every claim that 's made by any MP . "
Under the new system , officials who approve MPs ' claims will be overseen by senior officials who will be formally charged with advising on whether claims are valid .
A separate audit office in the Commons will conduct statistical analysis to identify MPs who overclaim .
Since 1 April this year the National Audit Office has been auditing MPs after they were placed on the same level as the rest of the public sector .
The internal and external auditing marks a major change .
Until now MPs ' expenses have only been examined individually , with no overall oversight .
By conducting a statistical analysis , the auditors are meant to identify MPs who claim above average amounts .
I just received the following email from Citibank , the private lender I was forced to deal with as part of the bank 's arrangement with my graduate school :
Citi : Learn about legislation that impacts you
May 7 , 2009 Dear XXXXX ,
Thank you for the opportunity to help you obtain the education of your choice .
As a student loan provider for the past 50 years , Citi has provided financial aid assistance to millions of students and parents nationwide .
Given the challenging economy and continued increases in the cost of higher education , it is critical that the U.S. student lending system serves the best interests of students and their families .
If you believe that competition and choice among student loan providers is valuable , you have an opportunity to make your voice heard .
Why Get Involved ?
The government budget outline proposes offering federal student loans solely through the federal government 's Direct Lending Program starting July of next year .
While this proposal will not impact a borrower 's ability to obtain a federal student loan , it will eliminate your ability to choose a student loan provider .
It will also substantially increase the national debt since each and every federally - insured student loan will be funded by the Federal Treasury through the issuance of treasury securities .
This proposal impacts you as a citizen - both as a taxpayer and as a borrower .
Why Does Competition And Choice Matter ?
Without private lender involvement through the Federal Family Education Loan Program , students and their families will not enjoy the benefits that competition has made possible for more than 40 years .
This competition has provided not only a choice of lenders , but also innovative products and services , such as : * a variety of borrower benefits that lower your cost of borrowing
* financial literacy programs that educate you on how to borrow responsibly
* web - based tools and resources to advise you about your financing options
* default prevention services to help you pay back your loans Competition also has driven increased customer satisfaction as a result of the responsiveness , personal attention and on - campus support that student loan lenders have provided to borrowers and schools nationwide .
Make Your Voice Heard
If you value the ability to shop for , evaluate and choose your student loan provider , make your voice heard by contacting your Members of Congress and by signing one of the online petitions that support borrower choice and competition in federal student lending .
Sincerely , The Student Loan Corporation
This message came as part of the regular email communication from Citibank , which includes the ususally mundane messages of statements arriving and bills coming due .
But you can rest assured that with two - thirds of college graduates with student debts , a lot of people are going to be receiving similar emails .
The policy proposal making Citi so anxious is a plan by President Obama to rein in an industry that makes a killing off of government subsidies to private lenders for services that used to run exclusively through the federal government -- without the banking middlemen .
By cutting out the middlemen , the President 's proposal would :
save $ 94 billion over the next decade , money that Mr. Obama would use to expand Pell grants for the poorest students .
Yet this commonsense policy is exactly what Citibank and other taxpayer - funded , bailed - out banks want you their customers to oppose .
Among the obstacles to President Obama 's student loan reform agenda in Congress is Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) , who Obama administration officials have indicated they would side - step through the budget reconciliation process .
This Citibank email is yet another reminder of why passage of the Obama budget is such a big deal and a reason why we were so cranky when Arlen Specter opposed reconciliation to avoid a Republican filibuster .
Sen .
Nelson 's rationale is that there are Nebraska jobs at stake based out of NelNet , a Lincoln - based student loan institution .
For Citibank , however , their rationale is some ironic notion of " competition " that might be lost of these loans originated back with the government .
In other words , private banks would no longer have guaranteed federal money backing up their loans to students at a marked up rate .
At the end of the email , Citibank provides a link to contact your members of Congress in opposition to student loan reform .
I 'd suggest anyone so inclined should use the link they 've provided to remind our congressmen and women that we are in fact in support of the President and his efforts to help college students .
We might also point out to our lawmakers that banks like Citi are continuing to benefit from taxpayer bailouts as they rally the public against reform .
This summer , residents in Chicago and the surrounding region will be asked to plan for their own future , thanks to a collaboration between the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and a real - life version of SimCity , known as MetroQuest .
From the University of British Columbia Public Affairs :
How do you want your city to look in 100 years ?
A technology created at the University of British Columbia [ based on models developed by the Institute for Resources , Environment and Sustainability ( IRES ) ] is giving communities around the globe a peek at how today ’s decisions can rewrite tomorrow ’s cities .
Like a Web 2.0 crystal ball , the software dramatically illustrates the future impacts of city planning proposals , helping to steer stakeholders away from pitfalls such as urban sprawl , gridlock and decay .
Inspired by the game SimCity , which allows players to imagine different scenarios for fictional cities , the tool is called MetroQuest , a computer software that allows various stakeholders in the urban planning process to simulate the consequences of different policy choices 40 years into the future .
For example , how will expanding mass transit affect commute times ?
If regional policies favor car drivers , how will that impact local air quality ?
HOW DOES IT WORK ?
There are two different versions of MetroQuest : 1 ) the online edition , which displays maps and graphs of outputs resulting from different planning scenarios , and 2 ) the full - version software used in public meetings , where MetroQuest - trained staff facilitate a discussion and presentation of how the future of a particular region would look like based on real - time input from participants , who are asked to vote on certain urban planning policy choices .
Almost all of the data that feeds into the software ( like census numbers , emissions levels , and transportation figures ) is publicly available .
The rest of the information is provided through interviews with city officials and other community members .
From the UBC press release :
Once a city is “ digitized , ” citizens can alter key aspects of their city , including population , housing , transportation , density and amenities .
With a click of the mouse , participants can see the effects of their decisions decades into the future , both on a satellite - view map and in a graphical display .
WHO CREATED IT ?
MetroQuest was originally developed by a Vancouver - based technology company known as Envision Sustainability Tools ( now called MetroQuest ) , co-founded by environmentalist and urban policy expert David Biggs .
In an interview with Sierra Club magazine , he said , “ People are used to making short - term choices — what kind of car should I drive ?
What kind of house do I want to live in next ?
But they ’re not thinking , ‘ If 6 million other people did this , what would be the cost to the things that I care about ? ' ”
WHAT ’S THE BIG DEAL ?
That type of consensus - building is at the heart of MetroQuest ’s work .
Though based on computer modeling and university research , which can seem far - removed from the everyday needs of regular citizens , the full version of the scenario development process actively engages the local community to understand the priorities of the city .
Take the example of the City of Lethbridge in Canada , which is seeking public feedback for its new municipal development plan , which has n’t been revised since 1995 :
One of the ways local residents can share their ideas is by attending one of four public workshops in late April .
The interactive workshops , or visioning sessions , will use a unique system called Metroquest , which will allow attendees to see the effects of their ideas in real time : each participant will be given a handheld keypad they can use to respond to a series of questions , and the audience ’s answers will be instantly tabulated and used to create a model of Lethbridge ’s future development .
The city model , along with accompanying taxation , policing and other figures , will be projected onto a screen at the front of the room .
“ You ’ll walk into a session here and have an idea of what you want , and when you see the results , you might change your mind , ” said Ald. Jeff Carlson .
“ It ’s an amazing tool , it gives people something to think about .
Through the visioning sessions , I hope people can get some common theme , some common vision . ”
Those who ca n’t attend the workshops will still be able to provide feedback .
An online tool , available at www.lethbridge.ca, will allow residents to create and submit their own ideal future scenario and fill out a feedback sheet and survey that will reflect their ideas .
WHO ’S USING IT ?
So far , MetroQuest has been used in more than 70 municipalities , from Beijing to Denver .
Last September , the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning ( CMAP ) contracted the company to help inform the regional plan , known as GO TO 2040 , for northeastern Illinois , which anticipates an influx of 2.8 million residents over the next 30 years .
( Check out GOTO2040 ’s blog here . )
Chicago will be the first U.S. city to use MetroQuest , which is expected to roll out to the public in early June , according to Bob Dean , regional planner for CMAP .
The agency put out a request - for - proposals for scenario development planning tools , and MetroQuest came out on top .
“ There was nothing else that worked like MetroQuest , ” Dean says .
“ It ’s easy and simple to use .
Everything else looked like a GIS program .
MetroQuest seemed to be as interactive as we wanted , and also intuitive . ”
CMAP has already scheduled more than 20 public meetings , held almost every night Tuesday through Thursday this summer , to get feedback on the regional plan using MetroQuest .
As a way to get more people involved , MetroQuest and CMAP will place “ interactive kiosks ” across Chicago , including Millennium Park and the Sears Tower , where passers - by can click through an abbreviated version of the software , which will ask two major questions related to land use and transportation .
Once users submit their answer , a short video will play , revealing what the region would look like if planners followed their preferences .
The kiosks largely serve as a marketing “ teaser ” to get people to participate in public meetings or use MetroQuest online , Dean says .
As a happy coincidence , the timing of the kiosk launch overlaps with Chicago ’s 100th anniversary of the iconic Burnham Plan , commemorated in July .
WHAT’S WRONG WITH IT ?
MetroQuest is not without its limitations .
First of all , people who participate in the public workshops , use the online edition , or stop off at the kiosks represent only a tiny fraction of the sample population .
“ We ca n’t assume that the entire region has the same perspective as people who come to the meetings , ” Dean says .
“ Their input must be weighed against our general knowledge , as well as what technical people want and what politicians want . ”
Second , MetroQuest can only drill down so far .
It covers broad issues like land use , transportation and environmental policy , revealing outputs like mode choice , commute times , greenhouse gas emissions and household costs .
But that ’s about all it can handle without getting bogged down .
“ For anything to be simple , you ca n’t possibly have all the details of every policy that you want it to , ” Dean says .
“ But that ’s not a fault of the tool .
You have to narrow it down to some broad policy choices , or else it would get so complicated that an average person might get turned off . ”
Third , MetroQuest is open to the public in participating cities , but it ’s not open source ( as far as we know … leave comments below if you hear otherwise . )
A few years ago , Jamais Cascio from WorldChanging says that this is a major disadvantage :
The drawback is that the underlying model remains hidden .
As with other simulations , the results you get are highly contingent upon the choices developers make … .
This is not to say that the software is useless ; as it ’s employed in coordination with a consulting engagement , whatever deficiencies are there can be discussed and mitigated over the course of the workshop .
But it underscores a point I ’ve made before : simulations of communities and social systems need to open source , so that the underlying assumptions and variables are clear and can be modified .
When applied to energy and the environment , the need for open source is multiplied : changes to technology ( e.g. , the power output of domestic solar panels ) and economics ( e.g , the cost of domestic solar panels ) can lead to radically different results .
As MetroQuest is intended to provide scenarios looking out 40 years , the need for modifiability based on technological changes is obvious .
WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE ?
Watch a video about MetroQuest on YouTube :
IS ANYONE ELSE DOING THIS ?
There are a bunch of similar modeling tools out there , according to Laurence Aurbach on WorldChanging .
Here are a few examples :
CommunityViz
CommunityViz is advanced yet easy - to - use GIS software designed to help people
visualize , analyze , and communicate about important community planning decisions .
INDEX software
INDEX is an integrated suite of interactive GIS planning support tools for :
· Assessing community conditions .
· Designing future scenarios in real - time .
· Measuring scenarios with performance indicators .
· Ranking scenarios by goal achievement .
· Monitoring implementation of adopted plans .
PLACE( 3 ) S
PLACE3S , an acronym for PLAnning for Community Energy , Economic and Environmental Sustainability , is an innovative planning method that fully integrates focused public participation , community development and design , and computer - assisted quantification tools ( GIS ) to help communities produce plans that retain dollars in the local economy , save energy , attract jobs and development , reduce pollution and traffic congestion and conserve open space .

May 27 , 2009 -- A 62 - year - old Singapore man was temporarily denied entry into the U.S. because a cancer drug he was taking had made his fingerprints disappear , according to a letter published in the Annals of Oncology .
Eng -Huat Tan , MD , a senior consultant in the medical oncology department at Singapore 's National Cancer Center , says his patient , identified as " Mr. S , " had been taking the drug Xeloda since July 2005 to prevent recurrence of advanced cancer that had responded well to chemotherapy .
The cancer patient was detained by U.S. Customs officials for four hours in December 2008 because they could not detect fingerprints .
The Customs officials later determined that the man was not a security threat .
Tan says people being treated with Xeloda , described as an oral chemotherapy drug , should carry a letter from their doctor that they are taking the medication if they want to travel to countries that require fingerprints for identification .
According to the letter in Annals of Oncology , other cancer patients taking the drug have reported similar side effects .
Foreign visitors have been asked to provide fingerprints at U.S. entry points for a number of years .
The images are matched with millions of visa holders to detect whether the visitor has a visa under a different name ; visitors ' fingerprints are also compared to fingerprints of criminals , Tan says in the letter .
" Mr. S " did not know his fingerprints had disappeared , according to Tan .
Xeloda is indicated for the treatment of breast and colorectal cancers .
One of its side effects is be a condition known as hand - foot syndrome .
Symptoms include swelling , redness , tingling , numbness , and pain of the hands and / or feet ; the skin can peel , bleed , and develop ulcers or blisters .
" This can give rise to eradication of fingerprints with time , " Tan says .
According to the letter , " Mr. S " developed a mild case of hand - foot syndrome and was kept on the drug because it was not affecting his daily life .
" In December 2008 , after more than three years of [ Xeloda ] , he went to the United States to visit his relatives , " Tan writes .
It was on that visit that he was detained by customs officials .
Tan says it 's " uncertain ' ' how long people would have to take the drug for their fingerprints to disappear .
It 's possible , he adds , that a growing number of people treated with the drug could experience the same problem and all should " prepare adequately " before traveling to avoid the " inconvenience " experienced by his patient .
Tan says " Mr. S " traveled again to the U.S. , this time equipped with a doctor 's letter , and had fewer problems getting through .

Last night , a US warplane attacked members of the Awakening Council north of Baghdad , killing one and wounding two others .
Officials claim the men were seen planting a roadside bomb , which prompted the attack and the capture of the wounded men .
Major General Daniel Bolger says that “ while we value our Sons of Iraq ( another name for the Awakening Councils ) brothers , these men had broken faith with their fellow Sons of Iraq , the Iraqi people and us . ”
The attack comes less than a week after Iraqi government forces launched a gunbattle against the US - backed militia in a Sunni slum in Baghdad , whose protest over mistreatment by government forces had turned into a full - blown uprising .
It also comes just after reports that al - Qaeda had been attempting to recruit disenfranchised members of the Sunni militia .
The growing tension between the US - backed Shi’ite - majority government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and the exclusively Sunni Awakening Councils that the US played such a huge role in creating threatens to spawn a much larger conflict in the war - torn nation .
But if there was any question which of their two allies the American forces would eventually side with , today ’s attack seems to have removed any doubt .
America stands with the Maliki government , and the Sunni fighters will be faced with a choice of accepting that or rejoining the insurgency that most of them came from in the first place .

Rogue Government
April 8 , 2008
Recent news on the White House torture and spy memos has amazingly received very little coverage in the corporate controlled media .
For instance , Barack Obama ’s low bowling score has received more coverage than these memos .
The media some how thinks Obama ’s horrible bowling skills are more important than evidence that could be used to prosecute members of the Bush administration for all sorts of criminality including war crimes .
That makes no sense , but of course when you consider that the corporate controlled media creates reality for people it makes perfect sense .
Both of these memos were written by former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo and prove that the Bush administration sought to justify torture and ignore the Fourth Amendment under the guise of the phony war on terror .
In the memos , Yoo concludes that Bush can torture and spy without a warrant if he is doing these things to protect the country from terrorists .
Of course , the majority of the so called terrorists that the media and the government claims we are fighting are actually trained and funded by western governments so the whole thing is a big fraud .
That of course is a whole other story .
In these memos , it is clear that Yoo shows a blatant disregard for both U.S. and international law .
Yoo and other members of the Bush administration should really be put on trial for war crimes but since the corporate controlled media thinks that Obama ’s low bowling score is more important than smoking gun proof of war crimes , that ’s probably not going to happen .
First let ’s tackle the spying memo .
Below is taken from an excerpt of an Associated Press report on the 37 - page secret Justice Department memo in which Yoo concludes that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to domestic military operations .
For at least 16 months after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001 , the Bush administration believed that the Constitution ’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures on U.S. soil did n’t apply to its efforts to protect against terrorism .
That view was expressed in a secret Justice Department legal memo dated Oct. 23 , 2001 .
The administration on Wednesday stressed that it now disavows that view .
The October 2001 memo was written at the request of the White House by John Yoo , then the deputy assistant attorney general , and addressed to Alberto Gonzales , the White House counsel at the time .
The administration had asked the department for an opinion on the legality of potential responses to terrorist activity .
The 37 - page memo is classified and has not been released .
Its existence was disclosed Tuesday in a footnote of a separate secret memo , dated March 14 , 2003 , released by the Pentagon in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union .
" Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations , " the footnote states , referring to a document titled " Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States . "
First off , domestic military operations at the time this memo was written were forbidden by the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act .
On top of that , Yoo is essentially saying that the executive branch has the power to search and seize property without a warrant during domestic military operations .
Through this memo ,
Yoo is saying that the administration can disregard the Fourth Amendment so long as they claim that they are trying to protect America from terrorists .
This is absurd considering that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and there are no provisions for its suspension just because the executive branch says there is a state of war .
This memo represents an attempt to justify spying on the American people without a warrant when there is no justification for it anywhere in the law .
Now let ’s go to the torture memo .
News on the torture memo actually leaked out to the press back in 2004 following the Abu Ghraib scandal in which pictures of U.S. soldiers torturing and humiliating prisoners were made public .
Now , the memo in its entirety has been declassified via a Freedom of Information Act request by the ACLU .
Although the memo was eventually rescinded , it gave authority to the Bush administration to legally order torture and ways to get around U.S. and international law that prohibited such activity .
Below is an excerpt from an Associated Press report on the declassification of the torture memo .
The Pentagon made public a now - defunct legal memo that approved the use of harsh interrogation techniques against terror suspects , saying that President Bush ’s wartime authority trumps any international ban on torture .
The Justice Department memo , dated March 14 , 2003 , outlines legal justification for military interrogators to use harsh tactics against al - Qaida and Taliban detainees overseas — so long as they did not specifically intend to torture their captives .
Even so , the memo noted , the president ’s wartime power as commander in chief would not be limited by the U.N. treaties against torture .
" Our previous opinions make clear that customary international law is not federal law and that the president is free to override it at his discretion , " said the memo written by John Yoo , who was then deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel .
The memo also offered a defense in case any interrogator was charged with violating U.S. or international laws .
" Finally , even if the criminal prohibitions outlined above applied , and an interrogation method might violate those prohibitions , necessity or self - defense could provide justifications for any criminal liability , " the memo concluded .
First off , torture is forbidden by the Geneva Conventions as well as the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
It is against both international and federal law so it is ridiculous that Yoo would try to justify this immoral and illegal activity by using Bush ’s wartime authority as trumping any bans on torture .
First off , Congress has n’t issued a declaration of war so the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are illegal which means that Bush has no wartime authority to begin with .
In fact , the occupation and on - going wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq are unconstitutional and illegal .
There is simply no moral or legal basis that justifies the arguments in Yoo ’s memo .
Yoo did n’t stop there though .
In 2006 , he said that the President actually had the authority to crush the testicles of children during an exchange with human rights scholar Doug Cassel .
There needs to be an immediate Congressional investigation into this matter .
Adolf Hitler and the Nazis did not even have the guts to say or put this type of stuff down on paper .
The torture and spying memos authored by Yoo is proof that he is not only a criminal but a war criminal .
Anyone in the Bush administration military or non-military who used the memo as justification to order or participate in the torture of other human beings should also be put on trial for war crimes .
This is proof that the events in Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo Bay and in secret European prisons were authorized at very high levels in the Bush administration .
These events were not the result of rogue low level soldiers , it was in fact policy .
Since we have so many militarized police running around in Darthvader outfits , perhaps they can finally be used to go after the real criminals .
They can first pay a visit to Yoo ’s office at UC Berkeley and then they can go round up the rest of them at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC .
It is time to bring down the Fourth Reich .

already has enough projects , but he revealed that his dream was adapting of “ ” as a “ gothic - western ” titled “ . ”
Speaking to MTV
News , del Toro said that he hopes to one day helm a reinvention of classic novel by .
“ It ’s a gothic - western retelling of “ The Count of Monte Cristo , ” and I co-wrote it withandaround 1993 to 1998 .
I wrote a lot of that during the kidnapping of my father , so it ’s of a lot of rage , ” referring to the 72 days his father was held in Mexico .
“ I adore that screenplay .
If I can fight , sue , or hit someone to keep the project with me , I will keep them .
And I ’ll get them made . ”
The last big screen adaptation of the story was released in 2002 withandin the lead roles .
Felix had an easier time making it to the gym five times a week than the average person , but that was probably because he worked there .
It was n't the ideal job , but it paid well enough for the summer between first and second year of university .
Each day Felix arrived to the familiar scent of sweat and chlorine ; the faint smell had permeated throughout the gym , even into the office sections .
Most days , when punching in , Felix 's boss ( who we 'll call " Ross " ) would stop him and bounce off his latest and greatest idea for the gym .
" What if , " he said with a dramatic pause , arms outstretched , " you did n't have to punch in your ID number when you came in ? "
Felix recalled the touchpad near the door .
" But wait , before you say that 's impossible , I have one word for you ... biometrics ! "
Ross continued to describe his dream system .
" All you have to do is scan your finger and you 're in .
No more forgetting your ID number and having the receptionist look it up , no more having to carry your wallet in with you for card scans if you just want to go for a swim .
Just imagine ! "
His excitement and ambition were childlike , though that 's not to say he was naive .
Ross would be running the gym of the future .
But the high - tech sign in was n't all the system would do ; it would run the " store " too .
The store was part of the reception area , and was basically a cooler with protein drinks , sports drinks , energy bars , and the like .
If members had sufficient prepaid credit , they could simply grab a protein drink , scan their finger , and then pinch their nose and try to down the shake quickly without throwing up protein vomit on the receptionist .
" But the best part is , " Ross continued with a toothy smile , " ... we 're rolling it out this week . "
Day One
A few days later , Ross stood proudly in the reception area , hands on his hips .
A high - tech fingerprint scanner sat at the reception area near the turnstile and register , as the same scanner would be used for each , though the register system was n't quite ready for rollout yet .
Another scanner sat on the opposite side of the turnstile , for gym members to sign out .
The touchscreen was still available , but moved further away so that members would get accustomed to the new system .
The receptionist looked almost as pleased as Ross that morning as well , excited that this meant they were working toward a system that necessitated less manual member ID lookups .
The first member of the day showed up , walked to the spot where the sign - in touchscreen usually was , and eyed the fingerprint scanner dubiously .
" Hi , we 'll have to take your prints , " the receptionist greeted .
" We 've got a new better system . "
The man was initially skeptical , but agreed to get his index finger scanned and associated with his old member ID after learning that it was an internal system and the prints would n't be shared with the CIA , FBI , or UNATCO .
After signing a few people up , the new system was going swimmingly .
Some users declined to use the new system , instead walking to the far side of the counter to use the old touchscreen system .
Then Johnny tried to leave after his workout .
A One - Way Turnstile
Johnny was what you might call a " gym rat . "
In incredible shape from almost - daily gym visits , a tight Lycra tank top , iPod strapped to his sizable bicep , underneath which was a large black tribal tattoo .
He scanned his finger on his way out , but the turnstile would n't budge .
" Uh , just a second , " the receptionist furiously typed and clicked , while Johnny removed one of his earbuds out and stared .
" I 'll just have to manually override it ... " but it was useless .
There was no manual override option .
Somehow , it was never considered that the scanner would malfunction .
After several seconds of searching and having Johnny try to scan his finger again , the receptionist instructed him just to jump over the turnstile .
It was later discovered that the system required a " sign in " and a " sign out , " and if a member was recognized as someone else when attempting to sign out , the system rejected the input , and the turnstile remained locked in position .
This was not good .
The scene repeated itself several times that day .
Worse , the fingerprint scanner at the exit was getting kind of disgusting .
Dozens of sweaty fingerprints required the scanner to be cleaned hourly , and even after it was freshly cleaned , it sometimes still could n't read fingerprints right .
The latticed patterns on the barbell grips would leave indented patterns temporarily on the members ' fingers , there could be small cuts or folds on fingertips just from carrying weights or scrapes on the concrete coming out of the pool , fingers were wrinkly after a long swim , or sometimes the system just misidentified the person for no apparent reason .
Fingerprint Scanning
In much the same way that it 's not a good idea to store passwords in plaintext , it 's not a good idea to store raw fingerprint data .
Instead , it should be hashed , so that the same input will consistently give the same output , but said output can't be used to determine what the input was .
In biometry , there are many complex algorithms that can analyze a fingerprint via several points on the finger .
This system was set up to record seven points .
After a few hours of rollout , though , it became clear that the real world does n't conform to how it should 've worked in theory .
There were simply too many variables , too many activities in the gym that could cause fingerprints to become altered .
As such , the installers did what they thought was the reasonable thing to do – reduce the precision from seven points down to something substantially lower .
The updated system was in place for a few days , and it seemed to be working better ; no more people being held up trying to leave .
Discovery
Felix was n't just an employee ; the gym was also where he'd work out .
He arrived with a friend ( " Ray " ) one evening after work , around 8:30 .
Curious , the receptionist pulled up the activity log .
" Ray , were n't you already here at 6:00 today ? "
" No ... "
" Well that 's not what this says , " she said , turning the monitor toward them .
It showed Ray as coming in several times that week , often twice on the same day , just hours apart .
For each day listed , Ray had only come the later of the two times .
Reducing the precision of the fingerprint scanning resulted in the system identifying two people as one person .
Reviewing the log , they saw that some regulars were n't showing up in the system , and many members had two or three people being identified by the scanner as them .
Hopes Dashed
Ross lost his childlike ambition in lieu of adultlike rage .
Despite all of the time and energy he'd sank into this system , he swore that he 'd personally tear out the scanners if the technicians could n't get the system working properly .
And the very following day , mysteriously , there were no fingerprint scanners to be found in the gym ; simply the familiar smell of sweat and chlorine and a turnstile that no longer required a " sign out " for members to leave .
Of course , we 're all fortunate that this occurred in an environment where security breaches are of little concern .
Can you imagine something similar happening in a very high security environment , like say , a prison ?
Oh , wait .
RNC protesters charged with terrorism now a cause celebre Rachel Oswald
Published : Tuesday April 7 , 2009
Print This Email This Young anarchists who sought to disrupt the Republican National Convention with protests last year will be the first to test the limits of a 2002 Minnesota terrorism law .
The eight activists , who were preemptively arrested in raids in the days before the RNC began , have become a cause celebre for opponents of the various ' Patriot Acts ' passed in the months after 9/11 .
The RNC 8 , as they are being called by supporters , are being charged under Minnesota 's 2002 Patriot Act .
As MinnPost reports , the eight individuals are charged with , among other things , conspiracy to commit riot in the second degree in furtherance of terrorism and conspiracy to commit criminal damage to property in furtherance of terrorism .
These charges are punishable with up to five years in prison and / or $ 10,000 in fines .
The eight individuals , who range in age from 19 to 33 , are currently out on bail and are playing an active role in raising support for their case by going on college speaking tours .
They are : Monica Bicking , Luce Guillen Givins , Max Specktor , Nathanael Secor , Eryn Trimmer , Erik Oseland , Robert Czernik and Garrett Fitzgerald .
Their trial is not expected for several months .
" Court documents allege that the group 's preparations ranged from practicing peaceful sit-ins to training for more violent tactics including throwing Molotov cocktails , overturning vehicles and rioting , " wrote MinnPost .
" Authorities also allege they organized other anarchists around the country for action in St. Paul . "
" In raids on the group 's hangouts , authorities seized PVC piping , paint , bleach , marbles and slingshots , bricks and cement blocks , gas masks , bolt cutters , firecrackers , empty glass bottles , flammable liquids , rags , etc .
You get the idea .
Items that made virtually every news report were containers of urine and feces . "
The defense is claiming that the eight did nothing illegal as they were preemptively arrested and that they were only expressing their rights to freedom of speech and dissent .
" This goes back to the history of prosecuting political dissidents in this country , " said attorney Jordan Kushner , who is representing one of the defendants , to MinnPost .
" Eventually the Supreme Court set a clear standard you can't criminalize speech unless there is a clear and imminent danger .
But how could there be a clear and imminent danger when they were put in jail before any of this alleged stuff happened ? "
Since their arrest , the eight protesters have received a flood of support from the greater anti-war community .
Anti-war student groups have hosted showings of a documentary called " Terrorizing Dissent " made about the group 's case .
Last week a bike ride was held to bring further attention to the case .
The bikers ' route was a tour of sites raided by police in the buildup to the RNC .
Organized labor has also joined in supporting the group .
In March , the Duluth Central Labor Body , which represents 17,000 workers , passed a resolution calling for the prosecution to drop its case against the protesters and for the Minnesota Patriot Act to be repealed .
 We work with the peace movement quite a bit in our area , " said Chad McKenna , field coordinator for the labor group in an interview with The Minnesota Independent .
 The broad net that was cast by the anti-terrorism act and the prosecution of the RNC Eight could affect things that we do typically . 

Like all oil firms , Chevron has suffered from the fall in the price of oil
US oil giant Chevron has said that its profits for the first three months of 2009 will be " sharply lower " than those it made in the previous quarter .
The company said that the drop would , in part , be due to falls in the price of crude oil and natural gas .
Chevron made a profit of $ 4.9bn ( £ 3.3 bn ) in the final quarter of 2008 but did not say what it will make in the period to the end of March .
The fall in profits will come in spite of an increase in oil production .
Chevron , one of the biggest oil companies in the world , said that margins on refined products fell significantly during the period .
It also said that earnings would include $ 100 m in write - offs associated with exploration .
Chevron increased oil production by 41,000 barrels a day in the US and by 64,000 a day internationally over the first two months of this year .
The company 's full results for the first quarter will be announced on 1 May .

When President Barack Obama was asked recently whether he believed that regulating cannabis would raise tax revenue while reducing illicit drug profits for Mexican cartels , he responded with derision .
He may be the only one laughing .
This Sunday on CBS ’s Face the Nation , Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan was posed the question of whether legalizing marijuana would curb the surging violence associated with the trafficking of pot by Mexican drug gangs .
Admirably , the ambassador did not answer with even the slightest hint of a chuckle .
“ [ T ] hose who would suggest that some of these measures ( legalization ) be looked at understand the dynamics of the drug trade , ” Sarukhan said .
( You can view the exchange at 2:22 . )
“ This is a debate that needs to be taken seriously — that we have to engage in on both sides of the border . …
It is a debate that has to be taken on with seriousness . ”

I was held at the climate camp until midnight last night .
When I arrived at 6 pm to celebrate the creative sight of a camp in London 's grey financial streets , the police allowed me to walk straight into the camp with my bike .
As the reports have said , the atmosphere was very warm and positive : schoolchildren and old - time protesters sharing a space full of colour and music .
Within an hour of arriving , the same police who had stepped back and let me through closed in around the camp and refused to let anyone in or out .
I then watched the police push forward into the crowd with a brutality that was not only shocking but utterly
unnecessary .
All the protesters put their hands in the air and sat down collectively on the road .
Yet as the crowd lowered I saw a young man stagger back with his head split open , another boy with a broken nose , a girl next to me had been kicked between the legs .
People were badly hurt and the atmosphere spun into a frightened panic .
A friend of mine from university who had come from Nottingham to join the camp just put his head in his hands and cried .
This was the scene minutes after people had been allowed to wander into the camp without any warning of the planned police actions , or any chance to leave peacefully .
As they rolled in back - up police and black armoured riot vans , and as the police kicked and crushed people 's bikes , the protesters called out to them , and the onlooking bankers , up in their ivory towers , " This is not a riot ! " .
As their batons came down , legal observers called out to people to take the police numbers of those who had hurt protesters .
En masse , the line of police all covered up their badges .
It was a chilling show of a police force unaccountable to their own laws , and their own humanity .
The police were indeed braced for violence , but most of that young crowd of protesters were not .
Despite our repeated requests to be searched and allowed to leave the space , we were held there for six hours with no access to water , food , toilets or medical care .
Proudly , throughout all this , not one person in the crowd reacted with violence to any person or property .
People shared the little they had and held public meetings about the aims of the G20 summit .
There was little show of anger , but much unhappiness .
When , finally , we were herded out one by one at midnight , I felt cold to the core , chilled by the unprovoked aggression of those who I had been brought up to trust .
I am deeply ashamed of my state , in which reasonable and calm protesters are criminalised and provoked in such a manner .
Their use of section 14 on 800 campers was mindless , their violence was a tragedy and their very presence , with armoured cars and helicopters , a ridiculous waste of public money .
I am writing this today because I grew up in this city and treasure the right to use this city space to speak out to our elected leaders in a peaceful , creative way .
There were no harmful intentions in that climate camp , but the harm done by the police last night goes far deeper that the physical wounds inflicted ; it is in the chaos of unnecessary state violence that fear is born and trust is lost .

Classics as Comics : Franz Kafka ’s THE TRIAL : A Graphic Novel
By Andy Frisk
One of the 20th Century ’s greatest works of existential and expressionist literature , Franz Kafka ’s THE TRIAL , has been adapted and translated into graphic novel form by David Zane Mairowitz and renowned French graphic novel artist Chantal Montellier , and it ’s an interesting interpretation that accurately portrays the novel ’s themes in a strikingly visual way .
THE TRIAL , published posthumously by Kafka ’s friend and editor Max Brod , is one of the most well known and read works of Kafka ’s along with THE METAMORPHOSIS .
Its themes of existentialist and expressionist absurdity , alienation and persecution are highly representative of their respective movements .
Briefly , the novel is the story of Joseph K , a bank clerk who has just turned thirty years old and is arrested one morning for a crime that neither his arrestors , the court or even his defense attorney can inform him of .
He spends the next year trying to advance a defense against a crime he somehow has unwittingly committed , with “ help ” from a bed ridden lawyer and advice from a painter and prison chaplain , all of which , like Macbeth says in the play by Shakespeare bearing his name , “ … is full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . ”
Eventually Joseph K fires his lawyer , drops his defense and when new arrestors come for him on this thirty - first birthday , he goes willingly , then unwillingly , and finally acceptingly with them to his execution , never knowing the nature of the crime he has committed .
Graphic novel interpretations of works of literature have been being produced for some time and are recently enjoying a renaissance of sorts with Marvel Illustrated ’s THE ILLIAD and MOBY DICK , and Sterling Publishing ’s THE TRIAL , CRIME AND PUNISHMENT , NEVERMORE and THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GREY being published recently .
With THE TRIAL : A GRAPHIC NOVEL we get a very good adaptation in realistically sketched black and white pencils that mix absurd and nightmarish visuals with realistic renderings of surroundings which come together to convey the “ Kafkaesque , ” defined as “ having a nightmarishly complex , bizarre or illogical quality . ” i
On several pages , for example , in fact more often than not , we get sketches of a sometimes grinning , sometimes leaping , sometimes laughing or dancing skeleton who invades , crosses and distorts the panel boundaries within the complete page .
This little visual vivisector of panels not only looks and moves in an absurd manner but clues the reader in on a theme of the work interpreted as the existentialist meaningless of action : we all end up dead , and a skeleton often represents the death that no matter what we do in life comes to us all , and the expressionist “ nightmarish action , distortion and oversimplification ( and ) the de-emphasis of the individual , ” ii since : as we all have skeletons what ’s so special about Joseph K’s predicament ?
Another aspect of expressionism in literature is the presentation , by the author , of his or her own subjective view of events , surroundings , and reactions to various encounters instead of an objective view.iii
The writer may also present only the subjective view of one character , or a main character like Kafka does often in THE TRIAL .
In the graphic novel adaptation which is the subject at hand , we get a visual representation of this aspect of expressionism at work .
One example of a visual representation is in the continual use of thought or speech balloons that simply contain punctuation marks such as “ ? ” or “ !. ” Joseph K is n’t the only character to whom these balloons are assigned but their repeated use by Joseph K and other characters in reaction to each other and the absurd events of the story starkly and very simply convey the expressed emotion of the character .
These punctuation mark reactions also help convey visually that “ The novel is written ( originally ) in German in uncomplicated , well - crafted , easy to understand sentences designed to depict the feelings invoked in Joseph K. by the world around him , as in expressionism . ” iv
The skeletal interloper and panel cutter as well as the stark and direct , yet simple , use of single punctuation marks in thought and speech balloons both help to translate the existential and expressionist themes of Kafka ’s original novel to a visual format .
There are other drawn visuals that further convey the novel ’s original themes which go beyond the skeleton and punctuation mark balloons .
In particular there are panels that represent conversations between Joseph K and other characters in the story where the only thing visible in the panel is a mouth and a one word exclamation .
Page 39 contains one such panel in the center - left of the page where Joseph K attempts to intervene and save two men from receiving and intense flogging by pleading with the flogger .
The flogger responds “ NO ! ” and his mouth is the only representation of him in the panel .
This absurd and rather nightmarish image of a disembodied mouth meets the definition of an expressionist image , especially since it is meant to convey Joseph K’s expression of what strikes him most about the flogger during this verbal exchange .
The flogger ’s loudness in his denial of mercy to the men and the source of this forceful exclamation , his mouth , is made prominent in the drawing .
Another such odd and expressionistic distortion conveyed powerfully through the visual art of the graphic novel is the scene where Joseph K makes a sexual advance upon his neighbor , Miss Burstner , by kissing her upon the lips and neck unexpectedly .
Joseph K is depicted in the scene with flames welling up inside of him that , like the skeleton sketches mentioned earlier , disrupt and distort the panel boundaries .
The reference is an easily grasped expression of Joseph K’s passion in the moment and what he is feeling .
In this panel as well we get a spoken “ NO ! ” by Miss Burstner and in the very next panel a reverse black and white image of the preceding panel with the word “ NO ? ” spoken by Joseph K .
The rendering of Joseph K’s completely reverse expression of the work “ NO ” is strikingly conveyed by the color reversal .
Very simply yet powerfully , without even changing the penciled drawing of Joseph K kissing Miss Burstner ’s neck , but simply , reversing the color scheme like a photographic negative , we get a clear vision of Joseph K’s reverse expression of Miss Burstner ’s “ NO ! ”
One final yet noteworthy visual representation in the graphic novel of Joseph K’s nightmarish collision with the meaninglessness of the world and the “ discomfort , anxiety , loneliness in the face of limitations , and desire to invest experience with meaning by acting upon the world ” v which is a hallmark of existentialism , is the consistency of the expression drawn on Montellier ’s renderings of his face .
As the reproduced cover of the graphic novel above shows , Joseph K has an intense and wide - eyed and nearly eye - lidless expression and several times in the graphic novel is depicted as such .
Joseph K has the look of a man who is intently preparing to dive passionately headfirst into an action designed to invest meaning in a meaningless world and / or the look of a man who is staring death in the face wide eyed , as he ends up doing at the end of the tale preparing for the unknown .
Perhaps the two different interpretations of his wide - eyed expression are not necessary mutually exclusive though .
For staring death and staring tomorrow in the face are both stares into the unknown and it is the existential moment we are living through now that needs the most intense scrutiny , as we shall never pass through this moment again and the next moment is as unknown to us as the moment that immediately follows our deaths .
Overall , simply stated again , while no graphic novel interpretation or adaptation of a classic of modern or classic literature will ever take the place a study or enjoyment of its source work , some graphic novel interpretations of such works can enhance the study and enjoyment of these works .
If anything , they can serve as vehicles for talented individuals such as Montellier and Mairowitz to enrich us with their art and in turn enrich our experience of , in this case , Kafka ’s original novel .

The human voice is one of the most versatile and amazing instruments .
It is able to produce highly intricate arrays of sounds and pitches .
It ’s tone can also be modulated to suggest emotions such as anger , surprise , or happiness .
And of course it can be used to sing .
Many singers have claimed the ability to sing very high pitches , or very low ones .
A music teacher in China named Li Wenxing is trying to beat the record for the largest vocal range – he is currently able to sing across 6 octaves .
Here is a video that he created to showcase his ability .
When I first saw it , I could n’t believe that the sound I heard was coming from this man ’s voice .
Definitely very strange .
Now , Li Wenxing can sing very high , however the Guinness record for the widest vocal range is held by ultra- low bass singer Tim Storms , who also holds the record for the lowest note in the world produced by the voice : a brown - note - busting 8 Hz !
8 Hz is actually lower that we can hear , but it can be detected by some audio equipment .
Here is an inverview with Tim and a demonstration of his vocal abilities .
A man named Charles Kellogg who claimed to have a vocal range of an incredible 12.5 octaves could accurately imitate birdcalls .
The birdcalls went up past the range of hearing ( on the high end ) .
Unfortunately , his claim of 12.5 octaves could never be accurately verified .
Here is a recording from 1917 of him imitating birdcalls with his voice :

Roger Eaton
KFC President
KFC has officially canceled , voided and revoked the coupons they originally issued on their web site ( and talked about on the Oprah show ) .
As we wrote about yesterday , some KFC fast food restaurants had been declining to redeem the free grilled chicken meal coupons promoted by Oprah on her show Tuesday .
They are now issuing ' rain checks ' to those who jump through a few hoops .
If you downloaded the coupon , you can print it out and take it to your local KFC , they , in turn , will give you a form that you 'll have to fill out and mail to KFC .
KFC says that they will then send you another coupon for a free grilled chicken meal ( and a free Pepsi ) that can be redeemed during certain dates listed on the coupon .
Their goal here , of course , is to try and spread out the dates during which people will be coming in to the restaurants for free meals .
I 'm sorry , but a company as large as YUM !
Brands ( KFC 's parent company ) should be grown up enough to know what kinds of promotions their restaurants can handle and have the marketing smarts to be able to predict the kind of response they 're going to get .
This is a shameful business failure on the part of KFC / YUM !
Brands .
Oprah has changed the message on her KFC Coupon page to reflect the new ' rain check ' policy .
Below is a video of KFC's President , Roger Eaton , apoligizing and explain the rain check system ( the text of his statement is also below ) .

Remember my nephew 's science project , which so many of you very kindly took part in ?
( Seriously , almost a thousand responses .
Professional surveys with monetary rewards often can't get that kind of response , people .
You are awesome , and I thank you . )
Tonight was the night the science project results were revealed , at my nephew 's school 's open house , and my sister was supposed to take a picture so I could show all of you .
Except she could n't .
Because my nephew 's project , alone among all of them , was not displayed .
After much back and forth with various people , my sister learned that apparently some people were uncomfortable with his conclusions .
Specifically the part where he said that what he really learned from this project was that some people do n't want to be called boysgirls , and that those people need an " other " option .
( And also that they tend to prefer blue to green . ) ( This really has been a learning experience , and not just for Z , either .
At my younger nephew 's birthday party , Z was wandering around showing off his survey , and many of the older kids asked why he had included an " other " option for gender .
Now , okay , you have to understand - Z is the kind of kid who , if you tell him you do n't want to be called a boy or a girl , he will just kind of accept it .
So you are other ?
Fine .
People are mysterious anyway , and obviously this is just another layer of mysteriousness to them .
He does n't need to understand it to be okay with it .
Most of the other kids , though , found this conceptand - obviously everyone is either a boy or a girl !
Obviously ! - and wanted to ask many many questions .
Which was the point when my sister turned to me and said , " They 're your friends .
You explain it . "
You have not lived until you 've tried to explain being genderqueer to a group of suburban elementary school students hyped up on cake and candy and penguins .
)
So tomorrow my sister has to write an irritated letter to the principal , emphasizing that she wants Z's project - which also apparently was the only one to get graded twice , or possibly not graded at all ; the story is n't clear - back , and she wants it considered for the district competition like all the other projects .
And also that it 's sad that the school missed the opportunity to show some genderqueer student or sibling or parent that , hey , you can have a different gender identification and still be considered and counted and included .
Anyway .
Whether they give back the project or not , you 'll still be able to see the results , because my nephew is nobody 's fool and has a copy saved .
But I still hope to be able to offer a picture of the poster , which is reportedly very nice .
In the meantime , I will be thinking about this : a concept that could be absorbed without distress by my nephew and a birthday party 's worth of kids was justfor some school official somewhere .
It 's a hard row you hoe , genderqueer people .
I salute you !
( And , parents , I think the take - home lesson here is : teach 'em early , while they 're malleable .
Or they might grow up to be narrow - minded educators . )
Hey guys , I 'm not exactly the most involved member on the boards , nor does anyone really know who I am as I 'm mainly a troll if anything .
Anyways , I just wanted to share a pretty disheartening story with you all .
On Thursday , April 23rd I had my front lip stolen right off my car while parked at Yorkdale Mall .
I was parked on P1 underground near the subway station .
This happened approximately at 3:45 pm and took the culprit 8 - 10 minutes to take it off .
I know this because I was able to obtain CCTV video and pictures from security .
I filled out a full report with security and Police that night .
I have attached pictures for you to see , but you will notice it is a first generation white A - Spec with a black roof that pulls around the lane .
From the pictures we can only make out that it was a caucasian male , but no real description .
He stops in front of my car which is at the top right of the picture by the last pillar , pops his trunk , then hunches behind his car while unscrewing my lip .
He then gets up , throws something in the trunk quickly , then closes it .
He was somewhat smart by removing his license plate which also indicates this was a premeditated crime .
So I asked security to go back and review a few days and even a couple weeks of tapes to see if they ever see a car similar to this one driving suspiciously around not only the underground parking lot , but all the lots .
We were able to find one that was the same but without the black roof and got a license plate .
So it 's possible he got the roof done recently before coming again .
I passed all the information I received including the videos , bolts left on the ground from my lip , and the suspicious license plate to the Police Detective in 32 Division handling my case .
Upon review he said unfortunately the evidence I have is only circumstantial which means it 's pretty obvious they are the same , but there is no clear cut evidence since on the day of we have no definitive license plate or person description .
I could try to charge or sue , but he said it would be a waste of time and money for me .
I ended up doing some digging around myself and through all my connections in the car industry , I 'm pretty sure I found out who this guy is .
I could confront him , but I 'm pretty sure that will go nowhere as he could just straight up deny it .
Hence I decided to post here on the boards with the information I have .
I know some people here are pretty tight with each other and I 'm sure new friendships have been made , but be careful you never know who is hiding behind their username .
Not that I 'm accusing anyone on the boards , because that would just suck if it was someone on here .
I 'm just saying that there are people out there who own TSXs who want to mod their cars , but are so cheap that they have to steal from others .
I hope with the information I have provided and the pictures posted , that you all can help me just keep an eye out for this car just as a precaution for yourselves .
I posted a few pictures from the video and again , you can plainly see it is a first generation white A - Spec with the A - Spec badging on the passenger side and white painted rear oem lip .
Also you can see from the side profile they are running A - Spec rims .
It seems like there is no lip on the front which is odd .
Plus my car is a 07 so why would a first gen want my second gen front lip .
Did they put it on their car ?
I do n't believe it 's a straight swap .
Finally , they have a black roof overlay .
I 'm sure with these detailed descriptions it 's hard for there to be more than one car out there that looks just like this .
Mind you it is possible they have the front lip on now , and maybe changed the rims or other things .
Again , just wanted to provide a FYI to everyone here .
Thanks for reading .

Finally got a piece of the pie .
For most of my life I have lived in the cauldrons of sin - first New York , then California .
These Bluer than Blue states are the source of most of our society 's ills , or so we are constantly told .
When it comes to online smut , though , it appears I 've been living in the wrong places .
Thanks to Harvard researcher Ben Edelman , we now know the most avid consumers of Internet pornography live in the heartland -- the " real America , " I believe someone once called it .
Edelman , a lawyer - geek who made his bones hunting down spyware and adware firms , has published a report titled " Red Light States : Who Buys Online Adult Entertainment ? " [ PDF ] in the ponderous sounding Journal of Economic Perspectives .
For his report Edelman analyzed subscriber data from an unnamed " top 10 seller of online adult entertainment , " broken down by ZIP codes , demographic data , and the speeds of users ' Internet connections .
One key finding :
The biggest consumers of online adult entertainment live in the great state of Utah .
An average of 5.47 people per 1000 broadband subscribers pay for porn in Orrin Hatch 's home state .
( Utah also leads in porn consumption among the general population and dial - up users , in case you 're wondering . )
It must have been all those Osmonds Gone Wild videos that sent them over the edge .
Close behind Utah with just over five porn subscribers per thousand is Sarah Palin 's Alaska .
California and New York , on the other hand , average between 2.4 and 2.9 subscriptions per 1000 broadband users , smack dab in the middle of the pack .
Overall , eight of Edelman 's top 10 porn - consuming states voted for McCain last fall , while six of the least smut - crazed states went for Obama .
It appears the Red states are also the Red Light states .
Notes Edelman :
Subscriptions are slightly more prevalent in states that have enacted conservative legislation on sexuality .
.... subscriptions are also more prevalent in states where surveys indicate conservative positions on religion , gender roles , and sexuality .
In states where more people agree that " Even today miracles are performed by the power of God " and " I never doubt the existence of God , " there are more subscriptions to this service .
Subscriptions are also more prevalent in states where more people agree that " I have old - fashioned values about family and marriage " and " AIDS might be God 's punishment for immoral sexual behavior . "
Here 's another fascinating tidbit :
... adult escort sites are more popular in " blue " states that voted for Gore in 2004 , while visitors from the " red " states that voted for Bush in 2004 are more likely to visit wife - swapping sites , adult webcams , and sites about voyeurism .
Thus explaining the whole Eliot Spitzer fiasco last March .
Edelman adds that as education and income go up , so does porn consumption .
Younger people also tend to get more of their naughty bits over the Net .
But that does n't explain why Florida is in his top 10 and California is n't .
It also does n't address why the strongest proponents of anti-porn laws tend to live in the states where online smut is most popular .
You could argue Red staters oppose adult content so vocally because they know the problem intimately -- first hand , so to speak .
You could speculate people who live in these states use online porn more because traditional venues like adult bookstores and peep shows are harder to find .
You might even stake a claim Blue staters are more likely to get their porn through illegal means such as file swapping networks .
( I 'm a little dubious about that last one . )
As they say in academic circles , more research is needed .

Let ’s play a little game of pretend , dear readers .
First , imagine you ’re the boss of some company .
Any company will do .
Be creative .
Be indulgent .
Ever wanted to own Apple ?
Now you do .
Next , imagine you have a female employee who holds a pretty prominent and important position with your company .
Maybe she manages your highest earning store , or perhaps she developed and runs some brand - spanking - new software that your company has exclusive rights to .
Whatever she does , she ’s kick ass and you ’re lucky to have her .
Then , imagine her boyfriend , fiancé , or husband sent her to the hospital by beating her to a bloody pulp .
Finally , answer this question :
How would you respond ?
Would you be supportive , offering her time off to recoup , or would you give her the boot ?
I ’m going to go out on a limb here – probably a pretty strong branch , actually – and assume none of you answered with the latter .
Given the picture to the right and the title of this post , you ’ve undoubtedly figured out that this little game of pretend is n’t entirely fictional .
It ’s based on the domestic violence situation between music artists and former ( I ’m guessing former ) lovebirds Chris Brown and Rihanna .
What you might not know , though , is that some “ bosses ” ( companies that have endorsement deals with Rihanna , rather ) may actually end up choosing the latter answer .
Some people are actually expecting the situation to negatively affect Rihanna ’s career .
Let ’s just pause to give that last bit the emphasis it deserves , shall we ?
Rihanna ’s career .
Direct quote from the Los Angeles Times :
“ Beyond the courtroom and the hospital , both have millions of dollars at stake in terms of possible damage to product endorsement . ”
Um …what ?
I can understand why Doublemint has pulled the reigns on Brown ’s catchy little commercial jingles , but why would anyone punish Rihanna ?
In case these people have n’t noticed , Rihanna is a victim .
I do n’t know the specifics of the situation – for all I know Rihanna could have been slapping Brown around before he assaulted her .
But , I do know – we all know – the basics :
The two were involved in a physical altercation that landed Rihanna in the emergency room and Brown under arrest .
Brown has since issued a public apology that included a statement about seeking counseling – a public apology that has apparently left Rihanna unmoved .
So , given those rough “ facts , ” can someone please tell me why a spokesperson for CoverGirl “ declined to discuss whether her status as an alleged victim of domestic violence would affect the future of the campaign . ”
“ ’As a matter of policy , we do not discuss advertising plans , ’ the spokeswoman said . ”
Yeah , okay , Ms. Spokeswoman .
It gets worse .
Senior vice president at New - York - based marketing research company Millward Brown , Anne Green , said :
“ ’ The reason why she has been used as a celebrity endorser is that she represents something very positive and in particular a strong female role model , and when she is associated with a situation like this it can have an impact [ … ] ' ”
EXCUSE ME ?
It took me a while to even begin wrapping my brain around that statement .
Because she happened to be romantically involved with a guy who turned out to have some serious violence issues , are we to assume Rihanna is no longer worthy of representing positive thinking and female strength ?
It seems to me that – once she pulls out of this – Rihanna will represent just that .
Hello ?
I guess we ’ll have to wait and find out how the situation affects Rihanna ’s endorsements – if it does at all .
In the meantime , I highly recommend checking out U.S. News & World Report article “ What Rihanna Can Teach Us About Domestic Violence ” in which Deborah Kotz discusses an abuser ’s ability to change , victims and mental illness , and domestic violence resources with the executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence , Rita Smith .

No , that wretched , God-awful smell is just the enormous and rapidly growing mountain of Republican bullshit that is piling up all over the country around FOX News and CNBC anchor desks , in the offices of nutty right - wing Governors of Alaska , at cable news studios where Michele Bachmann shows up and anywhere Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh have been over the past three months .
Do n't worry that stench you smell is n't lingering because you forgot to take the garbage out last night .
And no , it is n't some sort of sewer problem down the block .
It 's not even that annoying dog next door that wo n't stop pooping on your front lawn .
Sadly , David Frum 's shovel is not big enough to clean all of it up .
In fact , as we 've already seen , it is n't even big enough to just clean up Limbaugh 's portion of the pile .
Whether it's just the somewhat harmless verbal diarrhea of Michael Steele or the enormous , squeezed out turds of FOX News , the GOP is committed to making Mt. Rush - Limbaugh - More the largest , crappiest and stinkiest mountain on the planet .
As a proud liberal and Democrat I should welcome this seemingly endless supply of Republican insanity - and in those respects , I do .
But as an American and as a liberal blogger this ever expanding pile of poop from my country 's second largest political party is n't any fun at all .
It may be shocking to hear that this Republican mess is n't any fun for a liberal blogger , but we 'll get to that in a moment .
First , as an American , it is truly upsetting that only one of our two major parties consists of at least a veto - proof majority of sane people .
The other one is running around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off , creating budgets with no numbers , screaming about the coming end of the dollar , calling for an anti-Marxist revolution and having their henchmen broadcast , in the so - called mainstream media that the Obama Administration " does n't mind " the use of Islamic Sharia Law in the U.S.
No true patriot would ever wish these circumstances on his own country , that part is obvious .
What is n't quite so apparent is why , as a liberal blogger , I would not thoroughly enjoy a complete conservative meltdown .
The answer is that the size of this mountain of bullshit really is what is bumming me out , not just the simple fact that its there .
Why ?
Because I am only one human being , and Mt. Rush - Limbaugh - More is too huge for one humble blogger to cover .
" Well , " you might say " why do n't you just focus on one or two turds in the pile of crap instead of focusing on the whole stinking pile ? "
Good question , but I am trying - in fact we are trying , but it 's coming too fast and the story keeps changing .
Last night is a perfect example , as I sat down to write a piece about the hypocrisy of the Republican reaction to the recount in Minnesota , and their completely baseless claims of election theft in the Land of 10,000 Lakes , they suddenly start hyperventilating and making things up about the Congressional race in New York 's 20th District .
Upon finishing the piece the new GOP story would have made it obsolete .
Another example from earlier this week : our very own Michael Sweeney posted an excellent piece about the lack of numbers in the Republican Budget proposal , but before his story was even 24 hours old the GOP was already out with a second budget that was so moronic it was described as a fantastic April Fools joke .
These guys are finding a new way to screw the same thing up every 24 hours !
With a real job and as much of a social life as a political blogger can possibly have , how am I supposed to keep up with this bunch of jokers ?
At least during the campaign , there were really only two bumbling and fumbling Republicans to keep an eye on , Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber ... and oh , that guy John ... from Arizona ... he was Palin 's running mate if I remember correctly ... right ... what was his last name again ?
Now , instead of two or three Republicans slowly , but steadily shoveling the bullshit onto their little hill we have a gaggle of GOPers frantically heaving rotten , stinking piles of poop onto their now - gigantic mountain of bullshit .
It was n't too long ago that , while I disagreed with what the far right was talking about , I could at least safely assume that most of them knew what planet they were on .
But now , From Glenn Beck to Bill O'Reilly , from Sarah Palin to Michele Bachmann , from John Boehner to Eric Cantor and from Michael Steele to Dick Cheney , the far right is a collection of stark - raving nuts .
The only logical conclusion to be drawn from the massive Mt. Rush - Limbaugh - More is that eventually it will become as large as that other monument with a similar name in South Dakota and they 'll be able to sculpt the faces of George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Karl Rove and Mr. Limbaugh himself into it .
As of this writing , I think they 're only a couple truck loads away from achieving that goal .

How does your friend feel about this ?
If you are that close I 'm pretty sure you talked to her about it first , right .
Wow , beside it being sick and dysfunctional that will still not make you sisters .
Lets say that baby was that 1 in a trillion lucky miracle baby that did survive are you willing to take care of a mentally disable child for life ...
Yes you would be happy , but will the baby be happy ?
You are only 16 and flirting with a 51 , what is he like a pedophile or what ?
Or are you fugly and no teenage boy would look at you .
Oh the baby would be your bff 's 1/2 sister / brother and still she would not be related to you .
Have you taught about alternatives .
Like sorority sisters or even better marry each other and have an open marriage so like that you have the best of both world and most of all it is legal .
You know what forget about becoming sorority sisters , if you are asking questions like this , I doubt if collage is in your future , or even finishing high school .
But to correct this talk to a psychiatrist to help you deal with your daddy issues .
That has to be the reason why you would even look towards an older , older man compared to you .
I mean he is old enough to be your grandfather and would you ask your grandfather to the prom or much less have a baby with a 16 yr old girl .
If you still think this is a wise decision I ask you to please ask 3 other adults about this before you actually do this : so ask your mom , teacher and a priest and see what they say .
that is if you are not ashamed of what you are doing .
If you do not ask , that only means that you know it is wrong your self and are ashamed of what you are doing .
Having a baby should not be shameful and you should n't hide it by sneaking around , but if you are hiding it , then you are not ready for a baby .
So ask your mom , teacher and priest , I dare you .
Are you afraid , you should be .

Debbie Purdy is concerned her husband could be prosecuted Former health secretary Patricia Hewitt is urging MPs to change the law to allow people to take terminally ill patients abroad for assisted suicide .
The Labour MP has tabled an amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill which would protect them from prosecution .
The amendment which may be debated but not voted on at this stage , is not thought to have much chance of success .
Care Not Killing , which opposes assisted suicide , said the effect of Ms Hewitt 's amendment would be " tragic " .
BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the government did not plan to change the law and the amendment , which has been signed by a handful of Labour , Conservative and Lib Dem MPs , was unlikely to pass .
Purdy case More than 100 MPs have signed a Commons motion calling for the issue to be debated .
Downing Street said that while Gordon Brown did not favour a change in the law , Labour MPs would be given a free vote if there was a division on Ms Hewitt 's amendment next week .
Ms Hewitt told the BBC she had been " troubled " by the issue for years and was aware more than 700 Britons were members of Dignitas and may choose an assisted suicide in future .
She said her amendment was only " reinforcing the current prosecution policy " .

But if she got the chance in the future to introduce a private members ' bill she would like a specific law to allow people who are terminally ill but " mentally competent " the choice of an assisted death .
In October multiple sclerosis patient Debbie Purdy , from Bradford , West Yorkshire , lost a High Court case in which she tried to clarify the law on assisted suicide .
She wanted a guarantee from the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) that her husband would not be prosecuted for murder if he assisted her death in Swiss euthanasia clinic Dignitas .
No prosecutions
But two senior judges ruled the current guidelines were adequate .
The Appeal Court said it had to be Parliament which decided if the law should change .
Since Dignitas opened in 1998 , more than 100 British citizens have ended their lives in Switzerland , where it is legal to aid and abet a suicide , provided it has not been carried out for a profit .

It is illegal in the UK and anyone convicted faces up to 14 years in prison .
While there have been no prosecutions of relatives to date , the DPP has carried out investigations into cases .
At the end of last year , the parents of 23 - year - old Daniel James , who was paralysed in a rugby accident , were told they would not face charges over his death .
He ended his life in Switzerland in September even though he was not terminally ill .
' Quite clear ' Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer QC said while there was " sufficient evidence " to prosecute the couple , their " fiercely independent son " had not been influenced by his parents and so charging them would not be in the public interest .
FROM BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC Radio 5 live Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile said the current system should be left broadly as it is and the law was actually " quite clear " .
" There is a law against assisting suicide and there is also an important constitutional discretion which can be exercised so that a prosecution may not be brought if it is in the public interest not to bring it , " he said .
Making the law " prescriptive " would make using that discretion more difficult , he said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It is a person 's right to die with dignity LM , Guildford Sarah Wootton , chief executive of the Dignity in Dying group , said the Coroners Bill currently did not distinguish between types of suicide .
" Clearly the law should protect vulnerable people from abuse , but at the same time it should not criminalise people who accompany those who make rational decisions to end their suffering , " she said .
But Peter Saunders , director of Care Not Killing , said while the government was trying to outlaw websites encouraging suicide , the effect of the amendment would be to encourage it .
" The result would be a law that discouraged suicide with one hand and encouraged it with the other .
That would be farcical as well as tragic , " he said .
Ms Hewitt 's amendment has been signed by Conservative MPs Crispin Blunt and Richard Ottaway , Labour 's Kevin Barron , James Plaskitt and Chris McCafferty and Lib Dem Evan Harris .

U.S. - backed Afghani President Hamid Karzai is poised to issue a law on women 's rights that the UN Development Fund for Women has warned against and a female Parliamentarian calls " worse than during the Taliban . "
Advertisement
The law would legalize marital rape ; require women to seek their husband 's permission to leave the house ; additionally mean that women obtain their husband 's permission to see a doctor , go to school or work ; and eliminate the child custody rights of women in the event of divorce or widowhood .
No , for real .
This is what the government we 've installed is about to do to half its citizens .
Our government — which is happily handing out Viagra in tribal areas to ensure the military and intelligence cooperation of impotent warlords — is backing the President of a country who is putting into effect a new law which legislates away what few rights those warlords ' wives have .
I guess somebody in the embassy forgot to read Hillary Clinton 's confirmation hearing testimony in which she promised to elevate the status of women 's rights in foregin policy .
Advertisement
And why do you think our puppet government is perfect happy to legislate away the hard - fought rights of half its citizens — rights , by the way , that the U.S. actually sort of fought for on their behalf ?
To increase Karzai's chance of winning re-election in a country that is sick of his increasingly corrupt and ineffective government .
There 's a reason they call the guy the Mayor of Kabul .
After seven years leading Afghanistan , Karzai is increasingly unpopular at home and abroad and the presidential election in August is expected to be extremely closely fought .
A western diplomat said the law represented a " big tick in the box " for the powerful council of Shia clerics .
Leaders of the Hazara minority , which is regarded as the most important bloc of swing voters in the election , also demanded the new law .
Ustad Mohammad Akbari , an MP and the leader of a Hazara political party , said the president had supported the law in order to curry favour among the Hazaras .
And if that 's not fun enough , check out how well the Islamic supporters of the law can parrot the talking points of American conservatives when it comes to women and " innate " differences .
But [ Akbari ] said the law actually protected women 's rights .
" Men and women have equal rights under Islam but there are differences in the way men and women are created .
Men are stronger and women are a little bit weaker ; even in the west you do not see women working as firefighters . "
Advertisement
By the way , Akbari says that women can refuse sex with their husbands if they are sick or have a " reasonable " excuse — not that they could , like , prosecute that or anything — and they would totally be allowed to leave the house without permission in an emergency .
There 's , naturally , nothing in the law that defines a reasonable excuse or an emergency , but I 'm assuming that will be for the husband or male authorities to determine .
Of course , Afghanistan 's Western allies ( ie. , the U.S. and its allies ) have been suspiciously quiet about this heinous new law , being as Karzai 's people have convinced us that it 's the only way he can win the election .
" It is going to be tricky to change because it gets us into territory of being accused of not respecting Afghan culture , which is always difficult , " a western diplomat in Kabul admitted .
Soraya Sobhrang , the head of women 's affairs at the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , said western silence had been " disastrous for women 's rights in Afghanistan " .
" What the international community has done is really shameful .
If they had got more involved in the process when it was discussed in parliament we could have stopped it .
Because of the election I am not sure we can change it now .
It 's too late for that . "
Advertisement
Some diplomats are claiming that we'll , like , totes object when the law is final .
Some female Parliamentarians are trying to see the silver lining in the big black cloud of this law , at least until their husbands rescind their permission to work .
Some female politicians have taken a more pragmatic stance , saying their fight in parliament 's lower house succeeded in improving the law , including raising the original proposed marriage age of girls from nine to 16 and removing completely provisions for temporary marriages .
" It 's not really 100 % perfect , but compared to the earlier drafts it 's a huge improvement , " said Shukria Barakzai , an MP .
Advertisement
Well , hey , no more child brides !
I 'm sure that will be prosecuted with the same alacrity that women are prosecuted for leaving the house or working without the permission of their husbands .

There is an old Wall Street adage that no one rings a bell at major market tops or market bottoms .
That may be true in normal times , but as many have noticed , we are now completely through the looking glass .
In this parallel reality , U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has just rung the loudest bell ever heard in the foreign - exchange and government - debt markets .
Investors who ignore the clanging do so at their own peril .
The bell 's reverberations will be felt by everyday Americans , whose lives are about to change in ways few can imagine .
While nearly every facet of America 's economy has been devastated over the past six months , our national currency has thus far skipped through the carnage with nary a scratch .
Ironically , the U.S dollar has been the beneficiary of the very global economic crisis that the United States set in motion .
As a result , our economy has thus far been spared the full force of the storm .
Following its policymaking meeting last week , the Fed finally made clear what should have been obvious for some time :
The only weapon that the U.S. central bank is willing to use to fight the economic downturn is a continuing torrent of pure , undiluted , inflation .
The announcement should be seen as a game changer that redirects the fury of the financial storm directly onto our shores .
In its statement , the Fed announced its intention to purchase an additional $ 1 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury and agency debt .
The purchases , of course , will be made with money created out of thin air through the government 's printing presses .
Few can doubt that it will persist with these operations until the economy returns to its former health .
Whether this can ever be accomplished with a printing press alone has never been seriously considered .
Bernanke himself admits that we are in uncharted waters , with no map or compass , just simply a hope that more dollars are the answer .
Rather than solving our problems , more inflation will only add to the crisis .
Falling asset prices , the credit crunch , declining consumer spending , bankruptcies , foreclosures , and layoffs are all part of the necessary rebalancing of our economy .
These wrenching movements , however painful , are the market 's attempts to resolve the serious problems at the root of our bubble economy .
Attempts to literally paper - over these problems will lead to disaster .
Now that the Fed has recklessly shown its hand , the mad dash to get out of U.S. Treasuries and dollars should not be far off .
The more the Fed prints to buy bonds the less the dollar is worth .
Holders of our debt ( read China and Japan ) understand this dynamic .
We must expect that they will not only refuse to buy new bonds , but they will look to unload those bonds they already own .
Under normal circumstances , if creditors grew concerned that inflation was eating into their returns , the Fed would raise interest rates to entice them to buy .
However , the Fed will avoid this course of action as it fears higher rates are too heavy a burden for our debt - laden economy to bear .
To maintain artificially low rates , the Fed will be forced to purchase trillions more debt than it expects to as it becomes the only buyer in a seller 's market .
Just last week , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao voiced concern about his country 's massive investments in U.S. government debt .
In the most unequivocal statement yet by the Chinese leadership on this issue , Wen made it plain that he was concerned with depreciation , not default .
With his fears now officially confirmed by the Fed statement , we must wonder when the Chinese will finally change course .
There is a growing consensus that if China no longer wants to buy our bonds , we can simply print the money and buy them ourselves .
This naïve view fails to consider the consequences implicit in such a change .
When the Treasury sells bonds to China , no new dollars are printed .
Instead , China prints yuan , which it then uses to buy Treasuries .
This effectively allows America to export its inflation to China .
However , now that we will be printing the money ourselves , the full inflationary impact will fall directly on us .
With such a policy in place , America has now become a banana republic .
It wo n't be too long before our living standards reflect our new status .

SAN FRANCISCO — Technology has changed the nature of warfare from the Bronze Age to the Atomic Age .
Now a new report focuses on the next stage in military technology : the imminent arrival of weapons designed to fight on their own .
" The use of military robotics represents a new era in warfare , " writes co-author Patrick Lin , a philosopher with the Ethics & Emerging Technologies Group at California State Polytechnic University , in the report , " Autonomous Military Robotics : Risk , Ethics , and Design , " .
" Robots are not merely another asset in the military toolbox , but they are meant to also replace human soldiers , " the report continues .
" As such , they raise novel ethical and social questions that we should confront as far in advance as possible . "
The 108 - page report , prepared for the U.S. Navy 's Office of Naval Research , does not predict when independent killing machines might go to war , nor take a firm stand for or against their deployment .
Instead it suggests that advances in artificial intelligence , coupled with the growing use of semi- autonomous robots in battle , make it a question of when , not if , robots will become capable of making life and death decisions .
The report says the development of military robots stems from a desire to minimize casualties by American troops .
" Two key Congressional mandates are driving the use of military robotics , " the authors write ; the first urges a significant deployment of unmanned deep - strike aircraft by 2010 , and the second mandates the widespread use of driverless combat vehicles by 2015 .
These first - generation machines are not intended to act independently .
" Most , if not all , of the robotics in use and under development are semi-autonomous at best , " the report says , adding that , " the technology to ( responsibly ) create fully autonomous robots is near but not quite in hand . "
But war is driving the pace of development .
The report says an estimated 5,000 semi-autonomous robots have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan .
One common application is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) to provide reconnaissance .
Some UAVs , like the aptly named Predator , are designed to carry out air strikes .
" They can navigate autonomously toward targets specified by GPS coordinates , but a remote operator located in Nevada ( or in Germany ) makes the final decision to release the missiles , " the report says .
The technological and moral considerations involved in putting that killing decision on autopilot make up the body of the report .
The authors tip their hat to science fiction writer Isaac Asimov who wrote about the three laws of robotics — meant to prevent robots from harming humans — in stories that showed how these mandates could be subverted .
That sets the stage for considering how much more difficult it would be to create rules to tell a machine when and whom to kill .
The report calls this a top - down approach and says a designer can't hope to anticipate all the eventualities .
But if builders opt for the alternative bottoms - up approach , creating an artificial intelligence that can learn , how can they be confident that their machines will absorb the desired lessons ?
Even so the report entertains the possibility that properly designed robots might be less prone to commit atrocities .
It cites a U.S. Army Surgeon General 's survey of troops in Iraq that found less than half of soldiers and Marines believed non-combatants should be treated with respect and dignity .
" In the not too distant future , " the Cal Poly authors say , " relatively autonomous robots may be capable of conducting warfare in a way that matches or exceeds the traditional jus in bello morality of a human soldier . "
The United States is not the only nation developing robots for advanced roles in war and peace , while also mulling how to control their behavior .
The report notes that an academic conference in the United Kingdom recently heard warnings that the world was on the verge of a robotic arms race .
" Robotics is a particularly thriving and advanced industry in Asia , " the Cal Poly authors write , citing an effort underway in South Korea to develop a robot ethics charter " though the document has yet to materialize . "
" Autonomous Military Robotics " may sound tame to Americans raised on movies like " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " and " Terminator " , in which intelligent machines turn on their creators .
But in a scholarly way the report reminds us that technology is posed to bring science fiction to life .

Friday Q&A 2009 - 03 - 27 : Objective - C Message Forwarding
Welcome back to another exciting Friday Q&A .
This week I 'm going to continue the series on the Objective - C runtime .
Yuji Tachikawa suggested talking about how @dynamic properties work in CoreData and I 'm going to take that and expand it to talk about message forwarding in general .
No Such Method
Last week I talked about how Objective - C messaging works , and mentioned that interesting things happen when no method is found for a given selector .
Those interesting things are what make forwarding happen .
( If you are n't totally clear on what a selector is or what the difference is between a method and a message , you might want to go read through that article real quick , or at least re-read the Definitions section if you already read it . )
Just what is message forwarding ?
Simply speaking , it allows unknown messages to be trapped and reacted to .
In other words , any time an unknown message is sent , it gets delivered to your code in a nice package , at which point you can do whatever you like with it .
This kind of thing is incredibly powerful and allows for doing all kinds of nifty , clever things .
Right about now , you 're probably wondering , " Why is it called forwarding ? "
There does n't seem to be much of a link between taking arbitrary actions in response to unknown messages , and " forwarding " .
The reason for this is because this technique was mainly intended to allow objects to let other objects handle the message for them , thus " forwarding " .
What Happens
What happens when you do [ foo bar ] and foo does n't implement a bar method ?
When it does implement such a method , it 's pretty straightforward : it looks up the appropriate method , then jumps to it .
When no such method can be found , a complicated sequence of events ensues :
Lazy method resolution .
This is done by sending resolveInstanceMethod : ( resolveClassMethod : for class methods ) to the class in question .
If that method returns YES , the message send is restarted under the assumption that the appropriate method has now been added .
Fast forwarding path .
This is done by sending forwarding TargetForSelector : to the target , if it implements it .
If it implements this method and it returns something other than nil or self , the whole message sending process is restarted with that return value as the new target .
Normal forwarding path .
First the runtime will send methodSignatureForSelector : to see what kind of argument and return types are present .
If a method signature is returned , the runtime creates an NSInvocation describing the message being sent and then sends forwardInvocation : to the object .
If no method signature is found , the runtime sends doesNotRecognizeSelector : .
Lazy Resolution
As we learned last week , the runtime sends messages by looking up a method , or IMP , and then jumping to it .
Sometimes it can be useful to dynamically plug IMPs into a class instead of setting them all up beforehand .
Doing this allows for really fast " forwarding " , because after the method is resolved , it gets invoked as part of the normal message sending process .
The disadvantage is , of course , that this is n't very flexible , since you need to have an IMP ready to plug in , and that in turn means that you need to have already anticipated the argument and return types that will be arriving .
This kind of thing is great for stuff like @dynamic properties .
The method signature is something you should know in advance : you 'll either take one parameter with a void return , or have no parameters and return one value .
The types of the values will vary , but you can cover the common cases .
Since the IMP gets passed the selector that 's been sent to the object , it can use that selector to get the name of the property and look it up dynamically .
Plug it in to the class using +resolveInstanceMethod : and off you go .
Fast Forwarding
The next thing the runtime does is see if you want to just send the whole message unchanged to a different object .
Since this is a common case of forwarding , this allows it to be done with minimal overhead .
For some reason , fast forwarding is really poorly documented .
The only place Apple even mentions it , aside from a commented - out declaration in NSObject.h , is in the Leopard release notes .
( Search for " New forwarding fast path " . )
This technique is great for faking multiple inheritence .
You can write a little override like this :
- ( id ) forwardingTargetForSelector :( SEL ) sel { return _otherObject ; }
_otherObject
This will cause any unknown message to be sent to , which will make your object appear from the outside as though it combined your object with this other object in one .
Normal Forwarding
The first two are basically just optimizations that allow forwarding to go faster .
If you do n't take advantage of them , the full forwarding mechanism goes into action .
This creates an NSInvocation object which fully encapsulates the message being sent .
It holds the target , the selector , and all of the arguments .
It also allows full control over the return value .
Before the runtime can build the NSInvocation it needs an NSMethodSignature , so it requests one using - methodSignatureForSelector : .
This is required due to Objective - C's C heritage .
In order to bundle the arguments up in the NSInvocation , the runtime needs to know what kind of arguments there are , and how many of them there are .
This information is n't normally provided in a C runtime environment , so it has to do an end run around the C " bag of bytes " view of the world and get that type information in another way .
Once the invocation is constructed , the runtime then invokes your forwardInvocation : method .
From there you can do whatever you want with the invocation it hands you .
The possibilities are endless .
Here 's one quick example .
Imagine you 're tired of writing loops , so you want to be able to manipulate arrays more directly .
Add this little category to NSArray :
@implementation NSArray ( ForwardingIteration ) - ( NSMethodSignature * ) methodSignatureForSelector :( SEL ) sel { NSMethodSignature * sig = [ super methodSignatureForSelector : sel ] ; if ( ! sig ) { for ( id obj in self ) if ( ( sig = [ obj methodSignatureForSelector : sel ] ) ) break ; } return sig ; } - ( void ) forwardInvocation :( NSInvocation * ) inv { for ( id obj in self ) [ inv invokeWithTarget : obj ] ; } @end
[( NSWindow * ) windowsArray setHidesOnDeactivate : YES ] ;
NSProxy
Then you can write code like this : I do n't recommend writing code like this .
The trouble is that forwarding wo n't catch any methods already implemented by NSArray , so you 'll end up being able to capture some but not others .
A much better approach is to write a trampoline class by subclassing
NSProxy is basically a class that 's expilicitly designed for proxying .
It implements a minimal subset of methods , leaving everything else up for grabs .
This means that a subclass that implements forwarding can capture basically any message .
To use NSProxy for this kind of thing , you 'd write an NSProxy subclass that can be initialized to point at an array , and then add a little stub method to NSArray that returns a new instance of the proxy , like so :
@implementation NSArray ( ForwardingIteration ) - ( id ) do { return [ MyArrayProxy proxyWithArray : self ] ; } @end
[ [ windowsArray do ] setHidesOnDeactivate : YES ] ;
Then you 'd use it like this :
This whole area of writing trampolines to capture messages and have them do interesting things has been well explored and has been given the name Higher - Order Messaging .
I wo n't go into more detail about it in this post , but there 's a lot of neat stuff out there .
Declarations
Another consequence of Objective - C's C heritage is that the compiler needs to know the full method signature of every message that you 're going to send in your code , even purely forwarded ones .
To make a contrived example , imagine writing a class that uses forwarding to produce integers from code , so that you can write this :
int x = [ converter convert_42 ] ;
This is obviously not very useful , but you could certainly do it .
More useful variants of this technique are possible .
The trouble is that the compiler does n't know about any convert_42 method , so it has no idea what kind of value it returns .
It will give you a nasty warning , and will assume that it returns id .
The fix to this is simple , just declare one somewhere :
@interface NSObject ( Conversion ) - ( int ) convert_42 ; - ( int ) convert_29 ; @end
Again , this obviously is n't very useful to do , but in cases where you have a more practical forwarding situation , this can help you make peace with the compiler .
For example , if you use forwarding to fake multiple inheritence , use a category to declare all of the methods of the other class as applying to the multiply - inheriting class as well .
That way the compiler knows that it has both sets of methods .
One set gets handled by forwarding , but that does n't matter to the compiler .
Conclusion
Message forwarding is a powerful technique that greatly multiplies the expressiveness of Objective - C. Cocoa uses it for things like NSUndoManager and distributed objects , and it can let you do a lot of nifty things in your own code .

Tomboy ’s role in GNOME has made it a troublesome component that grabs an entire Mono stack into many GNU / Linux distributions .
For reasons that were brought up before , the TomTom lawsuit teaches everyone why Mono does not belong in GNU / Linux .
It is thus reassuring to hear that Tomboy is now being rewritten in C ++.
The company which vigorously promotes Mono /.NET no longer employs this developer .
Stefano Forenza summarises the situation by connecting the dots and stating that “ the most ironical thing , is that his project is born out of boredom , after getting la[id off ] from Novell . ”
TomTom will replace FAT .
It ’s time to replace Mono , as well .
It ’s the same problem , but the latter is still waiting to break out . █
“ [...] we know that Microsoft is getting patents on some features of C# .
So I think it ’s dangerous to use C# , and it may be dangerous to use Mono . ”

Karl Denninger notes that a nasty rumor is circulating about Goldman Sachs amongst observers of the Street .
Allegedly , GS is about to report their second - best quarter in history , +$ 12 billion or so …
In this era of finacial disasters , credit crisis , and recession , how is that possible ?
Easy .
You — and your grandkids — are the ones who paid for it :
“ The fact that they ( like so many others ) are being paid by the taxpayer through AIG ’s “ conduit ” for losses that did n’t ( yet ) happen at 100 cents on the dollar might be the basic math .
And further ( and potentially much worse ) there is the repeated statement by Goldman executives that they were “ fully hedged ” against a potential counterparty default by AIG .
One wonders – was that “ hedge ” to be short the equity on AIG itself , perhaps ?
Why is this important ?
Because if that ’s how Goldman hedged they got paid twice and the taxpayer literally got robbed .
Someone in Congress needs to look into this now ; there are already rumblings of investigation .
Those rumblings need to get a lot louder and turn into subpoenas , not “ polite inquiries . ”
If in fact Goldman ( or anyone else ) was “ hedged ” against a possible credit loss from their CDS with AIG and they were able to collect on that hedge ( no matter what it was ) those payments through AIG need to be clawed back immediately as nobody is entitled to be paid twice for the same risk and reap what amounts to a windfall profit by quite literally engineering a multi-billion dollar transfer of funds from the Taxpayer to the firm ! ”
Makes you wonder if having a Treasury Secretary who was a former CEO of Goldman Sachs had anything to do with this .
Indeed , not only was Hank Paulson Goldie ’s boy , but he was the same gentleman who so vociferously lobbied the SEC to allow the 5 largest iBanks to drop the net capital rule and leverage up 40 to 1 .
So not only did he help set up the disaster , but he then oversaw the greatest transfer of wealth in the planets history — several trillion dollars from taxpayers to the management and shareholders of inept , incompetant , wildly irresponsible companies .
This is theft on the sort of grand scale thta calls for the population to revolt .
Perhaps the French peasants were right ;
Time to bring the guillotine for executing nobles and bankers .

J- Ware Stink - Free Underwear
Japanese scientists and one astronaut are making a new kind of odor - free history .
J- Ware clothing , which was created by textile experts at the Women ’s University in Tokyo , may transform the chore of changing one ’s underwear into a thing of the past .
Koichi Wakata , the first Japanese astronaut to live on the International Space Station , is now involved in a project that has more to do with personal hygiene than outer space exploration , as he is currently the tester for a new line of stink - free underwear called J - Ware .
“ He can wear his trunks ( underwear ) more than a week .
The other astronauts become very sweaty , but he does n’t have any sweat .
He did n’t need to hang his clothes to dry , ”  said Koji Yanagawa , an official with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency .
The underwear , which was developed by researcher Yoshiko Taya , is very versatile .
It is designed to kill bacteria , absorb water , insulate the body and dry quickly .
Believe it or not , they are also flame - resistant and anti-static , not to mention comfortable and stylish .
It is expected that J - Ware will greatly reduce the amount of clothing sent to the space station , which has no laundry facilities .
Having clothes that can stay fresh for weeks at a time is expected to reduce expenditures significantly .
The Japanese space agency plans to make the line of stink - free underwear available to NASA and its other space station partners once development is complete .
“ Nobody has complained , so I think it ’s so far , so good , ”  said the non-smelling tester himself .
Here is some audio after the Astronaut returned , having worn the underwear for one month : LINK

The VA needs to clean its sh*t up , for real , just disgusting ....
The Department of Veterans Affairs says a fourth person exposed to dirty equipment at its hospitals has tested positive for HIV .
The test result revealed Friday is the second positive HIV test from a patient who was treated at a VA hospital in Miami .
The VA is investigating problems with cleaning medical equipment used for colonoscopies as well as ear , nose and throat exams at three of its Southeast hospitals .
Positive HIV tests have also been reported from patients at VA clinics in Murfreesboro , Tenn. , and Augusta , Ga .
The agency says it does n't yet know if the HIV and hepatitis cases are related to its treatment , but it has warned almost 11,000 veterans treated at those hospitals to get blood tests .
The VA also increased the number of patients who have hepatitis C to 20 .

It took corporate media swine flu hysteria to ram through a martial law bill in Massachusetts .
S18 gives the Governor the power to authorize the deployment and use of force to distribute supplies and materials and local authorities will be allowed to enter private residences for investigation and to quarantine individuals .
The Associated Press reports :
The Massachusetts Senate has unanimously passed a pandemic flu preparation bill that has languished in the Legislature before the recent swine flu outbreak .
The 36 - 0 vote today sends the measure to the House .
Both branches have taken it up in past years , but have not been able to agree on the details .
The new Senate version would allow the public health commissioner — in a public health emergency — to close or evacuate buildings , enter private property for investigations , and quarantine individuals .
The bill specifically mandates the following :
( 1 ) to require the owner or occupier of premises to permit entry into and investigation of the premises ;
( 2 ) to close , direct , and compel the evacuation of , or to decontaminate or cause to be decontaminated any building or facility , and to allow the reopening of the building or facility when the danger has ended ;
( 3 ) to decontaminate or cause to be decontaminated , or to destroy any material ;
( 4 ) to restrict or prohibit assemblages of persons ;
( 5 ) to require a health care facility to provide services or the use of its facility , or to transfer the management and supervision of the health care facility to the department or to a local public health authority ;
( 6 ) to control ingress to and egress from any stricken or threatened public area , and the movement of persons and materials within the area ;
( 7 ) to adopt and enforce measures to provide for the safe disposal of infectious waste and human remains , provided that religious , cultural , family , and individual beliefs of the deceased person shall be followed to the extent possible when disposing of human remains , whenever that may be done without endangering the public health ;
( 8 ) to procure , take immediate possession from any source , store , or distribute any anti-toxins , serums , vaccines , immunizing agents , antibiotics , and other pharmaceutical agents or medical supplies located within the commonwealth as may be necessary to respond to the emergency ;
( 9 ) to require in - state health care providers to assist in the performance of vaccination , treatment , examination , or testing of any individual as a condition of licensure , authorization , or the ability to continue to function as a health care provider in the commonwealth
Any person who knowingly violates an order of the commissioner or his or her designee , or of a local public health authority or its designee , given to effectuate the purposes of this subsection shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 6 months , or by a fine of note more than one thousand dollars , or both .

Hank Paulson was surely about to do this as well but somehow it slipped his mind .
The US continues to allow the banks to get away with profiteering despite being saved from total failure , but that ’s the Republican way .
As long as their friends can squeeze one last penny out of consumers ( whether it ’s oil , banking , or any other business ) then everything is OK .
It does n’t have to be this way , but it is thanks to Bush and Paulson .
( Hat tip D/M )
Credit card giants have been given two weeks to agree to stop charging exorbitant rates to borrowers or risk losing their operating licences .
Ministers said they were giving Britain ’s major lenders one last chance to prove they were not profiteering from the downturn .
The ultimatum was delivered at a four - hour Whitehall summit called after The Independent disclosed some credit card and store card providers had raised interest rates – in some cases to 30 per cent – even though the cost of borrowing had fallen .
The credit card companies agreed last night to give borrowers who run into trouble paying their bills a “ breathing space ” of up to two months before they face action .
They also pledged to draw up a clear “ statement of principles ” over their rates by 9 December .
It will commit them to give clear information to borrowers , not alter rates constantly and charge “ proportionate ” levels of interest .
Lord Mandelson , the Business Secretary , and Gareth Thomas , the Consumer Affairs minister , told leaders of the industry that they were alarmed by lenders increasing their rates overnight without justification .
Findjango , the Django vertical search I 've been working on , has been in the open for about one week .
It 's moving in a good direction , and -- I 'd like to say - - improving at a good pace .
I 'm really interested in seeing Findjango become a community tool , so let me give a quick overview of the impediments to that happening , and also what I 'm doing to wear them down .
Over the first week there have been about 2500 queries , a number of results flagged for relevancy tuning , and one kind soul who decided to run a load testing script against it with fifty concurrent clients .
Expanding Content
I 've tried to keep content extremely Django focused , and one of the side effects of doing so is that there simply is n't enough content available for some queries .
Search for Marty Alchin's Pro Django and you get 258 extremely relevant results .
Search for tutorial and you get 4218 exceedingly mediocre results .
Search for performance and you get 3402 awful results .
To improve upon this situation , I spent much of Sunday getting to know whoosh ( a pure - Python full - text indexer and searcher ) and feedparser , and now have the ability to persistently index RSS ( or Atom ) feeds .
That is to say , as of yesterday all content that passes through the Django Community feed , This Week in Django feed , and a couple of smaller feeds have been -- and will remain -- indexed for searching .
This approach wo n't allow me to pick up older content , but it is one useful tool in the toolkit , and going forward will make it possible to index content for sites that are unable to expose a native search api to Findjango .
Please let me know if you have an RSS feed with Django content which is n't already picked up by the Django community feed , and I 'll add it as well !
The next step will be to setup a small web - crawling process using Scrapy and make it possible to extract older or non-feed based content .
This is probably a week or two away .
( I'm also working in a few situations to get APIs opened up to Findjango , and that is still the best way to give Findjango access to your content . )
Increasing Awareness
The other major stumbling block for Findjango is that the people who would benefit most from using it -- those who are new to developing with Django - - have the smallest opportunity to discover it .
If I was Yahoo ! or Google , I 'd be wheeling and dealing with search deals , but since my budget is markedly smaller , I 've come up with a different strategy , one which will hopefully be helpful for both site - owners and Findjango .
As I mentioned last week , I am opening up an API to Findjango .
curl http://findjango.com/service/?query=app%20engine curl http://findjango.com/service/?query=app%20engine&start=10
The api returns JSON formatted results in this format :
{ ' total_results ' : 200 , ' start ' : 0 , ' count ' : 10 , ' results ' : [ { ' title ' : ' a ' , 'url ' : ' http://etc' , ' text ' : ' yada yada ' } ] }
You can use it to add a Django - specific search to your own site .
I realize that alone is n't necessarily enough added value , so here something of a special sauce as extra enticement : you can pass your domain along using the site parameter , and results from your site will bubble to the top of the result set .
This means -- as long as you let me know where I can find an RSS feed for your site or you expose a search api -- you can use Findjango to power an enhanced site search for your Django related site .
curl http://findjango.com/service/?query=tutorial&site=lethain.com
For a lot of sites , I think this will allow Findjango to be genuinely useful , and I 'll be working at putting together some default templates and / or templatetags to make using Findjango to power site - search increasingly trivial .
Needs A Better Design
The new design should be in place before Findjango turns two weeks old .
Sorry that you 've been forced to deal with the current iteration for so long , but things will improve soon .
The above overview was n't an exhaustive list of changes over the past week ( integration with GitHub search api , minor DjangoCodeSearch integration , Findjango became an autodiscoverable search engine in Firefox , and so on ) , but hopefully it gives some reassurance that Findjango is moving in a good direction , and evolving towards a useful solution .
As always , feedback is welcome .
Four people died Thursday after two semi- trailer trucks were involved in a head - on collision on the Trans - Canada Hwy .
east of Chilliwack , B.C.
A compact car was also caught in the collision .
The deceased included the two truck drivers and two people who were travelling in the car .
The collision occurred on the Trans - Canada near Annis Road in the eastbound lanes at about 2:20 p.m .
Police say a semi truck was travelling westbound , when it crossed the median into the east bound lanes .
It collided with a small car and then the semi which tried to brake but could n't .
The collision disrupted traffic which was diverted at Prest Road west of the accident .
After being closed for much of the day , the Trans - Canada 's westbound lanes between Prest Road and Annis Road reopened at 10:00 p.m. Thursday .
Eastbound traffic was expected to be flowing again by 1:00 a.m. Friday morning .
Robert MacMullan witnessed the carnage after he heard a horrible noise from his office near Highway One and Annis Road .
" I heard a large crash and I immediately looked out on the highway and saw a large puff of smoke , '' he said .
" The smoke was very black , very heavy , very thick .
Lots of flames , so I immediately jumped in my truck and ran down to see what I could do . "
But there was little he could do .
Both trailers were completely engulfed and gone .
The small car was completely demolished .
" This is one of the worst accidents we 've seen in a while .
It 's very tragic , " said Fraser Valley RCMP Const .
Lea -Dunlop .
" All the people were dead when we arrived on the scene .
They likely died instantly . "

DuoGuo launches Conceptis Sudoku on casual game machines in China
Duo Guo , owner and operator of China 's network of retail stores exclusively selling mobile content and services , now provides mobile - phone Sudoku puzzles through kiosk machines across China .
The machines are set up in subway stations and other high traffic retail locations .
The gaming application is powered by G - mode while the puzzle content is provided by Conceptis .
Priced 8RMB ( approx . $ 1.2 US ) , each Duo Guo mobile game contains 40 Sudoku puzzles with difficulty levels ranging from ultra easy to very hard .
A human mobile - content service professional
Based in Shanghai , Duo Guo ( 多果 ) partners with China 's largest retailers and global media companies , providing games , ringtones , software and other mobile services to China 's 500 million mobile phone users in a unique retail setting which is not very common in western countries .
The mobile - content kiosks are normally located in high traffic retail locations such as subways , shopping malls , electronics stores , train stations and mobile phone stores .
At Duo Guo ’s kiosks , customers can surf for content on a touchscreen interface , allowing them to discover the newest content for their mobile devices and select their preferred games , music , wallpapers , videos , movies and other applications .
Yet , the operation is not entirely computerized as at every kiosk there is also a human mobile - content service professional who helps guiding the customer , give suggestions and completes the transfer process .
According to Jonathan Serbin , Chief Executive Officer of Duo Guo , the company plans to expand in the next year from its base in Shanghai throughout China , and into other territories in Asia .

The Western diplomat said that even if most of the bodyguards remained Blackwater veterans , there would be dramatic changes in their rules of engagement .
One former Marine Corps colonel who worked closely with Blackwater summed up the previous rules : “ No compassion for the locals who had to use the roads with the Blackwater vehicles or convoys , shoot if in doubt and keep driving , etc . ”
The new rules of engagement , the diplomat said , would require staff members to behave less aggressively .
They had already started to take effect , he added , with Blackwater escorts ordered to negotiate traffic courteously .
After Iraq refused to renew Blackwater ’s contract , the State Department awarded it to Triple Canopy , one of two other firms , including DynCorp , already doing some State Department security contracting in Iraq .
The five - year State Department contract , awarded March 31 , is worth $ 977 million and goes into effect May 7 .
That amount represents a large proportion of Blackwater ’s previous worldwide business .
American officials said replacing Blackwater from scratch in just over a month would be difficult .
The firm maintains a force of 600 armed men based in Baghdad ’s Green Zone to protect embassy and other United States government civilian employees .
Their work requires security clearances when they accompany diplomats on sensitive missions , involving lengthy background checks .
It is particularly difficult for non-Americans to get such clearances .
Blackwater also maintains a quick reaction force , and has a civilian air wing with helicopters , surveillance drones and other aircraft .
The contract for their air operations remains in force , expiring in September .
Although Triple Canopy is an American company , most of its Iraq - based employees are former members of the military from countries with low wage scales , like Peru and El Salvador , with a much lower level of training or expertise than Western employees , and little likelihood of getting security clearances .
Many American diplomats have defended Blackwater .
At least six American State Department employees have been killed since the occupation of Iraq , and Ms. Tyrell said that 27 Blackwater personnel members were killed defending their charges .
“ A certain number of our people are here today because Blackwater guards have been killed protecting them , ” said an official familiar with security arrangements for American diplomats , who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media .
The Iraqis now seem prepared to accept the prospect that many or even most of the former Blackwater employees will remain on the job as Triple Canopy employees .
“ It does n’t matter who they are , what their names are , or what uniform they wear , ” said Brig .
Gen. Abdul - Karim Khalaf , spokesman for the Iraqi Interior Ministry , “ as long as they are subject to Iraqi law and their company follows Iraqi laws . ”

Chief Strategist of No on 8 on the Decision Not to Share Open Letter From Obama : “ Maybe We Should Have ”
DUMBASSES —
Over the the weekend , San Francisco finally had its open town - hall forum where gays and lesbians had an opportunity to ask leaders of the No on 8 campaign what went wrong .
The event , which blogger Michael Petrelis had been demanding for months , comes nearly five months after Proposition 8 passed by a narrow ( and winnable ) margin of voters and after a series of town halls , conference calls and meetings with No on 8 leaders that have gone from blaming the opposition , to defiant justification of tactics , to admission of failure and in the case of one gay rights leader , the decision to never work on a marriage campaign again .
The big story is , however , is that even after all this time , we ’re still finding out new ways the No on 8 campaign screwed up big time .
Take for instance , the story of the No on 8 campaign and the open - letter from Barack Obama that clearly pointed out his support of gay rights that they never used .
You may remember that during the campaign , Barack Obama ’s position was muddled enough that the Yes on 8 campaign printed fliers with his image pointing out that he opposed gay marriage .
Which is why the nominee wrote an open letter to the Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club where he clearly stood up against Prop.
8 , saying :
“ I oppose the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the California Constitution , and similar efforts to amend the U.S. Constitution or those of other states .
For too long .
issues of LGBT rights have been exploited by those seeking to divide us .
It ’s time to move beyond polarization and live up to our founding promise of equality by treating all our citizens with dignity and respect .
This is no less than a core issue about who we are as Democrats and as Americans .
I want to congratulate all of you who have shown your love for each other by getting married these last few weeks . ”
What did the No on 8 campaign do with this letter ?
Nothing .
At the forum , hired campaign strategist Steve Smith admitted it was a boneheaded move ( emphasis ours ) :
Smith also acknowledged that the campaign should have used then - presidential candidate Barack Obama ’s stated opposition to Prop 8 .
Instead , little use was made of Obama ’s opposition in a letter last June to the Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club , and right before Election Day the Yes on 8 campaign sent out a mailer featuring Obama ’s image and quotes that he is opposed to same - sex marriage .
“ That was a close call , ” Smith said .
“ Maybe we should have . ”
You think ?
Kat Kendall , of the National Center for Lesbian Rights admitted , said that in the wake of the debacle , “ I ’m never going to be involved in another campaign . ”
Geoff Kors of Equality California acknowledges the decision to rely solely on an outside strategist was “ a huge mistake . ”
The angry SF crowd , urged on by Petrelis , all but called for their heads .
And why not ?
One of the things we ’ve done at Queerty since Prop.
8 is look at these leaders and give them the benefit of the doubt .
We ’ve listened to them explain the difficulty of running against a well - funded opponent in a ballot - initiative race they did not create .
The excuses — and I do n’t use that word lightly — range from a lack of funding to a lack of communication to a a lack of openness .
Some , like Kors and Kendall , have been forthcoming in the mistakes they made and have vowed to do better .
Others , like Lori Jean of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center , maintain they “ honestly do n’t know how they could have run a better campaign ” and angrily defy any inquiry in what went wrong in the campaign .
Other groups , like the Human Rights Campaign and the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force , both charged with field operations , have stood by silently escaping scrutiny , while more responsible leaders have taken then lion ’s share of the heat .
What possible reason does a gay , lesbian or transgender person have to donate a single dollar to any of them ?
I ca n’t think of one .
Can you ?
Word of the problem started spreading across blogs and Twitter on Sunday after Mark R. Probst , the author of “ The Filly , ” a gay western romance for young adults , posted on his blog that several gay romances , including his , had lost their sales rankings on Amazon .
Mr. Probst e-mailed Amazon and got a reply that said the company was excluding “ ‘ adult ’ material from appearing in some searches and best - seller lists . ”
In an interview on Monday , Mr. Probst said he was giving Amazon the benefit of the doubt .
“ I believe it was an error , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think it was anything malicious they were trying to do . ”
But other authors were unconvinced that the changes were caused by a simple glitch .
“ There are mistakes and there are mistakes , ” said Daniel Mendelsohn , an author whose memoir “ The Elusive Embrace ” lost its sales ranking over the weekend .
“ At some point in this process , which I do n’t understand because I ’m not a computer genius , the words gay and lesbian were clearly flagged , as well as some kind of porno tag .
I say , do I want my book in anyone ’s mind to be equivalent to a porno ?
And the answer is no . ”
Mr. Mendelsohn pointed out that books like “ American Psycho , ” a novel with sexually and violently explicit content , did not lose its sales rank .
He teamed up with others affected by the problem , including the playwright and author Larry Kramer , to start a petition to boycott Amazon .
As of Monday afternoon it had attracted more than 18,000 names .
Mr. Kramer said on Monday that he was willing to shelve the boycott for now .
But in an e-mail message he wrote : “ I do n’t think for one second that this was a glitch , ” adding , “ We have to now keep a more diligent eye on Amazon and how they handle the world ’s cultural heritage . ”

Several publishers whose books were affected , including Simon & Schuster , the Penguin Group USA and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , declined to comment .

Scott Horton - a professor at Columbia Law School and writer for Harper 's - says of the Bush administration memos authorizing torture , spying , indefinite detention without charge , the use of the military within the U.S. and the suspension of free speech and press rights :
We may not have realized it at the time , but in the period from late 2001 - January 19 , 2009 , this country was a dictatorship .
The constitutional rights we learned about in high school civics were suspended .
That was thanks to secret memos crafted deep inside the Justice Department that effectively trashed the Constitution .
What we know now is likely the least of it .
Yale law professor Jack Balkin agrees , writing that the memos promoted " reasoning which sought , in secret , to justify a theory of Presidential dictatorship . "
Horton is correct that " What we know now is likely the least of it . "
Just as with the economic crisis , we cannot change things - or even learn the full truth - unless we have the courage to ask the hard questions and to take appropriate actions to hold even the high and mighty to the rule of law .
And as constitutional experts have pointed out , Obama and Congress are complicit in crimes if they cover up and fail to prosecute .
For example , constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley said :
" There is an obvious level of collusion here .
We now know that Democratic leadership knew about the illegal surveillance program almost from its inception .
Even when they were campaigning about fighting for civil liberties , they were aware of an unlawful surveillance program as well as a torture program .
And ever since that came out , the Democrats have been silently trying to kill any effort to hold anyone accountable because that list could very well include some of their own members . "

Not only did a lot of us " realize it at the time " , but many in Congress and the judiciary knew as well .
Vuze , the BitTorrent client formerly known as Azureus , has just been released in a portable version .
Unlike the regular Vuze client , Vuze to Go is closed source and costs $ 9.99 .
No doubt a pirated version will end up on torrent sites sooner or later .
Over the past few months
Vuze has been implementing lots of changes and new features based on feedback from its active community .
In response to a recent survey where 72 % of Vuze users indicated they own a portable hard drive , the developers have now rolled out a portable version of their client , so that people can carry it around on a flash drive or external hard disk .
In order to get it to work on systems that do n’t have Java installed , Vuze to Go contains a virtual operating system in addition to the regular Vuze application .
Vuze teamed up with a company called Ceedo who developed the ‘ virtualization ’ technology .
This partnership does come with some downsides though .
First of all , the Vuze to Go client costs $ 9.99 , which is quite unusual for a BitTorrent client .
Vuze ’s Director of Marketing Chris
Thun told TorrentFreak that they were required to charge for the new application , and that the price tag was unavoidable .
“ We ’ve invested in creating a portable solution that has an entirely different ease - of - use relative to any other solution in the market .
We believe that if we ’re solving a real problem in an elegant way , our users will be willing to pay for it , ” he said .
Although TorrentFreak was assured that the core Vuze application will always remain free , one of the downsides of teaming up with Ceedo is that the portable version of Vuze is not open source like the main client .
“ The Vuze application bundled into Vuze To Go is still open source .
However , the Ceedo virtualization package is not open source , ” Thun explained to TorrentFreak .
A free trial of Vuze to Go is available for those who want to try it out .
It ’s pretty much identical to the regular client and it ran pretty smoothly in our tests .
uTorrent users who want to go portable do n’t need a separate application .
Among the revelations in Fortune magazine 's feature on our old friend Chairman Wang Chaun - Fu , founder and CEO of BYD Auto : he offered an American exec a glass of battery fluid .
Then he drank it himself .

We 're glad to see other publications take seriously a story we 've been reporting for over a year — since our first BYD test drive .
BYD received an investment from Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway and has already developed multiple hybrid and electric cars .
As a way of proving the non-toxicity of his newly - developed battery , the Chairman drank a glass of the electrolyte fluid from a battery in front of David Sokol , CEO of one of the largest utilities in the United States .
From the article :
When David Sokol toured BYD 's operations last summer , Wang took him to a battery factory and explained that BYD wants to make its batteries 100 % recyclable .
To that end , the company has developed a nontoxic electrolyte fluid .
To underscore the point , Wang poured battery fluid into a glass and drank it .
" Does n't taste good , " he said , making a face and offering a sip to Sokol .
Sokol declined politely .
But he got the message .
" His focus there was that if we 're going to help solve environmental problems , we can't create new environmental problems with our technology , " Sokol says .

It 's a good story and it indicates what we 've learned about Chaun - Fu : he believes in his product .
The rest of the story highlights some of the advantages the company faces and the challenges still ahead .

Today , the C - train was packed and I was stuck with a homeless man pressed up against me .
He was staring at me intently , and two minutes into the ride he got an erection , which was rubbed against me at every single bump and turn of the train .

This is a translation of my latest article ( original in French ) .
After my previous successes with Dell and Lenovo ( was IBM ) , I just finished a ( long ) process of reimbursement with the leading PC manufacturer : Hewlett - Packard .
Introduction
At the end of 2008 , I acquired two HP laptops for friends for whom I installed Ubuntu Linux .
As usual , the models of interest were not available without the operating system and pre-installed software .
First attempts
Upon reception of the first model , I called HP support for laptops where I was told to call support for HP professional laptops where they asked me to call customer service where they told me to call the sales department , this department then asked me to contact the claims department by e-mail because they could not help me !
After numerous e-mails and phone calls with the claims department , I had still not received the amount due in repayment of licenses for software that I did not agree with .
Worse , they told me they were not aware that a End User License Agreement ( EULA ) is displayed when you first start their PCs ( if this is not bad faith , I do n’t know what is ) and they asked me to send them a copy of the terms in question :
From : Jonathan Ernst
To : xxx.xx@hp.com
Subject : Attention Mr. S .
Date : Friday , 21 November 2008 Dear Sir ,
Thank you for your phone call .
Here are excerpts from your own license contract
displayed at startup of each computer running Windows
you sell : — — — — — —— ——
[ …]
If you do not accept the terms of the agreement , click the
button indicating your rejection and do not copy , download or
use the software in any way .
You can
get the full refund of unused software [… ]
— — — — —————
And here is the extract from the second license ( Microsoft Windows )
which is also displayed at startup : — — — — — —— ——
[ …]
Using the software , you accept these terms .
If you do not agree , do not use the software .
Contact the manufacturer or installer to determine their procedures for return of goods
to get your money back .
— — — — —————
I am surprised that HP does not know the existence of these
End User License Agreement ( EULA ) , since these licenses
are displayed on all your computers .
In addition , your company has already made several repayments ( willingly or
by force ) in the past .
You have been condemned last year in Italy
to pay 2300 euros ( 140 euros in software ) http://www.zdnet.fr/blogs/2007/10/29/hp-condamne-a-rembourser-un-microsoft-windows-en-italie/
I also invite you to educate yourself on this issue by visiting : http://www.racketware.info/
The software I want to get the refund for includes : – Microsoft Windows Vista Home Basic OEM
– WinDVD
– Roxio
– Mc Afee ( 2 months subscription )
– MS Office 2007 ready
Note that you can probably get repaid these amounts from the publishers of such software .
Yours sincerely
I then decided to start sending regular letters ( I sent an invoice for each computer , then , when expired , threats of prosecution ) .
I finally received a written response ( in English even though we had always communicated in French ) .
According to them , their return policy is in line with industry best practices ( even though I have pointed out repeatedly that their two biggest competitors had accessed to my previous requests , and that they had recently been convicted for similar facts in Italy ) .
Here is my answer :
From : Jonathan Ernst
To : xxx.xx@hp.com
Subject : Your letter
Date : Friday , 09 January 2009
Hello , I acknowledge receipt of your reply in English to my letter
in French ( you obviously have the resources to translate
the End User License Agreement that you do not respect
in French , but not enough to communicate with your clients
in the language in which they write and buy your products ) .
As explained in my previous request for refund ( for
which I am still waiting for the payment ) , I do n’t care about your
arguments .
First your refund policy is not in line with best industry practices as you write because IBM
and Dell , your two biggest competitors , have refunded software not used in a similar case after my previous
purchases : https://ernstfamily.ch/jonathan/tag/tax/
Second , even if it did , it does n’t matter because the EULA explicitly gives me the right to a refund in the event I do not
accept the terms of the license .
I remind you once again that you have recently been convicted in Italy on this subject :
http://www.zdnet.fr/blogs/2007/10/29/hp-condamne-a-rembourser-un-microsoft-windows-en-italie/
You can continue as long as you like to hide behind your legal department , but this wo n’t prevent me from , if you fail to
comply with my requests , prosecuting your management as stated in my last letter sent to your headquarters and Mr. P. and B .
You will also find attached to this e-mail a draft of the prosecution ( in french « requisition de poursuite » ) that I will send , if by the end of this month I do n’t have any satisfactory answer from you .
All rights reserved .
Legal proceedings against HP Switzerland and some members of its management
Hewlett - Packard Switzerland and several members of its management did not respond to my last notice before prosecution sent by registered letter ( sent to the address of the company and their personal addresses ) .
Therefore I sent the legal proceedings form to the competent offices .
Finally a response !
In February 2009 ( two months after the last notice before prosecution ) my debtors received their payment order from the legal proceedings office .
Mr B. , manager of HP Switzerland finally granted me with an e-mail ( this shows how far you have to go to make those companies reply to your letters ) :
From : Mr B. < xxx@hp.com >
To : Jonathan Ernst
Cc : yyy@hp.com
Subject : Legal proceedings
Date : Wednesday , 19 February 2009 17:28:29
Sir , Referring to your letter of 17 December 2008 and your payment order ( No. xxxxxx ) that I received this week , I state my opposition .
I respect the fact that you insist on your rights as a principle , which is quite legitimate .
However , I did personally never sell or charge any HP product and I condone the fact that you took legal action against me on a private level for a refund of software licenses pre-installed on HP products .
However , I can confirm that the accounting department will pay you tomorrow an amount of CHF 600 on your account XX - XXXXXX - X to cover your expenses .
Therefore , we urge you to withdraw the prosecution against Mr P. and Mr B .
I leave you to your opinions and your principles , as well as your undignified pride to have recovered the license fees charged for our HP products , and for the fees you also racked « willingly or by force » from other manufacturers such as Dell , Lenovo and IBM to use your own quotations .
Sincerely yours , Mr. B .
The man almost made me shed a tear , here is my answer after having received the promised sum :

Furthermore , I find it somewhat inappropriate to play the surprise and indignation when you acknowledge yourself earlier to have been informed of my approach by registered letter in December .
Perhaps you could have taken the necessary actions to avoid this situation at that time ?
As a manager you will certainly ensure that the various telephone services from Hewlett Packard in Switzerland and your company ’s complaint service are more aware of your customers rights so that this situation never happens again .
I am also at your disposal if you want to learn more about the real uphill battle that forced me to take this kind of actions .
It is clear to me that the current policy ( ignoring letters , claiming that the licensing contracts do not exist , etc.. ) of your
company is intended to discourage customers from exercising their rights which is unacceptable for a company like yours .
Therefore , I will not hesitate to assist any interested person to assert their rights as long as a simple and transparent refund process ( or , better yet , a purchasing process that does not force the tying ) is not implemented by manufacturers of personal computers .

These fees are in no way « racked » to manufacturers as you seem to think .
It is simply a reimbursement proposed by the
publishers of the software when the accompanying license agreement is not accepted by the end user .
Therefore it does not cost anything to the manufacturers that you mention .
Of course , if , on your side , you do not want to make the necessary arrangement to be refunded from your vendors , that is your problem .
As for my pride , please note that this was solely done because of principles and not to get money .
To enforce my rights and not pay 20 - 30 % of the price of a computer for software I do not intend to use .
Who knows , one day you may allow your customers to choose the software they want pre-installed ( opt - in instead of opt - out ) on your computers and make this whole process and the inconvenience caused by it to manufacturers and their customers unnecessary .
Best regards .
Conclusion
This time , I really thought that Hewlett - Packard was going to turn a deaf ear until the court .
Nevertheless , as it had already been the case with one of my first experiences on the subject , the threat ( in the case of Dell ) or the actual stake in pursuits again provoked a reaction and in forced the debtors to pay off to me what was due to me .
It is unfortunate to notice how difficult it is to assert ones ’ rights in IT tax removal .
I dare to hope that this kind of initiatives as well as those relayed by the project « detaxe » from swisslinux , the racketiciel .
info site at the French level and racketware .
info at the international level , will allow everyone not to pay pointless expenses of licenses for software of no use ( whether they do not wish to use them , or because they already possess them ) whatever their choice of equipment .
A clear display of the prices of this » inclusive software » as well as their optionality would be to the advantage of the consumers and the computers makers .
In order to multiplicate these procedures and to encourage the makers to change their dishonest practices , do not hesitate to let know your procedures ( successful or not ) against these groups quoted previously as well as to request for coaching .

Larry Summers , who was not only Tim Geithner 's predecessor as the 71st Secretary of the Treasury ( from 1999 to 2001 ) , but also the 27th President of Harvard University , and is currently the top White House economic advisor and serves as a director of the National Economic Council , apparently has a fond place in his heart and bank account for his most recent employer , $ 30 billion rocket scientist infested hedge fund D. E. Shaw ( nothing like signing an NDA before conducting interviews ) .
In a financial disclosure just released by the White House , Larry highlights that not only was he paid $ 2 million in 2008 from 40 speaking assignments , including speeches paid for by Goldman Sachs and Yale University , but , more notably , received $ 5.2 million in compensation from D.E. Shaw - one of the funds eligible and likely to participate in the PPIP and TALF .
Summers joined DE Shaw on October 19 , 2006 as a managing director of the investment and technology department .
Larry has recently been in hot water , for not only preaching Friedmanomics ( quoted as saying Friedman 's real contribution was " convincing people in the importance of allowing free markets to operate " ) as his administration is currently doing away with Mark To Market and covertly nationalizing the major banks , but also for accepting perks from Citigroup such as free rides on its corporate jet , for telling Chris Dodd to do away with executive pay caps at TARP recipient banks , and for sending Paul Volcker an imaginary memo entitled " stuff it .
" The full financial disclosure document is attached below .
One curious thing to note is that either Larry was drunk or high when he signed it , or else this document is counterfeit , based on the signature for " L.H.S " which is obviously not that of Larry Summers .
For comparison I present Larry 's signature in the disclosure document : with his omnipresent signature from his Treasury Secretary days ( check out the signature in the bottom right of any 9 year old dollar bill in your back pocket ) .
Regardless of this particular conspiracy theory , ZH will be closely following any and all preferential treatment that DE Shaw ( and the entire hedge fund industry in general ) receives going forward compliments of Mr. Summers and the Obama administration .
An apparent organized flexing of Second Amendment rights last weekend was a bit too Wild West for some local citizens and business owners .
Police and deputies responded to a number of complaints about citizens packing sidearms at restaurants , stores and other public areas .
None of the gun carriers was cited .
Michigan 's 2001 shall - issue concealed weapons law greatly increased the number of citizens packing handguns .
The public , however , does not notice the guns because they are hidden under clothing .
But a shopper with a handgun on his hip in Target is another matter .
Security officers followed the man Saturday and contacted city police .
" One of our officers had contact with the man in the parking lot , and that was the end of it , " Lt. Christopher Simpson said .
" He was carrying legally . "
Blackman Township officers responded to reports of a diner with a handgun in a hip holster at Bob Evans Restaurant on West Avenue , and another with a visible sidearm at Wal - Mart on E. Michigan Avenue .
" We verified they were legitimate side carries , " Blackman Township Public Safety Director Jon Johnston said .
While the appearance of citizens carrying weapons is unsettling to some , it also is an expression of freedom .
" Sometimes it is a matter of educating the public that this is a constitutional right , " Johnston said .
" We do not take enforcement action against those who obey the law . "
Sheriff 's deputies , meanwhile , were called to Vandercook Lake to check out two suspicious males , each carrying a handgun on his side .
It was a father and son , and the father also was packing two concealed handguns , sheriff 's Capt .
Kevin Stellingworth said .
The father has a concealed - weapons permit .
Stellingworth and Undersheriff Thomas Finco said that citizens who exercise the right to carry guns openly should realize it alarms the public and police .
" It hypes people up to see someone carrying a gun , " Finco said .
" What people do n't realize is it is perfectly legal . "
Aside from designated pistol - free areas , such as schools , bars , stadiums , churches and hospitals , most public and private areas in Michigan are open to both concealed weapons and open sidearms .
Stellingworth said law officers and business owners cannot become complacent regarding citizens showing weapons .
Because more citizens are choosing to carry weapons in public , police trainers are addressing that by incorporating scenarios in which officers approach those who could be exercising a right , or are up to no good .
One day after iTunes upped the prices for some of its DRM - free digital downloads to $ 1.29 , Amazon and Wal - Mart have also increased their prices .
That was fast .
One day after iTunes upped the price for some of its DRM - free digital downloads to $ 1.29 , Amazon.com and Wal - Mart have also increased their prices to $ 1.29 and $ 1.24 , respectively .
Of the top 100 MP3 downloads currently listed on Amazon.com , eight of them are now priced at $ 1.29 , up from 99 cents .
Those include selections from Jamie Foxx , Beyonce , Britney Spears , Kings of Leon , Brad Paisley , Journey , and The Fray .
Other Amazon tracks are available for 79 cents and 89 cents .
" As with any product on Amazon.com , product pricing is subject to change , " an Amazon spokeswoman said in an e-mail .
" At Amazon.com we are continually working to bring value to our customers , through low pricing , selection , and convenience . "
On Wal - Mart 's MP3 store , 17 of the top 100 are now priced at $ 1.24 .
They also include songs from Britney Spears , Beyonce , Brad Paisley , and Jamie Foxx , as well as Kelly Clarkson , Pink , Carrie Underwood , and Leona Lewis .
Wal - Mart previously priced most of its songs at 94 cents , but there are now selections available at 64 cents .
Apple on Tuesday started selling tracks without copyright protection , or digital rights management ( DRM ) .
They also introduced tiered pricing  99 cents for standard tracks , $ 1.29 for premium , popular songs , and 69 cents for older , less popular songs .
Amazon and Wal - Mart made no obvious mention of the price hikes on their Web sites .

This one will be a short one – as many of you know , I ’m currently at SXSW .
It ’s awesome and intimidating and overwhelming all at once .
One of the panels I went to the other day was “ Try Making Yourself More Interesting , ” moderated by Brian Oberkirch .
In his discussion about how to make yourself more interesting , he presented the following , easy guidance :
Do Epic Shit
Many of us are n’t doing epic shit because we think we ’re not big enough to do it .
Or that it ’s better to start with something small and that smallness defines our ambition indefinitely .
Or that epic shit is stuff that epic people do .
Wrong .
Everyday people do epic shit and then become epic .
They were n’t born that way .
Okay , so you may not like “ Do Epic Shit ” as a mantra .
You might prefer to think along the lines of “ Create Something Remarkable ” a la Seth .
They ’re saying the same thing , though .
What are you doing that ’s epic ?
Why is it worth talking about ?
Why should other people care ?
Rather than do something small and work like hell to build a story around it , do epic shit and let it speak for itself .
( Tweet this . )
Need some help getting your epic shit done ?
Join us for our Monthly Momentum Calls on the first Monday of every month .
We ’ll give you the structured time and support you need to ask some questions and start finishing the stuff that actually matters .
Sometimes I wonder if I am dreaming .
Virtually all of us have been affected by the economic crisis that has gripped the world , so no one can really claim to be uniquely impacted above and beyond others , although to each their own circumstance no doubt feels unique .
There are tried and true solutions that historically have lead to economic growth and prosperity , so the fact that our leaders seem more interested in pursuing strategies that would be first time successes even if they do work , because there is no historical evidence to suggest that spending more , printing money and increasing the size of government will do anything other than make things worse .
You cannot borrow and spend your way out of debt .
It was Daniel Hannan , a previously unknown member of the European Union Parliament , who best summed this up in a YouTube clip that has been viewed more than 2.2 million times .
Yet we continue to borrow and spend , and now U.S. taxpayers are being asked to give away $ 448 million to other countries to help citizens of those countries hit by the economic downturn , including $ 100 million for small business and entrepreneurs in Latin America , according to Bloomberg.com .
Mr. Obama , if you want to assist small business and entrepreneurs there are plenty here in the United States that could use a helping hand .
And , by the way , the best thing you could do would be to come up with a national technology policy to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. , and you can start with fixing the United States Patent and Trademark Office !
During his opening remarks at the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad , President Barack Obama said :
We ’re also committed to combating inequality and creating prosperity from the bottom up .
This is something that I ’ve spoken about in the United States , and it ’s something that I believe applies across the region .
I ’ve asked Congress for $ 448 million in immediate assistance for those who have been hit hardest by the crisis beyond our borders .
And today , I ’m pleased to announce a new Microfinance Growth Fund for the hemisphere that can restart the lending that can power businesses and entrepreneurs in each and every country that ’s represented here .
This is not charity .
Let me be clear :
This is not charity .
Together , we can create a broader foundation of prosperity that builds new markets and powers new growth for all peoples in the hemisphere , because our economies are intertwined .
I am all for helping small businesses and entrepreneurs , and I am not naive enough to miss the reality that the global economy is intertwined , but at what point in time are we actually going to do something that is calculated to succeed ?
At what point in time do we focus on fixing our own problems ?
President Obama and his supporters seem fond of saying that he , and they , can focus on more than one thing at time .
That is no doubt quite helpful , but can we possibly limit ourselves to maybe the top 10 , 20 or even 100 things that need to be fixed before we move on ?
I will speak only for myself , but Mr. President , helping small businesses and entrepreneurs in Latin American is not in my opinion in the top 10 , 20 , 100 or even the top 1,000 things to focus on .
This is our tax money , and if helping small businesses and entrepreneurs is so important ( which it is ) then we should spend that money on American small business and American entrepreneurs in the United States of America !
When I heard this part of Obama ’s speech earlier today I had a wave of emotion run through my body .
I do n’t know whether it was a panic attack , an adrenaline surge , complete and total disbelief , or resignation .
What I do know is that it is becoming nearly criminal for our leaders to ignore the real problem facing us .
First , the housing market caused this economic crisis so why not spend some time trying to focus on that !
Second , innovation , technology and entrepreneurship can lead us out of this horrible mess , just like it always does whenever we face a recession .
Since I bought a house , sold a house and bought another house all during this horrible downturn I think it is safe to say that I am not a housing expert , so allow me to focus on that which I do know .
I have been writing for many months that a coherent plan to revitalize the United States Patent Office would pay tremendous dividends and pave the way to economic growth and high paying jobs .
Which part of this is difficult to understand ?
I am more than happy to t.a.l.k… s.l.o.w.e.r… if that will help , but for crying out loud , can we focus on solutions that have a chance at succeeding ?
Please !
I feel like I am traveling through another dimension en route to the land of the different , the bizarre and the unexplainable .
I realize that our leaders in Washington , D.C. are trying something different , perhaps even radical , but I just do n’t understand how spending more money is going to get us out of debt .
It seems pretty clear that spending more money is only going to get us into more debt .
Now , if we were investing that would be a different story altogether , but investing in Latin America just does n’t make any sense at all .
If we want to create economic growth then why not actually do it in a way that creates wealth , rather than in a way that creates debt ?
Sounds logical to me .
The best investment that could ever be made would be an investment that costs nothing ( or next to nothing ) , creates wealth and causes investors to jump into the market and take money off the sidelines .
But whatever could that vehicle of growth be ?
Hhhhmmmm ….
it is on the tip of my tongue …
Oh… yes … of course …
The Patent Office could actually issue patents rather than deny them !
The Patent Office could actually follow the law , which says that inventors are presumed to be entitled to a patent unless the examiner can find a good reason why not to issue the patent .
See , the answer has been here all along .
When you apply for a patent you need to file what is called a “ patent application . ”
That application presently sits there without being read or even looked at for at least a couple years , unless your innovation relates to something particularly important like telecommunications , computers , software , the Internet , complex electronics and green technologies .
In those cases your application will sit there for longer , all without ever being looked at by anyone .
Then an examiner might get around to it at some point , and will probably ultimately reject the claims and force you to file a continuation application of some kind , at which point the Director of the PTO will claim that you are a part of the problem .
Why not try something radical , like issuing patents .
Lets open a Patent Granting Authority and call it the United States Patent Office !
Intellectual property is unique .
It is intangible because there is nothing there that can be touched .
The rights exist simply because the government says they exist , so if the government , namely President Obama , wants more things patented all he has to do is say the word and order the Patent Office to up the allowance rate .
If that were to occur more independent inventors , entrepreneurs , small businesses , corporations and Fortune 500 companies would obtain more assets .
Since these assets have “ value ” that would also increase the balance sheet and make the companies more “ valuable . ”
It would also allow inventors , entrepreneurs and small businesses to “ value ” their innovations higher , creating “ value . ”
This created “ value , ” which exists simply because the Patent Office issued a patent , all at no cost to taxpayers , then is attractive to investors who would “ invest ” start - up businesses and small businesses alike .
This would cause some of the $ 9 to $ 10 trillion that is sitting idle in cash reserves in the U.S. to come out of hiding in hopes of getting in on the ground floor of what could be the next big thing .
Did I go slow enough ?
The beauty of this type of revitalization of the U.S. patent system is that it costs nothing to tax payers .
We do n’t have to bail out another company , or industry , or send $ 100 million to Latin America .
The U.S. patent system is funded by users who pay fees both to apply for a patent and to keep a patent in good standing once it has issued .
So if the Patent Office actually starts granting patents it is easy to predict that research and development spending will increase , patent applications will go up and assets that create value will become more plentiful .
Easy enough , right ?
Unfortunately no .
The reason we are in this mess is because U.S. Presidents have not really understood that the Patent Office was an important post .
It is not a position where you put a political hack , but rather it needs to be filled by someone who really understands the patent system .
Luckily , it seems that President Obama is considering folks who have patent experience , which is definitely a step in the right direction .
I just hope that there are no hidden agendas or biases and the person appointed actually wants to issue patents .
So while it would be nice to have someone with patent experience , it would be even better to have someone on the acquisition of patent rights end of the curve .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A prominent U.S. senator backtracked on comments that American International Group Inc executives might consider suicide , but he still wants them to apologize for ruining the giant insurer .
Senator Charles Grassley , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , said on Monday that AIG executives should perhaps “ resign or go commit suicide , ” adopting what he called a Japanese approach to taking responsibility for their actions .
In a Tuesday conference call with reporters , Grassley retreated from those comments , but urged the executives to express regret , and perhaps to resign .
AIG is under fire for paying out $ 165 million of bonuses despite a series of taxpayer bailouts for the company totaling $ 180 billion .
Some of the bonuses went to people at the AIG unit principally responsible for the insurer ’s distress .
“ What I ’m expressing here , obviously , is not that I want people to commit suicide , ” Grassley said on Tuesday .
“ But I do feel very strongly that we have not had statements of apology , statements of remorse , statements of contrition on the part of CEOs of manufacturing companies or banks or financial services or insurance companies that are asking for bailouts , that they understand that they are responsible for running their corporation into the ground . ”
On Monday , in an interview with a radio station in his home state of Iowa , Grassley fired a gibe at AIG executives , saying they might “ follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say , I ’m sorry , and then either do one of two things : resign or go commit suicide . ”
AIG called those comments “ very disappointing . ”
President Barack Obama on Monday expressed “ outrage ” about the AIG bonuses , and lawmakers in Congress on Tuesday called either for AIG to be sued to recover the bonuses , or for the government to levy hefty taxes on bonus recipients .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , meanwhile , in a letter to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , said 73 AIG employees received bonuses of $ 1 million or more in 2008 , with the top recipient getting $ 6.4 million .
Grassley on Tuesday said U.S. executives might adopt practices of Japanese business leaders in admitting mistakes .
“ Japanese CEOs either go out and commit suicide , and probably in most cases they do n’t , and when they do n’t they come before the public and bow very , very deeply , and express regret , and may resign or may stay on , but the point is they accept full responsibility , ” he said .
“ I have n’t heard this from the CEOs . ”
Rep. Jerry Lewis ( R - Calif ) said the omnibus legislation “ includes several controversial policy items that have not been properly scrutinized or debated by Congress . ”
House passes $ 410 billion spending bill
The House has passed a $ 410 billion spending package on a largely party line vote , sending the delayed appropriations package to the Senate despite Republican complaints about having no say in crafting the legislation .
The vote was 245 - 178 , with 20 Democrats voting “ no ” while 16 Republicans voted in favor of the bill .
The great majority of Republicans voted against the spending package in a continued show of party unity after the GOP rallied en masse against the $ 787 billions stimulus that was signed into law last week .

Covering more than a dozen Cabinet departments , the omnibus spending bill adds another $ 20.5 billion to last year ’s domestic spending requests for the current fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 .
Overall , the 2009 spending bills represent a 6.7 percent increase over 2008 .
Republicans complained about both earmarks and the fact that they had little influence in crafting the legislation .
“ The omnibus legislation also includes several controversial policy items that have not been properly scrutinized or debated by Congress or the public , ” said Rep. Jerry Lewis ( R - Calif . ) , the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee .
“ In fact , the vast majority of members of Congress have little – if any – opportunity to shape this legislation .
The bill was released for viewing on Monday , did not go through Committee , and was brought to the House floor under a procedure that prohibited amendments . ”
Watchdog groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense have also pointed out more than 8,500 earmarks – for both Republicans and Democrats – in the omnibus .
But beyond the raw numbers , the package has some real policy changes that signal a break from the Bush administration , including loosening travel rules to Cuba , overturning limits on certain family planning funds in foreign aid , prohibiting Mexican - licensed trucks from operating outside of commercial border zones and changing D.C. charter school policy .
The spending bill will also freeze congressional salaries , which will be $ 174,000 for 2009 .
Case Study : How I Used Twitter to Generate 35,967 Extra Hits to my Site in Just 14 Days
Even with Twitter ’s immense popularity and quickly growing user base , there are still quite a few naysayers and skeptics of the social networking site .
For example , I still hear that “ it ’s a waste of time with nothing but useless chatter . ”
Blah blah blah .
Sure Twitter can be a big time sink with little income and traffic potential , but that ’s only if you let it be or you do n’t know how to utilize it efficiently .
Today , I ’m going to show you a case study from my own personal experiences of how I leveraged Twitter to send boatloads of viral traffic to my site – 35,967 pageviews in 2 weeks to be exact .
I ’ll include real evidence straight from my analytics that clearly displays the undeniable truth .
That ought to silence the critics .
Twitter is a serious social media tool that should be on the same level as giants like Digg , Delicious , and Reddit ( if not higher ) .
If you ’re not using it as a part of your social campaigns , you ’re missing out on a ton of traffic .
Now here ’s what I did …
Content development strategy – what to write about ?
When news broke out that Twitter implemented a search feature , there was much controversy on the role it would play in the search industry .
Would Twitter be a Google killer ?
A supplement ?
A fad ?
There was heated debate on both sides of the argument and that ’s when I knew I had a great post idea on my hands .
The news was still fresh so I was able to capitalize on the controversy and add fuel to the fire .
My article was born : 6 Reasons Why Twitter is the Future of Search – Google Beware .
What better way to go viral on Twitter than to stir up controversy about Twitter itself ?
Seeding the articles , getting initial exposure
Ok , so I had my Twitter piece ready to go and I knew it had the potential to do well on the social networks .
The problem was that I could n’t just let it sit and expect people to pick it up and share it .
I had to be proactive and tell them about it .
So what did I do ?
I talked to a bunch of friends online and asked them to share it on Twitter ( via re-tweet ) and promoted it on social networks like Digg , Reddit , and Sphinn .
Ah , more eyeballs … on the right track .
A crucial step that paid huge dividends for me in this effort was the implementation of the Tweet This WordPress plugin .
Basically what it does is automatically append a re-tweet Twitter link at the end of all posts ( complete with a shortened URL ) .
The results were very surprising and readers used the link a lot more than I thought they would .
I recommend everyone install the plugin and test it out .
You can see an example at the end of this post ( completely automated ) .
Mild success and followup
After my initial promotion , the article saw pretty good success .
It reached hot status on Sphinn and received a good amount of traffic in just a couple days through sharing on social networking sites .
I decided to write a followup article , Twitter SEO – How to Optimize Your Website For Twitter Search , which saw even better results and traffic using the same strategy .
After a week , both of my Twitter articles slowed down quite a bit in terms of traffic and re-tweets .
I thought that that was the end of the run , and to be honest with you I would have been perfectly fine with the results .
I definitely did n’t expect what was to come …
Viral traffic explosion
Now for the fun part – which will show you the explosive nature of Twitter .
About 10 days after publishing my 6 Reasons Why Twitter is the Future of Search post , Michael Arrington of TechCrunch ( 335,604 followers ) tweeted out the link and that opened up the floodgates .
Pete Cashmore of Mashable ( 368,239 followers ) did the same and the link was then re-tweeted over 700 times more by people who found the article interesting .
The article was featured on the front page of Twitturly as one of the most re-tweeted links and was placed on the popular pages of both Delicious and popurls .
Not only that but the success on Twitter led to the link also being shared on many other social sites like Facebook , Linked In , Friendfeed , and more .
That day the article received 9,946 pageviews and 6,179 the next .
In fact , all of the simultaneous database requests crashed my server several times during the spike ( teaches me to leave my cache plugin activated ) .
What a rush .
The awesome thing about it is that I ’m still seeing re-tweets of the article to this day , more than 3 weeks later .

Important Lessons Learned
I need you to understand that I ’m not sharing these results to brag or anything like that .
In fact , these stats are miniscule compared to the enormous viral campaigns some of the best social media gurus have pulled off .
Rather , I hope that through this small case study you ’re able to better use Twitter as another social media channel to send viral traffic to your sites .
Learn anything new ?
I know I have .
Here are some of my key findings I discovered through this experience .
Get the right people to notice you .
Power tweeps with hundreds of thousands of followers will send you a ton of traffic .
Remember that 20 % of re-tweets send 80 % of the traffic ( probably closer to 10 - 90 in this case ) .
Re-tweets are extremely important on Twitter and could lead to a gigantic snowball effect .
Be sure to install the Tweet This WordPress plugin to make it easy for your readers to re-tweet your links .
Use Twitter to jump start sharing on other social media sites .
As I discovered in this case study , popularity on Twitter easily translates to viral sharing on other sites like Facebook , Digg , Delicious , Reddit , StumbleUpon , etc .
Never give up on your social marketing campaigns .
If you truly believe you have a great idea that ’s worth sharing , keep going at it .

Fraud on the Internet reported to U.S. authorities increased by 33 percent last year , rising for the first time in three years , and is surging this year as the recession deepens , federal authorities said on Monday .
BOSTON - Fraud on the Internet reported to U.S. authorities increased by 33 percent last year , rising for the first time in three years , and is surging this year as the recession deepens , federal authorities said on Monday .
Internet fraud losses reported in the United States reached a record high $ 264.6 million in 2008 , according to a report released on Monday from the Internet Fraud Complaint Center , run by the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center .
Online scams originating from across the globemostly from the United States , Canada , Britain , Nigeria and Chinaare gathering steam this year with a nearly 50 percent increase in complaints reported to U.S. authorities in March alone .
" 2009 is shaping up to be a very busy year in terms of cyber - crime , " the report 's author , John Kane , told reporters in a telephone briefing .
Last year 's losses compared with $ 239.1 million in 2007 and dwarfs the $ 18 million of losses of 2001 .
The most common complaint of 2008 was non-delivery of promised merchandise , followed by auction fraud , credit card fraud and investment scams , according to the report .
Of 275,284 complaints received by the center in 2008 , some 72,940 were referred to U.S. law enforcement agencies for prosecution .
Those referrals spiked this year with 40,000 in the first quarter alone , said Kane .
" It is our belief that these numbers , both the complaints filed and the dollars , represent just a small tip of the iceberg , " said Kane , managing director of the National White Collar Crime Center in Richmond , Virginia .
UNDERREPORTED CRIME
" Our own research suggests that as few as 15 percent of cases of cyber - fraud are being reported to crime control agencies , " he said .
Scammers in the United States comprised 66 percent of complaints referred to authorities , followed by Britain at 11 percent , Nigeria 7.5 percent , Canada 3 percent and China 1.6 percent .
Within the United States , the bulk originated in California ( 16 percent ) , followed by New York and Florida .
Fraudulent sales on online auction sites like eBay Inc and classified sites like craigslist.com contributed to a 32 percent rise in the hottest area of online fraud non - delivery of promised merchandise , the report said .
That area alone made up about 33 percent of all complaints serious enough to be referred to law enforcement .
Other important areas included investment scams such as mini-versions of the $ 65 billion Ponzi scheme committed by New York financier Bernard Madoff in which money from new investors is used to pay existing investors .
About 74 percent of the scams were through e-mail messages last year , especially spam , while about 29 percent used websites .
But criminals were increasingly tapping new technologies such as social networking sites and instant messenger services , said Kane .
The report highlights one new " significant ' identity - theft scam involving e-mail messages that give the appearance of originating from the FBI but seek bank account information to help in investigations of money being transferred to Nigeria .
Recipients of the e-mails are told they could be richly rewarded by cooperating .
The report said almost 80 percent of known perpetrators of online scams are male .
Of those bringing complaints , nearly half are between the ages of 30 and 50 .
The median dollar loss was $ 931 per complaint , although the median losses for check fraud reached $ 3,000 and that for investment scams was $ 2,000 .

The independent Lord of the Rings prequel that has swept the internet with more than 1.5 million views in the first five months .
Haaretz published five T - shirt designs including this of a pregnant woman Israeli officials have described as " tasteless " and inconsistent with army values a popular military pastime of printing violent cartoons on T - shirts .
An investigation in Haaretz daily says the customised shirts are often ordered when troops finish training courses .
One example shows a pregnant Arab women in the cross -hairs of a sniper 's sight with the legend " 1 shot 2 kills " .
Another design shows a child being similarly targeted with the slogan " the smaller they are , the harder it is " .
In both images the people being targeted appear to be carrying weapons .
A third T - shirt design shows a dead Palestinian baby and the words " Better use Durex " ( condoms ) .
An army statement said the customised clothing was produced outside military auspices , but it pledged to stamp out the use of such imagery by soldiers .
" The examples presented by the Haaretz reporter are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless , " the military statement said .
" This type of humour is unbecoming and should be condemned . "
But it admitted that until now there were no military guidelines governing " acceptable civilian clothing " made by its soldiers .
' Callous attitude '
The Israeli military has faced heavy criticism for causing high levels of civilian casualties during its recent Gaza offensive .
The army frequently says it takes care to avoid civilian casualties and blames Palestinian militants for putting them in harm 's way .
Many Israeli combat troops deal with Palestinians in the occupied territories A sociologist quoted by Haaretz , Orna Sasson - Levy of Bar - Ilan University , warned the designs could strengthen , stimulate and legitimise aggression towards Palestinians in the occupied territories .
" There is ... increasing callousness , " she said .
" There is a perception that the Palestinian is not a person , a human being entitled to basic rights and therefore anything may be done to him . "
The Haaretz investigation discovered numerous T - shirts depicting violence against Palestinians and appearing to celebrate sexual assault .
Other designs appeared to bear witness to officially prohibited practices , such as " confirming the kill " ( shooting lifeless enemies ' bodies in the head to ensure they are dead ) , or deliberately harming religious sites and non-combatants .
The shirts are often printed up to mark the end of basic training and other military courses .
' Moral army '
The Tel Aviv clothing firm Adiv , which made many of the shirts , did not comment on the Haaretz report .
It prints up about 500 different patterns for military units each month , Haaretz says , mostly jokes about army life and " a handful reflecting particular aggressiveness , violence and vulgarity " .
On Monday , Israel 's chief of staff defended his troops against a rising tide of criticism .
" I tell you that this is a moral and ideological army , " Lt - Gen Gabi Ashkenazi said in a speech to new recruits .
" I have no doubt that exceptional events will be dealt with .
We took every measure possible to reduce harm to the innocent [ in Gaza ] . "
The Haaretz report says the T - shirts tend to be worn strictly in private or in barracks because of adverse civilian reactions and are seen by army psychologists as an expression of bonding within a small , tight - knit unit .
Last week several soldiers were quoted anonymously in the media saying troops had killed Palestinians , including women and children , by hastily opening fire under relaxed rules of engagement in Gaza .

LONDON , May 19 ( UPI ) -- British House of Commons Speaker Michael Martin announced Tuesday he was resigning in the face of a scandal over expense claims made by members of Parliament .
Martin , a Labor Party MP who was heavily criticized by all three major British parties for failing to deal effectively with the expenses scandal , told Parliament he would step down from the Speaker 's post next month , The New York Times reported .

" In order that unity can be maintained , I have decided that I will relinquish the office of speaker on Sunday , June 21 , " he said in a statement that offered no further details on his decision .
With the move , Martin , a former sheetmetal worker from Glasgow , Scotland , becomes the first House of Commons speaker to resign in more than 300 years .
His resignation marks the highest - level casualty in the scandal , in which MPs where shown to have accepted taxpayer reimbursement for such dubious claims as maintenance of their country estates .
Martin's authority to maintain decorum in the House was severely challenged Monday as heckling MPs ignored his calls to order and demanded his resignation .
In the 1970s the UK population was far slimmer than it is now Getting back to the relatively slim , trim days of the 1970s would help to tackle climate change , researchers say .
The rising numbers of people who are overweight and obese in the UK means the nation uses 19 % more food than 40 years ago , a study suggests .
That could equate to an extra 60 mega - tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year , the team calculated .
Transport costs of a fatter population were also included in the International Journal of Epidemiology study .
Dr Phil Edwards , study leader and researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said they had set out to calculate what the UK energy consumption would be if the weight of the population was put back a few decades .
Staying slim is good for health and for the environment
Dr Phil Edwards A " normal " adult population , where only 3.5 % are classed as obese , was compared with a population where 40 % are obese .
These populations reflect the proportions of overweight and obese people living in the UK in the 1970s - and what is predicted for the UK in 2010 , the researchers said .
In addition to calculating the increased food costs of the heavier population , the team worked out how much additional fuel would be needed for transportation of modern - day UK compared with the 1970s version .
Greenhouse gas emissions from food production and car travel in the fatter population would be between 0.4 to 1 giga - tonnes higher per 1bn people , they estimated .
Heavier
And people are generally bigger than they were three decades ago .
Between 1994 and 2004 , the average male body mass index ( BMI ) in England increased from 26 to 27.3 , with the average female BMI rising from 25.8 to 26.9 which equates to about 3 kg - or half a stone - heavier .
" This is not really just about obese people , the distribution of the whole population is what 's important , " said Dr Edwards .
" Everybody is getting a bit fatter . "
" Staying slim is good for health and for the environment .
" We need to be doing a lot more to reverse the global trend towards fatness , and recognise it as a key factor in the battle to reduce emissions and slow climate change . "
It is not just a UK issue - in nearly every country in the world , the average BMI is rising .
Professor Alan Maryon - Davis , president of the Faculty of Public Health said shifting the population weight distribution back to that of the 1970s would do quite a lot to help the planet .
" In the 1970s we had bigger portions of vegetables and smaller portions of meat and there 's been a shift in the amount of exercise we do .
" All these things are combining to hurt the planet and this is a calculation that deserves a bit more attention , " he said .

One of the FAQs of Xcode is “ Why is Save As… disabled for my project file ? ”
Or , put more bluntly , how do you duplicate or rename a project ?
It seems such an obvious omission in an ostensibly document - based Mac application .
The motivations to copy or rename a project are clear , but there are several different ones .
Some want to rename the project because Marketing picked a new product name , or because the project with a code name now has a real one .
Some want to archived finished project A and begin project B based on its skeleton .
Some want to fork project A into a new project A - prime to do parallel development .
And at the root is a fundamental confusion about the naming of three different things : your product , the target that builds it , and the project that contains them .
When you create a New Project from the template , Xcode only asks you for one name .
It uses that name in dozens of different places .
It creates a directory with that name to put everything in .
It creates a project file wrapper with that name as the basename .
It creates a target in the project file with that name .
It creates source code files in the project with that basename .
It creates auxiliary files , like Info - plists and prefix headers , with that name .
It sets the appropriate build settings in the target to point to the auxiliary files .
It sets the product name of the target to that name , which propagates to the executable name , to Info. plist settings , etc .
In some cases it even creates strings in source files , Info. plist files , and .nib or .xib files with that name , so they appear in your application ’s source code or user interface .
This is in many ways a trapdoor operation : one name fans out to many uses .
In some cases the relations are durable ( you change the name of the product , and the executable name follows ) ; in others , they ’re unlinked ( the target name , Info. plist file name , Prefix file build setting value , etc. are all independent ) .
So it ’s crucial to know beforehand what you want to change and why you want to change it , because you may not need to , or want to , change all occurrences of the original name .
For example , do you really want a different project or do you just want to change the name of the application that the project builds ?
You can do one , or the other , or both , but keep in mind that you can change the name of the build product ( the app that the project generates ) without changing the project ’s own name .
That ’s a lot easier in itself .
But let ’s walk through the steps of renaming or duplicating a project .
1 . Know the scope and reach of the project .
Most Xcode projects have a Project Folder ( MyProject ) containing a project file wrapper ( MyProject.xcodeproj ) and the files and directories for the source code .
( Often the build folder is in there too ; you can ignore it , perhaps Clean the project before starting to empty it out ) .
If your project has sources that are peer to the project folder , you will have to take some care to find the total extent of the project .
For example , you may have a MyProject folder , and inside it is a sources folder ( src ) , a documentation folder ( docs ) , and your Xcode project folder ( Mac ) .
The Mac/ MyProject.xcodeproj project file refers to ../src/MySourceFile.m to get to its source files .
You need to make sure that MyProject / contains all the parts of your project , and maybe more importantly , does n’t contain parts of other projects that would be damaged if you moved or renamed them .
2. Ensure the project ’s self - relative integrity .
It helps to make sure that the project does n’t have any embedded absolute paths .
Try dragging the whole project folder to another directory on the same disk .
If you can open it and nothing turns red , and you can build it , you ’re in good shape ; all your internal references are project - relative .
If anything turns red , select it , Get Info , find the appropriate file , make sure the Reference Style is Relative to Project ( Relative to Enclosing Group is usually good enough , and is the Default ) .
3. Copy and / or Rename the project folder and the project file .
Just do this in the Finder : change MyProject to MyNewProject and MyProject.xcodeproj to MyNewProject.xcodeproj .
There .
You ’re done .
No , you are n’t .
But that ’s the minimum : now you can build MyProject and MyNewProject , edit their source files separately , and their builds and indexes wo n’t interfere with each other .
But that ’s often not enough .
If you want MyApp.app to be MyNewApp.app , then you need to do a little more .
4 . If desired , change the Product Name in the main target ’s build settings .
Open the new project , double - click the main target , choose the Build pane , and type “ Product ” into the search bubble .
Enter the new app name into the Value column .
That changes the value of PRODUCT_NAME , which is used in a lot of places in the build :
the wrapper for the built app , $( PRODUCT_NAME ) .
app
the name of the executable inside the wrapper , $ ( PRODUCT_NAME ) .
app/$( EXECUTABLE_NAME )
the executable name in the product ’s Info. plist file
So in general you ’ll get a new app , and when you build MyProject and MyNewProject , you ’ll end up with MyApp and MyNewApp separately , even if you use a common build folder .
Remember that if you have hard - coded your bundle identifier ( com.myCompany.myApp ) into your source code anywhere , you need to change that in the source when you rename the Product Name .
5 . And change all the strings relating to the app name in the source and the .nib or .xib files .
If you ’ve changed your application name , you probably have references to it all over your source : in constant strings , in the Info. plist ’s Copyright string , in string files , and ( for Mac applications ) in the title of the second menu in the menu bar in the nib file , the name of the About … item , and the string in the About box .
You should remember to change all of these .
Xcode ’s Project Find can help find most of them .
6 . For completeness and to reduce confusion , rename source and auxiliary files .
If you ’re renaming from a code name to a final name , you may or may not want to keep the source files , class names , etc. as they are with the code name .
If you ’re spinning off a different project based on the old one ’s source code , you probably want to change them .
The Rename refactoring is your best friend here : select the class names and choose Refactor … and pick the Rename refactoring .
It will change all logical references to that class , and optionally change the file and header file names too .
What it wo n’t pick up is auxiliary files like MyApp - Info. plist .
You ’ll have to rename that manually , and make sure to also change the corresponding Info. plist File build setting in the target .
Same for export files , prefix files , or other non-source files referred to in your Target ’s build settings .
A note about Source Code Management
If your code is under the aegis of an SCM system like Subversion , Perforce , cvs , git , Mercurial , etc. you are going to have to manage the SCM effects of every change you make .
For Subversion , Perforce , and cvs , if your project is under SCM control in Xcode , file renames will be executed in the SCM system automatically , except for the renaming of the project file itself .
So in step 3 above , do the rename of the project folder and project file wrapper in the SCM system instead of the Finder , then you can do everything else in Xcode .
If you ’re using git or Mercurial , you probably know what you have to do .
If you are spinning off a new application , you should probably export the project from the SCM system first .
This ensures it ’s not carrying its SCM metadata with it .
( If you just do a Finder copy of MyProject / , rename it , make changes , and try to check it in , hilarity will ensue . )
If you want to branch the project so that it retains the SCM history to date , but allows you to conduct separate future development on both MyProject and MyNewProject , then you should use the branching tools offered by the SCM system .
So I hope you can see why there is n’t yet a Save As… button in Xcode that does what you mean .
What constitutes “ renaming ” or “ cloning ” may mean very different things to very different people , and depending on how thoroughly you ’ve embedded the old name in source , filenames , build settings , string constants , etc. you may have a lot of manual work to do in order to achieve the results you want .
Update :
This blog post was essentially the design spec for the Project >
Rename feature in Xcode 3.2 , now available in Snow Leopard .
When you choose Rename , you get a dialog box that previews all the above changes , and you check which ones you want applied .
Kudos to Kerry Hazelgren and Daniel Gobera for excellent implementation of this long - needed feature .

If you turned to the last two months ' headlines for a sense of what is happening to crime , you would probably spend the rest of your days looking over your shoulder for an incoming knife - wielding hoodlum .
But the latest annual crime statistics for England and Wales could not be clearer about national trends : offences are down yet again and we are in the longest ever recorded period of falling crime .
While we in the national media may have been highlighting brutal knife slayings , the reality for most parts of England and Wales is completely different .
The government relies on two officials measures to work out what is happening to crime : offences recorded by the police and the 47,000 - strong British Crime Survey ( BCS ) which captures experiences which do not always lead to a 999 call .
And the key to knowing if it is safe to walk the streets of Hackney lies in the relationship between these stats , flaws in the system , wider social or policing factors - and which newspaper you read .
Good news for government
The 2007 - 08 figures are generally good news .
Recorded crime is down 9 % to 5 m offences .
The number of the most serious violence crimes has fallen by 12 % .
Recorded drug offences are the only one of eight key measures to have significantly risen - up almost a fifth on the previous year .
Overall , the British Crime Survey says the rate of offending on the streets of England and Wales today is the lowest it has been since 1995 - the longest recorded period of falling crime .
Violence offences
The current key public concern has been a fear of knife - carrying and gun-toting gang members running the inner-city streets of Britain .
HOW MANY ATTACKED ?
WHAT VIOLENCE VICTIMS SAID One : 54 % of violent incidents Two : 13 % Three : 8 % Four plus : 25 % Source : BCS 2007 - 08
For the first time we have some proper figures on rates of knife crime - they were used in 6 % of all violent incidents .
To put that in perspective , bottles or glasses were used in 4 % of incidents and firearms in 1 % .
Overall , there were just over 22,000 crimes of attempted murder , GBH , and robbery involving knives or " sharp instruments " - that is one - in - five of all the offences in those categories .
Almost 40 % of serious wounding crimes and just over a third of all homicides involved a knife .
Gun crime is up 2 % and " all homicides " up 3 % .
More detailed research on what those rises mean will come later in the year .
Concern over knife crimes has been concentrated on a number of terrible deaths in a number of key inner cities , chiefly London .
The Metropolitan Police say that knife crime in the capital is down 16 % - 7,409 offences in all .
Fight night
But the majority of violent offences were committed by single young men - and the key factor behind that is booze .
CRIME FIGURES IN FULL Crime in England and Wales 2007/08 [ 1.8 Mb ]
Most computers will open PDF documents automatically , but you may need to download Adobe Acrobat Reader .
Download the reader here Almost one million acts of violence on the streets of England and Wales are thought to have been committed by people who were too drunk to stop themselves having a go at someone else .
So what this all comes down to is a difference between perception and reality .
We perceive there is a problem with youth gang crime - but the evidence suggests it may be more to do with delinquency , drunkenness and boredom .
The reality is that the real source of most violent crime remains Friday and Saturday nights .
Crime has been falling in almost every developed nation , regardless of the specific crime - busting approaches by different governments .
So while six out of 10 people think crime is rising nationally , the risk of being a victim is at its lowest level since the BCS began in 1981 .
The statisticians report goes on to note that those most likely to say crime has risen a lot are also most likely to read a tabloid .
And that 's a damning sideswipe at the media that ministers would never be prepared to make .
Economic prosperity has helped cut crime - there is a powerful argument that China 's cheap goods boom has meant it is not worth nicking a DVD player anymore .
But more importantly , police everywhere have far more sophisticated methods to solve crimes while homes and cars are far more secure than they were in the 1980s .
The question for policy - makers is whether these falls will be sustainable .
Research in the past has suggested that economic downturns lead to more property crime .
If we are on our way into the bad times this will be the figure to watch .

What are these ?
While the world 's Power Elite , known as the Bilderbergers , prepare to meet for their annual push for world governance on May 14 - 19 the corporate media propagandists provide their cover by flooding the airwaves with swine flu fears , the recovering / teetering stock market , torture , and other items that have been contrived by those same elitists in order to cover their true intentions .
One participant , Alice Rivlin , who has represented the Brookings Institute at Bilderberg , simply smiled and nodded when asked if the agenda this year includes a world without borders and an American Union .
One World Government has long been the goal of this group of elitists , coming from all parts of the globe , including the United States .
Bilderberg intends to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) throughout the Western Hemisphere as a prelude to establishing an American Union similar to the European Union .
Such entities strip the nations involved of their sovereignty and those nations involved in the European Union are now referred to as “ states ” .
The present Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) agreed to by Presidents Bush , Fox of Mexico , and Prime Minister Martin of Canada in 2005 without any Congressional approval or disapproval from any of the three nations , simply through a handshake of the three men .
Very little has been made known to the American people regarding this agreement which is expected to be entered into full - scale in 2010 .
A great deal of the areas have already been in place and may be a huge reason not much has been done regarding the illegal immigration which has been occurring since 2005 .
One of the goals of the SPP is to eliminate the internal borders of the three countries .
One of the advantages mentioned of such an arrangement is that it will make it more safe during times of influenza and pandemic flu .
Curious , how the present swine flu “ epidemic ” has the corporate media propagandists doing “ sixty miles an hour ” on their airwaves .
It is the guess of this writer the cooperation between the countries was a big reason for keeping the death toll down .
The recent monetary “ collapse ” will most likely lead to the Bilderberg group one government , one monetary system agenda .
Tim Geithner , Treasury Secretary , recently announced while addressing the Council on Foreign Relations that he supported a proposal to replace the dollar as the world 's reserve currency with a composite of currencies that would be managed by the International Monetary Fund .
Although both he and President Obama say they are opposed to the idea , he stated , “ We 're actually quite open to that . ”
As always , we will not hear much of what these elitists decide , but , unfortunately , we will experience in the future .
BRISBANE , Australia , March 14 ( UPI ) --
Authorities in Australia say a 230 - ton oil spill has caused an environmental disaster along nearly 40 miles of beach off the Queensland Coast .
The amount of oil leaked since Wednesday from a Hong Kong - register freighter is 10 times larger than shipping officials initially reported , said Allan Sutherland , the mayor of Moreton Bay .
Advertisement
The ship 's owners , Swire Shipping , failed to report the size of the spill , " hoping Mother Nature would take its course .
It did n't , " Sutherland said .
The oil from the Pacific Adventurer is endangering rare sea birds , dolphins , turtles and myriad other sea life in and around Moreton and Bribie Islands .
The ship was punctured in Brisbane 's port when 600 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in 31 metal containers fell overboard , hitting the hull , during Cyclone Hamish , the BBC said .
The toxic sludge created by the nitrate threatens marine habitats on the sea floor and could cause harmful algae blooms and suffocate fish for miles , the BBC reported Saturday .
" This is a very serious situation , " Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said Friday .

Sollten Sie in einem

Und der Typ , der sich dafür ausgibt , den können Sie vergessen .
Auf Umwegen dann doch wieder Ihre Titanic
Hallo , Clowns !
Daß Euch praktisch niemand lustig findet , ist ja beinahe eine Binse , und auch die Tatsache , daß Ihr ein » internationales Clownsparlament « unterhaltet und dafür ausgerechnet in Dresden tagt , der Hauptstadt eines Bundeslandes , in dem ausländische Gäste eher selten was zu lachen haben , ist kaum dazu geeignet , Euch zu rehabilitieren .
Aber als wir dann hörten , daß Ihr u.a .
Wim Wenders zum » Ehrenclown « ernannt habt , waren wir doch erstaunt :
So ganz witzlos seid Ihr dann offensichtlich doch nicht !
Die Clowns unter Tränen auf der Titanic
Bayern 2 !
Ist ja schon ein feiner Zug von Dir , daß
Du dem sympathischen Fußballrentner Mehmet Scholl eine Nebenbeschäftigung verschaffst und er bei Dir seine Lieblingsmusik in einer eigenen Radiosendung mit dem Titel » Mehmets Schollplatten « präsentieren darf .
Dürfen wir da auf eine Serie hoffen ?
Wie wär ’s mit südamerikanischen Rhythmen und » Zé - Ds von Zé Roberto « oder italienischem Liedgut und » Lucas Ton ( i ) trägern « ?
Und die Vorstellung hipper Chartzugänge unter » Bastis Neuschweinsteiger « sollte doch genauso drin sein wie Aznavour und MC Solaar unter » Francks Ribérhythmen « !

Marianne & Michael !
Anläßlich Eurer bevorstehenden Steinernen Hochzeit ( 67 1/2 Jahre ) antwortetet Ihr auf die Frage der Bild am Sonntag nach der sexuellen Situation so : Marianne : » Hmm . « Michael : » Na , kuscheln tun wir schon noch gern . «
Marianne : » Es wird alles ruhiger , das ist klar .
Aber es findet tatsächlich immer noch statt .
So ist das nicht ! «
Michael : » Ja , wir schaffen ’s , wir schaffen ’s noch . «
Marianne : » Und wie , das sagen wir nicht . «
Michael : » Aber es ist wunderbar . «
Als Beweis für den möglicherweise skeptischen Leser war ein doppelseitiges Farbfoto beigefügt , auf dem Ihr auf einer österreichischen Alm im Heubett liegt und den Betrachter so gespenstisch lebensecht angrinst wie eh und je .
Schön , einerseits , daß Ihr uns so zwanglos an Eurer Privatheit teilhaben laßt ; andererseits ist » hmm « und » kuscheln « und » grad noch so « nicht unbedingt das , was der erwartungsvolle BamS - Leser so unter wunderbar bumsen und richtig wild einen zusammenrammeln versteht .
Weswegen Ihr Euch nicht wundern solltet , wenn die Interview - Anfragen von Springer demnächst ausbleiben ; und das ist aber mehr Glück , als der beste
Fick zu bieten imstande ist .
In diesem Sinne Glückwunsch : Titanic

Durchaus diasporische Grüße : Titanic
Wolfgang Büscher !
Weil wir 2009 schreiben und es zufällig in der Historie Deutschlands eine vage Affinität zwischen Großereignissen und der Zahl neun gibt , durften Sie , als Wandervogel und Journalist , in der Zeit zwei Seiten unter der Überschrift » Ein Land kommt zu sich « über 1919 , ’ 39 , ’49 und ’89 vollsülzen und uns schon mal das Fürchten lehren angesichts dessen , was uns in diesem an Schicksalsjubiläen nicht eben armen Jahr noch alles erwartet ; gemessen an der feuilletonistischen Aufbereitung Ihrer Reise » von Versailles über Herrenchiemsee nach Berlin « v.a .
Aufsätze , geschaffen wie für einen Schülerwettbewerb des Innenministeriums .
Und wer da eine Eins mit Sternchen will , braucht mindestens einen schicken Aufhänger , und den haben
Sie mit einem prima Euphemismus für Krieg und Vernichtung auch gefunden : der Deutschen » Formsuche « .
Also sinnieren
Sie sich von der Urkatastrophe der Versailler Verträge bis zur » Erlösung « 1989 : » Endlich ein Land mit einem einfachen Namen : Deutschland .
Mit einleuchtenden Grenzen und einer irgendwie heilen Gestalt auf der Karte .
Keine behelfsmäßigen Kürzel mehr : BRD , DDR . «
Doch um zu diesem paradiesischen Zustand zu gelangen , muß man bei einer Deutschlandreise , egal ob durch Raum oder Zeit , notgedrungen durch eine No - Go - Area .
Oder besser um sie herum : » Man kann 1939 nicht besuchen , es ist begraben , verweht « , denn : » Hitler pervertiert die deutsche Formsuche .
In seinem Anfang als radikalisierter Landser ihr Produkt , in seinem Aufstieg ihr Verführer , steht er am Ende da als ihr Verräter . «
Wobei man ja sagen könnte , er sei der größte Formsucher von allen gewesen , als Sucher nach Deutschlands Riesenform ; nein ?
» Wie ein Medium hat Hitler auf seiner polnischen Zugreise allen Ekel und Haß gegen den östlichen , namentlich jüdischen › Untermenschen‹ in sich gesogen und potenziert . «
Und genau da kommt er halt her , der Haß und Ekel Hitlers , mit dem er als saugendes Medium das bloß formsuchende Volk zum Massenmord verführte : aus Polen – wie auch anders , wenn man sich Untermenschen aus der Nähe anschauen muß !
Sie , Büscher , sind ja wirklich in Topform : metaphorisch , historisch , insgesamt .
Mit potenziertem Ekel : Titanic
Ottfried Fischer !

Und so , Veronica Ferres , schleimen
Sie sich bei Bild ein : » Ich kann leider nicht jeden Tag Theater machen – Ihr schon ! «

Jan-Eric Peters !
Als Chef der Axel - Springer - Akademie ist
Ihnen der gute , saubere Journalismus selbstverständlich ein Herzensanliegen .
Da mußten
Sie ja regelrecht in die Luft gehen , als Zeit - Feuilletonchef Jens Jessen jüngst die » Gelfrisur mit den straff nach hinten gekämmten Haaren « , wie sie der neue Wirtschaftsminister von Guttenberg trägt , mit mildem Spott übergoß und im » Ursprungsmilieu der Boulevardjournalisten , Türsteher und nahöstlichen Bonvivants « verortete .
Dieses Verbrechen gegen Menschlichkeit und journalistische Ethik konnten
Sie nicht ungesühnt lassen : » Jessen bemüht alle Vorurteile , die man bei einem Glas Rotwein in einer scheinliberalen Redaktionsstube so an den Haaren herbeiziehen könnte « , zeterten Sie in Ihrem Blog und warfen dem » selbstgefälligen Autor « im weiteren » Dünkel « , Einfalls - und Erfolglosigkeit , » Intoleranz « und fürchterliches Spießertum vor .
Was wiederum wir nicht ganz verstanden haben : Gerade Sie als ehemaliger Boulevardjournalist müßten sich doch in der Gesellschaft von Türstehern und nahöstlichen Bonvivants eher aufgewertet fühlen !
Aber , Peters , davon einmal abgesehen : Ob Gel , Lack oder Spray – im Karrieremännerhaar sieht es halt auch immer mordsmäßig scheiße aus .
Schauen Sie doch Ihren alten Kumpel Kai Diekmann mal mit der gebotenen journalistischen Objektivität an – oder einfach in den Badezimmerspiegel .
Ihre ungekämmten Style - Berater von der Titanic
Judith Hermann !
Sie standen dem Zeit - Magazin für ein Zigaretten - Interview zur Verfügung , das sinnigerweise unter dem Titel » Die allerletzte Zigarette mit Judith Hermann « geführt wurde , obschon Sie schon seit zweieinhalb Jahren nicht mehr rauchen – was hart gewesen ist , v.a. » beim Schreiben , am Anfang war ich fast hilflos .
Ich hatte für jeden Satz drei Zigaretten gebraucht – eine fürs Denken , eine fürs Aufschreiben und die dritte fürs Ansehen des Satzes . «
Das können wir uns vorstellen , wie Sie am Schreibtisch saßen , Ihre Lebenstraurigkeit und Verlorenheit vor sich hinschoben und für einen Absatz in Länge dieses Briefs an die Leser zwei Schachteln verkasematuckeln mußten .
Doch jetzt : » Der Atem des Textes ist anders .
Ohne Zigarette scheint mir alles knapper , lakonischer , sachlicher vielleicht auch .
Ich habe einfach weniger Nerven für lange , elegische Sätze . «
Je nun , Frau Hermann : Wir Nicht - mehr - Raucher auch nicht .
Deswegen an dieser Stelle nur knapp und lakonisch , sachlicher vielleicht auch : Klappe !

Deutschlandfunk !
Da hat Deine Sprecherin am 4.3 . bei der morgendlichen Nachrichtenlektüre doch einen Augenblick gestutzt : Ist Erika Steinbach noch » umstrittene Vertriebenen - Präsidentin « oder u.U. schon » vertriebene Umstrittenen - Präsidentin « ?
Puh !

Sie hingegen , Christian Gottwalt , führten den Lesern des SZ - Magazins vor , wie kritischer Journalismus geht : Aus der Nullmeldung , daß Audi statt des sog .
Q7 nun einen sog .
Q5 als Hybridfahrzeug baut , strickten
Sie munter eine dreiseitige Werbekampagne für die Autoindustrie , halluzinierten eine » Zeitenwende « und erhoben die Käufer dieser ressourcenfressenden Quatschkisten zu Weltrettern .
Denn dank » BlueMotion « , » TrueBlueSolutions « und weiterer ultragrüner Features sei ein » unschlagbarer « Verbrauch von 5,1 Litern möglich usw .
Unschlagbar , Kollege Gottwalt , allerdings auch , wie blind begeisterter , wo nicht gar willfähriger Servicejournalismus immer wieder Dividenden sichert ; am Ende sogar Ihre eigene !
Unschlagbar : Titanic
Auf ein Wort , Guttenberg !
Als Sie als jungdynamischer Streber auf dem Stuhl des Bundeswirtschaftsministers landeten , überschlugen sich die Medien vor Begeisterung , nicht allein weil Sie von Adel sind ( von dem das gemeine Volk nicht erst seit Ferfried von Hohenzollern und Gloria von Thurn und Taxis Spitzenleistungen erwarten darf ) .
Auch Ihre Eloquenz beeindrucke , jedes Wort sitze bei Ihnen wie ein Schlag des Prügelprinzen von Hannover .
Dann gaben
Sie der Bild am Sonntag ein Interview , einem Blatt , das Ihnen von Haus aus nahesteht und mit dessen Chefredakteur Sie die Leidenschaft für ölige Tollen teilen .
Da sollte es sich entspannt parlieren lassen ; statt dessen klingen Ihre Antworten , als hätte ein halbes Dutzend Referenten Wortdurchfall gehabt : » Gleichzeitig verlasse ich mich in erster Linie auf meinen eigenen Verstand .
Der kann einen auch mal verlassen .
Aber das war bisher nicht inflationär häufig der Fall . «
Wenn Sie , Guttenberg , Sätze wie diese bei voller Klarheit von sich geben , möchten wir nicht wissen , wie es sich anhört , wenn das Oberstübchen mal Urlaub hat .
Deshalb eine Eilmeldung an Sie und die Ihnen angeschlossenen Kreise : Nur weil einer seine Vornamen auswendig weiß , ist er noch lange nicht eloquent .

Bernd Merbitz !
Als sächsischer Landespolizeipräsident durften Sie in ein Radiomikrophon hineinsprechen , um der
Welt kund und zu wissen zu tun , daß Ihre Beamten kaum ein halbes Jahr nach dem Mord an einem achtjährigen Mädchen den Täter gefunden hatten .
Zur näheren Charakterisierung des Mörders entrang sich Ihren Sprechwerkzeugen dabei der folgende Satz : » Also er ist noch in der Ausbildung als Sozialassistent , er lebt mit seiner Mutter allein , und man kann ihn eigentlich als eine Person bezeichnen , was wenig Kontakt hatte . «
Puh !
Bzw .
Sie , Bernd Merbitz , sind wohl auch noch in der der Ausbildung als Spuck - und Stotterassistent , Sie leben mit Ihren Beamten allein , also , da kann man man Sie wohl als eine Landespolizeipräsidentenperson bezeichnen , was wenig Kontakt mit deutsches Sprak hat – aber das ist ja in Sachsen vielleicht auch kein Wunder !

Wir dachten immer , das Problem der Musikindustrie sei , daß Musik eben immer weniger Ware ist , weil die Leute so arg downloaden und tauschbörsen !
Weshalb Sie gezwungen waren , zwecks Medienpräsenz Ihr Herz für Afrika zu entdecken und mit G. Bush , A. Merkel und anderen Unangepaßten über Lösungen für Probleme zu reden , von denen Sie gleichfalls nichts verstehen .

Zum vierzigsten Geburtstag , Zweitausendeins , von Herzen nur das Beste – aber sag : Damit niemand mehr glaubt , daß Dich » am 15 .
März vor genau 40 Jahren zwei langhaarige Menschen in einer Frankfurter Studenten - Kellerwohnung bei Tütensuppe , billigem Chianti ( aus der Korbflasche wurde später ein Kerzenhalter ) und selbstgedrehten Zigaretten « gegründet und dabei etwa folgende Konversation geführt haben : » › Wir machen einen total duften Versand !

› Gebongt !
Und wie nennen wir den Schuppen ? ‹
› Warum nicht Zweitausendeins , wie der Film , den wir gestern gesehen haben ? ‹
› Venceremos !‹ « – damit mit diesem Ursprungsmythos endlich aufgeräumt werde – warum eigentlich ?
– , hast Du das Bändchen » Zweitausendeins .
40 Jahre danach « in Auftrag gegeben .
Aber wieso hast
Du von allen , die diese Aufgabe bestimmt gern übernommen hätten , ausgerechnet den Mathias Bröckers genommen ?
» Der hat recherchiert , wie es damals wirklich war , und scheidet Wahrheiten von Halbwahrheiten und Gerüchten « und macht aus letzteren bekanntlich Bücher und Verschwörungsblogs .
» Bröckers sorgt als Wissenschaftsjournalist für eine Versachlichung des Themas « – mal ehrlich , Zweitausendeins : Hast
Du nicht vielleicht doch ein bißchen viel gebongt ?
Und welche Wahrheit über 3/15 wird Bröckers wohl aufdecken ?
Etwa daß die beiden Frankfurter Kellerbewohner von der CIA bezahlt waren und das Startkapital zum ersten Laden von Ignatz Bubis stammte ?

Ein deutsches Kraftwerk erzeugt jährlich genug Strom , um im Schnitt 2,5 Millionen Haushalte oder 4 500 Krankenhäuser oder 22 000 Hallenbäder am Laufen zu halten .
Und nun soll einfach so Schluß sein ? «

Oder wird sich der Schlacks noch mal umdrehen , wenn er drei Stunden vor dem Klingeln des Weckers aufgewacht ist ?
Ist halt schon ein Leben am ­Limit , so als Präsident !
Legt sich für ein paar Minuten hin : Titanic
Und Sie , Markus Lüpertz ( Kunst ) , haben was als » Hauptproblem der heutigen Zeit « erkannt ?
Den Ennui : » Der Friede ist nichts für Werte .
Wir haben schon zu lange Frieden gehabt .
Das macht die Leute fix und fertig . «
So isses .
Bzw . dem aberhundertsten Künstler dabei zuhören zu müssen , der meint , originell zu sein , wenn er verbal den Kraftkerl gibt , während er zu Düsseldorf als Malerfürst mit Professorengehalt residiert , das ist so derart langweilig , daß es uns wirklich fix und fertig macht .
Wenn Ihnen , Lüpertz , das jetzt zu lange Frieden gewesen ist , dann lassen Sie sich doch einfach über einem der aktuellen Kriegsgebiete abwerfen .
Das Angebot ist groß ,
Sie können da ganz nach landschaftlichen oder klimatischen Vorlieben buchen .
Dort kommen
Ihnen dann bestimmt Soldaten , die vor dem Vergewaltigen noch formvollendet einen Handkuß geben , und andere Vertreter humanistischer Werte als hübsche Motive vor den Einfaltspinsel .
Gell ?
Titanic
Sie , Georg Paul Hefty ( » FAZ « ) , erklärten Ihrer noblen Leserschaft , was den neuen Wirtschaftsminister Guttenberg für sein Amt zur Idealbesetzung mache : » Vieles , was der bisherige CSU - Generalsekretär als Befähigungsnachweis für das Staatsamt aufzuweisen hat , wurzelt in seiner Familie .
Wer sich über Jahrhunderte halten und dann noch ein gewisses Vermögen vorweisen kann , versteht überdurchschnittlich viel von Wirtschaft . «
Ebensogut ließe sich behaupten , wer über Jahrhunderte einem alten Adelsgeschlecht angehört , verstehe überdurchschnittlich viel von ursprünglicher Akkumulation und Bauernlegen ; jedenfalls mehr als , Hefty , Sie. Womit sich unweigerlich die Frage stellt , wie es eigentlich mit Ihrem Befähigungsnachweis aussieht !
Ihr gemeines Volk auf der Titanic
